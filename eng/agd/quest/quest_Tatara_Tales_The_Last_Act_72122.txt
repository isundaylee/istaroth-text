# Tatara Tales: The Last Act


## Talk 1

Xavier: The purification device, backup components, a map of our route, and the data from our beacons...
Xavier: I believe that's everything... Hold on, let me check my memo and see if anything is missing...
Xavier: Beacon data, route map, backup components, purification device...
Traveler: Yeah, we're good. Let's go.
Xavier: M—My apologies. This is my first time entering this area. Usually, my realm is logistics and data...
Xavier: And at the most, I would operate machines remotely.
Xavier: *sigh* I'm really in over my head this time, it's like... trying to drive a duck up a ramp. Have you ever heard that Liyue saying?
Xavier: It basically means asking someone to do something beyond their ability... Though I'm not sure what's so difficult about getting a duck up a ramp.
Xavier: Ah, ducks, such elegant, gentle creatures. The sight of them gliding silently along the mirror-sheen waters of Fontaine comes to mind most strikingly at this moment...
Xavier: Ugh, alright, let's go. If this device works normally, it should be able to constantly purify the Tatarigami energy in a small area around it.
Xavier: This way, we should be able to enter the disaster zone together. We'll stick to our previous plan: you deal with the Fatui and I'll deal with the Mikage Furnace... Let's go.
Traveler: Don't be nervous. We've got this.

## Talk 2

Xavier: Oh, good heavens... this is my first time entering this sort of place without any protective measures...
Xavier: Still, we've actually made it here, so that is good. In fact, it's great! Almost beyond my estimations.
Traveler: Sure you weren't setting them too low?
Xavier: This was as high as my estimations could go for this eleventh-hour solution.
Xavier: In my estimation, this cobbled-together fellow here would have failed on us halfway through.
Xavier: Afterward, I would have been rendered unconscious by the Tatarigami energy... well, either that or because I'd have scared myself silly...
Xavier: Either way, I kept a small piece of paper in my right trouser pocket. As long as you followed those steps, you'd be able to take me to safety outside.
Xavier: Wait... did I tell you about that piece of paper?
Traveler: Not at all.
Xavier: Uh, right. Well, never mind, now you know.
Xavier: Alright, I'll check the device one more time and then we can continue.
Traveler: You just told me, yes.
Xavier: I... must have forgotten in my hurry. Well, never mind, now you know.
Traveler: And what were those estimations?

## Talk 3

Xavier: Ah, curses, curses...
Traveler: What happened?
Xavier: It seems like we're now missing about... one, two, three components.
Xavier: They're not key parts, so the device is still working.
Xavier: But if we wish to proceed, we have to find a way to get them back.
Xavier: These components should still be on the path we took to get here. Please help me look for them. I'll be here waiting.
Traveler: Got it.
Xavier: I'll leave it up to you, then. I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: You stay here, then.
Xavier: As a matter of course. This place is infested with Tatarigami and crawling with Fatui. Hardly a place for someone like me to be strolling around willy-nilly...
Traveler: Have things developed as per your expectations?
Xavier: Well... I wouldn't say so, precisely.

## Talk 4

Xavier: Oh, I shouldn't have set my expectations so high...

## Talk 5

Xavier: Ah, you're back. Have you found all the components?
Traveler: I did.

## Talk 6

Xavier: That should do the trick. Phew... Let's continue onward. I know of a spot that shall be most ideal for our "final check."
Traveler: A "final check"?
Xavier: This is both the key step, and our proudest moment as a team!
Xavier: Any product must undergo a final phase of tests before it can be released into the market.
Xavier: I mean, those few components did come loose earlier. If we don't check the device again, I cannot help but feel uneasy.
Xavier: Alright. Let's proceed, shall we?
Traveler: That's a lot of tests...
Xavier: Haha, I suppose you aren't familiar with our work flow. This is how we take responsibility for the quality of our products.

## Talk 7

Xavier: Nothing dropped this time, right? Okay, good, it seems not.
Traveler: This is where we're conducting our "final check"?
Xavier: Indeed, this is the place. Let's turn our purification device up to full strength right here.
Xavier: However, I must warn you that it can get just a teensy bit noisy when operating at full power.
Xavier: I believe that this might displease our Fatui friends around the Mikage Furnace ever so slightly... Do you understand what I mean?
Traveler: I'll take care of them.
Xavier: Indeed! An excellent division of labor. Now, allow me to start it up.
Xavier: Let the final check begin!
Traveler: You just worry about the Mikage Furnace.

## Talk 8

Xavier: *cough* Those lawless lunatics! Try them in court, I say! Try them!
Traveler: Where were you hiding that whole time?
Xavier: A... a most safe spot... *cough*
Xavier: But let's get back on topic. According to the data that the beacon in my hand just gathered, the energy level in this area has fallen greatly.
Xavier: Based on the current state of our device and its performance, I would say it passes the final check.
Xavier: Now, we can truly get down to business. Come, let's head to the spot where the real work can begin. It's time to finish this.
Traveler: You're going to bring them to justice?
Xavier: *cough* Of course. Forget fighting these villains. I would prefer to use the law as my weapon.
Xavier: After all, not everyone is so well-versed in martial arts that they may solve... difficult problems the way that you do.

## Talk 9

Xavier: This is the spot. The part of the Mikage Furnace that stores the core is right above us.
Xavier: My data also indicates that the concentration of Tatarigami here is also the highest.
Xavier: As long as this area can be settled, the Mikage Furnace's systems can start running again, which will return everything to normal.
Xavier: Finally, we're at this step. I must say, I'd quite have liked to use my Film Kamera to record our actions here.
Traveler: It's a shame that you can't.
Xavier: It's alright. I can find some people to re-enact the events that transpired here.
Xavier: The name of this film... Hmm. Now I've heard that Inazumans often call their stories "something-something-Tales."
Xavier: As such, a fitting name for this film would be...
Traveler: "Tatara Tales."
Xavier: Bravo! Yes, "Tatara Tales" it shall be!
Xavier: Alright then. You know the drill, Traveler...
Traveler: I'll handle the Fatui.
Xavier: And I'll deal with the Mikage Furnace.
Xavier: Hahaha, this exchange between us will surely become an iconic moment in the film.
Xavier: Well, start the device once you're ready. Then, let us give "Tatara Tales" the perfect ending it deserves!

## Talk 10

Xavier: It's... it's finally over... The Mikage Furnace should have resumed operation.
Xavier: Let's head to the top and see what the situation is like.

## Talk 11

Xavier: Bravo! Right, I shall repair it immediately. Let me see, this component goes here...

## Talk 12

Xavier: Please go well, please go well, please go well...

## Talk 13

Toranosuke: The Mikage Furnace is back to normal already, huh...
Traveler: Oh, you already know?
Toranosuke: Your deeds at the Mikage Furnace have already been reported to me.
Traveler: Why didn't you help out more directly?
Toranosuke: I cannot take any action without orders from Sir Hanbei.
Xavier: Alright, alright. I imagine that our good man here must have his fair share of troubles, what with having a superior who values rigorous process so highly and all.
Xavier: What's more, I suspect that our previous actions only went over so smoothly due to the aid of this Mr. Hanbei.
Xavier: And of course, it's not as if this soldier was of no help to us at all. After all, those few doors...
Toranosuke: Thank you for your help, Mr. Xavier.
Xavier: *cough* Well, it was mainly the work of this Traveler. If not for them, I doubt that I would have achieved anything at all.
Toranosuke: Is that so...
Toranosuke: Thank you, Traveler. I... apologize for my previous attitude towards you.
Toranosuke: Thank you, again, for protecting this island.
Traveler: You're most welcome.
Toranosuke: Wait. You're... a blond... traveler? Just a moment. I think I remember that...
Traveler: H—Hey! Guess who's welcome? You're welcome!
Toranosuke: Uh, well, yes... Regardless, I'd like to thank you all for your help.
Xavier: Hahaha. Well, Traveler, look at you!
Xavier: Now, now, don't be so humble. If it weren't for you, I would have been stuck outside just watching events play out.
Xavier: However, I do have a question for you, Mr. Soldier.
Xavier: I recall you telling me previously that your most rigorous superior had to return to the city to hand in those most complicated documents. I imagine that was a terribly grueling ordeal...
Xavier: But now that the Mikage Furnace has returned to normal, I wonder where he might be...
Toranosuke: Hmm, well, as to what Sir Hanbei is busy with... one of our superiors, a man named Mikoshi Genjirou, came by earlier to ask me for a detailed report.
Toranosuke: After listening to my report, Sir Mikoshi Genjirou became quite interested in this matter.
Toranosuke: According to what he said afterwards, our mutual superiors have also found Sir Hanbei's work ethic to be quite praiseworthy.
Toranosuke: They have thus decided to appoint Sir Hanbei to the post of foreign attaché to Sumeru.
Toranosuke: I have heard that he will be staying there, ensuring that the most vital supply line of Mushrooms between Inazuma and Sumeru shall remain open and smooth.
Traveler: A most critical role indeed.
Toranosuke: Of course. Sir Hanbei is a perfect fit for such a key post.
Toranosuke: Sir Hanbei is presently awaiting orders in the city, waiting for the right time to set off.
Xavier: Ah, that's wonderful! Good for him. Still, having lost such a fine gentleman, however shall we fill the gaping void that is his now-vacant post?
Toranosuke: I recommended a few people suited to the job.
Toranosuke: It was decided that a craftsman named Yousuke would be in charge of all future maintenance work on the Mikage Furnace.
Xavier: Ah, that sets my heart at ease. But still, let us not speak of that anymore...
Xavier: Now then, Mr. Soldier, please give my share of the remuneration to this Traveler as well.
Xavier: Ah, yes, Traveler, this is also for you. Please take it.
Xavier: This is a blueprint that I previously purchased from a certain craftsman.
Xavier: I had plans to bring this blueprint back to my homeland as a souvenir...
Xavier: But it seems that I shall be staying in Inazuma for a while. I doubt that I will be returning any time soon.
Xavier: So, I'll give it to you as a gift.
Traveler: Thank you.
Xavier: Haha, you're most welcome, my friend!
Xavier: You've been a great help to me. Please allow me to invite you as my first viewer when I finish Tatara Tales.
Xavier: Oh, and I have another simple favor to ask...
Traveler: So he'll be bringing mushrooms to Inazuma, eh?
Toranosuke: Indeed. Making sure that mushrooms make it onto Inazuman tables is work of utmost importance, most suited to one such as Sir Hanbei.
Traveler: The Mikage Furnace's safe now! Hooray!
Traveler: Just doing my part.
Traveler: So you're just going to leave the Fatui to run amok?
Toranosuke: I cannot take any action without orders from Sir Hanbei.

## Talk 14

Xavier: The Tatarigami here has thinned out so much as to be harmless. Looks like the Mikage Furnace is back in business!
Xavier: If those Fatui want to get their hands on the Tatarigami energy, then the only way they can do it now is to use those cannons to fire on the Mikage Furnace directly.
Xavier: But since that would be tantamount to an act of war, I doubt they would do it, no matter how insane they might be.
Traveler: Let's hope so.
Xavier: Regardless, the Mikage Furnace is safe for now, so neither we nor this island's treasures are about to get blown sky-high any time soon.
Traveler: I'm looking forward to watching "Tatara Tales."
Xavier: Hahaha, I'll be sure to do justice to your image through this film.
Xavier: I might also have to hone my craft a little by making a few short films.
Xavier: But of course, this is all talk for later. That soldier named Toranosuke promised me "commensurate remuneration" for completing this task...
Xavier: Let's return now, and claim our "commensurate remuneration" from our fine soldier friend.
Traveler: Will you really make "Tatara Tales"?
Xavier: Of course! But before production can officially begin, I must make some preparations.
Traveler: Oh, they've done worse...
Xavier: I suppose you refer to those incidents in Liyue and Mondstadt?
Xavier: I personally feel that given the Mikage Furnace's value, I doubt that it would be worth it for them to resort to such drastic measures.

## Talk 15
