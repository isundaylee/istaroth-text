## Talk

Serene: Hmm. There's much left to do today...

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me about Merusea Village?
Serene: Huh? Is it your first time here? Well, in that case, welcome!
Serene: This is the home of us Melusines, but... as you can see, owing to the location, we don't get many human visitors.
Serene: Be sure to let me know if you run into any trouble here, or if you need anything at all.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Serene: Mmhmm, bye! Please do let me know if you need anything.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you the village head?
Serene: The village head... do you mean some person who's in charge of everyone?
Serene: I don't think that describes me. I'm just a little older than the other kids. As everyone's big sister, it's my responsibility to help with day-to-day issues.
Serene: That's right — I've gotta look after everyone.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Serene: Mmhmm, bye now! Please do let me know if I can help you with anything.

## Talk

Serene: Hmm. There's much left to do today...
Serene: Ah, hello! What can I help you with?

## Talk

Serene: Hmm. There's much left to do today...
Serene: Oh, hi! About what happened before... I really can't thank you enough for all your help!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Serene: Mmhmm, bye now! Please do let me know if you need help with anything!

## Talk

Traveler: Are there any Melusines around who might need help?

## Talk

Serene: Hmm. Let me think about this... Well, there's Iara. She seems to be having some trouble with fishing...

## Talk

Serene: Hmm. Let me think about this... Well, there's Iara. She seems to be having some trouble with fishing...

## Talk

Serene: Hmm. One moment. There's Verenata, I suppose. She's an earnest and hardworking sort, and she's learning from Carabosse. She says she wants to be able to help everyone...
Serene: She's been struggling with some new medicine or another. I'm not sure about the details, but... *sigh* I wish Carabosse would be a bit more serious...

## Talk

Serene: Right. Let me think... There's Ahes. I believe she's been claiming recently that she's "seen a ship in my dreams"...
Serene: I feel like she's going the way of Mamere — not telling anyone about the things on her mind. It's quite worrying...

## Talk

Serene: Right. Let me think... There's Ahes. I believe she's been claiming recently that she's "seen a ship in my dreams"...
Serene: I don't know what's going on with her, but I am quite worried...

## Talk

Serene: One moment... Ah, yes. There's Cosanzeana. I think she's been concerned about her inability to grow flowers...
Serene: Not that I know anything about flowers. I've tried to help her, but to no avail...
Serene: Would you know something about that?

## Talk

Serene: One moment... Ah, yes. There's Canotila. I think she's been puzzling over a certain book...
Serene: See, she's still in intense meditation over there, beneath that waterfall.
Serene: She says she can't understand its contents... and neither can I, but perhaps an experienced adventurer like you might be able to help her.

## Talk

Serene: Huh. Let me see... Right, I believe Puca said that she's lost her token...
Serene: These tokens are exceedingly important to us... Um, I was originally going to help her find it, like, immediately, but I can't quite leave now...

## Talk

Traveler: Fishing?
Serene: Yes. She said that she met an angler named Delaroche and learned fishing skills from her... Despite that, she's been unable to catch anything — much to her consternation...

## Talk

Traveler: Fishing?
Serene: Yes. She said that she met an angler named Delaroche and learned fishing skills from her... Despite that, she's been unable to catch anything — much to her consternation...
Serene: *sigh* I'm not sure how I can help her. I've given it some thought, though — if all else fails, I can play the role of the fish myself...
Serene: But that's not really a solution I'd call "good," so... Could you try helping her?

## Talk

Traveler: What can I do to help?
Serene: I'm not all that sure myself... It seems to have something to do with developing medicine, or something.
Serene: But if you do go and help her out, I'm sure she'll be very happy... And I'll be, too!

## Talk

Traveler: Mamere's not a good point of comparison, come on!
Serene: Fair enough, I guess Mamere has become a bit more open lately... But now, Ahes is going down that path...
Serene: If you don't mind, could you try helping her out?

## Talk

Traveler: That sounds problematic.
Serene: Fair enough, I guess Mamere has become a bit more open lately... But now, Ahes is going down that path...
Serene: If you don't mind, could you head over to the *place with a lot of ships* north of the village, and see if you can help?

## Talk

Traveler: That sounds problematic.
Serene: True. Whatever the case, could you head over to the *place with a lot of ships* north of the village, and see if you can help?

## Talk

Traveler: When I sing, flowers bloom...
Serene: Really? That sounds like it'd make for a lovely scene... In that case, I do hope that you can bless her flowers with a song.
Serene: I'd love to help myself, but it seems that deep subject matter knowledge will be required...
Serene: Would you be willing to visit her garden *at the village entrance* and give her some suggestions?

## Talk

Traveler: I guess I know a thing or two.
Serene: Do you really? Great! I'm afraid I haven't any knowledge myself... In which case, I'd be grateful if you could go see her garden.
Serene: I'd love to help myself, but it seems that deep subject matter knowledge will be required...
Serene: Would you be willing to visit her garden and give her some suggestions?

## Talk

Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Serene: Alright. I do hope that Canotila can resolve this matter that so confuses her...

## Talk

Traveler: Leave it to me!
Serene: Thank you, I'll leave Puca in your capable hands, then!

## Talk

Traveler: Delaroche? Seriously?
Serene: Oh, is that so? Oh dear.
Serene: *sigh* I'm not sure how I can help her. I've given it some thought, though — if all else fails, I can play the role of the fish myself...
Serene: But that's not really a solution I'd call "good," so... Could you try helping her?

## Talk

Traveler: I think she might've gone for the wrong teacher...
Serene: Oh, is that so? Oh dear.
Serene: *sigh* I'm not sure how I can help her. I've given it some thought, though — if all else fails, I can play the role of the fish myself...
Serene: But that's not really a solution I'd call "good," so... Could you try helping out?

## Talk

Traveler: No problem!
Serene: #Wonderful! She should still be trying to fish* at the south side of the village*... So please, Traveler give her some pointers!

## Talk

Traveler: Oh, I'm a real pro!
Serene: #Wonderful! She should still be trying to fish* at the south side of the village*... So please, Traveler give her some pointers!

## Talk

Traveler: Alright, you can count on me.
Serene: Thank you so much.

## Talk

Traveler: Alright, you can count on me.
Serene: Thank you so much.

## Talk

Traveler: Just leave it to me.
Serene: Alright. I do hope that she'll be able to grow some beautiful flowers...

## Talk

Traveler: No problem!
Serene: #Wonderful! She should still be trying to fish* at the south side of the village*... So please, Traveler give her some pointers!

## Talk

Traveler: Oh, I'm a real pro!
Serene: #Wonderful! She should still be trying to fish* at the south side of the village*... So please, Traveler give her some pointers!

## Talk

Traveler: Are there any Melusines around who might need help?
Serene: Let me think. Actually, I don't think there's anyone around who really needs help at the moment!
Serene: This is all thanks to your help... Thank you so much!

## Talk

Serene: Let me think. Actually, I don't think there's anyone around who really needs help at the moment!
Serene: #Still, troubles do often crop up in places that we can't see... For all we know, some of us might come to need your help in the future, Traveler...

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Serene: Indeed. What was with that earthquake earlier?
Serene: It didn't seem to have any negative consequences, but for things to start shaking so strongly all of a sudden... I'll have to report this to Monsieur Neuvillette...

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake before...
Serene: Ah, Mamere told me about the situation. It was the first time that the kid talked that much...
Serene: Anyway, Monsieur Neuvillette is very concerned about the matter. I heard that the Marechaussee Phantom has already sent someone to investigate.
Serene: Thank you so much for your help! Right, a—as a token of gratitude, please, take this!
