Domon: Was I like this before... Why did I want to wield my sword...
Domon: Master... Senior... I...
Domon: Alright! If you want to get your revenge, go on, then! Ahahaha...

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Domon: What is the ultimate swordsmanship... Will defeating everyone make you the best in the world?
Domon: But the best in the world... if I am the best in the world...
Domon: If I am the best in the world, why am I so obsessed with the past?
Domon: And if I am not the best in the world, then master and the others have... for nothing...

Traveler: Goodbye...
Domon: What on earth was I thinking back then...

## Talk

Domon: Hello, if you want to become a disciple here, please... Ah, it's you, the Traveler.
Domon: It has been a while. How has your journey through Inazuma gone?

## Talk

Traveler: You look a lot better now.
Domon: Haha, once the knot in my heart came loose, I knew what to do next.
Domon: Although I have lost my Vision and have no way of making my dream come true... I still have a group of disciples to succeed my will. The Meikyou Shisui Art will never be forgotten. There is still hope for our dream of being the best in the world.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Domon: Thank you! Goodbye.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you alright...?
Domon: Alright... alright? I'd be alright if I had good sword skills...
Domon: But my Vision...
Domon: Without my Vision, I can no longer be the best in the world... All the things I did in the past would all... even my disciples will...
Domon: Master, Senior... don't just stand there and watch, say something, please...!

## Talk

Traveler: You look much better now.
Domon: Haha, once the knot in my heart came loose, I knew what to do next.
Domon: Although my Vision has returned, I am not the person I was before... I will leave the dream of being the greatest swordmaster to my disciples.
Domon: As long as these young hopefuls are around, the Meikyou Shisui Art will never become lost to time.

## Talk

Traveler: May your wishes be granted as soon as possible.
Domon: Haha, thank you.
Domon: I've written down some of my experiences in swordsmanship that I've gleaned over the years. Though you aren't one of my disciples, I'm still indebted to you. Please accept it.
Domon: I wish you good fortunes in the long journey ahead of you.
