Traveler: And you are...?
Hubel: You can call me the... temporary owner of this little establishment.
Hubel: I say "temporary," for it is my dream to join The Steambird!
Hubel: I work hard every day, honing my scripts and accumulating rhetoric to constantly improve my understanding of the art of language!
Hubel: One day, I'll report all I've seen, and my astounding literary skills will spill across the headlines!
