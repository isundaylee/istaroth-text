Traveler: Anything you can tell me about the war?
Ono: Before this, I'd thought of many ways in which this conflict could go. Maybe the Shogunate might destroy the resistance by sheer dint of force, or perhaps the resistance might eventually buckle under the pressure and surrender...
Ono: I never expected the Shogunate to not only gain some advantage, but instead start peace talks with them...
Ono: To tell the truth, I'm a bit disappointed in the Shogunate leadership's strategy. But at the same time, this ceasefire gladdens me far more.
Ono: I mean, who among the ordinary citizens of Inazuma really wished to go out there and kill people, am I right?
