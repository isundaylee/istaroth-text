# Talk Dialog

Souka: *sob*... What am I gonna do... I put in the time and prepared as best I could... But I was still defeated in just the second round!
Traveler: Cheer up...
Paimon: Oh, don't be too hard on yourself, Souka. Don't worry, Miko won't blame you!
Souka: You guys... even at a time like this... you two are still here to comfort me. Do I even deserve this special honor...?
Souka: Wait... hold on! Ideas are growing inside my head... Spectacular arcs and subplots are appearing on their own!
Souka: Don't say anything... Let me guess... you're about to say...
Souka: "I've witnessed your courage and determination! I will fulfill your wish and claim victory on your behalf!"
Traveler: ?
Paimon: ?
Souka: Perfect! I know how the story goes from here! I'll pair this with the accidental encounter with the strongest opponent from before! I have to remember it for now...
Paimon: It's just as Miko said. Souka will return to normal after talking to herself...
Traveler: Should we cheer as well?
Paimon: Shh, let's not disturb Souka right now. Let her sort out the thoughts in her head first!
Traveler: (Leave quietly)
Souka: If the protagonist were to encounter an immediate setback right at the start of the competition... The novel would separate itself from cliche tropes. It'll be both unexpected and exciting...
