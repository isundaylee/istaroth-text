Is she here yet?
When will she get here?
She's not coming!
You're wrong...
She's here
O, if I become one with the springs
Can the world's wonder be restored?
And will you forgive us our sins, dear mother?
The water's flow puts the dance in our step
It nurtures our city
And thee, my beloved
But what about your wish!?
My...
Wish?
If you become human...
You can reveal your secret to no one
You will face suffering...
And loneliness
Is this truly what you want?
If only true love were enough
But alas, I must bid thee adieu
Our love but a bittersweet fairytale
Yet I am here, and here I shall remain
To behold the world in all its beauty
Until the end of time
