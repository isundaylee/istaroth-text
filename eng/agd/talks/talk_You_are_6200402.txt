Traveler: You are...?
Manager Xiao: I'm the Dockyard Manager here in Liyue Harbor. Name's Xiao. Is there something I can help you with? If not, I need to get back to work.
Traveler: Actually, about your work...
Manager Xiao: Work? Bah! Don't get me started! Young people these days... No expertise, zero sense of responsibility, they don't bother to tell you when they aren't going to show up, and when they do show up... Half the time they do more harm than good, and the other half they expect you to applaud every word that comes out of their mouths... Honestly, if we old folks weren't hand-holding them every step of the way...
Manager Xiao: I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Liyue's ships are the face of the nation. We should be aiming for perfection every time! Each spot you miss with the paintbrush harms not just my reputation, but that of Liyue itself!
Manager Xiao: Bah, I'm wasting my breath... You outlanders wouldn't understand anyway...
