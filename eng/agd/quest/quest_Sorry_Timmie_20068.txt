# Sorry, Timmie!


## Talk 1

Grace: Ah, whatever shall I do...
Traveler: Um, what happened?
Grace: Oh, it's you. You've come at just the right moment. Timmie's told me what you did to the ducks.
Grace: You... you... How should I say this? It's not as if I haven't heard of your deeds...
Grace: But did you really have to use your courage and strength in that way?
Traveler: I was too hungry...
Grace: If you really were hungry, you could have done some honest work.
Grace: With your capabilities, you'd definitely have a place at the Adventurers' Guild.
Grace: Ah, it's all water under the bridge at this point. But Timmie's been quite down because of this.
Grace: I... Timmie's father once taught me how to make a certain dish. Mondstadt Hash Brown with Philanemo Mushrooms is Timmie's favorite.
Grace: Why don't you help me find three Philanemo Mushrooms, so we can make some for Timmie? That should perk him up a bit, and also serve by way of apology.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Grace: Well then, off you go.
Grace: As for the Philanemo Mushrooms... I remember that you can find some under the eaves of the houses in the southern part of the city.
Grace: Please come back soon!
Traveler: It shall be done!
Grace: Just three is enough! What are you planning to do with this many mushrooms? Are you going to bribe Timmie with a meal every time you annoy him?
Traveler: It was an accident, really!
Grace: You accidentally hit those ducks and pigeons? Did you accidentally defeat the tough enemies you've encountered on your adventures too?
Traveler: Strength comes from daily practice such as this.
Grace: You... I... Forget it. Looks like your "strength" really is all-rounded.

## Talk 2

Grace: Did you find any Philanemo Mushrooms? I believe that you should be able to find some under the eaves of the city's houses...

## Talk 3

Grace: Thank you, these should be enough. Please wait a moment...
Grace: This should be fine. Please give this Mondstadt Hash Brown to Timmie.
Grace: And please, don't... do such things in the future. It's not worth the trouble.
Grace: Please listen to my advice. Don't disappoint Timmie... or me.
Grace: Well, if only everyone listened to advice. If that were the case, Sister Victoria wouldn't be so busy.

## Talk 4

Timmie: ...Eat, eat. Eat and go, quickly...
Traveler: What's up?
Timmie: You again!
Timmie: What are you planning? Are you trying to hurt the ducks and the pigeons?
Traveler: This hash brown is for you.
Timmie: A hash brown? Huh. How did you know how to make this?
Timmie: I know, you must have asked Mommy!
Timmie: Hmph. Are you trying to bribe me, just like that? I know what you've done to the birds!
Timmie: ...Still, since Mommy's sent you over with the hash brown, I guess that's her way of telling me to stop making trouble.
Timmie: She still needs to take care of Nora and Glory. It would be immature of me to make things harder for her.
Timmie: But let's be clear, I haven't forgiven you! I just don't wanna make trouble for Mommy. Got it?
Timmie: Still... Hmph. I bet that because I'm a kid, you're just going to forget your promise whenever you feel like it.
Timmie: Once Daddy is back, I'm telling him all about you!
Traveler: Please take this hash brown!
Traveler: Hey, Timmie...
Timmie: You again? Leave me alone!
Traveler: Has something happened?
Timmie: How can you even ask me that?

### Additional Talk 1

Grace: Please give that hash brown to Timmie.
Traveler: This "Mommy" Timmie talks about...
Grace: It's me. I've been taking care of the children who need care for a while now.
Grace: Timmie's the one I've looked after longest. He's even come to call me Mommy.
Grace: But in truth, I'm not his real family.
Traveler: Why's Timmie so mad?
Grace: How can you even ask such a thing?
Grace: That child hasn't got many friends or people he's close to in this city. So other than Nora and Glory, he only has the small animals to keep him company.
Grace: In fact, those pigeons even...
Grace: ...No, never mind. Please give the hash brown to Timmie as soon as you can.

### Additional Talk 2

Timmie: ...Why isn't he back yet...
Traveler: Hey, Timmie...
Timmie: Why are you back again!? Go away! The pigeons and the ducks... You're scaring them off!
