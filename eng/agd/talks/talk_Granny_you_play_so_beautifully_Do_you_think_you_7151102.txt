Yanfei: Granny, you play so beautifully! Do you think you could teach me?
Madame Ping: Oh, child, you simply never stop, do you?
Madame Ping: This festival is a rare chance to rest and relax, but here you are pestering me to teach you this, that, and the other...
Yanfei: Don't worry, Granny, I'm a fast learner!
Yanfei: And anyway, the sooner I start learning, the sooner we'll be able to perform a duet together.
Yanfei: A musical duo is only as good as its weakest link, so you gotta teach me all your secrets, okay?
Madame Ping: Alright, alright... Well, you can start by making me some more tea, and leaving it to cool on the side.
Yanfei: Sure, Granny!
