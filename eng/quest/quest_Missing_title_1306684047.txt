# Missing title (1306684047)

Traveler: How's the painting going?
Vermeer: I've been painting here at the side of those two statues since their eyes lit up.
Vermeer: But... How should I say this? I just feel like I haven't been able to paint that perfect picture.
Vermeer: It just feels like there's something missing, you know what I mean?
Vermeer: It's like a dish that uses good ingredients and is cooked well, but... but something's just not there...
Vermeer: I don't know how to express this feeling, and I can't grasp it, either. All I can do is continue to paint.
Vermeer: Don't worry, you can laugh. Really, all this drawing is making me a little woozy. And I would have taken a short break, too...
Vermeer: But every time I close my eyes, I can suddenly see the shining eyes of those statues before me. It's as if they've come alive and are staring right at me...
Vermeer: Which is why I came back here to take a break. I shouldn't be able to see the statues' eyes from here...
Vermeer: Ah, yes. Why don't you take this painting? It's the best one I've done so far.
Vermeer: Now, if you don't mind, I'm really tired. I need a break.
Vermeer: Still, what are my paintings missing... What are they missing...
