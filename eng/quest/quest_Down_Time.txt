# Down Time


## Talk 1

Paimon: Come on, can't you see we're listening to a story here? Shoo!

## Talk 2

Paimon: This'll do. Let's go back to Roialte and see what sort of story he'll spin.

## Talk 3

Paimon: This should do it! Let's head back and look for Roialte.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Gah, where did these Hydro Slimes come from? Stop 'em!

## Talk 5

Roialte: Wonderful! Those silly Blubberbeasts have been chased off — and with that, my peace of mind is restored! Thank you so much, Traveler.
Traveler: Now then, the story.
Roialte: Alright, alright. Now, where was I previously... Give me a moment to recall the story...
Paimon: You were talking about "exceptions."
Roialte: Ah, yes, that was it. I was talking about making a profit off exceptional circumstances...
Roialte: For example, someone might be able to scrub the various resources they have on hand, and then report them as expenses... or try to expand the scope of this particular "exception"... These are all things that can happen.
Traveler: And have such things happened?
Roialte: Before Iaune was with us, we had another clever fellow. He was very able, very clever, sharp, and full of energy.
Roialte: ...Unfortunately, he was not honest.
Roialte: Eventually, he was booted from the office, and I haven't seen him since... nor do I wish to, really.
Paimon: Did he do something terrible, then?
Roialte: He certainly did not think that about his doings — and that is precisely the kind of mindset that gives birth to criminality.
Roialte: That's why I have high expectations for Iaune. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he's honest and diligent.
Paimon: That doesn't sound like praise...
Roialte: But honesty is the greatest virtue. A dishonest but intelligent person may achieve great fame in a short period of time...
Roialte: But it is often those stupid yet honest people who will accomplish truly great things.
Roialte: Alright, I'm going to continue fishing now. Please, take this as your payment. Hahaha, don't look so surprised. Did you really think I was just going to pay you with a story?
Roialte: All those who labor must be compensated — that's always been my motto.
Roialte: Thank you once again. I'm sure I'll score a great catch this time.
Traveler: The story, please.

## Talk 6

Roialte: I take back what I said before. It seems that not everything is going to plan today...
Traveler: Those Slimes were just going about their day.
Roialte: Funny, aren't you? I envy your good humor... Following your logic, I suppose that today was, in fact, the Slimes' lucky day, and I was just a bit actor in their play?
Roialte: It seems that everyone's definition of a "good day" need not be the same, nor must they be in conflict with one another.
Roialte: Ugh... I think I injured my waist during the kerfuffle earlier. I need to get it checked in the city soon... Ow, ow...
Roialte: Here's your payment, Traveler. I... Ow, ow... Ugh, that really hurts.

## Talk 7

Roialte: Have you brought the bait back? Wonderful! Time to continue fishing, I say.
Traveler: Boucicaut wants to relay this message...
Black Screen Text: You pass Boucicaut's words onto Roialte...
Roialte: Hahaha, is he worried about me? It's fine, I know what I'm doing.
Roialte: As for inviting my old fishing buddies... Some of them have settled down with family, while others are busy with work. Either way, we haven't been in touch for a long time.
Roialte: And I'm not the type to go fishing with strangers, so rather than do that, I'd prefer to go it alone.
Roialte: Hmm, now that you mention it... I could call Iaune to come fishing with me. He could use the break, in any case.
Roialte: Anyway, Traveler, here's your payment. Thanks for your help.
Roialte: Yes, this sounds good. I'll go fish for Iaune's opinion tomorrow at work.
Roialte: If he's willing to come, we'll be able to bring more gear, go further, and find some better fishing spots...

## Talk 8

Roialte: *sigh* These silly Blubberbeasts just won't leave, will they...
Traveler: Fishing again?
Roialte: Well, what does it look like I'm doing? I just chased off a few of those unreasonable journalists, so I'm just taking a little fishing break.
Roialte: But these Blubberbeasts just won't leave, and I daren't approach them... *sigh*
Roialte: Honestly! Did they learn their trade from those journalists? And did they master those dastardly arts of opportunistic deception?
Paimon: You really do hate journalists, huh.
Roialte: Of course. Some of them raise a hue and cry about reporting the truth, but truth, as they see it, is for them to define.
Roialte: They claim to be doing this for the masses, but they don't even know about this...
Roialte: Hmm, I should stay silent. You never know if there might be a journalist in a divesuit eavesdropping on us from under water.
Roialte: Traveler, could I trouble you to get rid of those Blubberbeasts? Just thinking about journalists is making my head spin... I need to take my medicine and rest a while more, I think.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Roialte: Thank you. I'm afraid I'll have to find another good place to fish...
Traveler: Rest well.

## Talk 9

Roialte: Have you gotten rid of those silly Blubberbeasts? Wonderful! You truly are my savior!
Traveler: Have you been well lately?
Roialte: Not bad, not bad, I suppose. Iaune has gone back to his normal self at last, and Semaine's as reliable as ever.
Roialte: Every day is as peaceful as the last. It's a good life... And it would be better if those journalists would just stop calling at our door.
Roialte: Please take this as your payment. If not for you, my fishing plans would have been a bust.
Roialte: I need to pick another fishing spot. Where should I go...

## Talk 10

Roialte: Hmm, what should I say next...

## Talk 11

Roialte: *sigh* These silly Blubberbeasts just won't leave, will they...

## Talk 12

Roialte: Agh! Slimes!? Where did they all pop out from?

## Talk 13

Roialte: I need to strengthen this rod further...

## Talk 14

Roialte: The weather's good, the fishing spot's great, no Blubberbeasts, and no journalists... Ah, this is the life!
Traveler: In a good mood today, I see.
Roialte: In various ways, yes, and now that you're here, I've never been better, haha!
Paimon: Did something good happen? Or something interesting, maybe?
Roialte: No, no, in fact, everything's as peaceful as placid waters!
Roialte: No journalists, no announcements, no leaks, and no lost forms or documents.
Roialte: Everything is operating as it should without any mistakes...
Paimon: Wait... Don't move! Whatever you do, don't move!
Roialte: What? Why so sudden...?
Traveler: Just freeze...
Roialte: What happened? Did those Blubberbeasts come back? Haha, I looked all around, you know. They...
Roialte: Agh! Slimes!? Where did they all pop out from? Help! Help!
Paimon: C'mon, that's why we told you not to move about!
Traveler: Get down!
Roialte: Help me, please!
