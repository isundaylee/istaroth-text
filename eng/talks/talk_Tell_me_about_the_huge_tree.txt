# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about the huge tree.
Dr. Edith: This oak tree grew at the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia, in the same year she left. I daresay you won't find a bigger tree in all of Mondstadt!
Dr. Edith: I have come across so many stories and ballads about this tree in my time, far too many to count. Let's find somewhere to sit, I could talk non-stop about them for days...
Traveler: Maybe next time.
Dr. Edith: Okay, never mind. The offer will still be there when you want it though!
Traveler: What's Celestia?
Dr. Edith: Celestia is where all the great heroes and heroines of the mortal realm go at the end of their lives.
Dr. Edith: Those heroic enough to be accepted into Celestia become one of the gods and continue to keep watch over their people from on high.
Dr. Edith: Mere mortals will never know what Celestia looks like.
Dr. Edith: Even though there are many gods who roam the land in Teyvat, they are silent on the topic of Celestia.
Dr. Edith: Maybe only those heroes who have lived and died in the mortal realm earn the right to tell the story of Celestia.
