# The Boars are Attacking!


## Talk 1

Tunner: My grape vines are destroyed... These boars...

## Talk 2

Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Tunner: You are...?
Tunner: ...Ah, travelers. How kind of you.
Tunner: Now is the ripening season for grapes. But a herd of boars came out of nowhere and they have their eyes set on the vineyard.
Tunner: I can't chase them away by myself and my son is not with me now, so all I can do now is to watch them wreck my land...
Tunner: If you can help me kick those boars out, I'll repay you handsomely!
