Arakavi: Festival Utsava is getting closer. I wonder what melodies will be sung at the festival.

## Talk

Traveler: About Festival Utsava...
Arakavi: #Nara Traveler and Aranara must sing together at Festival Utsava.
Arakavi: #No need to worry, Nara Traveler's voice will surely be warm and golden.

## Talk

Traveler: About Song Gatherers...
Arakavi: #Thanks to Nara Traveler's help, the Song Gatherers have learned many songs that had been forgotten many sunrises ago,
Arakavi: These songs, to Aranara, are like Nara's "treasure."
Arakavi: #The song gatherers and Nara Traveler went to look for treasures together, and are good friends.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arakavi: Goodbye, good friend of Aranara.

## Talk

Arakavi: Golden Nara and Arama defeated Marana, and brought new story and new song with the Ashvattha...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Ashvattha...
Arakavi: A long, long time later, there will definitely be new Nara friends coming to Vanarana.
Arakavi: But the future Nara will not have to go to the Ashvattha to look for the melodies of today.
Arakavi: Because all Aranara and the leaves and soil of Vana will remember this Festival Utsava, remember the golden song.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arakavi: Goodbye, Golden Nara. Aranara will not forget you.

## Talk

Arakavi: #Nara Traveler, we will not forget you. Even if we are no longer here one day, the forest will not forget. Even if the forest disappears one day, the earth will remember.

## Talk

Traveler: The song from Festival Utsava...
Arakavi: It was a song as golden as the sun, and I was proud to be a part of it. As the Golden Nara, you will always stay in my memories and the memory of Vanarana.
Arakavi: I'll leave the little one to you. This is the Singing Majalis, and she loves being surrounded by warm sounds. In the past, she was the emblem of us Song Gatherers. Flowers like her have all perished during Vanarana's destruction, and now, only one seed remains.
Arakavi: We did not think that this seed would never grow or bloom again... But I think that the song from Festival Utsava gave her a new lease on life. Please, take her with you and give her lots of warmth and light.
