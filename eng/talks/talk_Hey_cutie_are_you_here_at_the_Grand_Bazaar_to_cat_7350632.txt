# Talk Dialog

Lisa: Hey cutie, are you here at the Grand Bazaar to catch some performances?
Traveler: Do you like the performances here?
Lisa: Yes, they are quite amusing. I even wonder if I should start taking notes on the formats of some of the programs. Who knows? Perhaps it'll come in handy for the next Ludi Harpastum.
Lisa: Kaeya could take charge of the jokes, but dancing might prove to be a little tricky.
Traveler: Have you seen the dancing here before?
Lisa: Yes, there was a lovely girl with red hair dancing yesterday. I had a front row seat, it was really something.
Lisa: I can't help but wonder how great it would be to see similar performances in Mondstadt.
Traveler: You just have to convince Nilou to perform in Mondstadt.
Lisa: Actually, I think the biggest challenge would be to get Eula, Captain of the Reconnaissance Company, to show some interest in dancing, as well as to find a beautiful outfit she would agree to wear.
Traveler: So you're trying to get Eula involved?
Lisa: Eula is surprisingly gullible when it comes to certain things. Rather than inviting the performers to Mondstadt, it would be easier to trick... ah, I mean, ask her to dance.
Traveler: That might be a challenge.
