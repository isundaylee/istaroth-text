Traveler: Any recommendations?
Sanguinetti: You can try some Fontainian Foie Gras alongside this red wine blend of Sassica and Ornella, produced on Erinnyes.
Sanguinetti: This wine is naturally sweet and carries a slightly sour note, while its fruity flavors stand out to balance out the fatty flavor, rounding it out and making it even more elegant.
Sanguinetti: Finally, allow its silky finish to fill your senses with the fragrance of roasted Figs and Sweet Flowers as a parting gift.
Sanguinetti: Those revelers who raise their champagnes in toast can never appreciate such beauty.

Traveler: You don't seem too pleased.
Sanguinetti: ...You're quite sharp.
Sanguinetti: Though those who come and go here at Hotel Debord are well-known in society, not every well-dressed gentleman or lady is as elegant in their tastes as their appearance might indicate.
Sanguinetti: "What's the oldest and most expensive wine in your store? We'll have one of those." How often have I heard those words?
Sanguinetti: Only Vaneigem can smile as he faces down such louts. My suggestion would've been "please raise your aesthetic levels before you enter these grounds."
