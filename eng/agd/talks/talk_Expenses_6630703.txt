Traveler: Expenses?
"Mural Maniac": A thousand Mora to each person each year â€” that's what goes into training up new members of our Alliance.
"Mural Maniac": Outsiders have told us that art from other places attaches great importance to heritage.
"Mural Maniac": So my master's master's master's... master from Archon-only-knows how many generations ago, that person created this membership fee system.
"Mural Maniac": We put these dues toward buying lots of paints and spray paint tools so that we can give keen joiners free lessons...
"Mural Maniac": That spread the popularity of graffiti and got more people into it.
"Mural Maniac": However, the fees haven't changed for hundreds of years. Nowadays, it's not enough to cover our expenses.
"Mural Maniac": Perhaps I could take some orders for portraits, earn some royalties, and beef up our expenses fund...?
