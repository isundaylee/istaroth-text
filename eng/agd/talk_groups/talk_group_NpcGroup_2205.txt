## Talk 1

Qingzhou: Oh, I was just lucky this time. Let's go for another round — and let's play for keeps this time!

## Talk 2

Qingzhou: What bold play! If you'll allow me, let me compose a verse in praise of this game!

## Talk 3

Qingzhou: How unexpected...
Traveler: What's unexpected?
Qingzhou: I originally wished to enter the mountains to seek the adepti, my liege. Yet now Liyue seems to shed its skin with every passing day — do poets such as I have any reason not to write a few poems of leisure?
Qingzhou: Still, though my heart is burdened with words, they are too scattered, and lack a central spirit of poetry to rally around. I was just puzzling over the matter.
Traveler: Wh—Whatever do you mean, my liege?
Qingzhou: Ah, but you are no poet. It is normal if you do not understand. The flow of a poet's words is a mystery unto itself.
Qingzhou: But other than the words, the poetic spirit itself is fraught with many meanings. Meanings that I shall explain to you in detail, in exchange, perhaps, for a little favor...
Traveler: H—Hold your horses. What favor?
Qingzhou: Ahaha, do not fret, my liege. It's like this...
Qingzhou: I merely feel that if I am to offer up a poem for Liyue as it is today, then I must draw inspiration from the city itself.
Qingzhou: You are well-traveled, my liege, and must surely be learned in many fields, including that of social grace. Perhaps, then, you could go to Liyue Harbor in my stead to gather data—
Qingzhou: No, no. Perhaps the intentionality shall render the exercise mediocre yet. And moreover, you are... Ahem, please allow me to marshal my thoughts.
Qingzhou: How about this, then? You merely need to go through the city as you are wont to — then return, and tell me of the things that catch your eye.

Traveler: I'll do it.
Qingzhou: Splendiferous! I shall be counting on you, my liege.

Traveler: I'm afraid I have other things to do.
Qingzhou: No harm done, my liege. Poetry requires inspiration, and inspiration may not be coerced. I shall ponder a little by myself.

Qingzhou: To fish, forever moor on the pampas sea... When will the next line come to me? *sigh* ...Oh, hello there!

Traveler: Who are you?
Qingzhou: My name is Qingzhou, my liege. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold.
Qingzhou: In a few years' time I shall have to inherit the family business. I gave my word to meet my father back home in three years' time.
Qingzhou: In the meantime, I am on something of a poetic pilgrimage in Liyue; I thought I would avail myself of the relative freedom one tends to be afforded in the years before fully fledged adulthood.
Qingzhou: I merely wish for the chance to spread my poetic wings and see how far they carry me... before I either crash or get shot down, that is. Hahahaha.
Traveler: Tell me about your pilgrimage.
Qingzhou: I've been to all of the Lord of Geo's sacred sites, which has already given me some inspiration to work with.
Qingzhou: But all the true marvels to be beheld in terms of Liyue scenery take place in a semi-mystical realm. There is a saying about Liyue's name that captures this very idea: "As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds," Li being a precious ceramic ornament and Yue referring to the moon.
Qingzhou: The next thing for me to do is to seek guidance from the adepti.
Qingzhou: There are legends throughout Liyue of people becoming adepti and ascending to the celestial realm in broad daylight. They say that to take a single visit to the island in the clouds is to say goodbye to the world for many a year.
Qingzhou: In other words... Once you set off down this path, you'll get lost in the clouds — and then who knows when you'll come back down to earth...
Qingzhou: Hahahaha...

Traveler: Can you show me some of your work?
Qingzhou: "The sole survivor of an endless war, plagued by anguish for eons more."
Qingzhou: "His fleeting figure through Guyun soars, conquering demons in service of his Lord."
Qingzhou: This one is about an adeptus. For some reason, it just seems so fitting reciting it here...
Qingzhou: Hah, listen to me, I must sound like such a fool.
