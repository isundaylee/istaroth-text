# Big Pudgy Problem!

Arthur: Thank you! You saved my life.
Arthur: Those slimes came out of nowhere. I didn't think they would show up around these parts... Before I knew what was happening, I was surrounded!
Arthur: Please don't tell my father... He's already been nagging me to stay at home, saying the slimes 'round here are supposed to be getting more hostile recently.
Arthur: With slimes appearing closer to the city, I've been stuck at home for days now. I managed to slip out today without him noticing.
Arthur: If you don't mind, could you check if the coast is clear now? And if not, get rid of the slimes for me?
Traveler: Sure, it won't take me long.
Arthur: Great! Looks like my father will never have to find out...
Traveler: Sorry, I've got too much on my plate right now.
Arthur: Bâ€”But... I cannot get my father involved... Please, you're the only one who can help me!
