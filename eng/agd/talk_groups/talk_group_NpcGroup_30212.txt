Mamdouh: Every new toy we've ever launched at Acara Crafts has always had kids from all over Port Ormos flocking here to buy it.
Mamdouh: We thought our Aranara carvings would be a big hit too. Who would've thought...

Mamdouh: With Razi's help, we're finally ready to get started. Hopefully, the children will like our carvings this time.

Mamdouh: We didn't expect the carvings to be so popular. My hands are getting sore from making them.
Mamdouh: We won't be developing any new toys for a while. Right now, our focus is on making Aranara carvings so that all children in Port Ormos can have one of their own.
