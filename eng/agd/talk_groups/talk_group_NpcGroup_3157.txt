Ono: Hmm? Are you an outlander traveling to Inazuma?
Ono: How strange. Why are you walking around in a place like this when you could be enjoying yourself in Inazuma City?

Traveler: Anything you can tell me about the war?
Ono: It's all because of the people from Sangonomiya. Not only do they not worship the Electro Archon, they even disobeyed the Almighty Shogun and stirred up this conflict.
Ono: If they would just give up their Visions or whatever, we wouldn't have to fight this war and I could return to the city. I could really use a cold one at the Uyuu Restaurant.
Ono: *sigh* War is just bad all around.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ono: I still don't get you, but yeah, see you around I guess.

Traveler: Anything you can tell me about the war?
Ono: Before this, I'd thought of many ways in which this conflict could go. Maybe the Shogunate might destroy the resistance by sheer dint of force, or perhaps the resistance might eventually buckle under the pressure and surrender...
Ono: I never expected the Shogunate to not only gain some advantage, but instead start peace talks with them...
Ono: To tell the truth, I'm a bit disappointed in the Shogunate leadership's strategy. But at the same time, this ceasefire gladdens me far more.
Ono: I mean, who among the ordinary citizens of Inazuma really wished to go out there and kill people, am I right?

Traveler: See you around.
Ono: See you.
