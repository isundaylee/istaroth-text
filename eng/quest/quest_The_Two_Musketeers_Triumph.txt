# The Two Musketeers' Triumph


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: Some more time passes after that...
Paimon: Xavier! It's been a while!
Xavier: Hey there, you two. Sorry I've been scarce, I've been buried in marketing and preparing the film for release ever since we wrapped post-production...
Paimon: The award ceremony is today, right? Paimon wonders if we'll win the Furina Award!
Furina: I'd give it a ninety percent chance.
Paimon: Furina! Paimon didn't know you were already here. You're earlier than everyone else!
Furina: I'm sure the others will also be here in no time. Hmm... Xavier, if we end up getting called on stage, shouldn't you come up with a name for our crew?
Xavier: Huh!? But we don't even know if we're going to win. I wouldn't want to jinx our chances by celebrating early...
Furina: Just open your eyes! Surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? We've had nothing but critical acclaim!
Furina: You've also had conversations with the opera house's operating staff, right? Didn't they want to increase the number of showings?
Furina: With the Mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
Xavier: B—But that's all credit to my amazing crew! You've all helped to make this a reality, so I can't be the only one asked to come up with a name!
Furina: Well, give it some thought. I'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
Xavier: #Alright... But before that, Traveler and Paimon, could I trouble you to quickly pay a visit to the Fortress of Meropide?
Paimon: Huh? But shouldn't we stay for the award ceremony?
Xavier: I wanted to ask you two to invite Chevreuse to join us at the ceremony. She's one of the lead roles, after all.
Xavier: I haven't been able to find her recently, so I haven't had the chance to invite her personally.
Xavier: According to the papers, the culprits of the musket murder case will be personally escorted today by the Captain of the Special Patrol to the Fortress of Meropide...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now.
Traveler: It'll be a piece of cake for us.
Paimon: Yep! Just wait here, Xavier, and maybe try to come up with a few snappy sounding names.
Xavier: Alright, then I'll leave you to it.

## Talk 2

Chevreuse: This is as far as I'll be taking them. I'll leave the three of them to you now.
Wriothesley: Got another errand to run?
Chevreuse: Something like that. I'm expected at a party.
Wriothesley: Now that's something you don't hear every day. Found a new pastime?
Chevreuse: No, it's just a special occasion.
Paimon: Chevreuse, Wriothesley!
Wriothesley: Festivals really do bring people together. It's been a while since I last had so many visitors at the Fortress of Meropide.
Chevreuse: Call it the festival spirit, I guess.
Wriothesley: Yeah, you could say that. Even our head nurse has gotten herself all worked up preparing super deluxe nutritious shakes... Just one gulp, and you'll have met all of your nutrition needs.
Paimon: Were you talking about work just now?
Chevreuse: We've already finished discussing everything. So, what do you think about my "heads-up," Mr. Wriothesley?
Wriothesley: Hmm. I believe I haven't yet made any promises or guarantees.
Chevreuse: But you also didn't shoot me down.
Chevreuse: Here, how about this? You could give everyone a copy of the newspaper. Perhaps on the day when the cover story happens to, oh, I dunno, expose a certain someone's misdeeds from 20 years ago.
Wriothesley: Hmm. I suppose then, a certain someone may soon find himself the most unlucky person in the Fortress of Meropide.
Chevreuse: While another two people will soon be hailed as heroes.
Wriothesley: Speaking of heroes, did you two need something from me?
Paimon: Oh, uh, actually we're here for...
Chevreuse: You're here to invite me to the party, right? Don't worry, I didn't forget.
Paimon: Ooh, then let's head back right away!
Paimon: See ya, Wriothesley! Happy Fontinalia Festival!
Wriothesley: And the same to you.

## Talk 3

Film Festival Host: And the winner of the Furina Award for the first Fontinalia Film Festival is—
Film Festival Host: "The Two Musketeers"!
Paimon: We won! We really won!
Kamisato Ayaka: Congratulations, Mr. Xavier.
Xavier: We won... I can't believe it, I... I... I really can't thank all of you enough!
Furina: See? My takes on Fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
Film Festival Host: Now, please welcome to the stage the producer of "The Two Musketeers," Mr. Xavier!
Xavier: Thank you... Thank you all so much for your recognition and support. While I'm up here, I would like to give special thanks to—
Chevreuse: Time really flies, huh?
Kamisato Ayaka: It certainly feels that way. It feels like it was only yesterday when you were teaching me to hold a musket.
Chevreuse: Will you come back to Fontaine again?
Kamisato Ayaka: Of course! I'm very fond of this city. There are so many novel and interesting things that it's been hard to keep track of them all.
Kamisato Ayaka: But how about you? Would you be interested in visiting Inazuma?
Chevreuse: I can't say the thought has crossed my mind before... but I'd be willing to consider it now.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will be eagerly awaiting your visit. It would be wonderful if you could visit my home and enjoy a taste of our tea and desserts.
Chevreuse: Yes, let's keep in touch.
Chiori: Did you accomplish all you came here for?
Kamisato Ayato: Yes. And you should visit Inazuma again sometime.
Chiori: How has Ogura and her business been?
Kamisato Ayato: To my knowledge, she's been doing quite well.
Chiori: Tell her I said hi.
Kamisato Ayato: I certainly will.
Chiori: I heard the thunderstorm has stopped.
Kamisato Ayato: Yes, and the war has also been brought to an end. Peace and prosperity has returned to the islands.
Chiori: I quite like the sound of that, perfect for hanging textiles out to dry.
Xavier: —I'd like to offer my thanks again to the entire cast and crew. Without you, I would have never completed this film, much less had the opportunity to be standing on this stage.
Xavier: With the support of my entire crew, I would like to officially announce our film company, "Musketeer Pictures"!
Paimon: Ooh, that has a really nice ring to it!
Film Festival Host: Then, in that case, let's please welcome all the members of Musketeer Pictures onto the stage for a commemorative photo!
Paimon: Oh! Paimon didn't know we'd also be taking pictures!
Xavier: Director Furina, I believe you are the most deserving person to raise this trophy.
Furina: Huh? No, no no no, there's no need... It's so embarrassing...
Chevreuse: It's an honor the director deserves.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I agree.
Traveler: I can't think of anyone better for the honor.
Chiori: Just accept that you're not getting out of this.
Film Festival Host: Ready, everyone? Three, two, one—
Paimon: Musketeer Pictures!!!
