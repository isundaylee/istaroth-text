Traveler: Why did the Shogunate tell you to move?
Oda Tarou: The reason... Well, I can't remember. It's been many generations after all.
Oda Tarou: Some people said it was because of the rampant lightning storms on Seirai Island. Some said it was to prevent smuggling and stowaways... Anyway, there are many theories, and they all sound pretty plausible.
Oda Tarou: As the children of the Electro Archon, we listened to the Shogunate's order, of course. After relocating to Narukami Island, my family started doing business in the city, and we eventually became affluent. Turns out it's actually better than staying on a lonely island.
Oda Tarou: Still, Seirai Island is my hometown. To think that we have no idea what's going on there anymore...
