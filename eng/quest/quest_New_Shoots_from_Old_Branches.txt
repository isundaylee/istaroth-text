# New Shoots from Old Branches


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hmm? Those two look familiar...
Paimon: Ah, it's Ippei and Shinnojou!
Traveler: So it is!
Paimon: Hehe, guess they must be good friends, huh?
Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.
Paimon: Hi, Ippei! Hi, Shinnojou! What are you guys doing here?
Ippei: Oh! It's you! Thanks so much for your help last time.
Ippei: I was just ordering some clothes when I ran into him.
Shinnojou: You know these two as well?
Ippei: Yes. They helped me and Master Kamaji out a great deal last time. I've never had the chance to say thank you properly.
Ippei: What about you? How do you know them?
Shinnojou: Also a chance encounter. Our Lady had them join us as additional guards for a goods escort in order to sneak out of Ritou undetected.
Paimon: So we all know each other, huh! What a coincidence!
Ippei: Ah, not exactly. We've only just met. We both came here to order some clothes and got to chatting.
Ippei: Somehow we ended up on the topic of Master Kamaji and Lady Hiiragi's relationship... Wait... it's okay to talk about that, right?
Shinnojou: It's probably fine. They've known about it for a long time already.
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon remembers those two had a thing. In fact, that was why Chisato wanted us to deliver a letter!
Paimon: That's old news though, so why's it come up now? Are they... taking the next step, or something?
Ippei: We have reason to suspect that they'll be getting married soon.
Paimon: Wow! That's great! They can finally make it official!
Ippei: Of course, this is just personal speculation. They haven't announced anything, and we wouldn't dare to ask...
Shinnojou: I was instructed to place an order for some formal wear for a big banquet. Turns out that Ippei received the exact same instructions as I did.
Ippei: They're both preparing for a banquet at the same time, they're both purchasing the kind of fine wine and confectionery normally reserved for big festivals... It's hard not to put two and two together.
Shinnojou: Lady Hiiragi has been in high spirits recently, and I heard she's on a diet as well... Surely it's all for the wedding.
Paimon: This is wonderful news! But, um...
Shinnojou: What's wrong?
Shinnojou: Oh, don't mind me. She's about to be happily married to the love of her life. I genuinely couldn't be happier for her.
Ippei: Right? I think so, too, it's fantastic!
Shinnojou: Yes, but we shouldn't let ourselves get overexcited. What if it's all a big misunderstanding? As things stand, we have no actual proof of a wedding.
Shinnojou: Now, if they sent me out to deliver wedding invitations, that would be a different story...
Paimon: Shinnojou doesn't look like he's taking this very well at all.
Traveler: You seem upset.
Shinnojou: ...Sorry. I just... haven't slept well recently.
Shinnojou: I'm ashamed to be so out of sorts at work. I'm not living up to my responsibilities, either to the Kanjou Commission or to my lady...
Ippei: Are you worried about their wedding?
Shinnojou: Not exactly, it's just... everything feels kind of up in the air until they make it official.
Ippei: I get what you mean, I really do! We need this wedding to be set in stone before the celebrations can really begin!
Traveler: (Actually, you don't get what he means at all...)
Paimon: What should we do? Shall we just... straight up ask them?
Ippei: I don't know, that seems a bit rude...
Traveler: Well, since this is a wedding between two Commissions...
Paimon: Right! If Ayaka knows about it, that means it's a sure thing!
Shinnojou: I... I don't think it's a good idea to bother the Yashiro Commission about this...
Paimon: #Ah, it's fine. {NICKNAME} and Ayaka are practically best buds. There's nothing to worry about!
Shinnojou: I see... Then, thank you, thank you very much. Having a definite answer will stop my thoughts from running wild.
Paimon: Let's go to the Kamisato Estate!
Traveler: The Yashiro Commission oversees wedding ceremonies. They'll know something.
Traveler: You seem down.
Traveler: Remind me who they are again?
Paimon: What? You forgot already?
Paimon: That one is Shinnojou. Back when we first arrived in Inazuma, we escorted Hiiragi Chisato out of Ritou with him. Remember? That's how we got out.
Paimon: Next to him is Ippei, Kujou Kamaji's servant. That day when we hung out with Ei, he came and told us that Kujou Kamaji had gone missing. He was really worried.
Traveler: Good memory.
Paimon: Hehe, all part of Paimon's job as your guide.
Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.

## Talk 2

Ippei: This place impresses me every time I come here. It's so magnificent but still so elegant.
Shinnojou: We'll just wait here. We don't want to cause any extra trouble for you.
Paimon: Ayaka wouldn't mind!
Ippei: Honestly, even if we did come with you, we wouldn't know what to say or do once we were inside... Hehe, so we'll just leave you to it.
Paimon: Alright then. We won't be long.

## Talk 3

Ippei: Not to pry, but it seems like there's something on your mind. Do you want to talk about it?
Shinnojou: It's nothing. I just didn't sleep well, that's all. Really, I'm fine.

## Talk 4

Kamisato Ayato: Greetings, both. I have long been indebted to you on my sister's behalf. Finally, I have the chance to express my profoundest gratitude to you in person.
Kamisato Ayato: Ayaka is out today. If you are here regarding anything related to the Kamisato Clan, you are quite welcome to discuss it with me instead.
Paimon: Oh, uh... hi... Your flattering words... flatter us. Um, please excuse the sudden... -ness of our visit, for it is most improper etiquette...
Thoma: Hahaha, why on earth are you talking like that?
Paimon: Well, he seems like a pretty powerful person... He's already working his way up Paimon's list of people to never mess with...
Paimon: Look! As soon as he stands up, the whole atmosphere in the room changes and it feels like you've gotta be super polite!
Kamisato Ayato: Haha, you shower me with praise undeserved, my little guest.
Kamisato Ayato: There is no need to be quite so formal. This is a private residence, so please relax.
Paimon: Oh, good! 'Cause that whole spiel was really tiring just now! Alright, now that that's over, Paimon's just gonna ask the question.
Traveler: Paimon goes from polite to presumptuous in a split-second.
Paimon: We heard a rumor that Kujou Kamaji and Hiiragi Chisato are gonna get married soon. Do you know anything about that?
Kamisato Ayato: Oh? I wouldn't have thought you'd heard about that yet.
Traveler: As it happens, we've crossed paths with them before.
Kamisato Ayato: I see... Well, it's true. It wasn't long ago that I received the news myself.
Kamisato Ayato: The head clans of two Commissions are to become joined through marriage. This is big news, for the whole of Inazuma.
Kamisato Ayato: Since the Yashiro Commission presides over cultural and ceremonial affairs, it closely involves us, too.
Thoma: Yes. And since the commissions are kind of the face of the Almighty Shogun to the masses, this wedding is one that we have to treat as a serious affair.
Paimon: Right, makes sense.
Paimon: Ah, two true lovers becoming husband and wife. What a happy occasion!
Kamisato Ayato: It is. High-profile matrimonial links between two commissions are extremely rare, but these two truly love each other. Tradition should give way to freedom in this case.
Thoma: Alright then. I'll be sure to pay them a visit to send the best wishes of the Kamisato Clan.
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm...
Kamisato Ayato: No need. I'll visit them personally this time.
Thoma: Huh? But you have other things to be doing...
Kamisato Ayato: This is a marriage between the Kujou Clan and the Hiiragi Clan. The Kamisato Clan must demonstrate an appropriate level of respect.
Kamisato Ayato: The work of the Yashiro Commission is indeed multifarious. Normally, weddings and other ceremonies would come under the supervision of my sister.
Kamisato Ayato: But she is presently occupied with other matters, and I happen to have a little time to spare. This will be a good chance for me to pay a visit to the bride and groom.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh — and would you two care to join me?
Traveler: You mean us?
Kamisato Ayato: I presume you two have a special connection with the individuals in question, or you would not be quite so interested in this matter.
Kamisato Ayato: This being the case, why not come and offer your best wishes too? Or... is my presumption incorrect?
Paimon: Oh, it's not as interesting as you make it sound... No special connections here. Super-ordinary ones, actually.
Paimon: We just agreed to help deliver a letter this one time, that's all... Although, wait... does that mean we helped make this wedding happen!?
Traveler: Paimon, don't overestimate your contribution here.
Paimon: Huh, alright then...
Traveler: But still. Let's go see them.
Kamisato Ayato: I cannot thank you enough. Your mere presence shall surely mean we are spared the futile pursuit known as small talk.
Paimon: Wait, you're the Yashiro Commissioner, but you can't do small talk?
Kamisato Ayato: Ahaha... small talk is a chore. Of course, there are some people in the world who quite enjoy doing chores... but I am not one of them.
Kamisato Ayato: Thoma, I'm heading out with my two guests now. I'll leave the residence in your capable hands.
Thoma: Not a problem. Take care, my lord.
Traveler: Romantic relationships are determined by fate.
Traveler: So adaptable, Paimon.

## Talk 5

Thoma: What's wrong? Are you worried about having to be on your best behavior around my lord? Hahaha, don't be nervous. He's actually pretty easy to get along with.
Thoma: Well... the vast majority of the time, at least...

## Talk 6

Ippei: Ahh, you're finally—
Shinnojou: Ah! Yashiro Commissioner!?
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm? Who are these two?
Paimon: They're friends of ours. Paimon will do the introductions!
Black Screen Text: You introduce your companions to Ayato and update Ippei and Shinnojou on the situation.
Shinnojou: So it's true...
Shinnojou: Well, there we have it... That's it, then. So be it.
Ippei: Great! So our hunch was spot on!
Kamisato Ayato: It is a little inappropriate for me to have shared news of this magnitude with you. So I would be much obliged if you could keep it in strict confidence until an official public announcement is made.
Ippei: Don't worry, Sir. We... we give you our word, we won't tell anyone about it!
Kamisato Ayato: That puts my mind at ease. Now, on the topic, we'd like to pay a visit to the Kujou Clan. Would you mind leading the way for us?
Ippei: Of course not. I'd be honored!
Shinnojou: I guess this is where I... Goodbye, then...
Paimon: Cheer up, Shinnojou!
Shinnojou: I'll try. Thank you.

## Talk 7

Ippei: Alright then. Please excuse me, I'll leave you to it from here.
Kujou Kamaji: Okay. Thanks, Ippei.
Kujou Kamaji: I apologize that your impromptu visit comes at a busy time for us, Commissioner. Otherwise, you can be sure that we would've prepared a more extravagant reception.
Kamisato Ayato: I don't mean to impose, Sir Kujou. In fact, I'm not here on official business at all.
Kamisato Ayato: I heard the good news about yourself and Lady Hiiragi. What a glorious marital alliance this shall be. Given the close ties between our clans, it seemed only right that I should come and offer the Kamisato Clan's congratulations in person.
Kujou Kamaji: I'm truly honored. I hope the news didn't come as too much of a surprise...
Paimon: Hey there! We came to congratulate you as well!
Traveler: How have you been?
Kujou Kamaji: Since the incident with the Takatsukasa Clan, things in the Tenryou Commission have slowly started to stabilize.
Kujou Kamaji: I'm still acclimating to the position of acting head of the Clan. I just hope I'm up to the task, so I can live up to everyone's expectations.
Kamisato Ayato: You're far too modest. The public thinks very highly of you. They say you're hard-working, upright, and responsible.
Kujou Kamaji: I'm flattered, but I wouldn't have achieved anything without the support of my people. Thanks to them, everything is gradually stabilizing, and I've finally had the chance to focus a little on my personal life.
Paimon: Hehe, well you're certainly making big progress in that department!
Traveler: Sounds like it was worth sending that letter.
Kujou Kamaji: Hehe, come on now. You're embarrassing me...
Kujou Kamaji: Ah! Pardon me, I, um...
Kamisato Ayato: It's perfectly alright. Please, continue. I'm quite content to listen.
Kamisato Ayato: It's a joyous occasion. Light-hearted is exactly how things should be. Really, who stays stony-faced when talking about a wedding?
Kujou Kamaji: You're right.
Kujou Kamaji: But I am curious to know — what's your honest opinion on the whole thing? Do you think it's... too sudden?
Kamisato Ayato: Haha, of course not. Where there is true love, nothing should be allowed to stand in its way.
Kamisato Ayato: No doubt people will offer you a colorful variety of opinions. But of course, you will have factored this into your decision, and I'm sure you are prepared for whatever challenges may lie ahead.
Kujou Kamaji: Indeed I am.
Kamisato Ayato: So, please be confident. When your mind is made up, you ought not be worried about things for which you are already well-prepared.
Kamisato Ayato: Nevertheless, there is just one small aspect of this that puzzles me a little...
Kujou Kamaji: Please go ahead.
Kamisato Ayato: You've been working hard to bring the Tenryou Commission in line. This is positive, and no doubt the beginning of an important change. But on the other side of this equation, Lady Hiiragi's father, Hiiragi Shinsuke, is still in prison.
Kamisato Ayato: If you choose now, of all moments, to announce a marriage between the Hiiragi and Kujou Clans, the kinds of rumors that may begin to spread, both among the general public and in the Kanjou Commission, are not likely to be in either of your best interests.
Kujou Kamaji: Yeah...
Kujou Kamaji: Couldn't have put it better myself, Sir Kamisato. This has been my biggest concern for quite a while now.
Kujou Kamaji: Hiiragi Shinsuke is firmly against me having any contact at all with Chisato. In the past, we've always had to communicate in secret, by sending letters.
Kujou Kamaji: So although now may not look like the best timing for this marriage, it may well be the only opportunity we have.
Paimon: ...Oh! That guy! Yeah, he acts like this sweet old man, but he was determined to make as much trouble for us as possible! Oh, he is the worst...
Kamisato Ayato: I can see where you're coming from. But you're only postponing the problem, not solving it. You will still have to face it sooner or later.
Kujou Kamaji: *sigh* Yes, I'm well aware of that. But since Chisato had the courage to ask me to marry her in spite of everything, how can I disappoint her?
Traveler: Oh... so she proposed to you?
Kujou Kamaji: Well, sort of... She raised the idea in a letter, and after some initial hesitation, I went to meet her and have a serious conversation about our future.
Kujou Kamaji: It's funny, actually, because when I formally proposed to her in person, she denied having ever written that letter... Ah, so coy...
Paimon: Huh? ...Really?
Traveler: I guess she's just pretty shy?
Kujou Kamaji: She didn't say, she just acted confused by the whole thing. She really committed to it. I'll never forget the look on her face.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh...
Kujou Kamaji: Anyway, as her boyfriend, I knew she was just pretending. So, I played along and said "Ah, I was only joking about the letter"... Then, I proposed.
Kujou Kamaji: After making some disgruntled noises about me making a stupid joke, she blushed and said yes. We spent that afternoon working through all the details of the wedding.
Kamisato Ayato: Okay. So you discussed it and decided on a date.
Kujou Kamaji: We did. I guess... it was a chance to finally express our commitment to one another, clearly and completely.
Kujou Kamaji: And you know what? I think it was about time.
Kujou Kamaji: No matter what happens next... I will always be there for her as the one person she can always rely on.
Paimon: Argh, gimme a break...
Paimon: Sorry, but Paimon's been wanting to say this the whole time! Is it just this dude, or does everyone in love act like this? He just won't stop talking!
Traveler: Nothing can stop him from sharing his love story...
Kujou Kamaji: Ah...!
Kujou Kamaji: Apologies, my friends, and also to Sir Kamisato... I must sound like a fool.
Kamisato Ayato: Far from it. On the contrary, seeing you so positively smitten puts my mind at rest.
Kamisato Ayato: No surer evidence could there be of your true feelings and your commitment. If I had any reservations before, I certainly don't now.
Kamisato Ayato: I wish you a joyous wedding when the day comes.
Paimon: Yeah, even if it's kinda irritating to see you all smug like this, it's still a happy occasion. Good luck on the day, and have a happy wedding!
Kujou Kamaji: Thank you all, it means a lot.
Kamisato Ayato: We have some other business to attend to now. Until next time.
Kujou Kamaji: Very well. I'll see you out.
Traveler: I think he can't help it.
Traveler: Maybe she prefers things to be more implicit?
Traveler: You must be a smooth operator.

## Talk 8

Tomoki: Ah, it's you two! Seems like you're always showing up with a VIP in tow.
Tomoki: I got my license and I'm doing a soft opening today. Wanna try out my latest creative drink?
Traveler: I'm a little busy right now...
Tomoki: Okay sure. Well, feel free to swing by later if you're free.

## Talk 9

Kujou Kamaji: I know it's not an easy path ahead, but this is my responsibility.
Kujou Kamaji: I need to give her a reason to be confident in me.

## Talk 10

Paimon: He seems busy. That must be true for anyone about to get married, right? It's a happy kind of busy, though.
Kamisato Ayato: You're right. Kujou Kamaji is on cloud nine.
Kamisato Ayato: What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: He seems genuinely happy, but...
Kamisato Ayato: He chalked it up to her being coy, but... that doesn't sound like the Hiiragi Chisato I know.
Kamisato Ayato: It bothers me also. But unfortunately, attempting to seek the truth of the matter would likely be fruitless.
Traveler: How so?
Paimon: Yeah, how come? Whenever we come across stuff like this on our adventures, we always find a way to get to the bottom of it.
Kamisato Ayato: I see. So that's how adventurers think.
Kamisato Ayato: In my opinion, we face two obstacles in this case. Firstly, we have very little information to go on, and I must be cautious about taking a stance. This makes it difficult to investigate.
Kamisato Ayato: Secondly, and more importantly, the person involved doesn't seem to care.
Kamisato Ayato: If we intervene without his blessing, good intentions may lead to catastrophic results.
Paimon: You do have a point... Kamaji doesn't seem worried at all.
Kamisato Ayato: Everything in the world is intertwined. What looks like a simple outcome is often the result of multiple conflating reasons.
Kamisato Ayato: Seeking the full truth would be a long and laborious process. It would be inefficient.
Traveler: Speaking from experience?
Kamisato Ayato: Sort of. I have to take this approach, or the work of the Yashiro Commissioner would never be done.
Kamisato Ayato: My opinion is something like this: When something strange happens, instead of trying to find out what could have caused it, it is better to look at the situation itself.
Kamisato Ayato: If the outcome is positive, and no one was deceived or harmed in the process, then it is acceptable.
Traveler: But...
Kamisato Ayato: We don't know yet. After all, we don't know what Hiiragi Chisato's thoughts are, do we?
Kamisato Ayato: I have to say, I'm impressed by your ability to zero in on the issue from such a short meeting. Most insightful of you. You are thorough and thoughtful, just as my sister describes.
Paimon: Huh? But... Chisato and Kamaji have already talked everything through, haven't they?
Kamisato Ayato: Only if we are to take Kujou Kamaji at his word. But there are two sides to every story.
Kamisato Ayato: I wish to know Hiiragi Chisato's angle on this.
Paimon: Huh... Makes sense, but Paimon still doesn't quite get it...
Kamisato Ayato: Don't worry about it. I was planning to visit the Hiiragi Clan to deliver my best wishes anyway. Let's take the opportunity to hear her thoughts.
Kamisato Ayato: If she's as committed as Kujou Kamaji, perhaps they can navigate the challenges ahead successfully. But if not...
Kamisato Ayato: ...Well, life isn't always a smooth journey.
Traveler: Are there really no negative consequences to this?
Traveler: Been here before?
Traveler: ...I'm bothered by how the whole thing began.

## Talk 11

Matsuura: There is still much to prepare for the wedding.
Matsuura: Should we also invite some prominent business leaders who frequently visit Ritou?
Hishida: At the very least we should send them invitations.
Matsuura: I agree... Ah, hello there, Yashiro Commissioner.
Yagi: To what do we owe the honor on this fine day?
Kamisato Ayato: As it happens, I'm here regarding the same wedding I believe I heard you discussing just now. I come bearing the felicitations of the Kamisato Clan.
Kamisato Ayato: Would Lady Hiiragi happen to be available at this moment?
Matsuura: Our lady is entertaining guests right now, and we're not entirely sure how long she will be.
Hishida: But please, do come in. We will arrange some tea and snacks for you and your attendants.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon is not an attendant!
Kamisato Ayato: You misunderstand. These two are dear friends.
Paimon: Hehehe, you're too kind...
Kamisato Ayato: We don't wish to impose. We'll just wander around in the general area.
Kamisato Ayato: Apologies for the interruption while you're busy with preparations. Please let us know once Lady Hiiragi is available.
Matsuura: Nonsense, Commissioner, no imposition at all. This wedding is a joyful occasion, and all the other clans who serve the Hiiragi Clan are most delighted for them indeed.
Matsuura: We're merely doing the best we can to make this wedding as grand an affair as possible.
Hishida: When the time comes, we'll invite everyone in the clan and even the general public to attend.
Kamisato Ayato: That sounds splendid.
Kamisato Ayato: We'll leave you to it.
Yagi: Take care, Commissioner.

## Talk 12

Matsuura: Now, where were we again? Ah yes, invitations...
Hishida: My family can take charge of that. We have a lot of written correspondence with them already.
Matsuura: Sounds sensible to me. Then, thank you.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Oh, it's Tomoki!
Tomoki: Ah, it's you! Good to see you again.
Tomoki: Seems like you're always showing up with a VIP in tow.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh? So you know the owner as well?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kamisato Ayato: I meant to ask earlier — do you know the owner here as well?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Yep! We tried his Dango Milk a while back with the Almighty Shogun in Inazuma City.
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, I see... So you were involved in that...
Kamisato Ayato: I'd caught wind of this Dango Milk, but I didn't know that it had anything to do with you two.
Traveler: It was a twist of fate.
Kamisato Ayato: I always order one of his creative drinks whenever I pass the stall. The flavor is always new and interesting.
Kamisato Ayato: When I noticed he'd set up shop in Ritou, I simply had to come by.
Tomoki: Ah, thanks to you all, my business is finally beginning to take off. More and more people are willing to give my creative cuisine a shot.
Tomoki: It gave me the confidence to decide that I'm gonna stick to creative cuisine from now on.
Tomoki: On the one hand, I wanted more people to be able to try out my culinary creations. On the other hand, I wanted my customers to experience the joy of being creative, too.
Tomoki: So, I gave it a lot of thought, and finally came up with an all-new business concept.
Kamisato Ayato: Sounds interesting. What is it this time?
Tomoki: I've decided to give complete creative control to the customer. I offer all sorts of ingredients, and they pick and choose whatever they want to mix with their milk or tea.
Tomoki: As well as Dango, I now offer Rice Cake, Purple Potato Balls, Black Sugar, and Sunsettia.
Paimon: Do they really all go well with milk...?
Paimon: Hmm, hard to imagine. But... who knows — it could be delicious!
Kamisato Ayato: What if I were to choose some ingredients you don't have here? Would that be okay?
Tomoki: Uhh, well... I guess so. Any novel ideas you have, Commissioner, please feel free to tell me. I'll go buy the ingredients right away.
Tomoki: The whole idea was to let my customers express their creativity freely. So of course, I shouldn't place restrictions on the ingredients if I can help it.
Kamisato Ayato: Excellent. There are a few things I'd like to try...
Kamisato Ayato: Lavender Melon, Seagrass, and Sea Ganoderma.
Paimon: Uh, what? You want to mix those with milk?
Kamisato Ayato: I do indeed — why, what's wrong?
Paimon: ...You really think that's gonna turn out tasting good!?
Kamisato Ayato: It's all about the experience — the taste is secondary. It's great to try new things.
Kamisato Ayato: Traveler? Any thoughts?
Traveler: It was unexpected, that's for sure.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Lavender Melon.
Paimon: Sounds like a risky choice. Are you sure...? Well, okay, Paimon will have the same as you...
Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Lavender Melon, please.
Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Black Screen Text: After a short while, the "Creative Milk" is finally ready.
Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: Yup, just as Paimon suspected. Raw Lavender Melon does not taste good!
Kamisato Ayato: I think it tastes alright. It makes me feel in touch with mother nature.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Seagrass.
Paimon: Are you serious? Uh... will Paimon seem like a scaredy-cat if she opts out of this one? Ugh, okay, Paimon'll have one, too...
Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Seagrass, please.
Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Black Screen Text: After a short while, the "Creative Milk" is finally ready.
Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: The Seagrass is stuck in the straw... Phew, this is so much work...
Kamisato Ayato: But it tastes alright. It captures the essence of the ocean.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Sea Ganoderma.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Doesn't Paimon get a say in this? So this is peer pressure, huh? Well... Alright, then bring it on! Paimon can take it!
Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Sea Ganoderma, please.
Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Black Screen Text: After a short while, the "Creative Milk" is finally ready.
Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: Somehow, Paimon got it down eventually, but... ugh, Paimon feels light-headed...
Kamisato Ayato: I think it's alright. It has quite a fascinating texture.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: ...Let's go with Dango.
Paimon: Yes! Dango! Dango will do nicely!
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm. An ordinary choice, but there's nothing wrong with that.
Kamisato Ayato: Two Dango Milks, and one Milk with Lavender Melon, please.
Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Black Screen Text: After a short while, the "Creative Milk" is finally ready.
Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Paimon: Dango Milk tastes pretty good once you get used to it.
Paimon: What about yours?
Kamisato Ayato: A most memorable texture indeed. A success, I'd say.

### Additional Talk 7

Paimon: Your review seemed pretty positive. But Paimon still thinks there are better combinations...
Kamisato Ayato: Taste is your key concern, yes?
Paimon: Obviously! Tasty food and drinks are some of life's most important pursuits.
Kamisato Ayato: Well said. If I could say the same was true for me, I believe I'd be a very content man.
Traveler: In other words, you have too many other things to worry about?
Kamisato Ayato: Yes. No one has unlimited energy, and I try to conserve mine for the things that really count. To create some mental breathing room, I try not to overthink the less-critical matters.
Kamisato Ayato: Having my sister attend public events in my stead and having Thoma as housekeeper has also been a great help, and allowed me to focus.
Paimon: We're just passing the time here though, right? Is there anything else to think about than what we're doing right now?
Kamisato Ayato: One or two things.
Kamisato Ayato: Let's continue this discussion somewhere else.
Kamisato Ayato: I noticed something before we left the Hiiragi Clan's residence.
Traveler: You saw who Hiiragi Chisato was meeting?
Kamisato Ayato: No, it was just a small detail. I was curious to know their thoughts on the wedding, so I asked them about it.
Kamisato Ayato: Naturally, they responded that all other clans are happy for the Hiiragi Clan...
Kamisato Ayato: But that's not the truth.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Shinsuke is still in prison, meaning the Kanjou Commission is the least stable in the Tri-Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Chisato is the sole remaining pillar of her clan, but now she plans to marry into the Kujou Clan. If I belonged to one of the assisting clans to the Hiiragis, I would not be feeling optimistic about the future.
Kamisato Ayato: But they didn't mention a word about that, they simply said they were delighted for them. These are not unintelligent people... I highly doubt it is because they simply do not realize.
Traveler: Hmm, I guess it is a bit strange...
Kamisato Ayato: I imagine they didn't want to discuss family issues in front of outsiders. But still, the more I think back over that conversation, the more it doesn't sit right.
Kamisato Ayato: Keep a close eye on them, Hisashi.
Hisashi: Yes, Sir.
Paimon: Whoa! Where did you come from!?
Kamisato Ayato: This is one of my most trusted members of the Shuumatsuban. He's been quietly watching out for us this whole time.
Hisashi: Merely doing my duty, Sir.
Kamisato Ayato: Keep a close watch on the clan representatives we met today.
Hisashi: Well received. I'm on the case.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh, and I almost forgot. That milk I just had — please order one more and deliver it to Thoma.
Hisashi: As you wish, Sir.
Paimon: Oh no, poor Thoma!
Traveler: (Sorry, Thoma.)
Yokoyama: Sir Kamisato, Lady Hiiragi's previous engagement is now concluded. She's waiting for you in the courtyard.
Kamisato Ayato: Thank you kindly.
Kamisato Ayato: Let's go and see Hiiragi Chisato.
Traveler: (Good luck, Thoma)
Traveler: You overheard those guys talking about something?

### Additional Talk 8

Tomoki: Thanks for coming. Hope to see you again!
Tomoki: Maybe this whole "creativity" theme really will work out...

### Additional Talk 9

Paimon: Hi! Nice to see you again, Chisato!
Hiiragi Chisato: I heard that Sir Kamisato had brought some guests, but I didn't know it was you two.
Kamisato Ayato: It's been a while, Lady Hiiragi. How have you been faring?
Hiiragi Chisato: This is a rare privilege, Sir Kamisato. It is not often that I have the chance to meet you, let alone here in the comfort of my own home. I'm doing very well indeed, thank you.
Hiiragi Chisato: You must be so busy. Thank you so much for taking the time to come and congratulate Kamaji and I, it really means a lot.
Kamisato Ayato: But of course. The Tri-Commission are the servants of the Shogun, and we should look out for one another. In fact, we visited Sir Kujou just now. It's clear that he's very much looking forward to the wedding.
Kamisato Ayato: Perhaps his joy is infectious, for I am now feeling rather elated myself. I sincerely wish you a joyful wedding and a blissful marriage.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you for your kind words.
Hiiragi Chisato: This was not an easy decision to make. We will both have to work harder from now on.
Hiiragi Chisato: I'm sure the news will cause something of a stir. But come what may, we will stand as one and face whatever the future throws at us together.
Paimon: Sounds like things are pretty tough for you, Chisato.
Hiiragi Chisato: Yes... To be honest, I'm still a little nervous about it all...
Hiiragi Chisato: But Kamaji has been so supportive. His promises have comforted me a lot.
Kamisato Ayato: It sounds like you have some considerable reservations, Lady Hiiragi.
Hiiragi Chisato: ...Yes, well... There are so many things I need to consider.
Hiiragi Chisato: In case you were wondering, I was not actually entertaining VIPs just now. I was in fact meeting with one of the Kanjou Commission's officers, Shinnojou.
Paimon: Oh... really? Him?
Hiiragi Chisato: Mm-hmm. He charged in all of a sudden and said that he had something very important to tell me.
Hiiragi Chisato: He didn't mince his words. Basically... he doesn't want me to marry Kamaji.
Traveler: ...He finally went there.
Hiiragi Chisato: He has always been a calm and contained person who never acts out of line. I was quite shocked to see him so agitated.
Hiiragi Chisato: But despite all that, what he was saying made a lot of sense. He thinks that now is a bad time for this wedding to happen.
Hiiragi Chisato: He pointed out that I am like the final pillar propping up my clan. If I marry into the Kujou Clan, that pillar is taken away. There will no longer be a voice of authority in the Hiiragi Clan, and it could be a disastrous move for my personal image, too...
Paimon: It's just two families becoming one big family though, right? What's the big deal?
Kamisato Ayato: Traditionally, in Inazuma, clan affiliation influences every facet of life.
Kamisato Ayato: After the wedding, Lady Hiiragi will belong to the Kujou Clan. The Kanjou Commission's attitude toward you may undergo some significant changes thereafter.
Hiiragi Chisato: Precisely. This is a terrible thing to be saying, but... I'm starting to have second thoughts. Maybe I went along with it all too easily. Maybe I allowed myself to be pushed into this...
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah! I'm so sorry, I can't believe I'm making my guests listen to me complaining...
Kamisato Ayato: No problem at all. The Yashiro Commission has a duty to listen to you. Now that I've heard your concerns, I should offer to help you as best I can, for instance, by helping you gather your thoughts on the matter.
Kamisato Ayato: Now. We heard from Sir Kujou that his decision to tie the knot was prompted by a letter he received from you.
Kamisato Ayato: But we've also heard that you did not write that letter. Sir Kujou thought that perhaps you were just being coy... Oh dear, perhaps I should have kept that part to myself?
Hiiragi Chisato: ...What? But that was... It was just a prop in his playful proposal, wasn't it? It was clearly purpose-designed, what with all the fancy lettering, and so on...
Kamisato Ayato: ...Fancy lettering, you say?
Kamisato Ayato: So I am to understand that had it not been for this letter, you two may not have chosen this moment to be wed?
Hiiragi Chisato: When it comes down to it... Yes, I think so... Oh, do you mean to say that this letter is not what I thought it to be?
Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou maintains that the letter was penned by your hand.
Hiiragi Chisato: Huh? But then... how did...
Kamisato Ayato: Either way, it's wonderful to see how much you both trust one another. In that sense, you could say that the origin of the letter is ultimately not of great importance.
Kamisato Ayato: Who knows, perhaps Sir Kujou was the one being coy. After all, he had no particular reason to be forthcoming with us about the details of his playful proposal.
Hiiragi Chisato: ...
Hiiragi Chisato: I understand. As you say, ultimately, the origin of the letter doesn't matter.
Hiiragi Chisato: But my position does matter. Kamaji and I thought that we needn't worry about anything that lies ahead, because we can face it all together.
Hiiragi Chisato: But now, I... I think I should give it some more thought.
Kamisato Ayato: Marriage is the most important decision of your life. Don't let yourself regret it.
Kamisato Ayato: It is also part of the Yashiro Commission's job to help people through difficult times.
Kamisato Ayato: I say this as an advocate for you personally and for the Hiiragi Clan. Please do not be compelled by circumstances to make any decision that goes against your will.
Kamisato Ayato: To be together with the one you love is a sacred thing. It is my earnest wish that both of you may enjoy a bright and beautiful future, not a bittersweet one.
Hiiragi Chisato: I'll take to heart every word you have said to me... I can't thank you enough, Sir Kamisato. I'll think very carefully about your advice.
Kamisato Ayato: All that matters is that you follow your heart. Since you'll be needing some time to think things over, we will excuse ourselves now.
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah, wait! Let me see you out...
Kamisato Ayato: Thank you, Lady Hiiragi, but there will be no need.
Kamisato Ayato: Traveler, let's find somewhere to talk.

### Additional Talk 10

Hiiragi Chisato: What should I do...
Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, Kamaji...

### Additional Talk 11

Paimon: Hiiragi Chisato is on a totally different page than Kujou Kamaji...
Paimon: Ayato, why did you give her such vague suggestions? Couldn't you just have told her what you'd do in her position? 'Cause Paimon's pretty sure you have an idea.
Kamisato Ayato: I've said everything I can, given the Yashiro Commission's stance. Interfering too much with other Commissions' domestic issues will only create trouble.
Kamisato Ayato: The more I think about it, the stranger this all seems, but Hiiragi Chisato has yet to see it. We must be vigilant.
Paimon: Strange? In what way?
Kamisato Ayato: Someone wants Hiiragi Chisato to be married as soon as possible, and if my guess is right... it is someone from within the Kanjou Commission. This person is presumably also responsible for the mysterious and misleading letter.
Kamisato Ayato: Think about this: A lowly officer is greatly worried about Hiiragi Chisato's future, while the heads of the supporting clans ostensibly have no concerns at all. It doesn't add up.
Kamisato Ayato: When someone's words and actions do not match, you need to infer their intentions from their behavior.
Traveler: So... is someone trying to get Hiiragi Chisato into trouble?
Kamisato Ayato: Yes. It's a smart strategy. Far superior to the one adopted by the Tenryou Commission's Takatsukasa Clan.
Kamisato Ayato: Even had the forged letter failed and been seen for what it was, there would have been no repercussions. They could simply have explained it away as a misguided but well-meaning matchmaking attempt by a member of the family.
Kamisato Ayato: But if the letter were to achieve its goal, as it has so far... the perpetrator would successfully weaken the Hiiragi Clan without ever having to lift a finger against them, all under the guise of simply encouraging a wedding.
Kamisato Ayato: With Hiiragi Chisato having married into the Kujou Clan and the head of the Hiiragi Clan in prison, challenges to the Hiiragi Clan's leadership would begin to emerge throughout the ranks of the Kanjou Commission... Eventually, another clan would take the Hiiragi Clan's place.
Traveler: A reasonable theory. But it's just a theory.
Kamisato Ayato: Actually, we have evidence. His name is Shinnojou.
Paimon: Shinnojou?
Kamisato Ayato: He should be back by now.
Hisashi: Yes, Sir.
Paimon: Aah! That's the second time you've done that! Paimon cannot deal with this...
Kamisato Ayato: Did they take one of the Kanjou Commission officers away?
Hisashi: Yes. His name is Shinnojou.
Kamisato Ayato: As I expected.
Kamisato Ayato: They cannot afford to let this opportunity pass them by. They have to act now, while the Hiiragi Clan is at its weakest.
Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Chisato had been persuaded by Kujou Kamaji, and the wedding was sure to go ahead.
Kamisato Ayato: But after Chisato's meeting with Shinnojou, she began to have second thoughts. In their eyes, Officer Shinnojou has interfered with their plan.
Paimon: But why did they suspect him, and not us?
Kamisato Ayato: Someone was eavesdropping on our conversation with Chisato the entire time. That's why I was a little reserved.
Paimon: *gasp* No way! Whew... lucky Paimon didn't say anything stupid.
Paimon: Ah! But Chisato got what you meant about the letter though, right?
Kamisato Ayato: I think so. But whoever is behind this will not allow their plan to fail now. They will not be inclined to respect Hiiragi Chisato's own wishes.
Kamisato Ayato: Her stance was so passive that she was easily manipulated... Treated like a pawn, with even her marriage becoming a battleground for political power play.
Kamisato Ayato: Despite all of this, she still believed that a happy future was awaiting her...
Kamisato Ayato: When she formally marries into the Kujou Clan, she will lose her title as daughter of the Hiiragi Clan, her position in the Kanjou Commission... and above all, her independence.
Paimon: Whew, marriage is such a trap...
Traveler: We've got to stop her.
Kamisato Ayato: Easier said than done... The perpetrators are manipulating everything from the shadows, letting unsuspecting pawns do their work. This is what makes their approach so smart.
Kamisato Ayato: We, meanwhile, are out in the open. If we attempt to stop this wedding from happening, we will become the villains of the story and face immense public backlash.
Paimon: Um... so what're we gonna do?
Kamisato Ayato: At this stage, if the perpetrators wish to maintain control over the situation, their only option is to come out from the shadows and bare their fangs. I will wait for that moment to arrive.
Kamisato Ayato: But first things first, we must go and rescue Shinnojou. He has done nothing wrong, and does not deserve to be punished.
Kamisato Ayato: Tell me where Shinnojou is. We'll head off right now.
Traveler: We can't let this evil plan come to fruition.
Traveler: Unfortunately, there's no evidence.
Traveler: So... is someone coveting Hiiragi Chisato's position?
