# All's Well That Ends Well


## Talk 1

Paimon: We've been fighting here for a while now.
Paimon: Paimon's starting to wonder if we should've left the ley line deposit alone... Maybe then, the monsters would have stopped coming...
Paimon: Also, Paimon still doesn't have a clue what's going on here... Shall we just go ask Diluc?
Paimon: #Yeah, c'mon, let's get back to the Dawn Winery, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's sort Diluc's letters for him.
Paimon: Well, since he said he doesn't mind, why don't we read them as we go?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa, there are so many letters here.
Paimon: It looks like Diluc read them just before he left. He must have been in a hurry...
Paimon: Adelinde asked us to put this one at the top of the pile, but how are we supposed to tell the order of the other ones?
Paimon: Guess we'll have to read them to get an idea of when they came in.
Traveler: We really shouldn't be reading other people's mail...
Paimon: That's true. In that case, let's just tidy them up a little.
Diluc: You're here? You move fast.
Paimon: Whoa! There he is!
Diluc: What are you agonizing over?
Paimon: Ms. Adelinde asked us to put these letters in a pile, and we can't tell which order they should go in...
Paimon: But it's your personal mail, so it'd be rude for us to read them without your permission.
Diluc: There's no need to be nervous.
Diluc: ...And I can see from the looks on your faces that they've grabbed your interest.
Diluc: These letters deal with events that are past and gone. I only held onto them in case any of the information they contain proves useful later down the line.
Diluc: I just dug them out to confirm a few details, I've been following some rather unique developments recently.
Diluc: You were involved in the events in question anyway. You can read them if you want to. It's not a bad thing to be curious.
Traveler: Are you in a hurry?
Diluc: ...
Traveler: You seem to be in a huge rush...
Paimon: Hey, that's a good point... Actually, you kinda smell like wild mountain fruit... Oh! Did you go to those mountains where the Valberries come from?
Diluc: Very perceptive. Yes, I did make a trip to the Stormbearer Mountains.
Diluc: I'll fill you in later.
Black Screen Text: Diluc swiftly goes upstairs...
Paimon: No fair! We still have some super important things to discuss with Diluc... not to mention a whole bunch of questions!
Traveler: Paimon, you need to calm down.
Paimon: Ugh... Alright, let's just sort these letters for him.
Paimon: Well, since he said he doesn't mind, why don't we read them as we go?
Traveler: It's been a long time since Diluc's presence last overawed you, huh.
Traveler: You don't look like you just got back from the city...
Traveler: Do you still have other business to attend to?
Traveler: Wait, let me think...
Paimon: Bad idea? Yeah, you're probably right... Okay, let's just tidy them up a little.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, Paimon's not sure what this one's about...
Paimon: #Shall we read another one, Traveler?

## Talk 5

Diluc: There, it's done.
Diluc: The ley line deposit will disappear before long.
Traveler: That battle went very smoothly.
Paimon: All thanks to the power of teamwork!
Paimon: See, even Captain Pyro needs his trusty sidekicks sometimes. It can't be Master Diluc saving the day by himself every single time. Many hands make light work!
Diluc: Sidekicks, hmm...
Diluc: It's been a long time since I last worked with others. It's not so bad.
Diluc: If the opportunity arises, let's team up again in the future.
Traveler: That battle was a lot of fun.

## Talk 6

Paimon: #Do you want to keep reading them? Or have you got the gist now, Traveler?
Traveler: Let's read one more letter.
Paimon: Okay. Remember, we're trying to figure out when each letter was written.

## Talk 7

Traveler: I'm all set.
Paimon: Alright then, let's put the letters in the right order.
Paimon: If there's one thing we can take away from these, it's that Master Diluc has had a pretty difficult past...
Paimon: Not only was he misunderstood by the Knights of Favonius, but he's faced all kinds of other obstacles, too...
Paimon: Sounds like it's tough being Captain Pyro.
Paimon: Always fighting alone, because for one reason or another, it wasn't convenient for the people around him to help out.
Traveler: But Diluc seems to have found some peace since then.
Paimon: Yeah, that's true.
Paimon: Plus, he's got us now. We can give him all the help he could ever want!
Paimon: Oh — out of friendship, of course! Definitely not just for the grape juice!
Paimon: Wait... what?
Diluc: Is there a problem?
Paimon: Master Diluc... you're wearing your old outfit again? And you've tied your hair back...
Paimon: You look so formal all of a sudden!
Diluc: "Old outfit"? You've seen it before?
Paimon: Yep, it was by that ley line anomaly... That was your past self, right?
Diluc: Huh. I'm surprised it made such an impression.
Paimon: Do you mind telling us about it? What happened back then? Why were you fighting there?
Diluc: The same reason as ever. Just stopping another Abyss Order plot.
Diluc: They launched an offensive on several fronts at once. Unfortunately for them, they were still no match for me.
Diluc: We were fighting in an area on Falcon Coast, and everything was recorded by the unusually active ley lines.
Diluc: They must have become unstable again recently, causing them to let out all kinds of information from that time. Hence why you saw what you saw.
Traveler: Why didn't you stay there to keep guard?
Diluc: For starters, you only need to deal with the monsters and the ley line deposit will stay dormant, as long as it isn't disturbed again.
Diluc: On the other hand, if I'd done nothing at all, the Knights of Favonius would have taken over straight away. Knowing how they work, they'd be sure to send a large contingent to guard the site.
Paimon: Wouldn't that have been a good thing?
Diluc: Depends. Most of the knights are away on expeditions, so they don't have a lot of people to spare.
Diluc: If the ley line anomaly was just a diversion tactic, the Abyss Order could have been poised to attack somewhere else entirely, while the knights were scrambling to send what limited forces they have to Falcon Coast.
Diluc: But anyway, I have no interest in talking to the Knights of Favonius. I prefer to get to the bottom of things myself rather than waste time negotiating with them.
Diluc: And it was easy enough for me find out the Abyss Order's plans. Take a few Abyss Mages hostage, and they soon start talking.
Diluc: As for the Knights of Favonius, I've sent someone to enlist their cooperation where it's needed.
Traveler: So this is a joint initiative between you and the Knights.
Diluc: It's their job to handle situations like this. They ought to be present when things come to a head.
Diluc: I don't like working closely with the Knights of Favonius because of our differences in philosophy, but that doesn't mean we can't watch each others' backs when it counts.
Paimon: Whoa... seems like you have even more control over things now than you used to, Diluc.
Diluc: The best way to deal with any threat is to utilize all the force at your disposal.
Diluc: Anyway, thank you for your help, Adelinde brought me up to speed with everything. In return, I have a gift for your trouble.
Paimon: Grape juice?
Paimon: The packaging is so fancy! It must be really expensive?
Diluc: This is my personal favorite grape juice, made of the highest-quality grapes. I happened to have an unopened batch, so I brought you a bottle to try.
Diluc: I didn't know you were such fans of grape juice. Next time you want some, don't bother waiting for the discount — just go down to the cellar and help yourselves.
Diluc: It's on the house.
Paimon: Woohoo! Paimon's gonna tell everyone we meet that we're VIPs at Dawn Winery!
Paimon: This one bottle must be worth at least... like, fifty thousand Mora? Hee-hee, and he gave it to us for free...!
Paimon: Thank you, Master Diluc!
Diluc: Haha... If you're free tonight, you're welcome to stay for dinner. Adelinde is already making it.
Diluc: There are, however, a few things I need to take care of before dinnertime.
Traveler: Things that involve fighting?
Diluc: Yes. Passiveness is not my style.
Diluc: Though I had my suspicions at the start, everything I've come across so far in my investigation suggests that the Abyss Order was not behind this.
Diluc: Since this arose from natural causes, it's time to wrap things up.
Paimon: #Traveler... Um, so what should we do...?
Traveler: Well, in for one Mora, in for the lot...
Paimon: Right, sure! After all, he did just give us this amazing grape juice...
Paimon: Wait, no... what was it... After all, "even when the odds of success are nine to one, you must never lower your guard."
Diluc: ...
Diluc: Well said.
Diluc: In that case, let's get going.
Paimon: Okie-Dokey, Captain Pyro! You can take it a little easier this time!
Paimon: Come on, let's go! This is the final battle, then we can put all this trouble behind us!
Traveler: We help Diluc out.
Traveler: It almost sounds like you're doing the Knights of Favonius a favor.

## Talk 8

Adelinde: Hello, Master Kae— Ahem, I mean Captain Kaeya.
Adelinde: I don't believe we were expecting you. Has something urgent come up?
Kaeya: Oh, Adelinde, don't be such a stranger, hehe.
Kaeya: The Knights of Favonius have received word of another sighting of the Darknight Hero. Now, the witness wasn't able to see where the suspect was headed, however...
Kaeya: I just have a gut feeling that he's in the Dawn Winery area.
Adelinde: Really? What can I say, Captain Kaeya... You and the Darknight Hero have never been seen in the same place at the same time, and you often show up at the Dawn Winery — just like the Darknight Hero.
Adelinde: So is it safe to say that... you are the Darknight Hero?
Kaeya: Hahaha, now that you mention it, it makes sense. I almost can't believe it — I am the legendary Darknight Hero!
Adelinde: I'm sorry, Captain Kaeya, but the Dawn Winery is having a fire safety inspection today.
Adelinde: You'll have to come back another day.
Kaeya: Seriously? Shouldn't you at least ask me to stay for dinner, as a courtesy?
Kaeya: *sigh* Then again, I do have a pile of admin work waiting for me today...
Kaeya: In that case, please pass a message on to Diluc for me. Tell him that the hazard zone has been established, the public shouldn't notice anything, and the enemy is unlikely to detect it right away.
Adelinde: Captain Kaeya, your words are as profound and enigmatic as ever. I'm just a maid, none of that means anything to me.
Adelinde: Master is currently out at a business meeting with his commercial partners. I don't know where they are exactly.
Adelinde: I will pass your message on to him word for word when he gets back, but I can't guarantee that the meaning behind the words will be fully conveyed.
Kaeya: Oh? But these are code words he grew up using. If he doesn't understand them... then perhaps it was a wasted childhood.
Kaeya: Oh, by the way, is there anything new at the Winery? While I'm here, I'd like to pick up some choice wine to take home.
Adelinde: Captain Kaeya, you are too funny. You know we don't do retail.
Adelinde: Still, thank you so much for visiting.

## Talk 9

Adelinde: Please make yourselves comfortable in the Winery.
Adelinde: And thanks again for helping with the letter.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: A Letter With Elegant Handwriting
Investigate: Dear Diluc,
Investigate: Welcome back to Mondstadt, Sir.
Investigate: It has been some time since the incident. We discovered that Eroch had betrayed us, and he has been punished severely.
Investigate: I hope that this news will put your mind at ease.
Investigate: In other news, our people have discovered that the Abyss Order has stepped up its activities between Wolvendom and Stone Gate lately.
Investigate: Also — a mysterious individual that people are calling the "Darknight Hero" has suddenly started showing up out of nowhere all around Mondstadt City. He typically acts in the dead of night, and his intentions are currently unclear.
Investigate: Please stay safe, and notify the Knights as soon as possible should you see anything suspicious. We will send support immediately.
Investigate: Whether you are presently in our ranks or not, all faithful knights will remember your contributions to the Knights of Favonius.
Investigate: May you remain in good health.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: A Neatly Written Letter
Investigate: Dear Mr. Diluc,
Investigate: It is my pleasure to investigate the ley lines alongside you.
Investigate: As you know, my focus is on alchemy, so my knowledge of the ley lines remains quite shallow, and I fear that I will only be able to share what little understanding I have.
Investigate: According to many pre-existing documents, the ley lines can be seen as a medium for storing information. Under certain circumstances, they can record activities that occur in the area around them.
Investigate: All this information goes through a recording and storage process. After a certain period of time, they may be released once again by the ley lines.
Investigate: If I may be so bold as to make a guess, there should be a method to activate the ley lines. Those who grasp such methods can control the times at which ley line information is recorded and released.
Investigate: Judging from the runic symbols and some other clues, I surmise that there are particular members of the Abyss Order who may have a very small chance of being able to achieve this.
Investigate: If you believe that this requires further investigation, these entities may serve as your point of entry.
Investigate: I wrote a paper a few years ago in which I covered my brief foray into questions concerning the flow of ley lines and other such topics. You will find a copy of this paper enclosed.
Investigate: I hope that it can help to clear up some of your doubts.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: A Letter With Rough Handwriting
Investigate: Diluc,
Investigate: Jean wrote to me lately with shocking news. If I don't miss my guess, she wrote to you too. Her sentiments are those of the Knights as a whole.
Investigate: Crepus was a good man, and I thought very well of him. It grieves me greatly to know that he met with such a fate.
Investigate: As for the defeat of the drake, the honors for that accomplishment should go to your father. I do not accept Eroch's theft of the credit for that deed, which was bought with your father's sacrifice.
Investigate: Stolen credit will not be accepted within the Knights of Favonius under any circumstances. I will not permit it.
Investigate: I have already given Jean the authority to punish Eroch with all necessary severity. The Knights will inform you of the results.
Investigate: I've heard that you've been taking some time off outdoors and may not be easy to reach, so there is no guarantee that my letter will reach you. As such, I'll stop here for now.
Investigate: If it does reach you, then I wish you good health and safety in your travels. Contact us if you need anything.
Investigate: I hope that falcon of yours will help put this letter in your hands. I mean, I don't write in person very often, you know?
Investigate: These may seem like pointless words to you right now, but remember: even the greatest of disasters must come to an end.
Investigate: Mondstadt waits for your return, and if you're willing, the Knights will always welcome you. (If you're not, forget I said anything, yeah?)

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: A Tidily Written Letter
Investigate: To the heir of the Ragnvindr Clan,
Investigate: I apologize for sending this letter without notice. You may not remember me, but we've met a few times.
Investigate: We've met near the square, when I sat at the table adjacent to yours at the Good Hunter, and I've seen you in your tavern...
Investigate: You were always busy with a great many things, especially back when you were much chattier than you are now. You spoke cheerfully and often with your brother and friends then.
Investigate: It's probably no surprise that you did not notice me then. But I've always had my eye on you, child.
Investigate: I recall with crystal clarity how my little Klee once made a complete mess of your vineyard while she was trying to catch Crystalflies there...
Investigate: But you didn't get angry. In fact, you personally escorted Klee back and even gave her a few bottles of fresh grape juice.
Investigate: Now I think that might jog your memory, yes?
Investigate: Klee recently told me that she "hasn't seen that strange man with the red hair in aaages," so I decided to look into it out of curiosity.
Investigate: My deepest condolences regarding your father.
Investigate: In many of the stories I've been told, you are the model knight: proud, driven, a knight of noble character and lineage.
Investigate: But I know that you're gentler than you appear. If you weren't, you wouldn't have treated Klee the way you did.
Investigate: And since you helped my child out, I hope you won't mind if I treat you as if you were my own.
Investigate: Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will leave the dark place that you are presently in, and that you will not wallow in grief and remorse.
Investigate: Partings are most painful things, but they also encourage us to grow. A bird that has lost the roof over its head will fly further than others of its kind.
Investigate: Go out and see the world. That's the best course of action I can envision. Only by feeling, observing, and listening can your heart be healed.
Investigate: Parents all wish that they can accompany their children forever, and the skies, seas, and stars bear witness to that oath.
Investigate: Everything that was your father now finds new life with you. That which you will experience in this world may have been things that your father experienced once upon a time.
Investigate: I hope that the wind will bring you all manner of wondrous things in your journeys to come.
Investigate: In any case, keep your chin up, young child.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: A Letter With Clear Handwriting
Investigate: Master,
Investigate: Master Kaeya took leave and stayed at Dawn Winery for a few days.
Investigate: In a rare turn of events, he decided to stay in his original bedroom. He would pace about the grounds when idle, and even asked Adelinde to make him his favorite dishes.
Investigate: Ah, it really does take me back.
Investigate: I shall be honest with you, but I was quite surprised to hear Master Kaeya say that he wanted to stay for a few days.
Investigate: We did not refuse him, however. We believe that even if you were here, you would not refuse him outright.
Investigate: Dawn Winery has always been a more quiet location, perhaps because all who stay here are rather peaceable people.
Investigate: The house is made by those who live in it, and Master Kaeya's uncommon arrival did end up livening the place up significantly.
Investigate: I hope that you are doing well in your travels abroad. Everyone here at the winery misses you.
Investigate: May you remain safe and in good health.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: A New Letter
Investigate: Dear Darknight Hero, the Knights of Favonius have stepped up the guard details throughout Mondstadt without making any major movements. The Abyss Order will not have noticed.
Investigate: I am scouting around Dragonspine. The monsters here are scattered and separated. Clearly, they haven't been assembled by the Abyss Order.
Investigate: There are no signs of enemy activity in the south of Mondstadt either.
Investigate: If you can confirm that the other locations are also free of monsters, we will be able to conclude that the Abyss Order has nothing to do with the recent ley line disorder.

### Additional Talk 7

Investigate: I recall with crystal clarity how my little Klee once made a complete mess of your vineyard while she was trying to catch Crystalflies there...
Investigate: But you didn't get angry. In fact, you personally escorted Klee back and even gave her a few bottles of fresh grape juice.
Investigate: Now I think that might jog your memory, yes?
Investigate: Klee recently told me that she "hasn't seen that strange man with the red hair in aaages," so I decided to look into it out of curiosity.
Investigate: My deepest condolences regarding your father.
Investigate: In many of the stories I've been told, you are the model knight: proud, driven, a knight of noble character and lineage.
Investigate: But I know that you're gentler than you appear. If you weren't, you wouldn't have treated Klee the way you did.
Investigate: And since you helped my child out, I hope you won't mind if I treat you as if you were my own.
Investigate: Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will leave the dark place that you are presently in, and that you will not wallow in grief and remorse.
Investigate: Partings are most painful things, but they also encourage us to grow. A bird that has lost the roof over its head will fly further than others of its kind.
Investigate: Go out and see the world. That's the best course of action I can envision. Only by feeling, observing, and listening can your heart be healed.
Investigate: Parents all wish that they can accompany their children forever, and the skies, seas, and stars bear witness to that oath.
Investigate: Everything that was your father now finds new life with you. That which you will experience in this world may have been things that your father experienced once upon a time.
Investigate: I hope that the wind will bring you all manner of wondrous things in your journeys to come.
Investigate: In any case, keep your chin up, young child.

### Additional Talk 17

Traveler: A Letter With Clear Handwriting
Investigate: Master,
Investigate: Master Kaeya took leave and stayed at Dawn Winery for a few days.
Investigate: In a rare turn of events, he decided to stay in his original bedroom. He would pace about the grounds when idle, and even asked Adelinde to make him his favorite dishes.
Investigate: Ah, it really does take me back.
Investigate: I shall be honest with you, but I was quite surprised to hear Master Kaeya say that he wanted to stay for a few days.
Investigate: We did not refuse him, however. We believe that even if you were here, you would not refuse him outright.
Investigate: Dawn Winery has always been a more quiet location, perhaps because all who stay here are rather peaceable people.
Investigate: The house is made by those who live in it, and Master Kaeya's uncommon arrival did end up livening the place up significantly.
Investigate: I hope that you are doing well in your travels abroad. Everyone here at the winery misses you.
Investigate: May you remain safe and in good health.

### Additional Talk 18

Traveler: A New Letter
Investigate: Dear Darknight Hero, the Knights of Favonius have stepped up the guard details throughout Mondstadt without making any major movements. The Abyss Order will not have noticed.
Investigate: I am scouting around Dragonspine. The monsters here are scattered and separated. Clearly, they haven't been assembled by the Abyss Order.
Investigate: There are no signs of enemy activity in the south of Mondstadt either.
Investigate: If you can confirm that the other locations are also free of monsters, we will be able to conclude that the Abyss Order has nothing to do with the recent ley line disorder.
