Xi'er: Yue cuisine?
Xi'er: One of the two major culinary traditions in Liyue, the other being Li.

Xi'er: If you do want to try it, the most authentic Yue-style cooking is at the Xinyue Kiosk in Liyue.
Xi'er: Only thing is, for both the Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, you have to book about half a year in advance...
