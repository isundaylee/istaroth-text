Traveler: About Kamisato Ayaka
Paimon: Hmmm...
Traveler: Paimon, you look so serious today.
Paimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.
Paimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...
Traveler: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.
Paimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.
Paimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.
Paimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...
Paimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!
Paimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.
Traveler: Yeah.
Paimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...
Traveler: ...I should've seen that coming...
Traveler: I'd like to go to another festival with her.
