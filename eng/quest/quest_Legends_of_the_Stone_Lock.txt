# Legends of the Stone Lock


## Talk 1

Aradashan: Oh no, the stone lock is gone!
Aradashan: Who could have broken the lock? Could it be the Big Iron Chunk?
Paimon: It's an Aranara...
Aradashan: Eh? The Golden Nara and the silver bird can see Aradashan?
Paimon: #Paimon is not a silver bird! And gold... Well, this is {NICKNAME}.
Aradashan: #Okay, Aradashan gets it. It's Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Aradashan's name is Aradashan.
Aradashan: Hmmm... You're a Golden Nara, with the same Golden hair as Nara Varuna, with the warm scent of a sun-kissed leaf...
Aradashan: #Oh, but now is not the time to make friends. The stone lock... Did you see who broke it, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!?
Paimon: The stone lock is probably what we just opened...
Traveler: We did indeed break it...
Aradashan: #No, so Nara {NICKNAME} was the one breaking the lock...? Aradashan thought the Big Iron Chunks escaped on their own!
Aradashan: The stone lock is gone! The Big Iron Chunk is coming out!
Aradashan: #You should hide, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Big Iron Chunks are big and hard, some even shoot fire out of their eyes! Very dangerous!
Paimon: Do you mean the monster trapped inside? We've dealt with it already.
Aradashan: Really? So the Big Iron Chunk was destroyed? Great news! Aradashan was about to shed leaves at the thought of them pouring out!
Aradashan: #So Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon took down the Big Iron Chunk here?
Paimon: We've taken loads of monsters like them down in the past!
Traveler: It's routine for us now.
Aradashan: #Aradashan didn't expect Nara {NICKNAME} to be so powerful. Uh, can Nara {NICKNAME} help...?
Paimon: Could it be related to the stone locks?
Aradashan: So smart, Paimon! Aradashan is somewhat a bit surprised...
Paimon: What is there to be surprised about!?
Aradashan: Hehe, yes, it is related to the stone locks.
Aradashan: #There are sixteen stone locks in total in the forest with Big Iron Chunks inside... Can {NICKNAME} defeat them?
Traveler: Of course.
Aradashan: #Oh, Nara {NICKNAME} is such a nice Nara. Aradashan thanks Nara {NICKNAME} from the bottom of Aradashan's heart!
Aradashan: Come see Aradashan once you've beaten all the Big Iron Chunks!
Aradashan: If you could beat all the Big Iron Chunks, you must also be able to...
Paimon: ?
Aradashan: #Heh, Aradashan will save that for when Nara {NICKNAME} comes back!
Traveler: If we see them.
Traveler: Have you really helped in any combat?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows just where to hide!

## Talk 2

Aradashan: #You're very powerful, Nara {NICKNAME}. We'll defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk for sure!

## Talk 3

Arayuta: Will we defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk? It is a terrible monster as told in the legends... Uhhh...

## Talk 4

Arasata: It is said the Bulky Iron Chunk has many forms and can turn into many Big Iron Chunks.
Arasata: #But it will be vulnerable once you beat any of its key parts, so watch carefully, Nara {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 5

Arasaha: I don't speak to Nara often.
Arasaha: Thank you, nice Nara.

## Talk 6

Aradashan: Whoa, Aradashan didn't think that the Bulky Iron Chunk would still be so strong after we used Ararakalari.
Aradashan: Even if our Ararakalari could defeat Big Iron Chunks, we wouldn't be able to handle the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Aradashan: #If Nara {NICKNAME} hadn't been here...
Paimon: It's okay, since the Perpetual Mechanical Array... Uh, Bulky Iron Chunk is defeated, there will be no more iron monsters in the forests!
Traveler: Yeah, you can rest assured now.
Arasaha: ...No.
Arasaha: ...Must rely on ourselves.
Arasata: #Arasaha is right. Seeing Nara {NICKNAME} fighting the Bulky Iron Chunk had us in awe.
Arayuta: There is still a long way to go before catching up with the great Aradasha.
Arayuta: We must train harder, so we can be heroes like Aradasha in the next crisis!
Aradashan: We must fight the imaginary Bulky Iron Chunk in our dream!
Paimon: Go for it!
Traveler: I know you'll get there.
Aradashan: #When you want to, Nara {NICKNAME}, just sing the Rhythm of the Great Dream like when you entered Vanarana.
Aradashan: Then you can join and share our dream of the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Paimon: Somehow that sounds more like a nightmare...
Traveler: Do you dream about fighting, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want to dream about fighting! Paimon only wants to dream about eating delicious food!
Aradashan: Aradashan will go train in dreams with Arasata, Arayuta, and Arasaha now!
Arasata: #As a sign of my gratitude, Nara {NICKNAME}, I shall remember you with the first ray of dawn.
Arayuta: #Nara {NICKNAME}, is as great as Nara Varuna!
Arasaha: ...You will not be forgotten.
Aradashan: Yes, let's meet again in the dream later!
Traveler: It's not dangerous in dreams.
Paimon: True, it's their dream, after all. The Perpetual Mechanical Array won't be real and we won't get hurt.

Traveler: Only 16? We've dealt with it.
Aradashan: #Oh! Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon are so amazing! Now Aradashan knows why the air and ground in the forest have become cleaner.
Aradashan: Wait for Aradashan! Aradashan is going to get the friends!
Traveler: Have you really helped in any combat?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows just where to hide!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Friends?
Paimon: Whoa! So many Aranara appeared out of nowhere...
Aradashan: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, these are Arasata, Arasaha, and Arayuta.
Paimon: More Aranara names! Aradashan, Arasata, Arasaha, and...
Arayuta: Arayuta! My name is Arayuta!
Paimon: Okay, Paimon's got it, Arayuta!
Arayuta: Paimon knows my name now. I'm so happy!
Arasata: Hello... I am Arasata.
Arasaha: ...Arasaha.
Traveler: Greetings.
Paimon: Aradashan, you told us to come see you after we're done with all the Big Iron Chunks... What for?
Aradashan: Oh, it goes way, way back...
Aradashan: Several hundred cycles of trees ago, the iron monsters appeared. Some were big iron Nara, some were legless big iron Nara.
Aradashan: The monsters were as tall as mountains, spewing light as bright as fire. They made the forests weep and bushes wail in the howling fire.
Paimon: You mean the Big Iron Chunks?
Aradashan: That's more or less correct...
Arayuta: Let me tell the story from that point on. I like the rest part of the story.
Arayuta: When things were at their most perilous, the great Aradasha emerged.
Arayuta: The great Aradasha defeated many, many Big Iron Chunks with Ararakalari and locked them up with stone locks.
Arayuta: Just like that, the great Aradasha restored peace to much foliage, allowing Nara and Aranara to rest in the forest at night.
Paimon: So, all the Ruin Graders and Ruin Drakes and stuff from the stone locks we unlocked were defeated and confined by Aradasha!?
Arayuta: Yeah, Aradasha was super powerful, taking on all those Big Iron Chunks like that! Aradasha stories are my favorites!
Paimon: #But if the Big Iron Chunks that Aradasha put away have been defeated by {NICKNAME}, why did you want us to come here?
Arasata: Well... Aradasha locked the Big Iron Chunks away, but even the hardest earth erodes and crumbles in time...
Arasata: Same as the stone locks. They crack and fracture until they become Valuka.
Arasata: Then the Big Iron Chunks can shrug off the stone locks to bring doom to the woods. So, we must guard the locks.
Aradashan: But it would be bad if we should miss any loose locks, so Aradashan, Arasata, Arasaha, and Arayuta must become more powerful.
Aradashan: If we could defeat them with Ararakalari like Arabalika can, we wouldn't have to worry about the stone locks turning into Valuka.
Paimon: So you wanted to beat the Big Iron Chunks yourselves...
Paimon: Uh... How did that become our problem?
Aradashan: Uh, we can't defeat the Big Iron Chunks right now, so if we released them from those stone locks just like that...
Traveler: That would indeed be very dangerous.
Aradashan: #But Nara {NICKNAME} is powerful and can defeat the Big Iron Chunks. With Nara {NICKNAME}'s help, we can beat the mighty Bulky Iron Chunk!
Paimon: So you called us here to deal with the Bulky Iron Chunk?
Aradashan: Bulky Iron Chunk is mightier than Big Iron Chunk. We could only contain it with our Ararakalari.
Aradashan: #So when Aradashan saw Nara {NICKNAME} defeat Big Iron Chunks, Aradashan thought Nara {NICKNAME} could defeat Bulky Chunk.
Aradashan: #So Aradashan would like to ask Nara {NICKNAME} for another favor...
Traveler: Whatever kind of iron chunk it is.
Aradashan: #Oh, Nara {NICKNAME} is such a nice Nara!
Arayuta: #Nara {NICKNAME} glows as bright as gold, just like Nara Varuna did in the tales!
Arasata: #Nara {NICKNAME} is so helpful, like the rain in a drought!
Arasaha: Thank you.
Paimon: But you said that the Bulky Iron Chunk is under a lake, right? So, how will we get there?
Aradashan: It's okay. We just need to lower the water level and make a passage!
Aradashan: #Please wait a while, Nara {NICKNAME}, and we'll see you in the lake.
Traveler: I'll help.
Traveler: The consequences would be unimaginable.

## Talk 9

Aradashan: #Hey, it is indeed you two, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Paimon: Yeah, we beat all the monsters that were locked up by the stones!
Aradashan: #Heh, Aradashan believed Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon could do that for sure!
Aradashan: #See, this is the Nara {NICKNAME} whom Aradashan mentioned.
Aradashan: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, these are Arasata, Arasaha, and Arayuta.
Paimon: More Aranara names! Aradashan, Arasata, Arasaha, and...
Arayuta: Arayuta! My name is Arayuta!
Paimon: Okay, Paimon's got it, Arayuta!
Arayuta: Paimon knows my name now. I'm so happy!
Arasata: Hello... I am Arasata.
Arasaha: ...Arasaha.
Traveler: Hello.

## Talk 10

Paimon: So this is the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Paimon: Since the Big Iron Chunks are Ruin Graders, Ruin Drakes, and the likes... It's no surprise that the Bulky Iron Chunk was actually a Perpetual Mechanical Array...
Arayuta: Strange. Why do you call the Bulky Iron Chunk "Perlulu Manacle Array"?
Paimon: Oh, the name will fit pretty soon... But we'll stick to calling it Bulky Iron Chunk for now.
Arayuta: Bulky Iron Chunk!
Arasata: #The Bulky Iron Chunk can fly and crash down like a meteor. Be careful, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arasaha: ...Be careful.
Aradashan: #We'll help you by using our Ararakalari, Nara {NICKNAME}!
Aradashan: Release the Bulky Iron Chunk when you're ready!
