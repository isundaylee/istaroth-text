Ulman: So, found yourself any treasure?
Traveler: I have some Iron Coins...
Ulman: Oh, do you? Hehe, I'll trade them with you for some of these beauties I've got here. What would you like?
Traveler: About treasure-seeking...
Traveler: Not yet...
Ulman: Well, it wouldn't be treasure if it was that easy to find. Take your time.
