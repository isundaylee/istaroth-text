Timaeus: Oh no. Where did I go wrong?

## Talk 3

Timaeus: A victory, just as I expected.

## Talk 4

Timaeus: How could I make such a stupid mistake...

## Talk 5

Timaeus: It's pretty much what I expected.

## Talk 6

Traveler: How's your research coming along?
Timaeus: Not too bad, although I haven't had the best of luck recently... My clock is a few minutes too slow, and thanks to that, a whole load of experiments have failed dismally...
Timaeus: It's not much use for keeping time anymore, that's for sure...
Timaeus: But after being used in so many alchemical experiments, it seems to have gained some understanding of the basic makeup and functional principles of the world... Maybe it's undergone some sort of miraculous transformation.
Timaeus: Why don't you take it? Maybe it'll come in handy in your adventures.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Sounds complicated.
Timaeus: You'll be fine, the procedure is actually very simple. If you're interested, I can show you the basics?
Timaeus: Much as one who uses a wind glider needs not understand how it was built in order to glide.
Timaeus: The process is mesmerizing to witness. I'm confident you'll be singing the praises of ancient civilizations and their ingenuity after you've tried it for yourself.

## Talk 8

Timaeus: I want to find out more about alchemy.
Timaeus: The ancient art of alchemy is simply captivating... I wish more people appreciated it.
Timaeus: Oh, you're into alchemy too?
Traveler: Very much so.
Timaeus: #Well then, boy, it's time for you to get some first-hand experience!
Timaeus: All great accomplishments start with a firm grasp of the basics and go from there.

### Talk 8 related talk 1

Timaeus: Remind me about that potion?
Timaeus: Have you finished making the Shocking Essential Oil?
Traveler: Still working on it...
Timaeus: Shocking Essential Oil is made from electro crystal and frog.
Timaeus: It shouldn't be too hard to find them when you're out and about. Gathering raw materials is a major part of the alchemist's work, you'll just have to get used to it.
Timaeus: When you've found them, try making some Shocking Essential Oil and show me how it turns out.

### Talk 8 related talk 4

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: Nice work! This is some genuine bona fide Shocking Essential Oil alright. It helps people channel Electro energy more easily.
Timaeus: Now, let me tell you what happens if you swap the frog for butterfly wings!
Timaeus: It produces a powerful Insulation Potion, which protects the taker against electroshocking.
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same electro crystal can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Go on, take this Insulation Potion and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!

### Talk 8 related talk 5

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: Wow, that's a mighty fine batch of Frosting Essential Oil you've made! Rub some of this on you to get more in touch with your Cryo side...
Timaeus: But guess what happens if you swap out the lizard tail and use crystal core instead?
Timaeus: Boom! You got yourself a Frostshield Potion, which protects you against the harmful effects of too much playing in the snow, amongst other things!
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same mist flower corolla can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Here's a Frostshield Potion for you. Now, go and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!

### Talk 8 related talk 6

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: That sure smells like Flaming Essential Oil alright! And you can really feel the heat too.
Timaeus: Did you know that there is a similar recipe using butterfly wings instead of a frog?
Timaeus: Voilà! You have yourself a Heatshield Potion. If you're ever rescuing a baby from a burning building, this little thing will make sure you don't even break a sweat.
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same flaming flower stamen can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Take this Heatshield Potion and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!

Timaeus: (Test) I've got all the ingredients.
Timaeus: (Test) Excellent! Now, let's add a few of these, a touch of this, mix it all up... and I have no idea what will happen.
Timaeus: (Test) Aha, it's finished! Take it, see if you can find out what it does. I have no idea — but that's the exciting thing about alchemy!

### Talk 8 related talk 12

Traveler: Who are you?
Timaeus: I am Timaeus, an alchemy scholar. You may not have heard my name before...
Timaeus: But I bet you'll have heard the names Albedo and Sucrose before.
Timaeus: Albedo is nothing short of a genius in the field of alchemy. And his assistant, Sucrose, is extremely talented for her age.
Timaeus: I'm a total amateur compared to them.
Traveler: About Albedo...
Timaeus: Albedo is an alchemy prodigy. A lot of people call him the Kreideprinz. He's the top alchemical talent in Mondstadt.
Timaeus: They say he's an outlander who just showed up in Mondstadt one day and was instantly taken on as Chief Alchemist by the Knights of Favonius. He's also Captain of the Investigation Team.
Timaeus: His alchemical theory is refreshingly unbridled in comparison to conventional theories. In practice it all works out too.
Timaeus: In his eyes, my work must seem like child's play... *sigh*
Traveler: About Sucrose...
Timaeus: Sucrose is Albedo's only assistant. She's so lucky to have gained Albedo's appreciation.
Timaeus: As a born and bred child of Mondstadt, we should all be proud of Sucrose's contributions to alchemy.
Timaeus: But her research and interests are a little... antiquated, to the point that they rarely render any practical application.
Timaeus: *sigh* If I had access to such a plethora of resources, who knows what I could accomplish.

### Talk 8 related talk 13

Traveler: Alchemy?
Timaeus: Alchemy is a craft that has been passed down since ancient times, but it is barely understood in the present.
Timaeus: Its mechanisms are magical and mysterious, completely unlike the principles that shape our understanding of the physical world.
Timaeus: If I can get the hang of it, I should be able to create some pretty awesome stuff, and contribute to our knowledge of ancient civilization.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Timaeus: Bye then, I'll carry on with my research.
