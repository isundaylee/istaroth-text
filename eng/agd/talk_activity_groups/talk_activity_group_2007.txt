# Talk Activity Group: 2007

## Talk

Smiley Yanxiao: I might not have won this iteration of Masterful Chefs, but I definitely learned a lot from the competition itself!
Smiley Yanxiao: I was just planning to invent a few new dishes for the Moonchase Festival and maybe learn a few things from Chef Xiangling, but I sure learned quite a few unexpected things, too!
Smiley Yanxiao: ...Actually, what are you doing, just sauntering on into the kitchen again?

## Talk

Jiangxue: Ah, so Yanxiao came in second this year. A shame, but also not a bad thing.
Jiangxue: Cooking is much like martial arts. One can only improve when rivals to compete with.
Jiangxue: I'll bet that he's cooking up some new recipes as we speak. Well, I sure hope I'll get to try some of it.

## Talk

Huai'an: Hello! I am Huai'an, innkeeper of the Wangshu Inn.
Huai'an: Our inn is a fine vantage spot for moon-viewing. The view from the top floor is excellent, with obstructed views of the moon and of the surrounding scenery alike.

## Talk

Verr Goldet: Hello! Oh! Well, you certainly are a returning customer. Welcome back.
Verr Goldet: You've come at a good time: the Moonchase Festival is the best time for viewing the moon and enjoying gourmet food, and Wangshu Inn has plenty of both.

## Talk

Madame Ping: Oh, child, it's you! The Moonchase Festival is a most lively time here in Liyue, so feel free to walk around and see the sights.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Stove God...
Madame Ping: Well, now you know that the Moonchase Festival was instituted by Rex Lapis as a way of remember that friend of ours.
Madame Ping: You call him Guoba nowadays, do you not? Hehe, I suppose it was destiny that led Xiangling to rename the God of the Stove for a dish they both enjoyed.
Madame Ping: Take him around Liyue Harbor — you and Xiangling both — a little more, would you?
Madame Ping: I'm sure he would be gladdened to see Liyue Harbor as populous as it presently is.

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Hello there, youngster. Here to enjoy the Moonchase Festival?
Uncle Tian: Back in the day, we would eat Wangxiao Cakes, drink Laurel Wine, and gather together with family and friends to share our hopes for the future.
Uncle Tian: Nowadays, the number dishes to be had has grown and grown, and we aren't quite as particular as we once were — we simply eat whatever we wish.
Uncle Tian: Take the opportunity to try some more of Liyue's delicacies, eh?

## Talk

Chef Mao: Here for the Wanmin Restaurant experience? Hi, I'm Chef Mao. Everyone in Chihu Rock will have heard of me.
Chef Mao: My name might not be the most famous around, but my daughter Xiangling is the champion of this year's Masterful Chefs. Now hers is a name I'm sure everyone's heard of!
Chef Mao: Haha! That's my dear girl alright, our very own culinary genius. Her future is very bright indeed!

## Talk

Geri: The Moonchase Festival is here, and with it, the Masterful Chefs tournament. All the Liyue locals are getting fired up about good food again, it seems.
Geri: Should I take this chance to try a few more Liyue dishes? Oh, but the food here is just...

## Talk

Freki: *sigh* It's the Moonchase Festival, and the food here's only getting better... But my brother is still as weak as ever...
Freki: I've heard that this iteration of Masterful Chefs has seen quite a few new dishes come to light. You know what? I'm just going to drag him off to try them all one by one!
Freki: I'm pumped to try something different form the usual fare. After all, they're just... you know, there.

## Talk

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want the moon!
Manager Kuan: Hey, aren't each of your requests becoming less reasonable than the last? Also, for the last time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Nope. Also, my requests are not that unreasonable.
Yiran: Isn't the Moonchase Festival all about chasing the moon? If you can get it for me, Manager Kuan, then no one will have to chase it.
Yiran: That would make you everyone's hero, Manager Kuan!
Manager Kuan: I'm not some hero, I'm just Kuan... No, wait, I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Well, if you're my Daddy, and then you can fulfill my wishes, right? I'll study hard, and you'll get me the moon. That's fair, right?
Manager Kuan: I don't think this is a question of fairness. It's more that... I can't get the moon in the first place.
Yiran: *sigh* Then until you get the moon, you're not a hero, you're Manager Kuan.

## Talk

Yicheng: Hello there! *LOUD RUMBLING* Happy *RUMBLE* Moonchase Festival...
Yicheng: Eat more at the *RUMBLE* Masterful Chefs...

## Talk

Huihui: C'mon, Li Cuisine was clearly the superior tradition this time at Masterful Chefs!
Hao: Oh sure, that sounds like something only Li lovers would say!
Huihui: Well, why don't you just accept that there's nothing redeemable about Yue Cuisine? Did you see that boiled fish dish in the qualifiers? Made that judge's face turn green just from tasting it! You could smell the rank flavor of soil from a mile away...
Hao: W—Well, it's not like Li Cuisine fared any better. I heard that one of the judges failed to show up at the finals because they got a tummy ache from tasting some Li Cuisine during the semi-finals!
Huihui: Nonsense! A tummy ache's got nothing to do with the dish's taste. Li Cuisine is just superior!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!

## Talk

Linlang: Welcoming the bright moonlight to illuminate the adeptal path — what a romantic scene!
Linlang: I should really start collecting some antiques related to the festival...

## Talk

Vlad: It's festival time here in Liyue again. Thanks for accepting my invitation to view the moon together...
Vlad: I'd originally planned to invite you to some famous restaurant, but I didn't think that they'd been fully booked ages ago...
Nadia: It's alright. I've heard that the theme of this festival is gourmet food. It's not all that surprising that there were no tables left.
Vlad: Eh? I—Is that so... So that's why I couldn't book any seats...
Vlad: Looks like my lack of understanding about Liyue was to blame. I'm sorry...
Nadia: Eh? Oh, no, you don't have to apologize...
Nadia: Just being able to relax and watch the bright moon together is good enough for me.
Nadia: Don't you think the moon at this time is brighter and rounder than usual?
Vlad: Oh, is it? ...No, I mean... You're right. It truly is very beautiful.

## Talk

Changchang: The Moonchase Festival is here, and Daddy still isn't back...
Changchang: The latest Masterful Chefs was super exciting. I've started learning how to cook, too!
Changchang: Once Daddy gets back, I'll make him something nice for sure.

## Talk

Nervous An: *sigh* And here I was thinking that I'd be able to take a break during the festival...
Nervous An: Instead, I've been working overtime due to the large increase in the demand for cooking ingredients...
Nervous An: Well, what can I say? I guess everyone here just loves to eat.

## Talk

Huixin: Hello, welcome to the Moonchase Festival here in Liyue.
Huixin: The theme of this year's Moonchase Festival is gourmet food, and this iteration of Masterful Chefs is being organized by the Liyue Qixing themselves. With all the great chefs taking part, this is one show you don't want to miss!
Huixin: I hope that everyone will have a good time during the festival. Of course, if you do have civil affairs at hand, please direct your concerns to the Ministry.

## Talk

Musheng: Haha! It was the right call to come here during the festival. You just can't beat the festive cheer here in the city!
Musheng: I've heard that the Moonchase Festival used to be celebrated for very different reasons in the past. Something about the adepti's rituals, I believe.
Musheng: But I don't think that what it's about now — gathering together and admiring the moon — is half bad, either!
Musheng: I'm sure that the adepti, too, would be gladdened to see everyone enjoying themselves.

## Talk

Zhang Shun: Have you heard the news? Captain Beidou of the Crux brought something amazing back from overseas again!
Zhang Shun: They say that it's the statue of an ancient adeptus... Or a god... Well, whatever it is, it's a really awesome statue!
Zhang Shun: Well, it's the Crux Fleet, you know? Anything they're packing is bound to be good. Well then. Would you like something today, friend?

## Talk

Ivanovich: The Moonchase Festival really is a busy time. Looking at all the locals running about preparing food, I can't help but be tempted to try my hand at it myself.
Ivanovich: Do you think some Snezhnayan fare and some grilled pies and such would sell well?

## Talk

Traveler: About the Moonchase Festival...
Madame Ping: The meaning of the Festival in ages past was quite different. It was about the ancients of Liyue seeking the adeptal path.
Madame Ping: Nowadays, it's more about admiring the moon, eating, and enjoying our time together with one another.
Madame Ping: The meaning of festivals will shift with time, and some traditions will be forgotten. However, everyone's hopes for the future will remain the same, no matter what the day or age.
