# The Chi of Yore


## Talk 1

Hastily-Written Notes: "Day 4: No progress. No idea why the boss is so obsessed with this place."
Hastily-Written Notes: "Day 7: Boss says she's had an idea, but so far it mostly seems to involve her waiting by the ruin... Don't ask me what for, because there's a great big Ruin Hunter guarding it, so there's no way she's getting in. Not quite sure how this counts as progress."

## Talk 3

Incomplete Writing: "...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the <color=#00E1FFFF>north</color>, its bones were pinned in the <color=#00E1FFFF>south-east</color>, its flesh was incarcerated in the <color=#00E1FFFF>north-west</color>, its soul was fettered in the <color=#00E1FFFF>north-east</color>, and its form was crushed in the <color=#00E1FFFF>south-west</color>..."

## Talk 4

Incomplete Writing: "...Its bones pierced, its spirit faded, its form and soul both decimated... still did its flesh survive..."
Incomplete Writing: Here stands this statue, to <color=#00E1FFFF>watch in each direction</color>: the <color=#00E1FFFF>wind-swept ruin</color>, the <color=#00E1FFFF>snow-capped peak</color>, the <color=#00E1FFFF>adepti's abode</color>, and the <color=#00E1FFFF>city of Liyue</color>...

## Talk 5

Yan'er: Agh, what terrible luck...
Traveler: What happened?
Yan'er: Oh, Traveler. You've come at the right time. I was just doing some, uh, research.
Yan'er: You know the name of this place, right? Qingce Village?
Yan'er: So, how do I say this... Do you understand what "Qingce" means?
Traveler: Understand... what?
Yan'er: Well, its origin and hidden meaning, of course. Should have known you weren't the cultured sort...
Yan'er: Do you know about the Chi? According to legend, the Chi was a dragon-like monster that once forcibly occupied this place.
Yan'er: When Rex Lapis — or Morax — defeated it, the Chi's body twisted into rock, its blood turned into water, and its scales became the terraced fields.
Yan'er: And in times long past, the word "Chi" also used to mean "Qingce."
Yan'er: And, through my long, earnest and rigorous research...
Yan'er: I believe that the Chi's corpse may still be on this mountain.
Traveler: That logic didn't add up...
Yan'er: Hmph, don't be so dismissive. Haven't you noticed the giant trees growing in this area? Don't you think that they're a lot larger and sturdier than elsewhere?
Yan'er: The locals call these Blood-Fed Trees. They believe that these trees grew by absorbing the Chi's blood, and that the area where they grew are the Chi's Eyes.
Yan'er: And indeed, the growth of these trees is abnormal.
Yan'er: Even if it were not truly the corpse of that monster, there must be something incredible underground...
Yan'er: Of course! How could I give up on something so... researchable?
Yan'er: I say that, but the truth is that I don't have a lot of leads.
Yan'er: It is, after all, an antediluvian legend. It's likely that barely anyone even remembers the legend anymore.
Yan'er: After all the effort I put into finding these ruins, thinking that I might be able to find something in here...
Yan'er: ...It turned out that there's a <color=#00E1FFFF>Ruin Hunter</color> standing guard inside. That's why I said that my luck was terrible.
Yan'er: I'd really like to go in and have a look, but it's far too dangerous. I'll probably wait until it leaves before giving this a go.
Yan'er: Are you looking to go inside and explore, by any chance? Not that I'd stop you, no, but...
Yan'er: Please be mindful of your safety. This might be the clue to some treasure, but it's just a legend in the end. Don't pay it too much mind.
Traveler: And what would the corpse be used for?
Yan'er: Uses? For a monster's corpse? Do you even have any idea...
Yan'er: Ahem! Do you even know how valuable it is for research?
Traveler: This is your research?
Traveler: It's pretty unique.
Yan'er: That's it? "It's pretty unique"? So uncultured...

## Talk 6

Yan'er: This way, I can... Whoa! Y—You're still here?
Yan'er: I'm going to rest for a while, and then... then I'll be going.
Yan'er: Take care of yourself now, and don't push yourself too much. For all we know, it really is just a legend.

## Talk 7

Granny Ruoxin: I have this fragment...
Granny Ruoxin: A fragment of...? Found something curious, have you? Let me see...
Granny Ruoxin: Heh... No wonder you can't make head or tail of it. This isn't writing on here — it's a drawing.
Granny Ruoxin: Long, long ago, before writing was invented, people recorded events with pictures.
Granny Ruoxin: Look, this symbol here depicts the Chi — a legendary beast. It looks like the full symbol must have been very large and complex, this is only part of it. But it's enough for me to recognize it by.
Granny Ruoxin: My guess is that this depicts the battle between the Geo Lord and the Chi. But it's hard to be more specific from just this one piece.
Traveler: If you had all the pieces, could you make sense of it?
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, I don't know about that. No guarantee.
Granny Ruoxin: But what I can guarantee is that without all the pieces, I certainly can't make sense of it.
Traveler: Watch me, I'll find the rest in no time.
Granny Ruoxin: Hehe... So much enthusiasm. I like that about young people.
Granny Ruoxin: Given what this fragment is showing, I'd say that if you really want to find the other fragments, here's what you should do...
Granny Ruoxin: According to the legend of the Geo Lord and the Chi, the battle took place at a <color=#00E1FFFF>great height</color>. So you could try your luck on the mountaintops around here.
Granny Ruoxin: Beyond that, there are many traces of the battle in this area. <color=#00E1FFFF>Ruins</color> would be a sensible place to look.
Granny Ruoxin: In every conflict there is a losing side. The legend tells that after defeating the Chi, the Geo Lord instructed our forebears to erect <color=#00E1FFFF>Geo Statues</color> to crush the Chi's remaining power.
Granny Ruoxin: I'd guess you would have a higher chance of finding things to do with the Chi in places with lots of <color=#00E1FFFF>Geo Statues</color>.
Granny Ruoxin: For example, there are many <color=#00E1FFFF>Geo Statues</color> erected <color=#00E1FFFF>west</color> of Qingce Village. It's said that's the very spot where the Geo Lord crushed the Chi... Maybe you'll strike lucky over that way.
Granny Ruoxin: Once you've found all the fragments, bring them to me. I'll be waiting right here.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh, so that's it? But we found nothing...
Paimon: Let have another look, just to be sure. We've come this far... we gotta have something to show for it!
Paimon: Those Treasure Hoarders look real scary. Paimon remembers that Qingce Village is nearby...
Paimon: Let's go there, find someone and tell them about this. It's best that they be on guard.
Paimon: We won't let these bad guys get their way!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow... Paimon can't make any sense of this at all.
Paimon: Paimon can't tell if it's supposed to be a drawing, or writing, or... some other kind of thing.
Paimon: Maybe the locals will have an idea.
Paimon: Let's ask around in Qingce Village.

## Talk 10

Paimon: That makes three fragments we've found. And it looks like they match up...
Paimon: So we just need to put them together, and... Nope. Still makes no sense to Paimon.
Paimon: Guess we do need to ask the locals after all, huh...

## Talk 11

Paimon: ...So that's it? Aw, but what about our monster corpse? And our treasure?
Paimon: Surely a place this big can't be completely empty? And think of all the effort we've put into this...
Paimon: Hmm... Shall we give it another once-over, just to be sure?

## Talk 12

Traveler: I have some fragments...
Granny Ruoxin: Let's see now... Why, these fragments all fit together.
Granny Ruoxin: See here, this is the symbol for a Chi, and this Chi was defeated in a major battle.
Granny Ruoxin: Afterward, it was pinned down in a deep place.
Traveler: What's a Chi?
Granny Ruoxin: In the legends, the Chi was a dragon-like monster, and Mt. Qingce was once its lair.
Granny Ruoxin: When Rex Lapis — or Morax — defeated it, the Chi's body twisted into rock, its blood turned into water, and its scales became the terraced fields.
Granny Ruoxin: Do you see those sturdy trees near Qingce Village? Those are Blood-Fed Trees, said to have been nourished by the blood of the Chi.
Granny Ruoxin: But a legend is a legend. After all, who would be able to find traces of the Chi today?
Traveler: What happened after that?
Granny Ruoxin: After that... in order to seal the corpse of the Chi and prevent it from endangering the world again, water was used to seal its corpse, and treasures were used to pin it in the center of the vault...
Granny Ruoxin: Hmm, the rest of it is illegible.
Traveler: Does the Chi's corpse still exist?
Granny Ruoxin: I'm afraid that other than Rex Lapis, no one else knows the answer to that question.
Granny Ruoxin: So, young one, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?
Granny Ruoxin: Well, it's not a bad thing for a young person to bumble around a bit.
Granny Ruoxin: But if you really want to pursue your search according to the content of these fragments, then I say that the place you're looking for must have something to do with <color=#00E1FFFF>water</color>.
Granny Ruoxin: Not only that, but it must also be <color=#00E1FFFF>water</color> whose <color=#00E1FFFF>entrance</color> can be blocked.
Traveler: Is it... a waterfall?
Granny Ruoxin: Let me think... Come to think of it, there is a sizable waterfall northwest of Qingce Village. I wonder if it has something to do with that vault...
Granny Ruoxin: Well, that's all I know. As for the rest, you'll have to mull it over yourself.
Traveler: Is it a pool...?
Traveler: Vaults... Treasure!
Granny Ruoxin: Haha, young one... you can't resist the thought of treasure, can you?
Granny Ruoxin: So, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?

## Talk 13

The Hidden Gate of Qingce: (The stone gates are tightly shut, and there are three strange grooves on its surface. Perhaps they are the key to opening the gate...)

## Talk 14

Granny Ruoxin: You're back. So, did you find anything?
Traveler: Not a thing.
Granny Ruoxin: Hahaha. It's alright, not to worry, there is nothing wrong with a bit of extra running around while you're young enough to handle it.
Granny Ruoxin: Here, these are for you. You've been out and about all day. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
Granny Ruoxin: So there was nothing inside... That's good, that's good...
Traveler: We found a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders outside.
Granny Ruoxin: Treasure Hoarders? Did you chase them off?
Granny Ruoxin: Those low-down, no-good crooks, always skulking about. They're so annoying. It's high time someone taught them a lesson.
Granny Ruoxin: And there was... nothing inside? Hahaha, no matter, no matter at all. there is nothing wrong with a bit of extra running around while you're young enough to handle it.
Granny Ruoxin: Here, these are for you. You've been out and about all day. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
Granny Ruoxin: So there was nothing inside... That's good, that's good...

## Talk 15

Paimon: The people of Qingce are really friendly. Hehe, guess we didn't come all this way for nothing.
Paimon: Still, don't you feel like that granny was too happy about all this?
Paimon: How can Paimon put this... Is kicking the Treasure Hoarders out something to be that happy about?

## Talk 16

Paimon: These three lines are so hard to read... But they did mention that "three Chi Trees were used to subdue it..."
Paimon: Chi Trees... Um, are they referring to <color=#00E1FFFF>some sort of tree</color>?
Paimon: Let's look around, and look out for <color=#00E1FFFF>trees</color>. Who knows, we might find some clues!

## Talk 17

Granny Ruoxin: Missing text (681002768)

## Talk 18

Granny Ruoxin: The Chi remains a shadow that haunts us. To think that someone would have designs on its corpse!
Granny Ruoxin: ...Well, I can only hope that it's just that bunch of two-bit crooks. But if there truly is something down there...
Granny Ruoxin: ...Ah, Geo Lord, protect us...

## Talk 19

Paimon: So after all that running around, we still didn't find anything.
Paimon: The Chi, the treasure, it's all just a legend!
Paimon: Still, it's weird. Why did the village chief granny seem so happy about that?

## Talk 20

Granny Ruoxin: Hello, and welcome to Qingce Village.
Traveler: How do you do?
Granny Ruoxin: You found a hidden chamber behind a waterfall?
Granny Ruoxin: What did you find inside?
Traveler: Nothing special...
Granny Ruoxin: Nothing special, you say... That's good, that's good... best there be nothing special...
Granny Ruoxin: Haha, look at you two, covered in dust from head to toe... I'm sure you two had quite the unpleasant adventure in there too.
Granny Ruoxin: Here, take these. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
Traveler: Um, we didn't do that much...
Paimon: That's right, Granny, we didn't do anything at all!
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, listen to yourselves. Didn't you help us chase those Treasure Hoarders away from our village?
Granny Ruoxin: Allow me to give these to you as a token of appreciation, on behalf of everyone in Qingce Village.
Traveler: We don't take payment if the work's not done...
Traveler: We found a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders outside.
Granny Ruoxin: Treasure Hoarders? Did you chase them off?
Granny Ruoxin: Those low-down, no-good crooks, always skulking about. They're so annoying. It's high time someone taught them a lesson.
Granny Ruoxin: So there was nothing special inside, you say? That's good, that's good... best there be nothing special...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ruins Investigation Log: "...studies show that these ruins date back to very ancient times indeed; they are older than the collective age of all the elderly residents of Qingce Village put together."
Ruins Investigation Log: "In other words, we find these ruins to be entirely generic, indistinguishable in substance from other ruins."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Yet despite their generic nature, the majority of these ruins contain treasure. Though driven out by the Ruin Hunters here, the allure of the treasure contained within will be sure to see the Treasure Hoarders return."
Ruins Investigation Log: "According to Chang the Ninth, who lives on the mountain, there was once an old town below. Once it was destroyed there was... what was it... something that was sealed away underground. Something to do with some kind of golden stone..."
Ruins Investigation Log: "But he's a destitute scholar who loves citing the classics and going off on tangents. Added to the fact that I drank a lot with him to get the conversation going, I can't remember what he said very clearly. I think the crux of it was that it had something to do with some golden stone and Ruin Hunters... That old man really can drink a lot."
Ruins Investigation Log: "The heavy drinking and the bitterly cold wind have left my head feeling like it's been bashed about by a bunch of hilichurls."
Ruins Investigation Log: "Actually now I think about it... Maybe I really did get attacked by hilichurls on my way down the mountain last night? I can't remember for sure... My head sure does hurt though. Better get myself to a doctor in Liyue Harbor before thinking any more about these ruins."

### Additional Talk 2

Incomplete Writing: "With the evil serpent gone from Qingce, the magic formula that subdued it was no longer in effect. ..."
Incomplete Writing: "...But the serpent did not perish, and its foul blood congealed within the earth and formed stone, poisoning the world..."
Incomplete Writing: "...Thus three statues were used to subdue it..."
Paimon: ...Just three lines and Paimon's head is hurting. Why are all Liyue's stories written like this?
Paimon: But anyway, that bit that goes <color=#00E1FFFF>"foul blood something something formed stone"</color>... does that mean there's <color=#00E1FFFF>strange stone</color> around here?
Paimon: Let's take a look around at the <color=#00E1FFFF>stones</color> around here and see if we can find some leads.

### Additional Talk 3

Master Lu: Take a look at this fragment?
Master Lu: Fragment? What fragment, is it from some toy that was broken?
Master Lu: I have never encountered a fragment of this kind before.
Master Lu: Perhaps you should ask the village chief. Perhaps she might know something.

### Additional Talk 4

Little Zuo: Can you read this fragment?
Little Zuo: A fragment? Hmm... No, I can't read it.
Little Zuo: As a matter of fact, I've never seen one in my life.
Little Zuo: You should go ask Granny Ruoxin, she might know something about it.

### Additional Talk 5

Zhi: Know anything about this fragment?
Zhi: A fragment? Let me see... I'm sorry, I've never seen anything like this.
Zhi: But I think Granny Ruoxin might know. You should go ask her.

### Additional Talk 6

Little Xing: Excuse me, know anything about fragments?
Little Xing: Fragments? Mm... I don't know.
Little Xing: You should go ask Granny Ruoxin, she might know.

### Additional Talk 7

Little Liu: Look at this fragment!
Little Liu: Ah! You scared me! ...What fragment?
Little Liu: What is it? ...You don't know? Go ask Granny Ruoxin, she knows everything.

### Additional Talk 8

Little You: What do you make of this fragment?
Little You: A fragment? Uh...
Little You: Lemme see... Wow. I have no idea. I've never seen one of these before.
Little You: Why don't you go ask Granny Ruoxin?

### Additional Talk 9

Pops Kai: I have this fragment...
Pops Kai: A fragment, you say? Show me.
Pops Kai: This writing... or maybe it's not writing at all. I can't read it, anyway.
Pops Kai: Ask the village chief, she's gotta know something.

### Additional Talk 10

Granny Ruoxin: ...This is something I never expected to see.
Granny Ruoxin: Well, if it's what fate has decreed...
Traveler: Remind me about the fragments?
Granny Ruoxin: Forgotten already? Well, I do have a habit of rambling on and on I suppose...
Granny Ruoxin: If you're looking for fragments connected to the great war, you may have more luck searching in <color=#00E1FFFF>high-altitude</color> places.
Granny Ruoxin: Also, you should head <color=#00E1FFFF>west</color> and take a close look nearby the <color=#00E1FFFF>Geo Statues</color>.
Granny Ruoxin: Finally, it can't hurt to check the <color=#00E1FFFF>ruins</color> in this area.
Traveler: What makes you so sure?
Granny Ruoxin: Hahaha... I never said I was sure, now, did I?
Granny Ruoxin: Let's just say that at my age, you sometimes find yourself remembering things that most people have forgotten.
Granny Ruoxin: When I was a child, everybody knew the tale of the Geo Lord suppressing the Chi.
Granny Ruoxin: But some people would say that even the Geo Lord himself couldn't wipe out the Chi completely, and so Geo Statues were used to press it down, slowly crushing it to death over time.
Granny Ruoxin: Haha. But of course, it's just an old story. If there was really a chance the Chi is still alive, we would hardly feel safe living here in Qingce Village.
