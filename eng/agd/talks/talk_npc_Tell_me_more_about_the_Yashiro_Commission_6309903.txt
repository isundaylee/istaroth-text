Traveler: Tell me more about the Yashiro Commission.
Hirotatsu: Oh? Do you have business with the Commissioner?
Hirotatsu: He is very busy. The various affairs at the Yashiro Commission have all but tied his hands, and he still has to deal with the other two Commissions...
Hirotatsu: My master and I have been taken good care of by the Commissioner before, so I will try my best to help him out.
Hirotatsu: Though all I can do now is be a good guard... Therefore, I will protect the mansion and Miss Kamisato with my life to repay the Commissioner!
