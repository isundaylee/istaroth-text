## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Vind: For the majority to live a life of peace, a minority of people must make great sacrifices. My family belong to this minority.
Vind: But this we have known since the day that we received orders from Lady Vennessa herself.
Vind: ...Have you heard of Barbatos Ratatouille? It is said to have been one of the dishes served at the feast held in celebration after Vennessa defeated the old aristocracy.
Vind: My forebears had the honor of dining with Vennessa that day. After the feast, an accomplished chef was invited to taste the dish and infer the recipe.
Vind: The taste is like the gentle caress of the breeze on your cheeks, and you can almost feel the peace and freedom given by Barbatos welling up inside your heart... That dish has kept our family going over the centuries as we watch out for storms, day in, day out.
Vind: ...Thank you for listening to me. In fact, here, please have the recipe. It's my pleasure to share the joy of this wonderful dish with you.

## Talk

Traveler: The past?
Vind: As you can see, looking out from the watchtower, the seas around Mondstadt are calm and peaceful.
Vind: Since those days went by, Lord Barbatos has been protecting Mondstadt. There have been no storms ever since.
Vind: Even our family has not seen a true storm for many generations.

## Talk

Traveler: So why do you still keep watch here?
Vind: Maybe it's because every beacon longs for its time to shine.
Vind: Even if I knew for certain that there would never be a single storm again, once in a while my mind would be drawn to the stories they used to tell in my father's generation...
Vind: The way our ancestors would defiantly blow the horn in the middle of a raging storm, sending a warning signal to all in Mondstadt...
Vind: And when I came back out of my reverie... I would find that I had walked all the way here, without realizing.

## Talk

Vind: Could it be that you share my interest in storms?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Vind: It's so rare to find a traveler passing through a remote out-of-the-way place like this.
Vind: I'm Vind, devoted follower of Lord Barbatos.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Vind: My family was given an order by Lady Vennessa. We are to keep watch here, looking out over the sea for any sign of an oncoming storm.
Vind: For generations, everyone in my family has felt honored to have this duty.
Vind: We see it as our life's purpose to be signal beacons for Mondstadt, ready to spread the message to every corner of Mondstadt at the first sign of a storm.
Vind: But... That's all in the past, now.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
