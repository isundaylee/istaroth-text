# Missing title (3967490503)


## Talk 1

Canotila: I see: The flames on the throne have been extinguished, and the burnt ashes have once again turned into trees.
Canotila: Flowers bloom with your every step, bringing change to an otherwise inevitable decay in the future.
Traveler: Canotila?
Canotila: #Huh? it's {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}! What brings you here?
Canotila: Um, right! The golden butterfly has returned. I need to go and see it! Goodbye!

## Talk 2

Canotila: *sob*
Traveler: Canotila...
Canotila: #Huh? {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}... Who are you? I thought no one could get in here besides me.
Canotila: Wait, how do you know my name?
Traveler: We know each other.
Canotila: Liar! You must be just like those monsters...
Traveler: (Lie) Serene sent me to find you.
Canotila: Oh... Always making her worry like this, I'm such a bad child...
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}. Do you still remember me?
Canotila: #Right, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}... I remember now... Even though you're a giant monster who could swallow the world in one gulp, you are very kind.
Traveler: Heh, how rude.
Canotila: I'm sorry.
Traveler: What's happened?
Canotila: I saw a few people, but then they slowly melted and turned into monsters...
Canotila: Uh... That's kinda scary.
Traveler: Thank you.

## Talk 3

Canotila: Since memories can be made into a book, if we reverse that logic, the contents of the book can also be written directly into memories...
Traveler: Canotila?
Canotila: #Ah, it's you, the strange {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}. What is it? Do you need something from me?
Traveler: What were you talking about...
Canotila: Hmm. No matter how I think about this, converting memories into a book is quite an incredible deed...
Canotila: The creator of this book must've only been able to do this because they viewed the emotions in their memo{RUBY#[D]delusions}ries as the most precious thing in the world.
Canotila: That doesn't change how difficult it is to read, though...
Canotila: ...And I'm not sure what kind of impact it will have on its readers. This is quite...

## Talk 4

Canotila: ...
Traveler: Canotila?
Canotila: Huh? You're finally back! Don't disappear like that, don't you know how worrying it is? Just imagine what would happen if you never returned...
Canotila: Do you have any idea how long you were inside? It felt like the waiting would never end... Even the other Melusines had no idea how to help!
Traveler: (It seems like I've been here for quite a while, then.)
Traveler: Well, I've got to go.
Canotila: #What? {NICKNAME}, where are you going...
Traveler: Don't worry. I'll come back once I find you, Canotila.
Traveler: Just wait for me a little longer, okay?
Traveler: I know that saying this to you won't change much.
Traveler: But still, trust me.
Canotila: #{NICKNAME}...
Traveler: Don't worry.
