Traveler: About Heart's Desire
Paimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...
Traveler: Are you sleepwalking?
Paimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from "Heart's Desire" actually exists!
Traveler: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist...
Paimon: A Slime Creator!
Traveler: Does such a thing even exist?
Traveler: What would you like to buy, Paimon?
