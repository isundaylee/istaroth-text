Mischievous Aranara: You found me? Aranara thought it was a good hiding spot... If Aranara went into the dirt, then Nara would be at a total loss, right?
Mischievous Aranara: Ah! If Nara doesn't find Aranara and just walks away... Then for how long does Aranara have to lie in the dirt? No, that's not acceptable at all!
