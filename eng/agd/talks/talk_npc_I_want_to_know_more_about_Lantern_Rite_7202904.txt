# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I want to know more about Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Ooh, if this your first Lantern Rite, I could be your guide?
Traveler: What is the Mingxiao Lantern for?
Huixin: Long, long ago, the heroes and the people joined forces to protect the land of Liyue.
Huixin: Since peace was restored, the tradition of everyone coming together to build a giant floating lantern has been observed as a way of keeping that spirit of unity alive.
Huixin: Everyone who can collects materials, donates what they can spare, and helps with the construction work. And on the final night of the festival, the whole city watches as the lantern is released into the air. It's the tradition most integral to Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Do you see the huge stone in the middle of the lantern? It's the largest Plaustrite unearthed this year.
Huixin: How big the Mingxiao Lantern is depends on the size of the biggest Plaustrite from the preceding year. This year is special, because it has the biggest chunk of Plaustrite found in twenty years.
Huixin: In honor of the great heroes who died to protect Liyue, the Mingxiao Lantern's design is always based on the adeptus form of one of the heroes.
Huixin: This year's Mingxiao Lantern depicts the adeptus form of Skybracer. The Yuehai Pavilion chose the theme based on popular demand.
Traveler: What's the Xiao Market?
Huixin: To put it simply, it's one of the attractions for visitors to the festival.
Huixin: A substantial portion of the funding for the Mingxiao Lantern comes from vendors at the market.
Huixin: So although Liyue Harbor's business people can sometimes seem a little tight-fisted, when it comes down to it they're all good people.
Huixin: While everyone's out for the festival, why not talk them, get to know them a bit?
