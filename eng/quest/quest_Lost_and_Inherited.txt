# Lost and Inherited


## Talk 1

Navia: Hey there, Ludivine? How's business lately?
Ludivine: Ah, the Demoiselle of Spina di Rosula! I must say, your generous patronage is the one thing keeping me from going bankrupt.
Colter: Haha, nonsense, we all know what a talented businesswoman you are. Oh, and don't forget, she's the Boss now.
Ludivine: My mistake, my mistake. I just got so used to calling her Demoiselle.
Ludivine: Are you here for the uniform?
Navia: Yup. I forgot to drop by earlier when I was running errands around here.
Ludivine: Haha, I didn't expect Demoiselle to come and pick it up in person. It's just a uniform, after all. Any of your folks could have come instead.
Paimon: Navia's always liked to take even small things seriously!
Navia: Hey, that's not the only reason I'm here! We mostly just needed a walk to clear our heads.
Navia: There are few things more uplifting than taking the first step on a new journey.
Colter: Haha, Boss has got a point. Going on a trip with friends is always better than staying cooped up at home.
Ludivine: Very well... Please wait here while I retrieve the uniform for you.
Paimon: Uh, can someone remind Paimon again why Adele wants to join the Spina?
Navia: Hehe, she hasn't given me any concrete reasons. All she says is that she really looks up to me.
Navia: After we cleared her father's name, she became a lot more cheerful and outgoing. It's probably because she now knows for sure that her father was never a bad person.
Navia: She said she used to be terrified of Papa, so as a result, she found all the rest of the Spina super scary as well.
Navia: But the Spina is very different now. She mustered up the courage to talk to me, and felt like I could really understand her.
Traveler: The two of you have contended with similar circumstances.
Navia: Yeah, you could say that. By uncovering the truth about the case, I was able to give her closure at the same time.
Navia: She said that she wanted to become someone like me — someone who could lend a hand to others, instead of standing still and waiting for others to help her.
Colter: From the sound of it, she'll be a wonderful addition to the Spina.
Navia: I think so too, but for now, let's focus on giving her a great atmosphere to grow and thrive. She can commit to us once she's older, and can really make that decision for herself.
Traveler: (So I wasn't just hearing things.)
Paimon: Is something up, Traveler?
Traveler: Follow me.
Paimon: Huh? T—Tailing? Paimon's coming!
Navia: I'll go check it out too! Colter, please hold on to this for me!
Colter: A—Alright!
Traveler: Someone's tailing us.

## Talk 2

Martinat: Tch. We knew you were going to be difficult.
Navia: Huh. Seems like if we want them to talk, we're gonna need to teach them a lesson first.
Martinat: Brothers, there's no need to skulk in the dark anymore! Let's take them out!

## Talk 3

Navia: Now talk. Who are you, and why were you tailing us?
Martinat: ...
Paimon: Don't think we'll let you off easy if you keep silent!
Traveler: Recognize your situation, and don't entertain any fantasies of escape.
Martinat: ...!
Colter: How did it go, Boss? Are any of you hurt?
Navia: Heh, if you thought they stood any chance against us, you were sorely mistaken.
Navia: Anyway, stop playing tough and start talking. There won't be any room for negotiation once the Maison Gardiennage gets involved.
Martinat: We... were looking to get vengeance on Spina di Rosula.
Martinat: We were discovered, and can't beat you in a fight... We admit it, we lost.
Navia: Get revenge? Wait... You're not Romeuf's followers, are you?
Martinat: You actually know that name...?
Martinat: But if you do, then surely, you should understand why we hate you so much!
Traveler: I would advise you to calm down.
Colter: Indeed. You haven't got the faintest hope of winning right now.
Martinat: Tch...
Martinat: We were out drinking when we saw Navia. We got so angry, we decided to follow you guys and look for an opportunity to really mess up your day.
Martinat: Too bad you guys messed up ours first.
Traveler: You're lying.
Martinat: Huh...?
Traveler: You followed us all the way here.
Martinat: You're pretty sharp, but so what? We didn't do anything, and now it should be pretty obvious that we can't do anything to you anyway.
Martinat: Seeing you like that just really ticked us off, and we let the drink go to our heads.
Navia: Listen, Callas is long dead. No matter what happened in the past, I want to be able to start things anew.
Navia: I am the current President of Spina di Rosula. If your boss wants to talk with me, I'd be happy to meet with him.
Navia: I won't press charges for your attack. That should also help demonstrate my sincerity.
Martinat: ...I understand, thank you. I'll let our Boss know.
Navia: But if you so much as think about pulling something like this again, I won't be so lenient next time. Understood?
Martinat: Alright, we get it. C'mon, let's go.
Paimon: Uh, are you sure it's okay to just let them go like that, Navia?
Navia: I don't want to inherit my father's grudges, too. Moreover, when it comes to the aquabus, I don't think what my father did was entirely correct, either.
Navia: If the other side is willing to talk, I'm happy to open the door for a reconciliation. Opportunities for new beginnings are all around us.
Colter: I support Boss' decision as well. The concept of "an eye for an eye" is a primitive practice that has no place in today's Spina di Rosula.
Navia: Yes. Plus, we already know that they're strapped for cash. If their financial situation is that dire, they don't have what it takes to challenge us, so this may be the best time to talk.
Navia: I still think we should keep an eye out for Romeuf's folks, though. If he decides to ignore the warning I gave his men...
Navia: Then we could still have a fight on our hands.
Paimon: Yeah, those guys definitely didn't look like big fans of yours.
Colter: I'd rather things not go that far, since... Though we haven't talked to each other for years, once upon a time, we were all a part of the Spina di Rosula family.
Navia: Yep, that's how I feel as well. Anyway, now that we've sent them packing, we don't have to worry about those guys anymore.
Navia: It's getting late already, so why don't we stay the night in the Fleuve Cendre? We can head back to Poisson tomorrow.
Navia: I'll also ask someone to write Florent a letter and inform him of everything that happened here today, so he can increase security around Poisson, and be on guard against any suspicious individuals.
Paimon: Do we have to stay in the Fleuve Cendre again? Even the pillows there smell like seaweed...
Navia: Sorry, that's just what happens when you live near water and don't get much sunlight. Poisson's pretty much the same, though, so I've long since gotten used to it.
Navia: We can still go out in the evening for some grilled fish and drinks, though. Bet you there'll be people singing sea shanties too! How does that sound?
Paimon: Huh, that does sound pretty cool! Okay, Paimon's on board now. Let's go, Paimon wants to sing, too!
Traveler: There's more to this.
Traveler: We've got people up above and down below as well.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Coming back here, it really does feel like this place is starting to grow on Paimon.
Paimon: If you think about it, it would be kind of weird if the Spina's base at the Court was some super luxurious building like the Palais Mermonia.
Navia: Hahaha, totally! Right on the money, Paimon.
Navia: Although of course, with the continued growth of the Spina, Papa wanted Poisson to eventually grow into a metropolis not unlike the Court.
Navia: He was a very ambitious man who rarely looked behind or beneath him. For better or worse, that always made him stand out from the crowd.
Colter: And that's also why people hated him just as much as they loved him.
Navia: Alright, why don't you wait for me at the restaurant? I'll go do some prep, and I'll get someone to tidy up your room while I'm at it.
Navia: You can use the same room as last time. You still remember the room number, yeah?
Paimon: Yep yep! Kinda hard to forget when there are only so many rooms here after all.
Navia: Oho, did I just hear someone taking a dig at Fleuve Cendre? I'll tell my guys to stuff your pillows full of actual seaweed right now!
Paimon: Paimon's sorry! Please have mercy, Navia! If you do that, then Paimon really won't be able to sleep at all!
Navia: Hahaha, I was just kidding. Be on your way, now.

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: You enjoy a fantastic meal as well as a wonderful performance. The boisterous night begins to slip away before you know it.
Black Screen Text: As things slowly die down, you return to your room with Paimon, but you soon hear a knock at the door...
Navia: Hello? Are you asleep yet?
Traveler: Navia?
Navia: No, not at all. I just figured that since we don't get to enjoy nights like these very often, we should try to enjoy it to the fullest.
Navia: Wanna go fishing? I've got some rods and lures ready.
Paimon: Oh, so that's the "prep" you were talking about! Sure, we'll come!
Navia: Hehe, hopefully I didn't wake you or anything.
Traveler: You're good.
Navia: Don't worry, you don't have to do any actual fishing if you're too tired.
Navia: Just think of it as keeping me company. How does that sound?
Navia: Okay, let's go. To the fishing spot!
Traveler: Since the invitation is coming from you...
Navia: Hehe, I knew it, you really are my best partner!
Traveler: Did something happen?

## Talk 6

Paimon: How can you call this fishing when you're using a fully automatic rod!?
Navia: Hmm? What's the problem? Lots of people in Poisson use rods like these.
Paimon: But... But shouldn't fishing be all about... You know, attentively watching the float, and then excitedly reeling in the catch when you've finally hooked something?
Navia: #Well, that's one way to enjoy fishing! What do you think, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I like Paimon's method. Manual all the way.
Traveler: Automation is more efficient.
Navia: Then let's try regular rods next time. We can have a real fishing competition!
Navia: Haha, that's how I feel as well. To me, I'm happy as long as I catch some fish.
Paimon: Honestly, Paimon's mainly shocked at how much energy you still have at this hour. Usually, by this time of night, it's a struggle for Paimon to even keep her eyes open!
Navia: Eh, it might just be something that runs in my family.
Paimon: That's a thing?
Navia: Hehe, I'm sure you'd just get even sleepier if I delved more deeply into it. Anyway, I was just thinking about how grateful I am to my mother, as well as the rest of the Spina.
Traveler: Your mother?
Navia: My father always had a lot of unrealistic expectations for me, but the more that he tried to get me to become like him, the less I wanted to listen to what he had to say.
Navia: My mother never had those kinds of expectations, though. I've heard that she had only one wish for me, which was that I would have a happy and secure childhood.
Navia: All the members of the Spina greatly respected her wish, so no matter what I did as a child, they were happy to humor me.
Navia: Can you imagine? Whenever my father wanted to scold me for something I'd done, everyone would form up into two rows, and just stand silently and listen to him rant. Melus and Silver were always there, too.
Navia: No matter what Papa yelled, nobody else would say a word. Eventually, Papa must have recognized scolding me over trivial matters was pointless, because he eventually stopped getting on my case so often.
Paimon: Paimon would've never guessed...
Navia: Yeah... looking back on it now as an adult, I can hardly believe how patient and kind everyone was.
Navia: When I was young, I often thought that I could do whatever I wanted, because there'd always be someone there to clean up after me.
Navia: But once, I saw Melus come back wounded. He wouldn't tell me how he'd been injured, but I could tell that it had something to do with me.
Navia: I learned then that there's always a cost to making a mistake. The more you care about those around you, the more you should care about doing the right thing to the best of your abilities.
Navia: Because if you do falter, there will inevitably come a time when you'll have to face the consequences. And when that time comes, those most precious to you really will throw themselves in front of you, and pay the price for your mistakes...
Traveler: Navia...
Traveler: It must still be really hard for you.
Navia: Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have brought that up. I wasn't planning to talk about sad things tonight.
Navia: Basically, I was just saying that the nurturing atmosphere of the Spina must have been my mother's legacy, rather than my father's.
Navia: And if that's the only way that I can continue to feel her love, then I'd like to pass that warmth on.
Paimon: Is that why you let those guys go today?
Navia: Mhm, although maybe there's a part of not wanting to repeat the mistakes of the past. I want to be reasonable, at least.
Navia: #Hey, {NICKNAME}, look! I think you've got something on the line!
Paimon: But why isn't the rod automatically reeling it in?
Navia: There must be something wrong with how I installed the mechanism. It was my first time putting one of those rods together!
Navia: We can't let it get away! C'mon, you two, let's catch it!
Paimon: Y—You want Paimon to help too!?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): After some time, you finally manage to reel in the prize catch together.
Paimon: You... You didn't attach a hook to your line!?

## Talk 7

Martinat: Stop wasting time. The Boss ain't gonna wait all day.
Martinat: We'll go ahead with the operation tomorrow. Do with that information as you wish.
Navia: Heh, well your rod was missing a part too, so... I guess that makes it fair.
Paimon: Well, if we're just talking about the number of missing parts, sure... *yawn* Ugh, never mind, Paimon really can't keep her eyes open anymore.
Navia: Hahaha, alright, go to bed! I had a great time today.
Traveler: See you tomorrow, Navia.
Navia: Mhm, see you tomorrow!
Navia: So, how was last night? Did you get a good night's sleep?
Paimon: Paimon dreamt that she danced with the sea stars... So you could say it was stellar, get it?
Navia: ...
Traveler: ...And just where did you get that from...?
Colter: Haha, I didn't know you had such a great sense of humor.
Paimon: See, this guy gets it!
Navia: Anyway, let's head out. I'll arrange for a boat to take us back to Poisson. I'm sure Adele will be happy to see you two again.
Paimon: Paimon hopes she'll really appreciate your gift!
Navia: I hope so too.
