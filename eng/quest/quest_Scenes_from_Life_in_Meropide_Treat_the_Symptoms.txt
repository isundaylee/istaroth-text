# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Treat the Symptoms


## Talk 1

Lechlade: I feel so weak... Must be those blasted yellow-green stones again...

## Talk 2

Lechlade: Something's definitely wrong with those yellow-green stones... I think I'm going to die here.
Paimon: Um, are you alright?
Lechlade: In the long run, we'll all be "fine," but I'm going to be "fine" before you are.
Traveler: Okay then, sure. Bye.
Paimon: Wait a minute, this guy doesn't sound fine at all!
Lechlade: No, I'm fine, literally. If something's wrong, it's too late anyway...
Traveler: So are you alright or not?
Paimon: Paimon's very confused. Can you please be more specific?
Lechlade: Specifically speaking, when I come to the production zone, I get headaches and heart palpitations, and my hands and feet grow cold!
Lechlade: I'm done for! Do you know what I mean? I'm done for!
Lechlade: It must be the yellow-green stones! They're evil! You know of those stones, right? The Central Laboratory of the Fontaine Research Institute...
Lechlade: The yellow-green stones destroyed everything!
Traveler: Please just go see a doctor.
Lechlade: I am a doctor! I know! Wait, I'm no longer a doctor. I lost my certification, and I can't give official diagnoses...
Lechlade: Please find a real doctor with certifications to save me! Please!
Paimon: #This sounds pretty serious. Let's go find a doctor, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Why don't you rest up in the infirmary?
Traveler: That's certainly a new way to use the word "fine."
Paimon: You don't sound fine at all.

## Talk 3

Arderne: Are you in trouble? Or are others in trouble? You both look healthy, so it must be the latter.
Paimon: Indeed...
Black Screen Text: You explain Lechlade's situation.
Arderne: Him again, huh?
Traveler: Can you treat him?
Arderne: His headache? Or his delusions?
Paimon: Huh? You mean he's not that sick?
Arderne: Based on his lab results, most likely not.
Arderne: I heard that he misdiagnosed a patient when he was still on the outside, ignoring some early warning results, and healthcare outcome... Well, he's been a little paranoid ever since.
Arderne: He's like that to others, and worse when it comes to himself.
Traveler: How about the yellow-green stones?
Arderne: No one else is having those same health issues, right?
Arderne: But I can't very well ignore him, so please, give him this.
Paimon: Isn't this Pure Water? Are you sure?
Arderne: Oh, so you know what this is. It's fine in the sense that it does no harm to the body, and it'll give him a boost.
Traveler: So he doesn't know?
Arderne: As far as I know, he stays away from these drinks. But I gave it to him before, telling him it was a health potion, and he did actually show more vigor after drinking it.
Paimon: Alright, we'll give this to him. If it doesn't work...
Arderne: Then tell him to go lie down in the infirmary. If you tell him it's "doctor's orders," he'll listen.
Paimon: #Sure. Let's go back, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Why not just give him Fonta?
Arderne: That's the thing. Everyone here knows what Fonta tastes like.
Arderne: But based on my knowledge, he hasn't had Pure Water. After all, it's not very common here.
Arderne: I gave it to him before, telling him it was a health potion, and he did actually show more vigor after drinking it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're back. The doctor gave you this.
Black Screen Text: Lechlade takes the Pure Water and drinks all of it immediately.
Lechlade: Ah, me, that's better! Vigor fills me once again!
Traveler: That's it!?
Paimon: Wasn't that a little too fast?
Lechlade: Arderne is a really good doctor, and certified, too! The medicine he prescribes always works. Unlike mine...
Paimon: But what about the yellow-green stones?
Lechlade: Suspicious, of course!
Paimon: Ugh, guess his delusions can't be helped.
Lechlade: Now I can keep working! Thank you so much for helping out. Here, take these Coupons — just a little something to show my appreciation.
Lechlade: Stay healthy!
Traveler: I don't think you were sick at all.
Lechlade: No, no, I was sick — but you brought me the cure!
