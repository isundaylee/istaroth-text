Traveler: Shikanoin Heizou's Message
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Itto, I've received your invitation letter. Everyone's happy for you.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): We believe that you've got a good head for event planning. If you work a little harder, I'm sure you'll stop having to report to us all the time.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): So please, take these Lavender Melons with compliments from the Police Station.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Oh, yes. Madam Kujou Sara also wishes us to pass this message along on her behalf: "The Tenryou Commission is watching you. Do not forget that."

Traveler: Message from "TCG Buddy Ayato"
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): I was delighted to hear that you were holding another festival, Itto. As such, I have commissioned a set of audio equipment as a congratulatory gift.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Also, I have recently heard the children of Hanamizaka saying, "Ayato of the South, Itto of the North." Could you enlighten me as to what that means?

### Talk 1 related talk 2

Traveler: Thoma's Message
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Hey, Itto, this is your second time organizing this sort of musical event, right? Haha, didn't think you'd move the stage to Watatsumi Island — opposite Sangonomiya Shrine, no less. Very cool!
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): I asked our Clan Head, and it was agreed that we dispatch a team from Komore Teahouse to help liven up the atmosphere.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): They'll provide tourists with free tea. What do you think? Pretty sweet, eh?
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Don't worry about it, you're welcome. I'm happy as long as you are!

Traveler: Yoimiya's Message
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Ah, sorry, my bad! I actually received your letter quite a while ago, but choosing the fireworks proved kinda tricky, and I wasn't familiar with the route, so there were some delays.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): That said, when I got here, I thought everything was going great! The atmosphere's electric, the scenery's beautiful... Ah, I'm going to have a good, long look around.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): I hope the fireworks will fit in well with your gang's rock 'n' roll festival!

### Talk 1 related talk 4

Traveler: Message from "Ramen Buddy"
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): Well, well, Sir Arataki, I didn't think you'd remember little old me, your ramen buddy. I've since spent many nights considering how I might express my thanks.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): See that standing sign over there? Yes, that's right, it's your beloved Ms. Hina. It was a last-minute decision, and I spent quite a hefty sum on this one.
Observe Sign-In Board ("Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"): You wouldn't disappoint me by not placing it in the most conspicuous of locations, such that Ms. Hina might be put on full display to the people of Watatsumi Island in all her glory, would you?

## Talk 2

Yae Miko: There you are, little one. I knew I'd find you here.
Traveler: Oh, it's Miko.
Yae Miko: ...That's all you have to say? After all this time apart? How devastating.
Yae Miko: To think of all the times that I've sat down beneath the Sacred Sakura, praying for your wellbeing on your travels...
Yae Miko: But I think I understand. Another wise and beautiful soul has stolen your heart, haven't they? I'm sure you cast aside the omamori I gave you long ago.
Yae Miko: Alas, I am but another fleeting passerby on your journey... Oh, woe is me...
Traveler: I see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Paimon: #You can always count on Miko to tease Traveler relentlessly.
Yae Miko: #Well, it's not my fault that he's the most appealing little Fortune Slip in the world. If I didn't indulge my curiosity by taking a peek inside, goodness knows how I'd sleep at night.
Yae Miko: Though I must say, another interesting Fortune Slip caught my attention recently. I believe you've heard of it too.
Yae Miko: This "Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"... Something to do with a dog, apparently.
Yae Miko: My first thought was... I wonder if it could be the Boss of Komore Teahouse, Taroumaru.
Paimon: ...Taroumaru!? Yeah, he might actually have what it takes! Hmm, you think he was the one rescuing animals during the war?
Yae Miko: Sounds likely, doesn't it? Boss of a teahouse by day, changes outfit after work, then runs to a warzone to save lives... And what a fascinating character it would make for a light novel.
Yae Miko: But the question is... Do we think he was only saving animals?
Traveler: Are you saying you know something?
Yae Miko: I'm just speculating, little one. You know how much I like to let my imagination run wild.
Yae Miko: I look forward to opening up this Fortune Slip. Who knows what might be written inside?
Traveler: Nonsense, how could I ever forget the amazing Yae Miko!

Letter With Elegant Handwriting: (This letter is elegantly written, and has been signed "Shikanoin Heizou.")

### Talk 10 related talk 0

Traveler: Read the letter
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I asked some Ritou residents, but none of them have heard of that which you call "ninken" on the battlefield.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: The sheer lack of information quite surpassed my expectations. This is quite strange, even for information that has not yet spread widely.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I will continue searching for clues.

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: Read the second letter
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I tried a different approach today, which unexpectedly yielded some relevant information.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: During the war, the International Trade Association had an organization registered with it that specialized in pet treatment and trade known as the "Puppy Union."
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Its symbol just happens to be a dog wearing a bamboo hat. Not that this proves anything alone, but I found two other suspicious things:
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: 1. After the war, the Puppy Union very quickly canceled its registration.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: 2. The Puppy Union's event funding went through at least six layers of transfers, quite suspicious...
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I will continue investigating.

### Talk 10 related talk 2

Traveler: Read the third letter
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Well, well, wasn't this quite the day?
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I tried to investigate the people who had dealings with this Puppy Union as much as I could, and I found two main, hidden sources of funding.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: One is the Foreign Trade Association. In fact, the Union could be considered a subsidiary of the former.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: You may not be aware of the particulars regarding said Union, but they are closely connected to Sangonomiya.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: The second source is more interesting still. You'd never guess, but it's Komore Teahouse, and of course... the Yashiro Commission isn't far behind the curtain.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: A fascinating turn of events, no? Sangonomiya and the Yashiro Commission... I wonder what your little secret is?
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I have my guesses, but I'll need more evidence to prove it — details of deals regarding pets.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: We should have records of such things at the Police Station. I'll get in touch with Yoriki Owada.

### Talk 24 related talk 0

Traveler: What kind of creative cuisine is that?
Tomoki: Dango Milk that's been marinated in rock, and macerated in roll — Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk! Here, have one on me.
Traveler: It's just regular Dango Milk, right?
Tomoki: I wouldn't go that far! At least, it might have been to begin with, but not after hearing all that rock 'n' roll that I made it listen to.
Tomoki: That's also why it now tastes like regular Dango Milk that's been lying around for a while.
Tomoki: But this way, some customers are even willing to pay double the price of regular Dango Milk just to get their hands on this stuff.
Tomoki: Must be the power of rock 'n' roll, eh? It's so mind-blowing that I can't even put it into words.

Langqing: #Is that you, Traveler? Oh my! I've heard so much about you from Fangfang.
Traveler: You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
Langqing: Ah, right! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Langqing. Fangfang is Wanwen Bookhouse's Jifang. She's my wife, you see. She was the one who told me about this event.
Langqing: I don't know much about rock 'n' roll, but Fangfang says that we should support the latest cultural trends, so here I am.
Langqing: I brought some free cultural products as well. They got snapped up in a heartbeat! Ah, if only I'd known, I'd have brought more.
Langqing: She also asked me to thank you for the invitation. Had she not been so busy, she would have come down here herself, I'm sure of it.
Langqing: I hope you'll enjoy yourself here too.
Traveler: See you.
Langqing: Indeed. See you around.

## Talk 26

Langqing: #Hey! That final performance was really something. Did you see it too, Traveler?

### Talk 26 related talk 0

Traveler: I thought there was room for improvement.
Langqing: That it does, but that's normal. I mean, even books like "How Mora is Made" aren't universally acclaimed.
Langqing: Just pick the books you enjoy reading, and listen to your favorite music.

### Talk 26 related talk 1

Traveler: I thought it went pretty well.
Langqing: I have to agree! I didn't think that rock 'n' roll of this kind existed, it's even different from the sort Fangfang and I heard in Fontaine. I'd love to collect some literature adjacent to the matter.
Langqing: Don't forget to drop by Wanwen Bookhouse more often if you've got the time.

### Talk 26 related talk 2

Traveler: I think it's great.
Langqing: You like it that much? There's something I need to give you then, haha.
Langqing: I already gave out all the cultural souvenirs I brought before, and I feel bad for not holding one back for you... so it looks like this is my chance.
Langqing: That Fontainian musician — you know, the one that carries a guitar around — said it was alright for me to record the final version of his lyrics and sell them on as music merchandise.
Langqing: Here, please take it. It's nothing valuable, but if you like it you can keep it as a souvenir.

### Talk 26 related talk 3

Xingxi: Oh? Really? Well, there is this one tune... What say I hum it for you, and you play it for me in turn?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Xingxi: Thanks for your trouble.

### Talk 32 related talk 1

Traveler: How was that?
Xingxi: Ah, now that brings back memories! It reminds me of how when I was young, I would wake up very early to attend calligraphy classes at my teacher's place. It was so early that it was still dark outside, and it was terribly frightening.
Xingxi: Fortunately, I would pass by the house of an old granny, and I could often hear this song drifting out from her home. It would give me a sense of peace.
Xingxi: That dear old lady probably isn't with us anymore, but I've also grown, and I'm no longer as afraid of the dark, haha...
Xingxi: In any case, I've given it some serious consideration, and while I'd love to agree, it's going to be tough finding someone to watch a time-honored store like ours on such short notice.
Xingxi: So let me recommend someone else to you who might attend instead — Xigu Antiques's boss, Linlang.
Xingxi: She doesn't even open in the daytime, and you can either find her sleeping or wandering the streets — I reckon she'd have the free time to help.
Xingxi: Regardless, thank you so much for letting me hear that song again. I hope your musical venture goes well!

Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.

Linlang: I see... Well, I do have something in mind. I'll hum, and you play. How does that sound?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Linlang: I'm listening.

## Talk 37

Traveler: How was that?
Linlang: My dear guest, it would be no exaggeration to compare your performance to an adeptal hymn.
Linlang: When I was just starting in this line of work, I went to Minlin to purchase some ancient jade. On the way there, I heard music coming from Qingyun Peak.
Linlang: I was so enraptured that I wondered if it might be the music of the adepti themselves, you know? Haha. Thank you — I thought I'd never get the opportunity to hear it again.
Linlang: As for the music festival, I must say that I wouldn't call myself any kind of music enthusiast — I simply happen to like this tune. So forgive me if I must decline.
Linlang: But allow me to let slip from my lips this tidbit of gossip: I believe Mingxing Jewelry's boss, Xingxi, is a closet fan of music. Perhaps you could ask her?
Linlang: Last but not least, I wish you the best of luck with your festival.

## Talk 39

Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Jifang: A music festival, you say? You know, I actually met my husband because of a song. Quite the coincidence, eh?
Paimon: Ooh! Which song was it? Bet we can play it for you — we're super serious about music!
Jifang: Oh, in that case, could you play it if I were to hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Jifang: Haha, how exciting!

## Talk 40

Traveler: How was that?
Jifang: What a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. I was immediately reminded of my studies in Fontaine.
Jifang: I would often go to cafes in Vasari Passage to read, and when I heard this song one day, I asked the barista what it was called.
Jifang: They didn't know, but a large fellow having some cake nearby told me that it was named "Le Souvenir avec le crepuscule." And yeah, later on, he became my husband.
Jifang: He was at the cafe meeting with his friends from a literary club back then. Ah, how nostalgic. We were all so young!
Jifang: Oh, right! Your music festival... I fear I shan't be able to attend, but if needed, I can get my husband to go.
Jifang: He's been fiddling with some old books that haven't been selling well all day, and I haven't been able to dissuade him from doing so.
Jifang: But I'm sure such cultural exchanges would interest him. I'll ask him to bring some souvenirs along that he can give out to boot.

Paimon: This one's taking place in Inazuma, Marjorie, and it's a serious musical exchange! If you've got any tunes you like, we can play it for you right here and now.
Marjorie: Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't remember this one's name, but could you play it if I were to just hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Marjorie: Oh, that'd be grand!

## Talk 43

Traveler: How was that?
Marjorie: This tune is so gentle, just the way I remember it.
Marjorie: My dad used to play this one for me on his harmonica while we were on the way back from Springvale.
Marjorie: He said that this tune represented Springvale itself, and that's where Dad's dad grew up.
Marjorie: Shame that my grandfather would pass before I was ever born.
Marjorie: Thanks for playing that music. You know what? I've decided that I should spend a bit more time with my dad. He's an adventurer, so he tends to spend time out in the field.
Marjorie: So, if you don't mind, I might have to give this festival a pass, but if there's another opportunity, I'll come — and drag him along as well!

Flora: Well... I do have something in mind. Its name escapes me, but I can hum the tune, at least. Will that do?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Flora: Nice, woohoo!

## Talk 46

Traveler: How was that?
Flora: Ooh, you're great! This is even better than when Mr. Sayid plays it! He performed this one for us last Windblume Festival, saying that it was a traditional song from Sumeru.
Flora: Donna said it sounded terrible compared to Master Diluc's playing, though.
Flora: Well, I've made up my mind. The flowers need care every day, and Inazuma's pretty far away, so I'm afraid I can't go.
Flora: Thanks for the music, though. It was lovely. On that note, I'll offer you a special price if you need flowers for your festival!

Charles: A song I like, you say? Hmm... I do remember Head Housemaid Adelinde hosting several small family concerts at Dawn Winery.
Charles: They played a song at those gatherings that I do quite like. I'll do my best to hum it for you. Mind playing the song after that?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Charles: In that case, do excuse my amateurishness...

### Talk 47 related talk 1

Traveler: How was that?
Charles: Very impressive. In fact, I should recommend to Adelinde that you be commissioned to play at the next such family event.
Charles: As for your invitation... To be honest, I was just about ready to agree the moment you finished your performance.
Charles: But I'm not sure if I'd want to ask Master Diluc for a day off over something this trivial — after all, he'd agree without hesitation.
Charles: How about this, then? I'll send you a token of support for your festival. Will that do?
Traveler: So you'll be sending us several crates of wine?
Charles: Haha, I doubt everyone who'll be attending the festival will be of drinking age.
Charles: As such, I'll give you some decorative banners instead. We've got them stocked in the winery warehouse — and I believe they'll come in quite handy.
