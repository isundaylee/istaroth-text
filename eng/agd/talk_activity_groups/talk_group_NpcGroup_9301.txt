Amber: What do you think we'll find if we go further in? I'm excited to see.
Amber: I know, everyone needs to rest after the last battle... But I'm an Outrider. I'm not used to standing around waiting.
Amber: Make sure you don't forget to call me when you're ready to leave!

Amber: You know that magical bird I told you about? The one I spent three days hunting? I still wear the feather I took as a trophy on my waist.
Amber: There's nothing like finally defeating your enemy after a long, hard battle. It's like biting into a delicious steak when you're starving hungry!
Amber: So, whatever happens â€” don't give up!

Amber: I've had times when I wished that one day, I'd wake up to find Baron Bunny had come to life and could talk.
Amber: Y'know, like Oz, Fischl's raven. They get to go adventuring together, and can even split up on missions when they need to.
Amber: Still, Baron Bunny's already a huge help. Besides, if I want to become the best outrider ever, it's me I gotta focus on!
