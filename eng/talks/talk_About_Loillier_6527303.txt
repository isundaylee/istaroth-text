Traveler: About Loillier...
Chaussivert: I specifically went looking for him later, but the scoundrel had already made off with everything. The house was totally empty, not even a piece of paper left behind.
Chaussivert: Hmph... Greedy yet cowardly. He wouldn't dare do anything to me, not unless he had a powerful patron.
Chaussivert: A pity I can't find him now, or I'd show him my special kind of hospitality.
