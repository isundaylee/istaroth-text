Traveler: Don't sneak into the mountains by yourself. It's dangerous.
Little Mao: I know. Uncle Luo and Grandpa Lu always say that too, but... Hehe, they can't keep an eye on me all the time, can they?
Little Mao: The mountains really aren't that dangerous. Bluey and Big Sis Fujin are there too. It's been a while since I've played with Bluey, too.
Little Mao: I wanted to introduce Grandpa Lu to Bluey earlier, but she said that wasn't a good idea, so I dropped the idea.
