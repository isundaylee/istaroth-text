Traveler: More work to be done means more Mora to be made.
Wanhu: You're right! Staying positive is a good thing!
Wanhu: Sometimes, however, no amount of joy from money made can mask bodily pain and fatigue.
Wanhu: I hope everyone can strike a balance between making money and taking care of their health, especially those at my age...
Wanhu: If you let the vigor of youth blind you to the need for self-care and behave recklessly as a result... You'll pay the price once you're middle-aged!
Wanhu: I was stubborn in my youth. Not only did I neglect my posture while working, I drank and stayed up late all the time!
Wanhu: Now it's too late for regret!
Wanhu: Let me rest against this box for a while longer. With any luck, it'll alleviate the pain.
