# Haunted Tales


## Talk 1

Arataki Itto: Hey, you guys finally made it!
Arataki Itto: I was searching for hours. Still didn't see any sign of those three, so I decided to come back.
Arataki Itto: How about you? Find anything?
Paimon: Uh, it's kinda hard to explain...
Traveler: We never managed to find those three, either.
Arataki Itto: I see... So you came up empty-handed, too.
Arataki Itto: Well, it doesn't matter! I already came up with a new plan!
Paimon: Huh? What plan?
Arataki Itto: Shinobu told me a saying after she got back from studying in Liyue. It went something like... "The something by day becomes..." Uhh, something by night?
Traveler: "The hunter by day becomes the hunted by night."
Arataki Itto: Yeah, that's what I said! C'mon, keep up!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, I was so focused on scaring people last round that those three dressed up as ghosts caught me completely off guard.
Arataki Itto: But not this time! Oh no! I'll be hiding nearby and waiting for those three to emerge first, then I'll nail 'em with a surprise attack.
Arataki Itto: You two just gotta keep playing it natural and join the contest. Got it? Okay, see ya later!
Paimon: Wait, Itto! Ugh, he ran off again!
Paimon: Well, his plan does make some sense at least... Let's go talk to the shrine maiden so we can join the second round.

## Talk 2

Shrine Maiden: Mwahahaha... Congratulations on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
Shrine Maiden: Now you're one step closer to the dark, messy truth. But is that really a good thing?
Paimon: Hey, cut the nonsense! What we just saw was super terrifying!
Shrine Maiden: Oh, really? Good to hear.
Shrine Maiden: Hearing the words "super terrifying" is exactly what all us event organizers would like to hear.
Paimon: Ugh no, that's not what Paimon means! Something mysterious is also happening here, not just the event!
Shrine Maiden: So what? You've heard the stories about the Test of Courage, haven't you?
Shrine Maiden: Everyone who participates in the event faces a variety of emotions.
Shrine Maiden: People are afraid of seeing their innermost fears appear before them, yet they still seek the thrill of experiencing those fears.
Shrine Maiden: So isn't it natural for us to have things in the dark and deathly silent forest to help fulfill that experience?
Shrine Maiden: Just like the grinning monster standing behind you right now, waiting for you to turn around...
Paimon: Aaaah!!! Really!?
Traveler: She's messing with you.
Shrine Maiden: Hehehe... I knew a little trick like that wouldn't be enough to scare you off.
Shrine Maiden: So, congrats on passing this test. The second round of the Test of Courage will begin shortly.
Shrine Maiden: Have you found your partner yet?
Paimon: Huh? But don't we already have a partner from the last round...?
Shrine Maiden: Yes, your team's outstanding effort certainly won you the last round.
Shrine Maiden: So it's understandable that you'd want to pair up with your previous partner... But unfortunately, you must find a different partner for each round of the event.
Shrine Maiden: If you don't have a partner by the time the next round begins, then...
Paimon: Yeah, yeah, Paimon already knows! If we don't have a partner in time, then we'll be disqualified!
Paimon: Let's ask around and see if there's anyone looking for a partner!
Traveler: There's nothing behind us.

## Talk 3

Arataki Itto: Don't freak out, boys! Whatever happens, I'll protect you!
Akira: You're the best, Boss!

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: #Heya {NICKNAME}, Paimon! I had a feeling you two would be here!
Paimon: Oh, Yoimiya! You're here too?
Yoimiya: Mm-hmm. I was also here for the first round, but I arrived a little early, so maybe that's why I didn't see you.
Yoimiya: By the way, I heard you were the winners. Impressive! I eventually found the hidden Dango Milk too, but it was already too late.
Paimon: Hehe... Actually, Paimon still doesn't know how we managed to find it.
Paimon: #Paimon was just hiding behind {M#him}{F#her} the whole time, and somehow we won!
Yoimiya: #{NICKNAME}, you never told me you were so good at this sort of event... You weren't keeping it a secret, were you?
Yoimiya: Anyway, would ya like to pair up with me? We'd be an amazing team! With us working together, the second round will be a piece of cake.
Traveler: I want to partner up with Yoimiya.
Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Yoimiya: Oh, I understand. You have to put some thought into choosing the best partner... You did already win the first round, after all.
Yoimiya: But I'm definitely no pushover when it comes to the Test of Courage. I've been to loads of these events.
Yoimiya: Besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! Anyway, give it some thought.

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: So you must be Hitotsume Kozou!
Hitotsume Kozou: Y—Yes!
Yoimiya: Hehe, no need to be nervous. I'm Yoimiya, and I run Naganohara Fireworks.
Hitotsume Kozou: Oh...! I once saw some Naganohara fireworks... Even though I was watching from a distance, they were still so beautiful, bursting across the sky...
Yoimiya: Really? Then the next time we meet, I'll bring some fireworks for us to launch together! It'll be fun!
Hitotsume Kozou: Wow, really? Thank you very much... And, if I may ask, are you Lord Kaedehara Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, that's me, but I'm afraid that I'm no lord... just a wandering samurai.
Hitotsume Kozou: I've seen you with your sword in the wilderness... You made quick work of many opponents with your amazing swordsmanship.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, that must have been when I was trying to escape Inazuma... It wasn't as impressive as you make it seem. I had to face many trying situations before I was able to leave the islands.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The head of the Kamisato Clan also lent me his assistance at the time. By the way, this is his sister.
Hitotsume Kozou: Oh, so y—you must be the one and only Shirasagi Himegimi? What an honor...
Kamisato Ayaka: There's no need to be so formal...
Hitotsume Kozou: I never imagined I'd ever meet someone as distinguished as you! I must be dreaming...!
Gorou: Hey, don't you want to go talk to them, too?
Kappa: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm rather shy...
Gorou: Really? That's strange, you seemed completely fine when we were chatting.
Kappa: I'm not sure why, but I feel so relaxed when talking with you, General Gorou.
Kappa: Actually, I'm the most timid of the three of us. I hid for days the last time someone tossed a stone into the river...
Kappa: Ah! Sorry for rambling on. It's odd... I'm not normally like this...
Gorou: It's okay. You can't excel at everything. The important thing is to have the courage to change.
Thoma: Hey there, chatting away I see... Mind if I join you?
Sayu: I've never seen a Kappa before.
Kappa: H—Hello there.
Youko: Thank you for bringing so many amazing people to meet us, Itto.
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! It's nothing! Being the "The One and Oni" means being the best, you know.
Arataki Itto: Oh — I should mention that, uh, I even have my own gang, and every member has a special title!
Paimon: Classic Itto... There you go, bragging about yourself... again!
Paimon: Don't confuse them! Everyone's here for the Test of Courage, not because you brought them here! Half the people here don't even know who you are!
Arataki Itto: Hey! This is my moment, Paimon! Don't ruin it for me!
Paimon: Hehe, Itto really isn't as cool as he claims to be.
Paimon: #When it comes to having connections in Inazuma, nobody can beat Paimon and {NICKNAME}!
Arataki Itto: Oh yeah!? Alright, well then let's have a little contest and see who knows the most people!
Paimon: Sure! Bring it on, Bull-Chucker Beetle Boy!
Youko: Ahem... please don't fight. Actually, I think you're both really amazing.
Youko: And you also have a great friendship. Just like Lord Kamai and the samurai...
Arataki Itto: Haha, well, of course—
Akira: Boss!!!
Arataki Itto: Oh, it's the boys!
Arataki Itto: Darn it! I was so caught up with the youkai that I forgot I was supposed to scare the daylights outta the gang!
Mamoru: Boss!
Arataki Itto: Ahem... hey fellas, look, I can explain, I—
Akira: Boss, we're sorry!!!
Arataki Itto: Wait, what now?
Mamoru: We shouldn't have ever doubted you, Boss. You were right!
Akira: Yeah, the Test of Courage is terrifying! Th—There are definitely ghosts here!!!
Genta: I still get shivers just thinking about it... But the thrill was kinda fun...
Arataki Itto: Oh... uh... hahaha well, I told you it would be an exhilarating experience, but noooo, none of you believed me.
Arataki Itto: Anyway, no need to be too scared now. Let me tell you what's happening here...
Arataki Itto: It turns out, there aren't any ghosts here, all the scary stuff you saw was just a little misunderstanding we had with the youkai.
Arataki Itto: Right?
Youko: Ah... Sorry, but I've never seen these three before.
Youko: I'm not sure where you've been or what you've seen, but I don't think it had anything to do with us...
Arataki Itto: Huh?
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: Huh?
Arataki Itto: H—Hold on, little Youko... You're kidding, right? You know, now's really not the time for that!
Youko: N—No, I'm serious. I really don't know what's going on...
Arataki Itto: But if it wasn't you guys... does that mean there are real ghosts out here!?
Traveler: Wait a minute, we did meet some lady who was all dressed up...
Paimon: Ah, that's right! Paimon assumed she was a youkai too, and we even played Akitsu Yuugei with her.
Youko: ...
Youko: *gulp* I—I'm not sure who it was you met...
Youko: But we're the only three youkai who wanted to hold a festival here...
Paimon: Ah! So she was a ghost?
Akira: Ah, Boss! Save us!
Arataki Itto: Calm down! Everyone j—just calm down now!
Shikanoin Heizou: What's all the noise about?
Arataki Itto: Hmm? Oh, you're the Tenryou Commission's...
Paimon: Heizou!
Shikanoin Heizou: There's nothing to fear. Even if there really is a ghost, all your noise would drive it away.
Shikanoin Heizou: Itto, you and your gang should go and inform the other contestants about the situation.
Shikanoin Heizou: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, please come with me.
Arataki Itto: Oh... Okay!
Paimon: Phew... Paimon somehow feels a little better now that Heizou's here...

## Talk 6

Kamisato Ayaka: Could the rumors be true then? Do strange phenomena really happen every time the Test of Courage is held...?
Kamisato Ayaka: Please, be careful.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: Unease pervades the air, and fear is spreading.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Maybe this is the real Test of Courage...? It's already becoming an unforgettable experience for me.

## Talk 8

Gorou: "Recite this to yourself, keep your mind clear and at peace. Free your thoughts from spirits and ghosts"...
Gorou: Those were Her Excellency's remarks in the directive. She once said, "There is nothing to be afraid of as long as your conscience is clear."
Gorou: If only Her Excellency were here. She would get to the bottom of all this in no time.

## Talk 9

Yoimiya: So is there really a ghost around here?
Yoimiya: I'm gonna go look for it. I've never seen a ghost before! Oh, how exciting!

## Talk 10

Thoma: I believe my lord had foreseen this situation...
Thoma: He has my absolute trust, but given Lady Ayaka is still here, we must get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

## Talk 11

Sayu: Shh... this is one of my usual hiding spots. It's always safe here.
Sayu: Let me show you a trick. Just cover your eyes, and the scary things will go away...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Uhh, hellooo? Miss shrine maiden...? Strange, she isn't here.
Paimon: Waaaah! What's this? Look, there's something written in red on the bulletin board!
Paimon: "Round 3... Item... Hagoita."
Paimon: Does this mean that the item we have to find in the third round is a hagoita?
Shikanoin Heizou: The shrine maiden appears to be urging us to finish the third round of the Test of Courage.
Paimon: But where did she go?
Paimon: *gasp* Has she been taken away by a ghost!?
Paimon: Will Paimon be next!? *gulp* Oh, Paimon won't ever leave your side now!
Shikanoin Heizou: The words are scribbled hastily, but there's no evidence of a struggle. However... aren't there too many words written here?
Traveler: What did you notice, Heizou?
Shikanoin Heizou: I believe that the three items chosen for this three-round contest were each selected by the three organizing parties.
Shikanoin Heizou: The Dango Milk was chosen by the merchant who funded the event, and the fan was chosen by the Yashiro Commission, which provided the staff.
Shikanoin Heizou: So, does the hagoita, which should have been chosen by the Grand Narukami Shrine, have any unique significance?
Paimon: Let's worry about that later. The bigger question is, are we really going to join the third round of the Test of Courage?
Paimon: Paimon would love to win the grand prize, but our safety comes first!
Paimon: How about we... make a tactical retreat!
Shikanoin Heizou: I still have my commission to complete, so I'll stay.
Shikanoin Heizou: Fear arises from mystery, and it's a detective's job to unearth the truth from the mystery.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon somehow feels a little better after hearing you say that...
Paimon: Okay then, let's wait for a while.
Paimon: Maybe the shrine maiden had something to take care of and will be back soon...

## Talk 13

Yoimiya: Hehe! Look what we have here! Isn't this the fan we're looking for?
Yoimiya: Wow, it has such a beautiful design on it. Are those fireworks? It seems to be for some sort of festival!
Yoimiya: So now that we've found this fan, does that mean we've won the second round of the Test of Courage? Let's bring it back!
Paimon: Phew... Thank goodness it's over!
Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Yoimiya: Hmm? Is there something else you need to take care of? How about I take the fan back, then?
Paimon: Thank you~! That would help.
Yoimiya: No need to thank me. It's been a blast doing the Test of Courage with you guys! I'd love to do it again!

## Talk 14

Sayu: Phew... this place should be safe.
Sayu: I can't believe I made it this far. Hey, did I get any taller?
Traveler: Uh, maybe a little.
Sayu: Really? Ah, that's great!
Paimon: Enough about that. Look! Isn't this the fan we're looking for?
Paimon: It has fireworks printed on it, so it must be for some kind of festival!
Sayu: So does that mean the second round of the Test of Courage is over now?
Paimon: Yep, seems like it. Haha, we've won again!
Sayu: Great. *yawn* Because I was just starting... to feel sleepy...
Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Sayu: In that case, I'll take the fan back with me and have a little nap. Just don't stay out here too long...
Traveler: I don't see any change.
Sayu: Aww, how come...

## Talk 15

Thoma: Ah, this must be the fan we're looking for.
Thoma: Seems we're the first to find it, too. Our luck's not so bad after all.
Paimon: Let Paimon see... Oh, it has fireworks printed on it, so it must be for some sort of festival!
Paimon: Huh... Paimon thought Ayato would choose a folding fan... You know, like the kind Ayaka usually uses.
Thoma: You're right, this fan doesn't appear to be something my lord would usually use...
Thoma: Anyway, let's head back now that we've found it.
Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Thoma: Hmm? Are you planning to stay here? Then allow me to take the fan back.
Thoma: But remember, you're only one round away from taking home the special prize! Make sure you get yourselves ready and give it your best shot.

## Talk 16

Shrine Maiden: You appear to have found a partner. Let's see if you can repeat your luck from the first round.
Shrine Maiden: Though, whether winning should be considered "good luck" or not is debatable, hehehe...
Shrine Maiden: Anyway, I will now reveal the item you'll be searching for in the second round of the Test of Courage.
Shrine Maiden: It's... a "fan."
Paimon: A fan? You mean like the thing we use to keep cool when it's hot out?
Shrine Maiden: Correct. The fan was personally selected by the Yashiro Commissioner himself, and has been placed somewhere in the Chinju Forest.
Shrine Maiden: There will be signs to guide the way, but beware, the darkness that lurks in the forest is drawing nearer.
Shrine Maiden: Mwahahahaha... Remember, if you can't go on any further, you can always give up and live to see another day.
Paimon: We'll never give up! Let's go!

## Talk 17

Shrine Maiden: You appear to have found a partner. Let's see if you can repeat your luck from the first round.
Shrine Maiden: Though, whether winning should be considered "good luck" or not is debatable, hehehe...
Shrine Maiden: Anyway, I will now reveal the item you'll be searching for in the second round of the Test of Courage.
Shrine Maiden: It's... a "fan."
Paimon: A fan? You mean like the thing we use to keep cool when it's hot out?

Paimon: We'll never give up! Let's go!

## Talk 18

Shrine Maiden: Have you found a partner yet?

## Talk 19

Sayu: *snoring* Huh? Ah, you found me...
Paimon: Hey, Sayu! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
Sayu: Yes... *yawn*
Paimon: She looks like she just woke up... No wait, she's actually trying to fall asleep!
Sayu: The Test of Courage is too scary, so I keep my eyes closed to not feel scared.
Sayu: But as soon as I close my eyes, it's really easy to fall asleep...
Sayu: During the first round, a big bull-headed beast leaped out of nowhere and scared me half to death, so I ran and hid behind a tree.
Sayu: I closed my eyes and tried to hide for a while, but it was really dark and I fell asleep... By the time I woke up, the round was already over.
Paimon: A big bull-headed beast... Wait, that sounds like Ushi!
Sayu: Now, no one wants to partner up with me for the second round.
Paimon: Oh, poor Sayu... Wait, but why would you join the Test of Courage in the first place?
Sayu: Oh, because I heard that being frightened causes you to grow taller...
Paimon: What kind of silly idea is that!? That's just a load of baloney!
Sayu: I wasn't sure if it was true, either, but since I heard it could help people grow taller, I decided to give it a shot...
Paimon: Well, Sayu doesn't have a partner yet. Should we team up with her?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Sayu.
Sayu: Really? You're willing to be my partner?
Sayu: Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
Sayu: It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Sayu: It's okay, no rush. I came here for my own reasons anyway.
Sayu: I'll try to overcome my fear... and sleepiness.
Sayu: But, if you do want to partner up, just let me know...

## Talk 20

Thoma: Hey there! Congrats on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
Paimon: Thoma! Wait, were you also a contestant in the first round?
Thoma: I sure was! But I couldn't shake this constant feeling that someone was secretly following me the entire round.
Thoma: He didn't seem to be from the Yashiro Commission, and I was concerned that he might be out to stir up trouble at the event, so I tried to capture him.
Thoma: I didn't expect him to run so fast. I gave chase for a while, but I couldn't keep up... and before I knew it, the round was over.
Paimon: Hmm, is there a chance he wasn't there to cause trouble? Maybe he was just trying to scare people.
Thoma: Coming all the way to the Test of Courage to scare people? Well, I guess the world is full of all kinds of weirdos...
Thoma: Anyway, I'm gonna be sure to show everyone my abilities in the second round.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers you once mentioned that you like kaidan...
Thoma: Yeah, that's right. Once I really get into it, you might find me to be your toughest competitor.
Thoma: Haha, I'm only kidding, of course. I'm not here for the prizes, just to have fun.
Thoma: My lord has granted me a rare vacation, so I'd rather spend my time relaxing than worrying about some contest.
Thoma: Speaking of which, have you found a partner yet? Would you like to pair up with me?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Thoma.
Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Thoma: Ah, I understand. Hope you can find the right partner and win the second round.
Thoma: You've probably already heard that to win the Grand Narukami Shrine's special prize. You have to win all three rounds.
Thoma: I'd like to know what the prize is as well... And you're the only one who has that chance now, so go for it!

## Talk 21

Yoimiya: So, made up your mind yet? Do you wanna team up with me?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Yoimiya.
Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Yoimiya: Ah, really? That's a bummer...
Yoimiya: Well anyway, I'll be right here if you change your mind!

## Talk 22

Sayu: Oh, will you pair up with me for the Test of Courage?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Sayu.
Sayu: Really? You're willing to be my partner?
Sayu: Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
Sayu: It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Sayu: Okay... If you want me to be your partner, you can find me here.

## Talk 23

Thoma: Haha, want to team up with me?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Thoma.
Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Thoma: Ah, not a problem. I still wish you the best of luck, no matter who you chose to team up with.
Thoma: Just be sure not to put too much pressure on yourself. The Test of Courage is meant to be a fun event, focusing only on winning would defeat the whole purpose of participating.

## Talk 24

Shrine Maiden: You appear to have found a partner. Let's see if you can repeat your luck from the first round.
Shrine Maiden: Though, whether winning should be considered "good luck" or not is debatable, hehehe...

Paimon: We'll never give up! Let's go!

## Talk 25

Paimon: Wow Itto, you really captured them!
Kappa: Seriously, why didn't you run when I told you?
Youko: What're you saying... We couldn't abandon you!
Hitotsume Kozou: Yeah, that's right! So just get on with it... If you're gonna eat us, then you'll have to deal with all three of us!
Hitotsume Kozou: We won't back down, even if... even if we're already in your stomach!
Paimon: Who said we were going to eat you? Wait, are you the ghosts of something tasty?
Paimon: And Itto, why're you so quiet all of a sudden?
Arataki Itto: Hmm... I have a weird feeling that I've seen these three somewhere before...
Arataki Itto: Ah, I know! These are all creatures from the Ultimate Youkai Field Guide that granny used to show me!
Arataki Itto: There's Youko, Kappa, and Hitotsume Kozou! They're all youkai.
Youko: It sure took you long enough to notice.
Kappa: Well, we recognized you right away! You're an oni, aren't you?
Hitotsume Kozou: According to legends, oni are grouchy, extremely strong, and crush other youkai into balls to eat them up!
Arataki Itto: Pfff! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! Who came up with that!?
Arataki Itto: Besides, you're the ones people are scared of! Hiding behind bushes and scaring people off the road, what are you trying to do here?
Arataki Itto: #Don't think I didn't see you! ...Following {M#him}{F#her} around and conjuring up all sorts of weird, scary stuff.
Paimon: Aha, so it was you three!
Kappa: No, we weren't trying to scare anyone. We were just trying to, uh...
Youko: ...
Hitotsume Kozou: ...
Traveler: Go ahead, you can tell us.
Hitotsume Kozou: Really? You're not mad?
Paimon: Even though you scared the daylights out of Paimon a few times, it doesn't seem like you were doing it on purpose.
Paimon: Anyway, let's hear your side of the story and Paimon will decide whether or not to forgive you!
Youko: Ahem, well, the truth is... we were planning a festival.
Youko: One hosted by the youkai, but humans are also welcome to attend.
Traveler: You mean, the Mikawa Flower Festival?
Paimon: Ah, the festival that Ei mentioned!
Arataki Itto: Mikawa Flower Festival... huh, that does ring a bell.
Arataki Itto: Ah right, it used to be hosted by the top youkai. I heard it was supposed to be a lot of fun... I mean, not as fun as my Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, but still...
Youko: Yes, the Mikawa Flower Festival is our aspiration... But we know that our festival doesn't deserve that name.
Youko: The times of Hyakkiyakou are long gone, we're just a bunch of little youkai living in the wilderness.
Youko: As you can see, we lack the necessary youkai powers to put on such a grand festival.
Youko: But... we're determined to still reach out to humans and express our gratitude.
Paimon: Huh? Gratitude? What do you mean?
Kappa: Mm-hmm. You see, we live in the wilderness and are frequently attacked by monsters.
Kappa: They would come and stir up trouble on our land, forcing us to hand over our food... Sometimes they would even get rough and leave us injured.
Kappa: But later, many human adventurers came into the wilderness and drove off the monsters, allowing us to live in peace.
Arataki Itto: Ah, I get it now. You wanna repay the favor, but your powers are too puny!
Arataki Itto: Hey, don't let it get to ya. You might be a bunch of pip-squeaks, but you're all solid youkai in my book!
Paimon: So are you the ones who set up the Akitsu Yuugei game on the beach?
Hitotsume Kozou: Yep, that was us! Have you tried it yet? Isn't it fun?
Hitotsume Kozou: We drew inspiration from the legendary Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura. It took a lot of youkai power to set it up.
Hitotsume Kozou: After that, we didn't have much youkai power left, so we set up some stalls in the forest to add to the festival atmosphere...
Youko: We were just following you to see your reactions.
Paimon: Is the Akitsu Yuugei really that important? Why did you spend all of your youkai power to build it?
Paimon: #Paimon would have taken {NICKNAME} for a big meal if you had set up more food stalls!
Hitotsume Kozou: Really?
Youko: To be honest, we've never met a human before, so we had no idea what you would like...
Youko: We focused on building the Akitsu Yuugei because of a legend we heard.
Arataki Itto: Ah, I know the one!
Youko: It's the story of youkai meeting a human during a festival hundreds of years ago.
Youko: The Mikawa Flower Festival is meant to bring happiness to all who attend, and Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura is a symbol of friendship.
Youko: That's why, when we decided to hold the festival here, setting up Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura was our first priority.
Youko: Unfortunately, the real Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura has been lost to time. What we created is a version of the game we heard about from a wandering merchant, so we changed the name to Akitsu Yuugei.
Traveler: We heard that someone had been trapped in Akitsu Yuugei.
Hitotsume Kozou: Yeah, but that wasn't us!
Kappa: We have no idea what could have gone wrong!
Youko: We closed Akitsu Yuugei a while ago and carefully checked it for any issues.
Youko: But, we didn't find anything wrong with it... Maybe it was just some strange mishap caused by our unstable youkai power at the time.
Arataki Itto: Hmm, they don't look like they're lying, and believe me, I know a liar when I see one! Maybe it really was just an accident.
Hitotsume Kozou: After that incident, people stopped coming to the attraction.
Kappa: Later, a human man with blue hair appeared and walked around the area...
Youko: He had a piercing gaze, I almost felt like he could see us.
Youko: But then he turned and quickly left without saying anything.
Hitotsume Kozou: It wasn't long before large numbers of people began coming to the Chinju Forest!
Hitotsume Kozou: And visitors were playing Akitsu Yuugei again. It was wonderful.
Paimon: "A human man with blue hair"...?
Traveler: It must have been Ayato.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, the fan that Ayato chose is the same kind that's used at a festival... Do you think that he knew about the youkai when he decided to hold the Test of Courage here?
Arataki Itto: Oh, so my bro Ayato is here for the Test of Courage, too?
Arataki Itto: Or maybe he's here to catch Onikabuto... Ha, had I known that, I would have brought the one I caught a few days ago to battle him!
Paimon: Wow, Itto's still clueless about who Ayato really is...
Traveler: It's alright, no need to tell him for now.
Paimon: Well anyway, seems like all the strange things we saw earlier were caused by these little youkai, not ghosts. What a relief...
Paimon: And now that we know what was happening, the Test of Courage doesn't seem that scary after all!
Arataki Itto: Hey, you want to hang out with humans, right? I totally get that.
Arataki Itto: After all, we youkai are becoming a rare breed these days. If all we do is isolate, we'll only feel more lonely. So, why don't you let this oni do ya a favor, hmm?
Arataki Itto: See, I'm a youkai too, right, and I'm already a natural in human society. I bet there's not a single person in Inazuma who hasn't heard of Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto!
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! C'mon, let's go! I'll show you around!
Paimon: Now that Paimon doesn't feel so scared anymore, maybe we can walk around the area?
Paimon: The youkai said they wanted to host a festival, but Paimon was too busy having the bejeebers scared out of her to pay any attention until now.
Paimon: Come to think of it, Paimon remembers seeing some festival-related items on the beach... Let's head over there and take a look. Maybe we can help out!
Traveler: Maybe we can help you.

## Talk 26

Paimon: Wait! You're the strange lady we met before!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...Oh, it's you two again.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I have to say, I'm impressed by your willingness to approach me after last time. You're much braver than I thought.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But I'm not going to let you off the hook so easily this time. If you don't leave, I'll—
Paimon: Hmph! Nice try, but you don't scare us anymore!
Paimon: We just met your fellow youkai, and they told us everything!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Huh? Fellow youkai?
Paimon: That's right! You're another little youkai who lives in the wilderness, aren't you? We just met Youko, Kappa, and Hitotsume Kozou!
Paimon: So which type of youkai are you? Let Paimon guess... uh... hmm, actually Paimon has no idea what you are!
Paimon: Anyway, it doesn't matter. We're on our way to play Akitsu Yuugei, care to join us?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Akitsu Yuugei, again that game...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: How could this be happening now? All I needed was a little more time, and I could...!
Paimon: Huh? What's the matter? Are you not feeling well?
Paimon: Oh! Maybe you're hungry? Or maybe you didn't sleep well? You look pretty exhausted.
Paimon: Don't worry. Itto has already taken your fellow youkai to meet some new friends! Everyone will get along just fine.
Traveler: Itto's showing some of his better qualities this time.
Paimon: Yeah, so there's no need to worry. C'mon, let's go play Akitsu Yuugei!
Paimon: We'll see who can finish the game the quickest. The loser will have to grant the winner a wish!
Paimon: Oh, it's starting! Get ready!
Traveler: We're your friends, too.

## Talk 27

Paimon: Amazing! You cleared all the elemental cubes so quickly.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon thinks we got this in the bag! Alright, it's your turn.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...Okay, watch and learn.
Black Screen Text: You watch as the lady finishes the game in record speed.
Paimon: #No way, she hit every cube in one shot and finished even faster than you, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's head is spinning after watching that! Did you see how she did it?
Traveler: I concede.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Even if the rules have changed a little, I would never lose to amateurs like you.
Paimon: Oh right, you're a youkai... You're the ones who created Akitsu Yuugei.
Paimon: No wonder you were so good... Anyway, we'll keep our word; you can make a wish now.
Paimon: But before you say anything, we won't do anything that's clearly impossible or harmful to others.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: A wish, huh? Then I wish...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...that we never cross paths again.
Paimon: Wait, what? But didn't we just have a great time together?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: That's precisely why...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Don't ever come near me or speak to me again.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Surely that's a wish you can fulfill, right?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: This is my final word of warning. If I ever see your faces again, I will, uh... I'll steal your souls!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Scared now? Good, then don't come here again!
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon doesn't get it... Did we do something wrong?
Traveler: Maybe she just wants to be left alone.
Paimon: Fair enough... But Paimon had a lot of fun playing Akitsu Yuugei with her! It would be great if we could see her again.
Paimon: Anyway, let's go see how Itto's doing!
Traveler: Everyone has their reasons.
Traveler: You win.
