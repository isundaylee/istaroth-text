# The Taste of Home


## Talk 1

Tang Wen: Ahh, it would be nice to have some Liyue cuisine...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Tang Wen: You are? With that outfit... You're the Traveler, right? Sorry, I'm just a little homesick...
Traveler: Did you just say you wanted to have some Liyue cuisine?
Tang Wen: Huh? Could it be... You know how to make Liyue cuisine? That's great!
Tang Wen: Th-Then, please help me! Please make me some authentic Liyue dishes!
Tang Wen: Let me think... What I really want to eat now is...
Tang Wen: Mmm! I want to eat meat! A lot, a lot of meat!
Tang Wen: The delicate texture and the fragrant aroma of the meat mixed with Liyue's special spices...
Tang Wen: Just thinking about it makes me salivate...
Tang Wen: So, I want to eat meat! Please help me prepare a Liyue dish made of meat!
Traveler: Do you need help with anything?
Tang Wen: Let me introduce myself. I'm Tang Wen, a historian from Liyue. I was previously doing some field research on the unique customs and folklore of Inazuma.
Tang Wen: I was about to return to Liyue as I had almost finished collecting information. But because of Inazuma's Sakoku Decree, I ended up being stranded here for a long time...
Tang Wen: Actually, I think this is kind of a good thing for me. It's because I feel that this is a historic moment for Inazuma!
Tang Wen: I am quite sure that this particular period will certainly leave a strong mark in the annals of history of Teyvat.
Tang Wen: To witness such history with one's own eyes, and then record all of it in a true, complete and clear manner for posterity, is what a historian should do.
Tang Wen: But... as exciting as this cause is to me, it won't satisfy my stomach...
Traveler: Are you getting hungry?
Tang Wen: I can't say... it's because I'm hungry... Hahaha, Inazuma's food is quite tasty too.
Tang Wen: I really like the tempura here, although it feels like everything is coated with batter and then fried...
Tang Wen: But after eating Inazuma cuisine for a long time, I started to miss the Liyue dishes. Sadly, I couldn't find a restaurant that could make authentic Liyue cuisine.
Tang Wen: I finally decided to post a Cuisine Commission at the Adventurers' Guild a few days ago but there hasn't been any response...
Traveler: Can I give it a try?

## Talk 2

Tang Wen: Hmm? Why does th—this dish taste... so... so interesting.
Tang Wen: Can't say it's interesting... Uhh, I should say...unique, or something...
Tang Wen: How did you come up with such a dish? Your cooking skills are really...out of this world...
Tang Wen: Thanks for your hard work! Traveler, please take these. I'll umm, savor this dish later...

## Talk 3

Tang Wen: Back so soon? You're not a secret chef, are you?
Tang Wen: Hmmm... I can't wait, please let me try it!
Traveler: Please enjoy.
Traveler: Let's see... What dishes did we talk about just now?
Paimon: Oh right... Mora Meat, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot, and Goulash!
Paimon: Let's decide and give it to Miss Tang Wen!

## Talk 4

Tang Wen: Ah! This is it! This, this is the taste of home I've been dreaming of... It's... *sob* I'm so touched...
Tang Wen: Thank you so much! I feel energized with all this good food.
Tang Wen: These are for you. I wish you a smooth journey ahead!

## Talk 5

Tang Wen: Ahh, it would be nice to have some Liyue cuisine about now...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Tang Wen: Huh, that outfit... You're the Traveler, aren't you? I'm sorry, I'm just feeling a little homesick right now...
Traveler: Did you just say you wanted to have some Liyue cuisine?
Tang Wen: Huh? Wait... You know how to make Liyue cuisine? That's great!
Tang Wen: Th—Then, please help me! Please make me some authentic Liyue dishes!
Tang Wen: Let me think... What I'd really like to eat right now is...
Tang Wen: Mmm! I want to eat meat! Lots and lots of meat!
Tang Wen: The delicate texture and the fragrant aroma of the meat mixed with Liyue's special spices...
Tang Wen: Just thinking about it makes me salivate...
Tang Wen: So, I want to eat meat! Please help me prepare a Liyue dish made of meat!
Traveler: Do you need help with anything?
Tang Wen: Ah, right. Allow me to me introduce myself. I'm Tang Wen, a historian from Liyue. Previously, I was doing some field research on the unique customs and folklore of Inazuma.
Tang Wen: I'd finished collecting all the material I needed, in fact, and was preparing to head back to Liyue. But so many big things have happened in Inazuma recently...
Tang Wen: So I feel like I'm living in historic times here, you know?
Tang Wen: The happenings of this particular period will certainly leave a strong mark in the annals of Teyvat's history.
Tang Wen: To witness such history with one's own eyes, and then record all of it in a true, complete, and clear manner for posterity — that is what a historian should do.
Tang Wen: But... as exciting as this cause is to me, it won't satisfy my stomach...
Traveler: Hungry, are we?
Tang Wen: Well, I wouldn't say that exactly... Inazuma's food is actually pretty tasty.
Tang Wen: I really like the tempura here, although it's, well... They just wrap everything in batter and fry it, you know?
Tang Wen: But after eating Inazuman cuisine for a long time, I started to miss dishes from back home. Sadly, I couldn't find a restaurant here that could make authentic Liyue cuisine.
Tang Wen: So I finally decided to post a "cuisine commission" at the Adventurers' Guild a few days ago, but there hasn't been any response since...
Traveler: May I give it a try?

## Talk 6

Tang Wen: Hmm, this taste... well, it doesn't seem to taste like a Liyue or Inazuma dish. The taste is really new to me...
Tang Wen: Although it isn't the cuisine I wanted to eat, I'm already satisfied to be able to taste such a novel dish.
Tang Wen: Thank you, Traveler. Please accept these.

## Talk 7

Tang Wen: Eh? I think this is still an Inazuma dish...
Tang Wen: I don't think this is the dish I asked for... Well, never mind, this dish is also filling...
Tang Wen: Thanks anyway, Traveler. Please take these.
