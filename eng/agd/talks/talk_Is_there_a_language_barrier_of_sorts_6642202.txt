Traveler: Is there a language barrier of sorts?
Semino: Ah... Well, communicating across languages requires a little more time and effort, yeah.
Semino: After all, each instrument has its own character.
Semino: Calm, mellow, lively, and those that love to steal the show. Finding a stage where they can coexist in harmony is tough stuff.
Semino: The Iridescence Tour is what's got my eye right now. If I had a chance to talk with the organizers, I'm sure we'd have a fruitful time!
