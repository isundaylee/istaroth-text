Traveler: Could I ask you to take a picture for me?
Yokina: No can do, I'm sorry to say.
Yokina: Fans have asked me before if I'd sell my photos so they could go get contestants' autographs, but I always refuse. I don't want people to start reselling them for extortionate prices.
Yokina: Plus, given that I actually have to assist the referees at times, I don't accept private commissions â€” all in the interest of fairness, you understand.
