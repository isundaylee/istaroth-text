# Like a Triumphant Hero


## Talk 1

Paimon: We've spent quite some time in Sumeru City, but ever since we last said goodbye to Lesser Lord Kusanali, we haven't heard anything from her...
Paimon: *sigh* We can't just keep waiting around like this. Let's go find Katheryne and pick up some work so we can at least keep ourselves busy!

## Talk 2

Nahida: Let's continue our chat here.
Paimon: Okay. So do you have any ideas on how we can investigate the sages, Nahida?

## Talk 3

Paimon: She's at Akim's now, right on cue! Let's get ready to possess him right away!

## Talk 4

Paimon: #C'mon {NICKNAME}! Setaria's already started talking with Qishan!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh, there really aren't many people out right now... Let's hope it'll be this quiet in front of the Akademiya, and that Setaria managed to distract all the guards...

## Talk 6

Paimon: So, was that everybody?
Nahida: Mm-hmm. Three familiar faces should be enough for Setaria.
Paimon: What's the point of all the information we've collected? Nahida, you still haven't told us how you're planning to make Setaria face her problems.
Nahida: Setaria is already used to avoiding her problems, so we must find a way to break through her usual sensibilities.
Nahida: I remember you mentioned that the Eremites in Port Ormos are all making a fuss about the upcoming resurrection of King Deshret.
Nahida: Although it's all just a boatload of nonsense, the faith of her homeland may turn out to be Setaria's soft spot.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now... You want to take advantage of the guilt Setaria feels about her homeland.
Paimon: Although she knows she should return home to help the people of the desert, all she's done is conspire with the sages...
Traveler: If King Deshret were to criticize Setaria's actions...
Paimon: Hmm, so how do we set that up?
Nahida: Well, King Deshret is long gone, and Setaria is also too smart to fall for any simple tricks...
Nahida: If we simply engaged her under the guise of King Deshret's believers, she'd definitely be wary of us, and we may not get anywhere.
Nahida: But if we were to "borrow" some of her close acquaintances to talk with her... her reaction would probably be very different.
Paimon: So you mean, you're going to possess those people we just talked to?
Nahida: Yep. Possess them through the Akasha, imply that they've already converted to the faith of King Deshret, and then convey our made-up "will of King Deshret."
Nahida: As long as everything goes smoothly, we'll get through to Setaria for sure. She'll never guess that we had anything to do with it.
Paimon: Ahh, so that's how you're going to use all the info we collected on these people — it's so that you won't slip up and break form! Possessing them will only work if you can manage to pass off as them.
Nahida: Exactly! So, best of luck with impersonating them.
Paimon: Huh? Best of luck? B—But we don't know how to possess anyone!
Nahida: That's no problem at all. I'll just share all their senses with you once I've possessed them. As long as you're also wearing an Akasha Terminal, the effect will basically be as if you've possessed them yourself.
Paimon: #Huh, that is pretty convenient... But why does {F#she}{M#he} have to do this? Can't you do it yourself?
Nahida: Although I've been observing humans for a while, I've never been good at imitating them...
Paimon: Hmm, you're not wrong... It's always been painfully obvious whenever you try to pass as Katheryne.
Traveler: Alright.
Nahida: *sigh* If it was at all possible, I would've preferred to leave these people alone, but seeing how things are now, I probably should just accept it and push on.
Paimon: Yeah, don't beat yourself up over it! We're only doing this to help everyone, and we'll only be borrowing them for a little while anyway.
Nahida: Alright, then let's give it a go tomorrow afternoon.
Traveler: I'll try my best.
Traveler: If King Deshret were to make demands of Setaria...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ooh, here she comes! Setaria's here!
Nahida: Let's quietly follow her. Once she starts talking to her acquaintances, we'll find a safe spot to begin possessing them.
Nahida: #As for how we'll sway her to our side... I'll leave that to you. {NICKNAME}, I trust you'll know what to say.
Paimon: Ahh, Paimon's starting to feel kinda nervous! Okay, let's go!
Paimon: Looks like they've already started talking... Let's find a hiding spot and get started!
Setaria: ...That's right, you really can't force anything when it comes to love. And besides, everyone around me has a very different background and outlook...
Setaria: Huh? Are you still listening to me, Nabiya?
Nabiya: Oh, o—of course I'm listening! You were talking about troubles with your love life, right? I heard everything you said.
Setaria: Ah, okay then. You just seemed a little distracted for a moment there.
Harut: Meow!
Setaria: Strange... Your cats seem pretty worked up. Is something wrong?
Setaria: I always thought they were quiet, happy kitties... Oh, what are their names again?
Traveler: Hamru and Tamru.
Setaria: Hmm, are you sure? Those aren't ringing a bell for some reason...
Nabiya: Ah, well... A—Actually, they have many names. Which names I use depends on my mood.
Setaria: Huh, I see. I imagine that must be hard for the kitties, too.
Nabiya: Ahem, so which fortune do you want me to read for you today? You must have come for another echo of the divine voice of wisdom.
Setaria: Hmm... I'd like to get another reading on my love prospects, but to be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I've been a real mess recently...
Nabiya: A mess?
Setaria: Well, erm... Could you do a reading on how long it'll take me to finish my current project at work? I really just want to get it over with...
Nabiya: I hear you... No problem at all. Uh, the gods will reveal the truth.
Nabiya: ...
Traveler: Hummm... Ah, the gods have spoken!
Nabiya: The gods are asking...
Nabiya: "Setaria, why haven't you gone home?"
Setaria: Why haven't I gone... home? Do the gods really know everything I've been thinking about...?
Nabiya: "Setaria, why don't you just go home!" It's a demand now, instead of a question... The gods seem to be truly upset.
Setaria: Ah! Ah... I'm sorry, I know I failed the gods. Please pass on my most sincere apologies and ask for their divine forgiveness...
Setaria: And, if I may ask... Nabiya, is there a specific god who's speaking to you right now?
Nabiya: Hmph, what an inconsiderate and naive question. The god who is speaking to me is, of course, the wisest and mightiest of all: King Deshret.
Setaria: K—King Deshret? No wonder he would make such a demand of me... Huh, wait a second... King Deshret passed away a long time ago...
Setaria: Even though news of King Deshret's resurrection has been spreading like wildfire, it's all just a misinformation campaign from the Akademiya... How can King Deshret still exist in real life?
Traveler: (Huh? King Deshret's resurrection is a misinformation campaign?)
Nabiya: What insolence! I am King Deshret's most loyal believer. Do you wish to refute his voice of wisdom?
Setaria: Oh, no, no... As a child of the desert, I am only reveling in his power upon learning that his divine glory has touched even this city.
Setaria: I will think very carefully about his demand of me... I'm sorry, I must go now.
Nabiya: Ah, wait...
Paimon: Whoa, she just ran off in a hurry. She looked pretty upset, too!
Nahida: #Well done, {NICKNAME}! Setaria didn't seem to suspect anything amiss.
Nahida: To have something she's been trying desperately to avoid show up out of nowhere and berate her... That must have shaken her to the core.
Paimon: Nahida, it seems like you understand human emotions really well after all!
Nahida: All I know are some abstract Haravatat theories. In any case, my time with you has shown a lot of them to be utterly useless. I'm still trying to make sense of everything...
Nahida: Anyway, enough of that. Let's hurry and catch up to Setaria.
Traveler: Ohohoho... The gods have spoken!
Setaria: Pfft... Sorry, your new laugh is just so hilarious, I couldn't help it...
Nabiya: Oh! Uh, please pay no mind to those kinds of details.
Traveler: Harut and Marut.
Setaria: Ahh, that's right! They are just little darlings, aren't they? Harut and Marut...

## Talk 8

Setaria: ...It's okay, I just got caught up in something.
Setaria: Oh, actually, didn't you ask me to help you look for work? What kind of work were you looking for again?
Traveler: Uh, gardening work.
Setaria: Gardening? But don't you hate everything to do with plants? I still remember getting mad at you for secretly throwing away the bonsai that I gave you as a present.
Akim: Erm... Well, uh, you see, a friend told me that the secret to self-improvement is to work on things you're not so good at.
Setaria: ...Fair enough. I didn't think that was something you would consider.
Setaria: Speaking of, how's he doing? Is he feeling any better?
Traveler: He's feeling a lot better, and he's walking more now.
Setaria: Ah, that's good to hear. I've been thinking a lot about him... If I could get some more time off, I'd love to pay him a visit.
Setaria: Actually, while we're talking about him... Is he still living in Port Ormos?
Akim: Yeah, he's been retired there for a while.
Setaria: If you could find the time, please write him a letter. Let him know that recently, faith in King Deshret has taken root in Port Ormos, and has begun to spread across Sumeru...
Setaria: He has a quick temper, and has always been a devout follower of the Dendro Archon... I don't want him to get into a fight with those King Deshret believers because of a difference in beliefs.
Akim: Oh? So who are you siding with in all of this? The Akademiya or King Deshret?
Setaria: Uh, I...
Akim: *sigh* I'm so jealous of you — you were born a child of the desert. Yet, you chose to betray King Deshret, and now you spend all your time with those crooks from the Akademiya...
Setaria: Akim...? You don't mean... You've also become a believer of King Deshret?
Akim: What's so strange about becoming a believer of the wise King Deshret? In fact, aren't you the strange one — the one who still can't pick a side?
Setaria: C—Can't pick a side... Me?
Paimon: #Whoa, {NICKNAME}! Paimon had no idea you'd be so good at this.
Traveler: Before I knew it, I really started getting into the role.
Nahida: You really zeroed in on the issue and put it right in front of her. It might feel a bit overwhelming for Setaria...
Nahida: But once everything is over, I'll be sure to pay a visit to her mind and explain everything. Anyway, let's keep going.
Traveler: I wasn't too harsh, was I?
Traveler: He's feeling a lot better. He can lift stuff now.
Setaria: Huh? Wasn't he nursing a leg injury? If I recall correctly, his strong arms had always been his pride and joy.
Akim: Uhh, he... sprained his arm a while back while trying to show off his strength. I thought you'd heard.
Traveler: Uh, masonry work.
Setaria: Oh, right, your old man's craft... How could I forget?

## Talk 9

Setaria: ...So, Qishan, have you noticed anything weird in the city lately?
Setaria: Like... as if someone was trying to preach to you about something.
Traveler: No, I've been spending all my time studying in the basement.
Traveler: No, I've been spending all my time studying in the attic.
Setaria: Wait, did you just say attic? I thought this place didn't have an attic... Also, don't you usually study in the basement?
Qishan: Uh, well... The restaurant recently added an attic. I've been studying there because it has better lighting.
Qishan: Oh right, speaking of strange things...
Qishan: I celebrated the Sabzeruz Festival so many times that I lost count. That was really weird.
Setaria: Wait, how could you be aware of that!? That should be impossible. Nothing in the report indicated anything like that...
Qishan: Are you still failing to realize that the Akademiya's lowly tricks could never deceive all of Sumeru's citizens?
Setaria: ...
Setaria: ...Qishan, don't tell me that you've converted to King Deshret as well?
Qishan: What an absurd question. You make it sound like I should be ashamed for becoming a believer of King Deshret.
Qishan: In reality, shouldn't you be the one who is ashamed? You, who worked side-by-side with the Akademiya and treated people as nothing more than experimental subjects?
Setaria: Please... Please stop!
Paimon: Even now, Setaria's still trying to run from her problems...
Traveler: Did I push too hard?
Nahida: She can no longer justify everything to herself...
Paimon: Hey, she's trying to talk to the guards! What should we do?
Nahida: This is the most important part of all. Quick, get ready!
Setaria: ...Mercenary, you're a member of the Corps of Thirty, correct? Please help me pass a message to the matra right away. The situation in the city is getting out of control...
Rima: Please, try to remain calm, miss. Tell me, what's happening in the city?
Setaria: Heretics are infiltrating the city, and they've already converted many residents to their side...
Rima: Heretics? What kind of heresy are you talking about?
Setaria: King Deshret! Many people I know have suddenly started believing in him, but he's long dead... It's impossible...
Rima: Miss Setaria... Nothing is impossible.
Setaria: Y—You know my name?
Rima: King Deshret is immortal, and all who defy him will one day pay the price.
Rima: You must face the truth, Setaria. You tread a treacherous path, and the longer you ignore it, the tighter the Akademiya's grasp on you will become, and the deeper you will be ensnared.
Rima: Child of King Deshret, never forget that the desert that belongs to you lies elsewhere.
Akim: What's so strange about becoming a believer of the wise King Deshret? In fact, aren't you the strange one — the one who still can't pick a side?
Nabiya: "Setaria, why haven't you gone home?"
Setaria: ...
Setaria: *sigh* ...It seems that no matter where I run, I only keep finding more believers of King Deshret. I have to say, this is a familiar feeling...
Setaria: I've also been running from my guilt this whole time... Guilt over my part in the sages' plans, and from ignoring the letters from the children of my homeland.
Setaria: But no matter how much I may try to ignore or get rid of it, my guilt always comes back.
Traveler: You should follow your heart.
Traveler: It's not too late to turn back.
Rima: You won't necessarily lose your research opportunities by facing the truth. Besides, did you really want to conduct your research while carrying such heavy feelings of guilt?
Setaria: How do you know me so well? Are you truly just a believer of King Deshret, or are you the god himself?
Rima: That's not important. The important thing is to pass judgment on the Akademiya and its sages, and to correct their mistakes.
Rima: If you could provide some assistance in this matter, perhaps it could serve as a form of atonement.
Setaria: I've actually never believed in the gods, but I've always believed in serendipity. Your appearance must be a fated opportunity for me to get out of this wretched situation.
Setaria: Please tell me... What can I do for you?
Traveler: (Great, we've finally convinced her.)
Rima: Ahem... How much do you know about the sages' current activities?
Setaria: I was just one of the designers for the Mass Dream Harvest scheme... which is what happened around the Sabzeruz Festival.
Setaria: But I know very little about the full scope of the overall project. I'd assume that only staff with the highest clearance would have access to those confidential documents...
Setaria: I've just been working to meet the Grand Sage's specified requirements.
Setaria: However, there's something that's been really bothering me... I heard that a scholar who was previously expelled has returned to the city, and even the sages are still quite wary of him...
Traveler: (An outcast that even the sages are still wary of?)
Rima: To fight against the Akademiya, we will need to figure out the nature and the purpose of their work. Is there a way for us to get access to the confidential documents you mentioned?
Setaria: It should be possible if we're willing to take some risks. After all, I'm an assistant to the Grand Sage, and I've been working on many tasks outside of the project.
Setaria: One thing, though... I won't be able to transfer the documents to you through the Akasha once I get my hands on them. The sages have always closely monitored all activities within the Akasha.
Setaria: Hmm, let me see... Let's use the most primitive method. Send someone to pick up the documents tomorrow evening at the Akademiya entrance.
Rima: The Akademiya entrance... Wouldn't that be too conspicuous?
Setaria: Don't worry about that. I assure you, this won't be a trap.
Setaria: I'm only suggesting this location because it'll draw more scrutiny for me to leave the Akademiya again. It'll be safest for me to distract the guards long enough to hand you the documents.
Rima: Alright, I trust you.
Setaria: So... If I were to successfully complete this task, would it mean I've atoned for my wrongdoings?
Rima: Umm... That'll depend on the judgment of the Dendro Archon.
Setaria: The Dendro Archon... That's right, her people are the ones we have endangered. As the God of Wisdom, she's also the one responsible for judging and guiding the scholars.
Setaria: ...Maybe it's time for me to find a god to believe in.
Paimon: Just as Nahida predicted, we've managed to bring Setaria to our side...
Nahida: #{NICKNAME}'s execution was ingenious. {F#She}{M#He}'s the one who deserves all the praise.
Nahida: Well, now that we've made plans to meet again tomorrow evening, all we can do is pray for Setaria's mission to go off without a hitch.
Paimon: Pray? But if we're going to pray to the gods, aren't we just praying to you, God of Wisdom and guardian of the scholars?
Nahida: Me? No, no. The truth is the true guardian of scholars — I've always believed that. Anyway, let's meet again tomorrow evening at the Adventurers' Guild.

## Talk 10

Nabiya: I've never seen Harut and Marut be so wary of anyone...

## Talk 11

Paimon: Katheryne, we're here! Oh, hmm... You're the "other" Katheryne, right?
Nahida: That's right. I suppose I'm the "other Katheryne" in your mind.
Traveler: Can't we just call her Nahida?
Paimon: Shh...! We're on a secret mission tonight, so we need to protect Katheryne's identity!
Nahida: Yep, Paimon's right. We cannot fully rule out the chance that the meet-up tonight is just a trap.
Nahida: If something were to happen, my existence may be the only trump card we'll be able to play.
Nahida: After all, the Akademiya should still be unable to confirm the existence of my consciousness in the outside world.
Paimon: Yep, yep! Exactly, just what Paimon was thinking!
Traveler: I somehow doubt that...
Paimon: Ugh... Anyway, enough about that! Let's just make sure to be on our guard!
Traveler: Speaking of which...
Paimon: Off? What do you feel is off?
Traveler: It's just a little too quiet around here.
Paimon: It's the middle of the night — of course it's quiet! You're not getting paranoid, are you?
Nahida: #No, I think {NICKNAME}'s right. It really is a lot quieter than usual.
Nahida: If you look around, there seems to be fewer people on the streets. I'm not sure if this is the case for the entire city, though...
Paimon: Huh, maybe it's just a coincidence? Maybe Setaria figured out a way to not only distract the guards, but also to get everyone to go to sleep early, just so we can exchange the documents in peace.
Nahida: I also can't quite figure out why things feel a little off... But, now that we're here, let's go ahead and meet her as we planned.
Paimon: Well, regardless... as long as you're here with us, Paimon feels a little safer!
Traveler: Don't you feel like something is off?

Paimon: Missing text (671980282)

## Talk 14

Paimon: This should be far enough... Phew, Paimon needs to catch her breath first.
Paimon: Is Nahida going to be okay? We only made it out because of her...
Traveler: She can jump between minds. Hopefully she'll be fine?
Paimon: Paimon wasn't counting on running into a new Harbinger here, let alone such a high-ranking one! That guy was number two... so scary...
Paimon: He called himself "The Doctor"... Remember Tighnari told us about him. Setaria did say that someone who once got expelled from the Akademiya came back recently...
Paimon: ...and that even the sages are wary of him. Yep, sounds like she must've been talking about The Doctor.
Traveler: We underestimated the scale of this problem.
Paimon: Yeah. Now that The Doctor's in the picture, we're no longer just dealing with the Akademiya — they're in cahoots with the Fatui.
Paimon: But what are the Fatui after this time? Another Gnosis?
Traveler: We need to find a way to reunite with Nahida.
Paimon: Yeah, things would be a lot easier with Nahida's help.
Paimon: Nahida said "We'll meet again outside of the city," but we can't just keep waiting around, right?
Traveler: Let's start our own investigation.
Paimon: Eh? You mean...
Traveler: Let's go find Tighnari.
Paimon: Oh! Right, wasn't he invited by the sages to work on some project when we were staying with him in the Avidya Forest? That has to be the same project.
Paimon: Even though he turned it down at that time, he might still know something.
Paimon: There's no time to lose. Let's go to Gandharva Ville!
Traveler: Let's go find someone else who might be involved.
Traveler: We underestimated the number of parties involved.
Traveler: I'm not sure... that guy was pretty terrifying.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Possess a key figure in the Akademiya?
Nahida: I've already tried that, but all the key members of the Akademiya — even the Corps of Thirty guards — intentionally avoid wearing their Akasha Terminals.
Nahida: It seems that from the very beginning, they've been guarding against info leaks from the Akasha. Of course, it could also be because they're wary of me.
Paimon: Have you already caught the sages' attention?
Nahida: I'm guessing not yet, but distrusting me would make perfect sense if they ever paid attention to the urban legends about me.
Nahida: In any case, I probably can't take over their minds directly.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Possess a student and infiltrate the sages' quarters?
Nahida: No way. That's too risky.
Paimon: You mean it'd be too easy to get caught?
Nahida: No, it's not that. We shouldn't involve innocent students in this. A single mistake could completely ruin their lives.
Nahida: Doing that would be ignoring the safety of my people for my own selfish goals. How is that any different from what the sages are doing?
Paimon: That's a good point. Spoken like the God of Sumeru!

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: We could grab someone close to the sages and question them?
Nahida: We're in the dark as of now. Since we still don't know anything about their goals, any rash move could tip them off and lead to terrible consequences.
Nahida: After all, every person in Sumeru City is one of their hostages.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: I can't think of anything else.
Paimon: Hmm... Are we really out of ideas?
Paimon: Nahida, you're super smart, so you already have something in mind, right? Don't keep us in suspense — spill the beans already!
Nahida: According to a popular theory from the Vahumana Darshan of the Akademiya, rejecting impractical motions at the beginning of a planning session will give more weight to the actual proposal.
Paimon: Okay, okay, but aren't you the God of Wisdom? You don't have to use that kind of gimmick to make us take your ideas seriously.
Nahida: Well, I've been thinking that if I can't directly possess the leaders, and if I can't get ordinary people involved...
Nahida: Then I should find someone who's already involved, but hasn't decided to side with the sages.
Paimon: You're saying we should recruit a spy? Hmm, that does sound like it could work.
Paimon: Oh! Before coming back, we met someone named Alhaitham. He seems like he acts alone, and he likes doing stuff behind the Akademiya's back. They probably aren't in cahoots.
Nahida: Actually, I already have someone in mind. Do you still remember that female scholar named Setaria?
Paimon: Setaria... Paimon remembers now! Isn't she the one who's always trailing behind the Grand Sage of the Akademiya?
Paimon: We ran into her basically every time the Sabzeruz Festival repeated itself. You could even say we're old enemies by now...
Paimon: Paimon still remembers the smug and mean way she always spoke to Nilou!
Nahida: Mm-hmm. I've always liked observing all kinds of people, and Setaria has always stood out from the crowd.
Nahida: She was born in the desert, and was hailed as their greatest genius. Her academic gifts allowed her special admission into the Akademiya, and also gave her the opportunity to serve as the sages' assistant.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon didn't know she was from the desert! She must be pretty special, then. Paimon feels like most of the desert-dwellers around the city are working as mercenaries.
Nahida: The name Setaria means "star." When she lived in the desert, she shone like the brightest star in the night sky.
Nahida: Later on, she was chosen by the Sun. The star was given a place in the daytime sky to complement the Sun's dazzling light.
Nahida: Soon after, the star witnessed the Sun scorching the earth, which brought forth many disasters.
Nahida: The star began to waver. Instead of staying beside such a sun, wouldn't it be better to return and light up part of the night sky?
Nahida: But in the end, she couldn't give up the radiance of daytime. To cope with her shame, the star buried her guilt and closed her eyes...
Traveler: This is no longer just a metaphor...
Paimon: From the sound of it, Setaria's just hung up on the research opportunities here...
Paimon: But she doesn't really support the Akademiya. She still feels guilty about not doing more for the desert, right...? She's just running away from her problems!
Nahida: Indeed. When they are presented with complex moral issues, many people will simply plug their ears and go with the flow until the problem can't be fixed anymore.
Nahida: She's suppressing a lot of guilt, but before she realized it, she had already become the sages' accomplice. She can't deny her part in their schemes anymore.
Traveler: Sounds exactly like the person we need.
Nahida: Right. We must somehow make her face her problems again...
Nahida: That way, not only can we get useful intel from her, but she can also use it as an opportunity to redeem herself.
Nahida: From my past observations, Setaria will take a day off from the Akademiya every ten days to do some shopping in the city.
Nahida: Tomorrow afternoon just happens to be a shopping day for her. That'll be our chance.
Nahida: To prepare, let's go check out some of her favorite spots, and have a quick chat with a few of the vendors there.
Traveler: Those are Setaria's true thoughts, right?

### Additional Talk 5

Akim: That was my first time talking with Miss Katheryne. Hehe, I'm sure I sounded a bit nervous...

### Additional Talk 6

Qishan: I must have met her somewhere. Why can't I remember?

### Additional Talk 7

Nabiya: Huh? What's gotten into Harut and Marut? They seem terrified of me all of a sudden...

### Additional Talk 8

Akim: Whoa... What happened just now? Wasn't I talking with Setaria? Where'd she go?

### Additional Talk 9

Qishan: *yawn* I seem to have dozed off just now... Maybe I studied way too late last night? Ah, I'm sorry, can I help you with anything?

### Additional Talk 10

Nahida: Actually, I've already done a little bit of work on that, but for now, I want to hear your thoughts.
