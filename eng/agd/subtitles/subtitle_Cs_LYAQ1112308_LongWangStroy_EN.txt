In our last tale
Rex Lapis was walking alone in the mountains
He heard a remote voice unlike any other
Coming from a crack in the earth
Most of the ancient Geo life forms that live below Liyue are blind
Having not seen the sunlight for an age
The voice was sometimes sad and songlike, other times it was loud and thunderous
The Lord of Geo searched here and there
Before finally unearthing a strange stone from the bedrock
That's how Azhdaha was
I answered his wish, and took him above ground
The Lord of Geo took pity on the rock's spirit
And carved it into a magnificent work of craftsmanship â€” a vivid representation of a dragon
I bestowed him with a pair of eyes to see the world
And came to an agreement with him
With his fingers, he made two eyes
Quicker than words could tell, lightning flashed and thunder roared
And a living, breathing dragon soared into the clouds!
I agreed to let him live among the people above ground
But if the day ever came when he brought ruin to order
He would once again be sealed in the dark
The dragon accompanied the Lord of Geo
Fighting campaigns alongside him in the four corners of the world
We have a saying to eulogize these events:
"The crash of a spear brought billowing dust"
"The mountains and waters made way at the sound"
"The sight of a dragon bestowed with a touch"
"The promise of rainwater blessing the ground"
