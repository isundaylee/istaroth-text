Hoturoa: It's a pity, I'm not really good at anything except for swimming...

Traveler: Having one specialty is pretty good already.
Hoturoa: Haha... You're right, but most People of the Springs do know how to swim, yes?
Hoturoa: If you're looking for people with much natural talent for battle, we'd disappoint you. Pretty lackluster on the ambition front, too...
Hoturoa: But we're serious as can be when facing battle head-on — in terms of attitude, anyway!
Hoturoa: Anyway, I should get stronger after learning some weapon-handling techniques... or after doing some grappling with the Collective of Plenty!

Traveler: Good luck.
Hoturoa: ...Fair enough. I'll make sure I keep up the swimming!

Traveler: Don't push yourself too hard.
Hoturoa: O—Oh, don't worry, I'm not! The whole point of a goal you set yourself is to put in the effort to achieve it, right?
Hoturoa: That way, even if it doesn't work out just like you wanted, you won't have any regrets.
