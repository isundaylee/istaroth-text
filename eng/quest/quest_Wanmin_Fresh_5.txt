# Wanmin Fresh


## Talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
Chef Mao: Sure. Just need to think of some other person who can get it there...

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure, I'll deliver it.
Chef Mao: I'm counting on you, then.
Chef Mao: Be careful out there in the Guyun Stone Forest. Mind you don't get attacked by some ill-starred thing.

## Talk 3

Curious Zi'rui: Why isn't the food here yet? It's been ages...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. That boy Zi'rui ordered some Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup from us. As I recall, he should be off wandering in the Guyun Stone Forest right about now.
Chef Mao: So many young people, all headed out to that weird place â€” what is Liyue coming to nowadays?
Chef Mao: Whatever the case may be, could I trouble you to deliver this meal to him? *Just don't fly about too much,* or the soup'll spill out.
