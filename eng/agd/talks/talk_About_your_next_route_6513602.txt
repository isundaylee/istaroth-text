Traveler: About your next route...
Galathee: My first mate and I haven't really made plans just yet, but I do hope that we'll make it a little further.
Galathee: Each time I return to land and look back upon the route that we just took in this manner, I can't help but sigh...
Galathee: Even the longest of sea routes is still all too short when seen from on high.
Galathee: Perhaps one cannot traverse every river and every ocean in a single lifetime.
Galathee: But since I've chosen this path... You never know what you'll encounter unless you try, right? Haha.
