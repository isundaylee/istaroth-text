# Ring of Boreas

A bit of crystallized ice from the Great Wolf King of the North.
This land was once a realm of freezing-cold blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards, all at the command of Boreas. Though his power may have diminished, he could still freeze the land in an instant.
