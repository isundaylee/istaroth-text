"Masanori": You're here.
"Masanori": Shall we spar?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Well then, have at it.
"Masanori": Very good. Let us fight.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'd like to talk.
"Masanori": I have forsaken my past. There is nothing to be said between me and this world.
"Masanori": If you are looking for someone to chat with, you have come to the wrong person.
"Masanori": Kindly leave.

## Talk 4

"Masanori": Haha. I am still not your match.
"Masanori": I should probably have expected that. You are ever advancing in skill, and the limits of my nature prevent me from making a similar breakthrough.
"Masanori": Nonetheless, should you learn any new techniques, I would be glad to see them.
"Masanori": Until we meet again, then.

## Talk 5

"Masanori": It seems that you have neglected your training.
"Masanori": A single day of sloth will waste ten of a warrior's work. I'm sure you understand this principle well.
"Masanori": Hone yourself further. I do not believe that is all you can do.
