### Additional Talk 1

Arataki Itto: This makes no sense... How did you do that!? My... my reputation is destroyed!
No-Frills Instant Kill: It was an honor doing battle with you, good Sir.
Arataki Itto: What the... So polite!
Paimon: Haha! So, been busy losing while we were away, Bull-Chu{RUBY#[S]"Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King"}cker?
No-Frills Instant Kill: I don't see it that way. Unless the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King is ready to give up now, he hasn't lost to me yet.
No-Frills Instant Kill: In battle, and in life, it's normal to hit setbacks every once in a while. But a setback only turns into a failure if you make the decision to stop trying.
Arataki Itto: Word! Heck yeah! I ain't about to admit defeat yet!
No-Frills Instant Kill: Still, there's nothing to be gained from constantly making excuses. Don't put all your energy into talking garbage — spend it on fighting a little harder instead.
Arataki Itto: Oof, burn...
Grandmaster Hanakado: Oni King, this brand of enemy doesn't seem to be your area of expertise. I advise you send in another of your generals and observe the duel in detail.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Watching others do battle is also a crucial part of a warrior's training. Some skills, one learns by doing. Others, one learns through observation.
Arataki Itto: Good point, Grandmaster! And good timing, compadre! Oni King's Right Hand, I'm handing the fight over to you!
Paimon: #Hehe, finally it's your turn! Make it count, Traveler!
Traveler: Hehe! Piece of cake!
No-Frills Instant Kill: #So I'm going head-to-head with the legendary Traveler? Guess I'd better look sharp...
Traveler: Uh-oh! I'm scared!

### Additional Talk 2

No-Frills Instant Kill: Nicely done. You beat me.
No-Frills Instant Kill: #I'd go as far as to say that it's an honor to lose against Traveler.
Arataki Itto: Ahhh, so that's how you do it! I never would've thought of that!
Paimon: Yup! When you're up against a cunning enemy, you gotta get creative.
Paimon: When your tactics fail, you have to change your point of view. In our journeys far and wide, we often have to think on our feet!
Paimon: Clinging to old methods can never solve the problem, no matter how hard you try!
Arataki Itto: I think Shinobu said something like that once, too. I guess there's something to it after all...
Arataki Itto: But I'll mull it over some other time. Right now, my focus is on the task at hand — more beetle-fighting!
