Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Eula: That I'd like to do? Why are you asking?
Traveler: Because I want to accompany you.
Eula: ...
Eula: What a weird statement.
Eula: If that's the case, then let me teach you how to dance. Specifically, the "Dance of Sacrifice."
Eula: I told you, I've incorporated dance into my swordplay. If you want to learn my sword techniques, you'll need to learn to dance first.
Eula: Actually, dance is also my favorite artistic pastime...
Eula: It's time for you to learn.
Traveler: Is there a duet?
Eula: Practice your basic dance steps first, then we'll talk.

Eula: But thinking about it... Since we're already this far, then I'll turn a blind eye to any new grievance.
Eula: After all, my vengeance for you runs deep... It has long been inextricable.
Traveler: If I step on your feet...
Eula: Then I ought to reserve the darkest and most grievous of vengeance for you...
