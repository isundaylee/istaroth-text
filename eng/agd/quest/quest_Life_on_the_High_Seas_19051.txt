# Life on the High Seas


## Talk 1

Beidou: People used to call this place "Downriver," because the villagers apparently moved here from a place called "Upriver."
Beidou: With them, they brought their knowledge of fishing which had been passed down from generation to generation. I learned a lot from them when I was here.
Beidou: Now, Upriver is long gone and Downriver is all but deserted. It won't be long before no one even remembers what these places are called.

## Talk 2

Beidou: About a year or two after I arrived, the village chief fell ill during the winter and passed away.
Beidou: During that same period, the harvest was getting worse and the fishermen's catch was getting smaller day by day.
Beidou: Without the village chief to handle the situation, people began blaming each other. There were even rumors that some families had been overfishing, leaving nothing for the rest of the village to catch.
Beidou: But in the end, they all turned on me, saying that they shouldn't have ever taken me in. They said I was bad luck.
Beidou: They pointed to how that dog died on the first day I arrived.
Beidou: Next thing you know, the village chief dies, then all the fish die out.
Beidou: They said I was a living curse, and the downfall of the village was all my fault.
Beidou: I told them that I didn't understand. I'm not a curse, I'm just Beidou.
Beidou: Then some of the villagers started shouting and drove me out of the village.
Beidou: They shouted, "Nandou controls life! Beidou controls death... Beidou controls death!"
Beidou: Before then, all I knew about my name was that it had something to do with the stars.
Beidou: It wasn't until then that I realized that Beidou was a constellation, and the Alcor, one of its stars, was an omen of death.

## Talk 3

Xu Liushi: Hello, Traveler. Are you here to learn about marine meteorology?
Traveler: Wait, how did you know?
Xu Liushi: Haha, in my line of work, I've got to have a pair of sharp eyes.
Xu Liushi: I saw the captain showing you around the training grounds, and then you went to see Yinxing and Huixing.
Xu Liushi: So, I figured that she probably wants you to get to know the life of a crew member.
Traveler: You have a real knack for your work.
Xu Liushi: Hehe! Okay, let's get started. First, I'll introduce you to the basics of meteorology.
Xu Liushi: Marine meteorology basically means keeping tabs on the weather as well as other ocean phenomena, so things like sea fog, storm surges, waterspouts, and so on...
Xu Liushi: These are all potential threats to safe navigation. Luckily, whatever weather might be coming up, there's always some kind of sign that gives it away in advance.
Xu Liushi: Take waterspouts for example. They're caused by high-speed rotating winds on the surface of the ocean. They can engulf large ships and do immense damage.
Xu Liushi: But, if you know that waterspouts can only form in an environment with high temperature, high humidity, and large clouds, then you can be well-prepared.
Xu Liushi: You will be even more alert if you also know that the presence of winds blowing in opposite directions with a significant difference in speed is a direct precursor to the formation of waterspouts.
Xu Liushi: And most importantly, if you spot a small white vortex emerging from the clouds, you should immediately notify the crew to steer clear of what's ahead.
Xu Liushi: So there you go, those are the warning signs of waterspouts. I am proud to say that, over the years, I haven't let a single one sneak up on my watch.
Traveler: You must have sharp eyesight.
Xu Liushi: Well, I'm good at reading the sea, but I'm not as good as the captain when it comes to reading people.
Xu Liushi: Do you know the small fishing village next to Wangshu Inn? I heard that when Captain was a kid, she worked there fishing with the adults.
Xu Liushi: Later, she made her way into the harbor, where she struggled to make a living. Heh, managing to survive in an environment like that as a kid is solid proof of the Captain's capabilities.
Xu Liushi: If it wasn't for her, I never would have dreamed of taking this job. She gave me confidence and told me I could do it.
Xu Liushi: You may not have heard, but I'm best known outside the Crux Fleet for a slightly infamous story involving me, Third-Round Knockout, and a few too many...
Xu Liushi: Who would ever have thought that the rookie sailor who fell drunk into the sea and became a laughingstock among their now-former crewmates would then go on to become a lookout for The Crux? But it's the unbelievable truth, haha.
Xu Liushi: It proves that having skills alone is not enough. You need someone like the Captain who is a good judge of character.
Traveler: Thanks for your time. I think I've learned all that I need for now.
Xu Liushi: Find me anytime if you want to know more.
Traveler: Sounds like you have a lot of experience.
Xu Liushi: I've gotta confess, I learned almost everything I know from the Captain.
Xu Liushi: All the stuff about meteorology that I just told you about... she's the real expert.
Xu Liushi: Do you know the small fishing village next to Wangshu Inn? I heard that when Captain Beidou was a kid, she worked there, fishing.
Xu Liushi: Later, she made her way into the harbor, where she struggled to make a living. Heh, growing up in an environment like that, it's no wonder she knows everything about the sea.
Xu Liushi: When I first came onboard, I lived every day wallowing in doubt, wondering if my former career as a sailor was all just a waste.
Xu Liushi: But as I gradually learned some new things and became more experienced, I finally realized what makes The Crux so great.
Xu Liushi: After all, not every fleet has the "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean" as their leader. I feel lucky just to have joined.
Traveler: Looks like Beidou got the right person for the job.
