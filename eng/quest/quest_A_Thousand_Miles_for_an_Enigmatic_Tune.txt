# A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune


## Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon votes we go say hi to Xiangling first...
Paimon: Eh? Zhongli! What a pleasant surprise meeting you here!
Zhongli: Oh? Why, the pleasure is all mine... as is the surprise, surely.
Zhongli: It must be fate that brings us together in this place. How have you fared as of late?
Traveler: Everything has been going great.
Zhongli: I sense you are older and wiser than the last time we met. It seems your travels continue to yield valuable insights.
Traveler: Thank you, Zhongli.
Zhongli: You are too kind.
Paimon: So Zhongli, are you here to listen to stories over tea again?
Zhongli: I had originally planned to set out after this last round of tea. However...
Paimon: However...?
Zhongli: I had planned to take a walk to Qingce Village and gather some nascent Bamboo Shoots, which are currently in season. A villager there once gave me a small sample, and they possessed a most excellent flavor.
Paimon: Huh? "Nascent" Bamboo Shoots...? Why can't you just use normal Bamboo Shoots instead?
Paimon: Wait, Paimon knows! Because Zhongli prefers the finer things in life, right?
Paimon: Okay, Mr. Particular, lemme guess... The "nascent" Bamboo Shoot has a uniquely tender texture and a delicate, sweet taste that its "normal" cousin cannot match.
Zhongli: An astute observation, Paimon. You know me well indeed.
Zhongli: Lantern Rite is almost upon us, but besides the Bamboo Shoots, there are a few other items I have not yet procured from Director Hu's list... May I ask if you have already made arrangements for the days ahead?
Paimon: Uh, well, we were planning to use the opportunity to say hi to some of our friends! But before we were able to figure out a schedule, we ran into you.
Zhongli: Well then, might I invite you to imagine the sheer delight that is a soup cooked with the freshest nascent Bamboo Shoots in all the land? Generous cuts of pork belly and crisp, fragrant Bamboo Shoots, placed together in the pot, and left to simmer slowly for half a day...
Traveler: I've never had anything like it...
Paimon: Ugh! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!? Paimon's onto your plan — you just wanna hoodwink us into fetching your bamboo for you!
Zhongli: Hmm? Why, I assure you, I would do no such thing. I merely wished to inform you of the freshest, most succulent and flavorful Bamboo Shoots one could ever hope to taste.
Paimon: #You... Ugh, let's go, {NICKNAME}! Paimon's tastebuds can't take it anymore!
Traveler: Ready to go when you are!
Paimon: Collecting a few Bamboo Shoots shouldn't take too long. Paimon has got to get her hands on some of that soup!
Zhongli: Such fine specimens are indeed well worth the excursion. Very well, I shall leave the Bamboo Shoots to you. Should you have the good fortune to find some, please share them with me as well.
Paimon: See, see! Paimon knew he was just bamboozling us!
Zhongli: However, there is no need to rush.
Zhongli: The streets of Liyue will be bustling with visitors and filled with all manner of celebrations during the festive period. By all means, go wherever your interests lead you.
Zhongli: The nascent Bamboo Shoots would be but a wonderful final touch to a most exceptional feast. What an honor it would be to savor them in the company of friends.
Traveler: I understand.
Paimon: We're heading out! Enjoy your walk, Zhongli.
Zhongli: Take care now, you two.
Traveler: We will check in with you later at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Traveler: I'm already drooling...
Traveler: Things have been going... alright.
Zhongli: Setbacks are inevitable over the course of a long journey. If you wish to share what's troubling you, allow me to lend my ear. There is no need to shoulder all burdens by yourself.

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: A short and slender figure rescues the drowning man, and brings him back to shore...
Yaoyao: ...Are you okay? Did any water go down the wrong pipe?
Dvorak: *cough* *cough*...
Dvorak: Phew... I—I think I'm okay now. Thank you so much...
Paimon: That was scary... Well, at least you're alright! All thanks to your savior here... oh, a little girl?
Yaoyao: Greetings, everyone. My name is Yaoyao. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Paimon: Whoa, she's so well-mannered!
Paimon: #My name's Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Greetings.
Dvorak: I'm Dvorak, a musician from Fontaine.
Dvorak: I came through Stone Gate, intending to head towards Liyue Harbor, but then I became captivated by the beautiful scenery... and before long, I was completely lost.
Dvorak: Just now, I was so mesmerized by the waterfall that I slipped and fell into the water. If it weren't for Miss Yaoyao's help, I shudder to think what might have happened...
Yaoyao: It's alright, Mr. Dvorak.
Yaoyao: The splashing around the bottom of the waterfall means the stone path is always wet and slippy. You definitely have to be careful.
Yaoyao: Next time you're exploring an unfamiliar environment, try to focus on what's right in front of you. Don't let your mind wander.
Yaoyao: As long as you watch your step, accidents like this won't happen anymore!
Dvorak: Yes Ma'am, I understand... I'll remember to be more careful next time.
Dvorak: *grumble*
Yaoyao: Oh... Are you hungry, Sir?
Dvorak: Oh, uh... I'll be fine, heh...
Yaoyao: Please, Sir, it's quite alright! I was born and raised here in Liyue. It's only natural for me to extend my hospitality to any guests who are passing through.
Yaoyao: I expect you still have quite a long journey ahead of you? It's very important to keep your energy levels up.
Yaoyao: I still have some Lotus Flower Crisps left in my backpack. Why don't we split them between the four of us?
Paimon: Aww... what a thoughtful kid! She even has some for Paimon!
Yaoyao: Hehe, you're welcome!
Black Screen Text: Everyone savors some Delicious Lotus Flower Crisps as they enjoy the scenery...
Paimon: Mmm, so tasty... If only there were more...
Traveler: More!? You already had the Sumpter Beast's share...
Yaoyao: Having a healthy appetite is a good thing! It means Paimon's still growing. If I'd known I was gonna run into you, I would have made a second batch.
Paimon: Hope you're taking notes, Traveler. This is how you treat your Paimon!
Yaoyao: What do you think, Sir? Are Liyue's snacks to your taste? I wonder if they're not sweet enough?
Dvorak: No no, they're perfect.
Dvorak: When I was traveling through Mondstadt, I had a chance to try one of their Moon Pies. It had a meat filling, unlike these crisps. But apart from that, it seems like they follow a similar cooking process. Both are delicious in their own way.
Dvorak: As for Fontaine's cooking, though... Ah, it's been a long time since I've had a taste of home.
Paimon: Sounds like you spend a lot of time on the road, huh?
Dvorak: I do. It's part of my job — I'm one of the main organizers of the Iridescence Tour.
Paimon: Iridescence Tour?
Traveler: That sounds somewhat familiar.
Dvorak: The Iridescence Tour is one of the biggest music festivals in Fontaine. We're looking to expand, though. Our aim is to hold a festival in every nation.
Dvorak: At least, all the main organizers share this goal. Unfortunately...
Dvorak: *sigh* It's a long story, so I'll spare you the details. But anyway, so the main reason I'm traveling all around Teyvat is to promote our music festivals. But I have some... personal reasons, too.
Paimon: Well, what are they? Just tell us already!
Dvorak: Let me see... well, to explain it in full, I'd have to start with a story from my ancestors... I don't want to take up too much of your time?
Yaoyao: I love listening to stories!
Paimon: Mm-hmm, we want to hear it too!
Dvorak: Okay. Then I'll start from the beginning.
Dvorak: The story goes that my ancestor, who was also a traveler, once slipped and fell into a lake during his travels. As he was sinking and gasping for breath, he heard a wondrous tune in the air...
Dvorak: They say it was the most beautiful, moving melody he had ever heard.
Dvorak: Even in that life-and-death moment, the ethereal music seized his full attention, and almost made him forget the fact that he was drowning...
Dvorak: When he finally came to, he found that he had already been brought ashore. Not too far from him stood an unfamiliar woman with an almost divine aura.
Dvorak: Once she saw that he was no longer in danger, she left without a word.
Dvorak: My ancestor tried to run after her to give his thanks. But although a mere dozen paces separated them, no matter how quickly he gave chase, he drew no closer, and remained a dozen paces behind.
Dvorak: In the end, all he could do was to bow in thanks to the woman as he watched her walk away towards the rivers and mountains in the distance, before at last he turned around and made his way home.
Dvorak: Once he returned to Fontaine, he began to learn an instrument, so that he could spread his story far and wide, just like the bards.
Dvorak: After generations of retelling, embellishing, and dramatizing, people have come to think of that lady as something like a fairy.
Dvorak: The story's become something of a local legend in Fontaine. It's called, "The Lady Overlooking the Lake."
Dvorak: People now say that if you go down to the lakeside and play an instrument, so long as you play a pleasing melody, you will hear a fairy lady, who is hiding out of sight, playing along with you...
Yaoyao: Wowwwww!
Traveler: It's a nice legend.
Dvorak: Well, yes, as it stands now, it's become a touch too romantic and detached from reality... But I understand the original story and its historical grounding better than anyone else.
Dvorak: I wanted to find out the truth of this tale. So I decided to retrace my ancestor's steps, and search for that lady's modern-day descendants.
Dvorak: Of course, there's no way of knowing where my ancestor fell into the lake all those years ago. So I always knew that the search would be akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.
Dvorak: I've spent many years on the road now, and I'm nowhere near as fit as I was in my youth. The wish that I have spent half my life chasing after has now become something of an obsession...
Yaoyao: I haven't lived half of my life yet, but still... I understand how you must feel.
Paimon: Paimon too...
Paimon: It's like... imagine if you'd saved the center of a Lotus Flower Crisp — which is the best part, by the way — 'cause you wanted to eat it another day, but then suddenly, sploosh! It falls into the water, never to be seen again!
Paimon: Paimon would definitely remember that for the rest of her life!
Dvorak: Hahaha... There's no need to feel sorry for me. I have made some progress over the years. For example... I've concluded that the story must have taken place in Liyue.
Paimon: Ooh! So you finally found a lead?
Dvorak: Yes. In fact, that's an intriguing story in and of itself.
Dvorak: I'd always known that Mondstadt is the City of Song and Freedom. But more recently, I heard that the Anemo Archon returned to Mondstadt for a festival in the Fall, and learned that he himself is a patron deity of music.
Dvorak: So, I prayed for the Anemo Archon's guidance in the Mondstadt Cathedral... and as soon as I set foot back outside the front gate, I noticed a cluster of leaves being blown in the wind, further and further west, towards Stone Gate.
Dvorak: A friendly local told me that this meant the wind was guiding me in the direction of Liyue. So, I followed their advice, and made my way here.
Traveler: That settles it then. It was Liyue.
Dvorak: Right? You get it! I knew I'd find someone that agrees with me eventually.
Yaoyao: Hmm... are you sure? It sounds a bit too much like one of those fake legends told by those treasure hoarder guys to scam gullible grannies from Qingce Village...
Yaoyao: "Rex Lapis has returned to the world! Just give me some incense and a little Mora towards the travel fees, and I will pass your gift on to the Lord of Geo, and ask him to keep you and your family safe and well..." And so on, and so on.
Paimon: Don't worry, Yaoyao! We, uh... we have a lot of experience with deciphering omens and stuff.
Paimon: And anyway, you only got scammed if you handed over Mora, right?
Dvorak: Actually, to express my gratitude, I did spend rather a lot of Mora on several bottles of fine wine, which I left at the Statues of the Seven along the way...
Paimon: Oh dear...
Yaoyao: Well, how about this, ladies and gentlemen — why don't I bring you all to Yujing Terrace to see Miss Ganyu?
Yaoyao: I don't know very many people, so I can't help you out much, but Miss Ganyu and the Qixing know just about everything.
Yaoyao: If you've been scammed, they'll help you get your Mora back. And if the wind was telling the truth, and you wanna keep looking for that lady's family, they'll be the best people to ask.
Traveler: That does sound like a good idea.
Dvorak: But you've already helped me so much...
Yaoyao: I was gonna take some new medicinal herbs and plants I picked to Miss Ganyu anyway, so it's no trouble at all!
Paimon: You know what, it's been a minute since we saw Ganyu, too. It'd sure be nice to pay her a visit before Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Then let's get moving.
Dvorak: Alright. Well, my sincere thanks to you all. I will never forget your kindness.
Yaoyao: Okay, everyone, please follow me! I'll be your guide. Remember to watch where you're going, okay?
Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon's out of a job... Eh, oh well! Paimon'll just be a cheerleader instead!
Traveler: Let's head off.
Traveler: At its heart is a true story.
Dvorak: Exactly. It may just be a legend to others, but for me, it's a real part of my family history.
Traveler: Doesn't ring a bell.

## Talk 3

Dvorak: Wow, Liyue Harbor looks very different from when I came last...
Dvorak: It's almost as if... I'm listening to the same melody, but with a richer timbre, and new variations added...
Paimon: Well, we are here during Lantern Rite, after all! It only comes once a year, so they always have a big celebration.
Paimon: It's fair to say that this time of year is when Liyue Harbor looks the prettiest!
Dvorak: Great. Let's go and check it out.
Dvorak: I can't wait to get into the city and see it all up close for myself.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The doors and windows are all fine, so there definitely wasn't a break-in...

## Talk 5

Paimon: This place is completely empty... There's nothing valuable left here at all...

## Talk 6

Xinyan: Hey, everyone! Fancy meeting you all here! What a nice surprise.
Yaoyao: Hello, Xinyan! Let me introduce some new friends. They are...
Xinyan: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, and Mr. Dvorak, right? Hehe, I've known them all for quite a while.
Traveler: So you already know each other...
Dvorak: Haha... When I was last here to advertise a Liyue stop for the Iridescence Tour, Xinyan was one of the few people willing to give me the time of day.
Xinyan: Feels like I've been chasing this Iridescence Tour bandwagon halfway around the world, but I keep getting stood up. What's going on, Mr. Dvorak?
Dvorak: *sigh* I am so sorry, Xinyan. We've had a string of terrible luck recently, and every time we've tried to put on a show, something or other has come up to stop our plans from materializing...
Xinyan: Is that right... Hmm, I guess it can't be helped.
Xinyan: So what brings you to Liyue Harbor at this time of the year, anyway? Thinking of putting on a music festival during the Lantern Rite celebrations?
Paimon: A Lantern Rite music festival? Yes please!
Dvorak: No, uh... I'm actually here on personal business this time.
Xinyan: Aw, so no Lantern Rite music festival?
Dvorak: I mean... That's not just up to me.
Dvorak: Hosting a music festival takes a lot of funding and personnel. Moreover, I've never worked with the Liyue authorities before. Even if I were to start putting something together right now... I think it'd be too rushed.
Paimon: Wait, but we're going to meet the Liyue Qixing, aren't we? And they're the ones in charge.
Yaoyao: Uh-huh, that's right! Miss Keqing and Miss Ningguang can make anything happen.
Dvorak: You mean... What?
Xinyan: Hahaha, this is the perfect opportunity! Sure, it might not work out, but it can't hurt to bring it up as a suggestion.
Traveler: A Lantern Rite music festival would be something different.
Xinyan: #That's the spirit! See, even {NICKNAME} agrees with me. Mr. Dvorak, don't let yourself be put off by the fact that a few things haven't worked out recently.
Xinyan: As for the performers... I can put you in touch with some local artists.
Xinyan: My friend Yun Jin is a well-known opera singer in Liyue. With her support and a commissioned song from the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, we should be able to get something going.
Paimon: But what about you, Xinyan? Are you just going to sit this one out?
Xinyan: Haha, what do you take me for?
Xinyan: If we actually manage to make the Iridescence Tour: Lantern Rite Grand Concert a reality, you think I'd let anyone else perform the opening act!?
Paimon: Wow, there's that rock 'n' roll spirit, hehe.
Xinyan: What do ya say, Mr. Dvorak?
Dvorak: Hmm...
Dvorak: Hmm... Okay. I'll give it a shot.
Dvorak: But the opening act is not something to be chosen lightly, Xinyan. I will judge your work by the strictest of standards, so please make sure you are fully prepared.
Xinyan: Are you kidding? I thought you'd never ask!
Xinyan: Whew, guess my shopping time's getting cut short! I'm gonna head back right away and start working on this!
Xinyan: Yaoyao, if you run into your senior on your way to the Qixing, please send her my regards!
Yaoyao: Okay, I promise I will! Good luck with your music, Xinyan.
Paimon: You've got this, Xinyan!
Traveler: A Lantern Rite music festival would be a huge hit.

## Talk 7

Yaoyao: Oh! It's Master. Is it okay if I go and say hi to her?
Madame Ping: Oh, calm down now, dear, I'm not about to run off anywhere. I'm not a bundle of energy like you...
Yaoyao: I haven't seen you in days, Master! I've missed you.
Madame Ping: Aww, bless you, Yaoyao... you do say the sweetest things.
Madame Ping: Ah, look who it is. Visiting friends during the Lantern Rite, are we?
Traveler: Greetings, Madame Ping.
Paimon: You're half right, Madame Ping! We were also trying to help out Mr. Dvorak over here. We were on our way to take him to see the Qixing.
Dvorak: Hello, Ma'am. I am a musician from Fontaine, and an organizer of the Iridescence Tour... I don't suppose you've heard of it...
Yaoyao: Master, Master, the Iridescence Tour is a super famous music festival!
Madame Ping: Hehe... An old lady like me wouldn't know much about that sort of thing. A music festival, you say? It sounds terribly exciting.
Traveler: If we could add some musical elements to Lantern Rite...
Paimon: Oh right! Madame Ping, how would you feel about that?
Paimon: You're an elder of Liyue, and you know all about Liyue's cultural traditions. Hearing your thoughts would definitely help us figure out how best to approach it!
Paimon: For example... do you think it might be a bit too modern, or is there any other issue?
Madame Ping: Why, not at all. Music pays homage to history and culture, and it can also be a bridge between different civilizations.
Madame Ping: Times change, and the music enjoyed by the youngsters of today is, no doubt, very different from the tunes I was accustomed to in my youth. Nevertheless, all fine things in life can be appreciated.
Madame Ping: And so... I look forward to it immensely.
Dvorak: Hear, hear! I do believe that, my own dear grandmother aside, you are the wisest old lady I've ever met.
Madame Ping: Goodness gracious, you're all being suspiciously sweet today. Yaoyao, whatever have you been feeding them?
Yaoyao: Master, you're in such a great mood today! You're even cracking jokes with the rest of us.
Madame Ping: Hehe. Well, I'm sure you must have plenty to be getting on with, yes? Run along now, don't let me hold you up.
Paimon: Thanks, Madame Ping! We'll see you again soon!
Traveler: If we could organize a Lantern Rite music festival...

## Talk 8

Ganyu: ...and when you meet with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, please remind them that the festivities are not an excuse to procrastinate their work.
Baixiao: Understood, Miss Ganyu. I'll take my leave now.
Yaoyao: Ganyuuu!
Ganyu: What brings you here, Yaoyao?
Yaoyao: I've brought all the medicine you asked me to pick for you. Ah, and here's a pack of Sweet Flower seeds as well.
Yaoyao: Also, also, these dried Qingxin leaves make a great pot of tea that's very good for you.
Yaoyao: I know you've had a lot to deal with at work recently, but you shouldn't push yourself too hard. If you're not careful, you'll end up falling asleep in the grass again...
Paimon: Well this is weird. It's like a responsible younger sister talking to their disorganized older sister...
Ganyu: Ahem...
Traveler: Paimon, you're running your mouth again...
Ganyu: #Thank you, {NICKNAME}, but Paimon's criticism is quite valid. I do have a tendency to neglect matters outside of work, and that's something I should improve on.
Ganyu: Oh, my apologies, I don't believe we've been introduced?
Paimon: Ah! Paimon will do the honors!
Black Screen Text: Paimon tells Ganyu all about Mr. Dvorak, from how you met, to his family history, to your shared music festival aspirations.
Ganyu: Hmm...
Paimon: Wh—What's wrong? Did Paimon go over everything a bit too fast?
Paimon: It's definitely an ambitious plan... If there's anything you didn't quite catch, Paimon's more than happy to go over it again!
Ganyu: It may be... a little difficult to make this happen.
Paimon: Oh?
Ganyu: Well, the Lantern Rite is the most important festival of the year. Our celebrations must not only be visually spectacular, but also appeal to the tastes of Liyue citizens from all walks of life.
Ganyu: The Iridescence Tour is relatively unknown in Liyue. It's difficult to predict how a brand-new show will be received.
Ganyu: It would be quite risky for us to bet everything on this one music festival.
Dvorak: *sigh* All very valid points. I completely understand...
Ganyu: Therefore, we will not replace or cancel any of our preexisting program. However... I will submit a proposal requesting to put the Iridescence Tour special performance as the final act of this year's festivities.
Ganyu: Some live music will certainly add to the festive atmosphere on the night of the Lantern Rite. As for the venue... Hmm, let's reserve a space at the docks.
Traveler: So we're not stealing anyone's thunder...
Ganyu: Yes. My thoughts precisely.
Ganyu: Now I just need to take some time to give this proposal some polish...
Ganyu: #As long as I clearly lay out the pros and cons, and highlight the key points of the proposal... Given that Ping and {NICKNAME} have both given the idea their blessing, I'm confident the Qixing will be sure to give it serious consideration.
Ganyu: Mr. Dvorak, I will need to discuss with you the number of musicians who will be coming to Liyue, as well as their catering and accommodation requirements...
Dvorak: Oh, yes, certainly... Let's step to the side and discuss further.
Paimon: As soon as there's work to do, Ganyu's as diligent as ever...
Yaoyao: I couldn't agree more!
Yaoyao: Master once said that everyone has things that they are good at, and things that they are less good at. So, with that in mind, Ganyu shouldn't feel compelled to become perfect at absolutely everything.
Yaoyao: I'm good at taking care of people, so that can be left to me.
Paimon: Wow... Hey, Yaoyao, can you take care of Paimon too? Paimon's getting hungry again!
Traveler: Paimon, you're trying to freeload again.
Yaoyao: I'm afraid my backpack's empty now, but if you let me know what you like, I can bring you some of your favorite dishes next time we meet.
Yaoyao: Apart from Lotus Flower Crisps, what else do you like?
Paimon: Anything sweet! And anything that's made from slimes...
Ganyu: ...Here's what I've drafted so far. Anything else you want to add?
Dvorak: No, this is excellent! I'm racking my brains, but I don't think you've missed a single thing.
Ganyu: Perfect, then we'll leave it as-is. I'll go make an official copy.
Ganyu: Oh, perfect timing. We were just wrapping up our discussion here.
Traveler: That was quick...
Ganyu: Not at all. Every second counts for a complex proposal such as this. I will inform the Qixing of this development immediately... please give me a moment to pass on the message.
Ganyu: Yaoyao, thank you for bringing my herbs. I will make sure to take them.
Yaoyao: Remember to make tea from them first, Ganyu! You mustn't just chew them raw.
Ganyu: ...Uh, I—I will.
Yaoyao: Okay, I should be getting back. If Yaoyao stays out for too long, Mom and Dad will be worried sick...
Yaoyao: Everyone, I'm sure that the music festival will go off without a hitch, so don't worry! And in case I don't see you before, I wish you all a very happy Lantern Rite.
Dvorak: Thank you, Yaoyao. Happy Lantern Rite to you, too.
Paimon: We should go get dinner together sometime!
Traveler: But we will end the night on a high note.
Traveler: Don't listen to Paimon...

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: After a short wait, Keqing and Ganyu arrive at the square in front of Yujing Terrace...
Keqing: #Greetings, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, and Mr. Dvorak. Call me Keqing.
Keqing: Ganyu has brought me up to speed on everything. I'll get straight to the point.
Keqing: The Qixing have approved Ganyu's proposal. Over the next few days, I will be working with Mr. Dvorak on behalf of the Qixing to facilitate the organization of this concert.
Paimon: Yay, that's awesome!
Traveler: Unbelievably efficient...
Keqing: Please. The Qixing have a duty to deal with matters such as these. We have merely moved things forward to the next step.
Keqing: On a more personal note, I am an avid supporter of all things new and innovative.
Keqing: As such, it is my privilege to work with you on this exciting project.
Dvorak: Thank you so much, Keqing!
Dvorak: I had become quite discouraged after our recent failures, and was expecting the same outcome once again, so I didn't dare to get my hopes up...
Dvorak: ...Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this going so smoothly. It's like a dream come true...
Dvorak: Right... Time for me to call in the performers. To stage a concert at a high-profile event like this is a rare opportunity. We'll make sure it's a night to remember!
Paimon: Yes! Our music man's finally getting fired up!
Dvorak: Yes indeed. I know exactly what I'm doing from here.
Dvorak: For a musician, music will always be the language they are most fluent in.
Traveler: What about your ancestor?
Dvorak: Oh, that... that can wait for another time.
Ganyu: ...Oh.
Keqing: Ganyu, what's wrong?
Ganyu: They told me all about Mr. Dvorak's situation, but I was so engrossed in drafting the proposal that I forgot all about it...
Dvorak: Oh, that's quite alright. I don't even know what the person I'm trying to find looks like, so it was always going to be a long shot...
Dvorak: Don't worry about me, Ganyu. Your time and energy are needed elsewhere. I'm sure you already have plenty to deal with between this concert and everything else going on during the Lantern Rite.
Ganyu: Thanks. It was just that I had a few initial thoughts when I heard your story. For instance... I wonder if this lady your ancestor met might have been an adeptus. What do you think?
Traveler: It's definitely possible.
Ganyu: To tell you the truth, Mr. Dvorak, I am somewhat related to the adepti myself. I am part-human and part-qilin. The qilin is an illuminated beast.
Ganyu: I know how important your quest to get in touch with your roots must be to you, because I've been there myself before... trying to find out where I belonged...
Dvorak: Did you say the adepti? And you're — illuminated beast? Part-qilin?
Dvorak: Are you telling me... all the rumors of the Liyue adepti are real? So it's not just artistic license?
Paimon: You bet they're real! Trying to track them down is tough, though... Like Jueyun Karst itself. There's nothing specifically stopping you from going there, but getting in and out of there is quite an ordeal.
Ganyu: Yes. Anyway... if you're looking to uncover a lost melody, or shine light on a forgotten aspect of Liyue's cultural history, I'm probably not the best person to ask.
Ganyu: But if it's a person you're looking for, then I just might be able to help.
Keqing: ...I see, I think I understand the situation now. In that case, Ganyu, shall we divide the work between us?
Ganyu: Yes, that was also my thought.
Keqing: Great. So, Mr. Dvorak and I will concentrate on things here in the city to make sure the concert goes according to plan. In the meantime, Ganyu will reach out to her network and try to find the person he's looking for.
Keqing: How's your workload at the moment? Will you be able to make time?
Ganyu: I can probably get through everything in... two days. As long as I don't sleep.
Keqing: Wait, what do you mean, "as long as I don't sleep"?
Keqing: Even for someone with illuminated beast blood in their veins, working for such an extended period without a break will take its toll on your health.
Paimon: Somehow, that does not sound persuasive coming from Keqing...
Keqing: "Be it but three moons from the start, he who returns is not he that departs."
Keqing: Hm! Even I know the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance!
Ganyu: ...In that case, three days.
Keqing: Alright, I can work with that.
Ganyu: If you have the time, would you join me for this search?
Ganyu: You're well-known to many of the adepti, and respected among the people. I'll feel much more at ease with your company.
Traveler: Of course.
Ganyu: Okay, then let's meet back here in three days.
Paimon: Watch this space, Mr. Dvorak! We'll get to the bottom of this.
Dvorak: You're all so helpful and kind, I really... I just...
Paimon: Just think... imagine if we found the adeptus lady or one of her descendants and got them to come to the performance. Wouldn't that be amazing?
Paimon: It'd be such a happy reunion! And that's exactly what this festival's all about!
Traveler: I'm sure the wind that guided you here feels the same way.
Dvorak: ...You're right. Okay! I'm going to pull out all the stops to make this Lantern Rite a true extravaganza.
Keqing: We should probably get going. Mr. Dvorak, could you come with me to confirm the site?
Paimon: Ooh! We're coming too!
Traveler: We don't have enough information yet.
Traveler: What about that fairy lady?
Traveler: Keqing strikes again...

## Talk 10

Baiwen: Lady Yuheng!
Keqing: Baiwen, what is it?
Baiwen: Per Lady Ningguang's orders, I've been gathering intelligence outside of the city with the goal of uncovering and dispatching any trouble ahead of the festival.
Baiwen: I am told that a strange melody was heard somewhere along the coast. I was wary of investigating further on my own, so I was just on my way to report this incident to Lady Ningguang...
Baiwen: But I'm worried that if we don't act right away, we may miss the window of opportunity to take appropriate action...
Keqing: I understand. In that case, I—
Traveler: Let us handle this one.
Paimon: Yeah! Keqing, you're busy enough as it is. There's a ton of different things in this city that needs your attention.
Paimon: #Leave it to us! Don't worry — whatever it is, we'll definitely be able to handle it. Uh... Well, {M#he}{F#she} will handle it.
Baiwen: #With {NICKNAME} on the case, it's as good as dealt with...
Baiwen: Thank you, this will be a great help. I will inform Lady Ningguang about the situation. Once it's resolved, please come and find me again at Yujing Terrace and let me know.
Paimon: Will do! And say hi to Ningguang for us!
Keqing: You have my thanks too. Stay safe, and come back as soon as you're finished.
Dvorak: Good luck.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Baiwen said the strange tune was coming from around here, right?
Paimon: But Paimon doesn't hear anything... There doesn't seem to be a soul in—
Yelan: I was just wondering who in their right mind would come out to a place like this. So, it's you two.
Paimon: Yelan!? How did you sneak up on us like that? You nearly gave Paimon a heart attack!
Yelan: You look pretty alive to me. Can't have spooked you that bad.
Paimon: Y—You... ehh, fair enough...
Traveler: Know anything about the strange music?
Yelan: Ah, you're here for that, too? Saves me a bit of explaining.
Yelan: Come with me. I've already reconned the perimeter, so we should be safe.

## Talk 12

Madame Ping: You mustn't be afraid to try new things. If you never try, you'll never know.
Madame Ping: With your contribution, I'm sure this year's Lantern Rite will be a most spectacular one.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Hm, the stuff by the door is in pretty good condition, though. It can't have been too long ago that someone was last living here...

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm, how strange. It looks like it's been looted, except for the fact that there's no sign of a struggle.
Paimon: The bad guys could have sneaked in while the owner was gone, but... then how do you explain why the door and windows are intact?
Yelan: Seems you've done a pretty thorough inspection. So, any theories on what might have happened here?
Paimon: Yelan, you didn't hide some of the evidence from us on purpose, did you?
Yelan: Why would I make this more difficult for you? We're on the same side here.
Paimon: Okay, well... Paimon gives up then. Paimon's got nothin'.
Yelan: What about you? Give up as well?
Traveler: It's difficult to theorize with so little evidence.
Yelan: Yup. It's not obvious at first sight, that's for sure.
Yelan: To be honest, I was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
Yelan: A long time ago, there used to be a group of bandits in the Liyue countryside who would sound a horn every time they were about to raid a village.
Yelan: But it wasn't a rallying cry to rouse their fellow men. It was a disconcerting tune, meant to intimidate the weak and warn them of their impending doom.
Yelan: To escape with their lives, the villagers would abandon their homes and flee overnight, taking only their most valuable belongings with them. Everything else was left behind.
Yelan: The bandits were eventually brought to justice. But the fear and trauma remained in the villagers' hearts.
Yelan: Whenever they heard that melody, they would feel like their lives were in danger once again, and flee immediately.
Yelan: The culprit of this crime exploited that very fear to get access to this house without having to force their way in.
Paimon: Whew, that's quite the story...
Yelan: The victims obviously will have gotten quite a fright, but at least they won't be in any great danger.
Yelan: The important thing now is to find this copycat criminal.
Traveler: If we use Elemental Sight...
Yelan: On any other day, that'd probably be a good idea. Unfortunately, it's not gonna work today.
Yelan: Take a look around and you'll see what I mean. This criminal is clearly well-versed both in using music to commit crimes and in making a clean getaway.
Yelan: Not only did they stay off the muddy road to avoid leaving footprints, it looks like they were also careful not to bring any gadgets with so much as a trace of elemental energy. Evidently, they were intent on keeping even the most experienced investigators off their trail.
Yelan: Unfortunately for them, I'm one of the best trackers in the business. They're not about to get away with their little scheme on my watch.
Paimon: So basically... if we wanna find the culprit, we just need to follow Yelan!
Yelan: Mm-hmm. As long as you can keep up.
Yelan: Since the culprit's trying to be cautious and low-risk, I'll bet they left through an area with some vegetation for cover — but not so much that it would slow them down.
Traveler: We could follow their tracks...
Traveler: It must have something to do with that melody...
Yelan: Your instincts are pretty good.
Yelan: Hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. The strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
Yelan: Let me share a folk story with you.

## Talk 15

Paimon: There they are! Look, a Treasure Hoarder tent!
Paimon: Ugh, not the Treasure Hoarders again! And so close to Lantern Rite, too... 'Tis not the season for their antics!
Yelan: C'mon, let's round 'em up.

## Talk 16

Fujing: Hey! Who are you? Where'd you come from?
Yelan: Hmm... the evidence is conclusive.
Yelan: Okay — confess, and we'll go easy on you. My patience is running low, so why don't you do us both a favor, hmm?
Fujing: You kidding me!? You think I'm scared of you?
Yelan: Perhaps not. But you should be.

## Talk 17

Fujing: Mercy, have mercy...
Yelan: Ooh, it's a little late for that... I've come this far, I might as well finish the job.
Fujing: I surrender! I surrender, please! I'll do whatever you say! Please have mercy...
Yelan: Hmph. Tell us everything.
Yelan: You have one chance, and I'm warning you: Don't make me ask twice...
Fujing: I won't! I swear!
Fujing: Um, y'know, so... Lantern Rite's nearly here, and like a lot of people, I wanted to buy a few nice things...
Fujing: I know I'm with the Treasure Hoarders and everything, but I don't really have any kind of experience with robbing people and whatnot, so I, uh... I don't have the guts to break into somebody's house.
Paimon: Wow, you're really going to complain to us about that?
Fujing: No, not at all. I'm just... telling it how it is.
Yelan: Mkay. Continue.
Fujing: I racked my brains trying to think of what I could do, and eventually I remembered something from back when I was a kid. The bandits would blow their horn, and my grandma would grab us kids and run...
Fujing: I remember the tune, so I... I figured I'd try it for myself. ...I mean, just to see what would happen! At first, anyway... I seriously didn't expect that family to pack up and leave...
Fujing: But they did, and they just left all their stuff right there for the taking. It was too easy, I just... I couldn't resist...
Fujing: It was completely wrong of me, I know that now. I'll return everything that I took — it's all still in perfect condition. It'll be like it was never gone... Please, gimme a chance, huh? Let me make it right...
Yelan: Give you a chance, huh? Sounds to me like you'd rather strike some kind of a deal... than spend Lantern Rite behind bars?
Fujing: Y—Yes, um... yes...
Yelan: You know how to bargain, I'll give you that. It's just a pity that you didn't confess at the first opportunity.
Yelan: You'll have to take a walk with me.
Yelan: Once we've returned the goods, we'll find the owner of the house, and you can apologize to them in person. After that, I'll escort you to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Fujing: Yes, Ma'am!
Yelan: You know, as a former victim of this kind of crime yourself, I doubt anyone understands the fear you inflicted quite as well as you do.
Yelan: Does your greed matter more to you than your fear? More to the point, if you can play a tune from memory, don't you think you should be capable of making an honest living?
Fujing: You mean...
Yelan: Heh, that's enough hints for you. You'll have plenty of time to reflect on all of this yourself.
Yelan: There's not much left to wrap up, so I'll take it from here. Guess this is where I'll say goodbye.
Traveler: Sure.
Yelan: ...Hmm...
Paimon: What is it? Is there something else?
Yelan: I'm still not sure how you first got your hands on this information, so play it safe when you get back. Don't mention to anyone that you ran into me out here.
Yelan: You helped a lot with the investigation and arrest anyway, so it's perfectly fair for you to get all the credit. Just take it — it works better for me too.
Yelan: See you when I see you. And Happy Lantern Rite.
Paimon: Yelan's such a pro at this. With her taking it from here, it's as good as resolved.
Paimon: Fwoosh! Random Event: "A Strange Melody" complete!
Paimon: Although... it's kind of a shame that we never got that Treasure Hoarder guy to play the melody again.
Traveler: Why's it a shame?
Paimon: 'Cause Paimon's curious, that's why! It's like when you have a tune stuck in your head, but you don't even know what it is. It's driving Paimon crazy!
Paimon: When we were chatting with Mr. Dvorak, music seemed like such a positive thing.
Paimon: And most music is, right? It can help us relax, feel all warm and fuzzy, recall happy memories, or even just think happy thoughts...
Paimon: Paimon never imagined that music could be used to commit crimes...
Traveler: It comes down to the ill will of the user...
Paimon: Oh, really? Huh... Makes sense... Paimon's musical understanding improves again!
Paimon: Well anyway, now that everything's resolved, let's get back to Liyue Harbor. Baiwen's still waiting for us with our Random Event rewards!
Traveler: Their bad deeds influenced the emotions associated with the music.
Traveler: I'm quite curious myself.
Paimon: Right? How could anyone not be!
Traveler: Well done, Yelan!

## Talk 18

Paimon: Baiwen~! We're back. Everything's all sorted!
Baiwen: That's great news! Please wait here a moment, if you would be so kind. Lady Ningguang instructed me to advise her upon your return...
Black Screen Text: Baiwen hurries off...
Ningguang: My greetings to the both of you. Long time no see.
Paimon: No need to be so formal with us, Ningguang! We've known each other for a long time now. You must be super busy with all the preparations for Lantern Rite. Don't mind us!
Ningguang: On the contrary, I think it is those that I have known longest to whom I should extend the greatest courtesies.
Ningguang: Alas, on a different day, I would invite both of you inside for some tea, and a brief respite from your travels...
Ningguang: But you're quite right: Trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
Ningguang: Once the performance itself is over, we'll then need to invite the representatives of the Iridescence Tour for a discussion on future collaboration opportunities. The financing arrangements alone could well entail many rounds of discussion.
Ningguang: Simply put, there will always be work to do.
Paimon: Whoa... you're already thinking that far ahead?
Ningguang: Hehe... well, we can discuss more current affairs if you'd prefer.
Ningguang: I trust you saw this year's Mingxiao Lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
Paimon: Yeah! It looked like... a goose? Which adeptus is it modeled on this time?
Ningguang: Sea Gazer. I believe you're familiar with the name?
Ningguang: Legend holds that he was free-spirited and easy-going. People described him as a cheerful soul and a loyal friend.
Traveler: I remember.
Ningguang: "On this marvelous Lantern Rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
Ningguang: If the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. I wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking...
Paimon: Oh, they're gonna love them! Paimon's sure of it!
Paimon: At least, if the guy you mentioned is anything to go by, the adepti and heroes of the past sound like a positive and free-spirited cheerful bunch. They're sure to be open to new music!
Ningguang: Hehe, well let's hope so.
Ningguang: I heard that you'll be going on a search with Ganyu to find the descendants of a fairy lady from a Fontaine legend.
Ningguang: I'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale... Do share it with me, won't you? I couldn't bear to miss out.
Traveler: Absolutely.
Traveler: It's been too long, I can't seem to recall...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Zhongli: As for Director Hu's list... Hmm...
Zhongli: I shall attend to it after one last round of tea.

### Additional Talk 2

Dvorak: That lady I just talked to, Ganyu... she really thinks of everything.
Dvorak: It got me wondering... could it be that all our failed attempts so far have been down to our failure to properly prepare for different contingencies?

### Additional Talk 3

Keqing: ...She said she'll reach out to the Yun-Han Opera Troupe? I see.
Keqing: Then I'll arrange for a rehearsal venue and accommodation as soon as possible. Everything should be ready tonight.
Dvorak: Many thanks, Keqing.
Dvorak: Heh... You know, I once heard someone from Liyue describe a person as "swift as lightning and agile as the wind." At the time, I thought it was a curious expression, and I had a hard time piecing together a mental image of such a person.
Dvorak: But now, having seen Keqing in action, I honestly can't think of any other way to describe it... It's such a vivid and expressive phrase. A testament to the richness of Liyue's culture.
Keqing: You're too kind, Mr. Dvorak.

### Additional Talk 4

Dvorak: Program... list of performers... dress rehearsal schedule, and rehearsal venue...
Dvorak: What a spectacular stage we have... I have to make sure that the performances will be nothing short of exceptional.
