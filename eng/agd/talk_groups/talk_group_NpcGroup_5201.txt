Traveler: What are you doing here?
Darcy: I'm here to help people like you, of course!
Darcy: All you newcomers, still holding the empty forms Ms. Monglane shoved at you, looking around like lost lambs. You need a friendly face to point you in the right direction, don't you?
Darcy: And who better than me, the former "Pretty Face," to perform this task?
Darcy: I'll tell you something on the down low... You can't repeat it to anyone else! Ms. Monglane herself approves of my work. Not that she can admit to it in public, but I know...
Darcy: That's definitely what she actually thinks!

Traveler: Heard any interesting rumors?
Darcy: You mean, apart from "Pretty Face" becoming "Dirty Face"? Ooh, let me think about that for a moment.

### Talk 8 related talk 0

Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Darcy: I actually like living here! When I was outside, I lived a life with my days and nights all topsy turvy, sleepless at night, dispirited and listless during the day...
Darcy: But ever since I arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I've led a regular and healthy life!
Darcy: If you have had similar issues, I recommend you stay a while longer!

Traveler: About Estienne's game...
Darcy: Congratulations on winning!
Darcy: Now that I think of it, I never even saw Caterpillar that much... I didn't know he had that many Coupons! I'm jealous! If only I had that many...
Darcy: I'd treat everyone in the entire Fortress to new flavors of Fonta... No! I'd pay everyone's wages for a day and give them all a holiday!
Darcy: Or maybe I'd sponsor an Invokation tournament? Oh, how can I choose between such good ideas... Oh! Why would I even have to choose? I can do them all!
