Traveler: Hello. What did you mean when you said "help"?
Aclla: Ah, let me explain. Often, members of the tribe just have too much on their hands, so some turn into commissions that are open to outsiders as well.
Aclla: Anyone who wants to take on a commission can just come here, to the Obsidian Totem Pole.
Aclla: Naturally, you'll be compensated for completing commissions! Feel free to stop by and help!
