# Warrior's Spirit


## Talk 1

Akatsuki Saemon Juuzou: Your skills are superb. I've been thoroughly bested.
Traveler: It was an honor to fight against you.
Reina: Ladies and gentlemen, after an exhilarating battle, the champion for the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition has been decided! Give it up for... the Traveler!
Reina: Tomorrow, we will conduct the final exhibition match... The Traveler and Miss Kamisato versus the Almighty Shogun's chosen envoy, an autonomous humanoid known as the "Maguu Kengou."
Reina: We'll see you then!
Kamisato Ayaka: That was a most thrilling match, Traveler.
Hiiragi Chisato: Congratulations, Traveler. You've certainly earned your title as the champion!
Paimon: Paimon had no idea that tomorrow's opponent would be the Maguu Kengou... That name sounds similar to that troublesome one we encountered on Yashiori Island. Oh, Paimon doesn't think it'll be an easy fight.
Kamisato Ayaka: Don't worry, Paimon. The Shogun's chosen envoy may be strong, but tomorrow's match doesn't prohibit the use of Visions. We'll make a formidable team.
Kamisato Ayaka: As long as we can track its moves, an opportunity to strike back will present itself.
Paimon: Oh, hearing your confidence sure makes Paimon feel better!
Kamisato Ayaka: I cannot guarantee that we will win, but we must try our best, if just to give the crowd a show they will not forget.
Traveler: We can win, Ayaka.
Hiiragi Chisato: I can tell you two are already raring to go, but it'd be best to conserve your energy and get some rest tonight.
Paimon: We'll also be able to see Ayaka's new outfit when we wake up tomorrow. Ayaka in a Fontaine dress... Oh, Paimon can't wait!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, yes. Well...
Traveler: I can't wait, either.
Kamisato Ayaka: Huh, Traveler... You too?
Hiiragi Chisato: Hehe, sounds like there's no way around it, Miss Ayaka. If I wasn't busy tomorrow, I would have loved to come see as well.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, I suppose it's settled then. I'll wait for you at the Kamisato Estate tomorrow morning.
Traveler: Do you want me to pick you up in the morning?
Traveler: It'll definitely be an exciting match.

## Talk 2

Hirotatsu: Ah, you're finally here.
Paimon: Ugh, it's Hirotatsu...
Paimon: The Traveler already beat you a few days ago and won the championship. What else do you have to say, hmmmm?
Hirotatsu: Don't worry, I'm not here to cause trouble. I just wanted to apologize. Traveler, I lost to you fair and square a few days ago.
Hirotatsu: Your swordsmanship is excellent. Each strike was precise but not aggressive, which speaks to your character. I ask your forgiveness for misjudging you and offending you with my words and actions.
Traveler: It's okay, it didn't bother me.
Hirotatsu: The two of you must be here to pick up Miss Kamisato. She's in the dressing room right now and should be out soon.
Hirotatsu: Traveler, before the young lady comes out, I have a bit of a presumptuous request that I hope you can consider.
Traveler: Sure, what is it?
Hirotatsu: Although the young lady has never mentioned today's exhibition match to us retainers, she has spared a few hours every evening to practice her swordsmanship, despite how busy she is.
Hirotatsu: The young lady has always been diligent and conscientious. Although it's just an exhibition match and it won't matter if she loses, I trust that she will do her best to win.
Hirotatsu: As a retainer, I do believe in her of course, but... I still hope you can support the young lady in the arena and ensure her safety.
Traveler: Don't worry, I will.
Hirotatsu: Traveler, I leave the young lady in your hands.
Paimon: Oh, that must be Ayaka!
Paimon: Wow...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? What's the matter? Why are you two so silent...? Is there something wrong with the outfit?
Paimon: Not at all! Ayaka, you look amazing... You're radiating beauty!
Traveler: This look really suits you.
Paimon: Yeah, yeah, you look like a spirited young lady who's just stepped off a boat from Fontaine!
Kamisato Ayaka: Do you think so? I was worried that it might be a little over-the-top... I'm not sure I can pull this off.
Kamisato Ayaka: But I'm relieved to hear your thoughts.
Paimon: Paimon can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when they see Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you for the compliments, Paimon. Traveler, now that we're ready, let's head to the arena.
Hirotatsu: My Lady, Traveler, I wish you all the best in the exhibition match.
Traveler: It's a beautiful outfit and it suits you perfectly.
Paimon: Just look at it! It even has the crest of the Kamisato Clan embroidered on it!
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, Onodera had someone from the family make it over the last few days. I heard it was based on suggestions that the spectators had written on the ballots.
Kamisato Ayaka: The outfit is well-tailored and offers more freedom of movement than I had expected.
Traveler: I enjoyed our fight.

## Talk 3

Yuu: Hey look, Miss Kamisato and the Traveler have arrived!
Sae: Although I've seen illustrations of this outfit before, seeing Miss Kamisato wear it truly brings some unique flair.
Matsumae: It was worth lining up super early to get front-row seats. I'm really looking forward to today's match!
Paimon: Wow, Ayaka became the center of attention the moment she appeared.
Reina: Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. The Warrior's Spirit exhibition match is about to begin. Please enter the arena in an orderly fashion and take your seats.
Reina: Miss Kamisato, Traveler, please come with me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Are you ready, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm ready. Let's go.
Kamisato Ayaka: Good. Let's give it our best. I look forward to fighting beside you.
Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, don't worry, there's still some time. Once you've taken care of everything, we can enter the arena together.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Traveler, Ayaka, we're over here!
Hiiragi Chisato: That was an extraordinary match. I don't know much about swordsmanship, but even I was caught up in the tense atmosphere of the arena. My heart's still pounding even now.
Paimon: Your opponent's moves kept surprising Paimon, but it seems like the two of you were prepared for that.
Kujou Sara: Traveler, Miss Kamisato, congratulations on winning the exhibition match.
Paimon: Hey, it's Sara. You came to watch the competition too?
Kujou Sara: I was ordered by the Almighty Shogun to observe this competition. You two displayed remarkable swordsmanship and cooperation. Not only did you present the beauty of the sword arts to the audience, I was also able to learn quite a bit myself.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm flattered.
Kujou Sara: All of you have been busy with various preparations for the competition. Today marks a perfect ending to this Warrior's Spirit event. Your efforts have been recognized by the Almighty Shogun.
Kujou Sara: I must return to the Tenshukaku and report on what happened at the exhibition match to the Almighty Shogun. Everyone, please excuse me.
Hiiragi Chisato: By the way, does everyone have plans now? If not, why don't we go to Uyuu Restaurant for a victory meal?
Paimon: Great idea! We've been so focused on the competition lately that it's been a while since we've had a good meal! Let's go!
Kamisato Ayaka: Whew...
Traveler: What's wrong, Ayaka?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, it's nothing. The effects of winning are only now starting to sink in. Kujou Sara said that she learned a lot from the fight, and so did I.
Kamisato Ayaka: Although the audience members might not have noticed, there were many moments where I would've been in trouble if it weren't for you by my side drawing away the opponent's attacks.
Kamisato Ayaka: Without you, it would've been impossible for me to win on my own. It's just as I expected, my swordsmanship is still far from your level.
Traveler: Ayaka, you helped me many times as well.
Kamisato Ayaka: Really? Hearing you say that makes me want to spar with you all of a sudden.
Kamisato Ayaka: To tell you the truth, I've been hoping for an opportunity to spar with you ever since we first met. That wish was half fulfilled today at the exhibition match.
Traveler: Next time, we'll find a chance to go a few rounds.
Kamisato Ayaka: Sure. But... until then, make sure you take good care of your sword. If I ever manage to steal it one day, your life will also be in my hands.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe... I've always wanted to say something like that. Did it sound strange?
Traveler: It sounded very much like Miss Orith.
Paimon: Hey, what's the hold-up here? What are you talking about?
Kamisato Ayaka: We were just talking about having a match to determine which of us is the superior swordfighter.
Paimon: Wow, you are so serious when it comes to swordsmanship. But, aren't you friends with the Traveler? Why do you need a match?
Kamisato Ayaka: It's precisely because we're friends that we should spar often and learn from each other.
Paimon: Oh. Guess that kind of makes sense.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, keep all I just said a secret?
Paimon: Huh? What did Ayaka say?
Kamisato Ayaka: Nothing, let's get going.
Traveler: It was cute.
Traveler: You're being too modest, Ayaka.

## Talk 5

Reina: Everyone is looking forward to this exhibition match. Good luck, Traveler!

## Talk 6

Matsumae: I wonder what Ayaka will look like wearing a Fontaine outfit...

## Talk 7

Yuu: In the past, the Archon's Emissary always wore traditional outfits, but today is different.

## Talk 8

Kamisato Ayaka: Are you ready, Traveler?
Traveler: No problem. Let's go.
Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Kamisato Ayaka: Good. Let's give it our best. I look forward to fighting beside you.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, don't worry, there's still some time. Once you've taken care of everything, we can enter the arena together.

## Talk 9

Sae: The Kamisato Art versus the Maguu Kengou... and don't forget the champion from the competition! This ticket was so worth it!
