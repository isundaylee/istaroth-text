# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Where is this?
Wood: This is the main hall on the ground floor of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. On this floor you can find the library and the Grand Master's Office.
Wood: If you have any questions, feel free to ask me at any time.
Traveler: One of these doors is locked...
Wood: Ah, that room's not open to outsiders.
Wood: Well, it doesn't involve some internal secret of the Knights of Favonius or anything. That room is actually solitary confinement.
Wood: To be honest, this room has more or less become Klee's private property...
Wood: Every time she's locked in there, you can hear some crackling noises, like she's researching new explosives in there...
Wood: I'm sure that she won't ignite any of her bombs in here, but if she ever slips up...
Wood: *sigh* It just worries me.
