# Missing title (1690897879)

Poca: You're back! You were gone quite a while, too. So, how did it go? Run into any problems?
Paimon: Well, we sure got a lot done down there...
Black Screen Text: You tell Poca what happened down by the roots of the Flamegranate Tree...
Poca: So he really pulled it off... Brilliant. Now we can tell Wayna that we won't be needing to trouble the Masters of the Night-Wind or the Collective of Plenty about this matter.
Poca: What did I tell you? I knew he could do it.
Paimon: Huh, so you're saying that Wayna already knew there was something wrong with the Flamegranate Tree's roots...?
Poca: Of course! We're all well aware of what's been going on with the Mother Flamegranate Tree. Tisoc's the only one who'd think that no one else had noticed and go about trying to solve the problem all by himself...
Poca: Anyway, despite being so set in his way of thinking, there's something quite endearing about his obstinacy.
Poca: #Haha, and once again, thanks to the two of you, Traveler and Paimon! In truth though, I'd heard your names a long time ago â€” after all, as couriers, staying in the loop is how we make a living!
Poca: So I simply gave you a little nudge along the way... by leaving that pass somewhere you'd come across it.
Paimon: Oh, so that was you!
Poca: Haha, indeed. Well, I'm guessing that blockhead already rewarded you, so what kind of person would I be if I gave you any less than he did? Here, take these!
Poca: And please, with this reward, let our... past grievances be forgotten, eh?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Tisoc: Ah, looks like the Mountain King Flamegranates have finally ripened up. What a relief!
Tisoc: Oh, it's you two! What's up? If you're planning on going in, be quick about it. Don't let anyone from the tribe see you!
Traveler: About the Mountain King...
Tisoc: Oh, you want to hear more about the Mountain King?
Tisoc: The Mountain King Kongamato is an extraordinary Saurian who once fought the Abyss, side-by-side with a legendary hero. Thus, he has the tribe's unanimous respect.
Tisoc: There are people whose job it is to pick and offer up these Flamegranates for the Mountain King's consumption. However, some say that in secret, other Yumkasaurs bring them to the Mountain King too...
Tisoc: Which is why the Mountain King is so much more, uhh... "Robustly built," shall we say?
Traveler: About the Flamegranates...
Tisoc: Well, you've certainly come to the right person. Flamegranates are phlogiston plants, and truly remarkable ones at that. The courage it must take for a plant to extend its roots down into liquid phlogiston... simply boggles the mind.
Tisoc: And the fruit they produce is full of phlogiston, so they make great food for Yumkasaurs... As long as they don't chuck them around, that is...
Tisoc: They do tend to explode on heavy impact, after all...
Traveler: Just passing through...
Tisoc: Oh, is that so? Sure you don't want to go in and take a look at the Mountain King Flamegranates... even just a little peek? I always feel much better after taking a good, long look at them... so if you ever feel troubled, I'd recommend you do the same.
