## Talk

Shibata: Hello, what are you here at Sangonomiya Shrine for?

## Talk

Traveler: Can you tell me about Sangonomiya Shrine?
Shibata: This shrine is the heart of Watatsumi Island, and is run by Her Excellency. It is an offering to our deity, Watatsumi Omikami.
Shibata: Well, I call it an offering, but this isn't actually where the body of Watatsumi Omikami lies.
Shibata: However, the large coral that can be found outside the palace courts were indeed taken from Watatsumi Omikami's very own body... Probably.
Shibata: *sigh* I don't really know the details myself. If you want to know more, why not ask the shrine maiden over there?
Shibata: ...That said, she's been quite troubled of late by that researcher. Either way, good luck.
