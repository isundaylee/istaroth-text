# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Brothers and sister...
Arapacati: #Nara Varuna looked so happy, so joyful, when talking about brothers. Nara are weird. Why are "brothers" and "sisters" so special?
Arapacati: We later decided, we should be "brothers" and "sisters," to make everyone happy and joyful.
Arapacati: At first, Arapacati was "brother." But the "sister" back then is gone now. Before being Vasara Tree, he decided that Arapacati should be "sister."
Arapacati: Who should be "sister" next time...
