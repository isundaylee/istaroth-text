Linling: Oh, so it's these ones... I need to find the corresponding formats and criteria for each one...
Linling: I cannot make another mistake...
Linling: If I lose this job, I won't be able to write my poetry in peace. I cannot make any more mistakes!

Linling: Hi there, are you here to enjoy Lantern Rite? In that case, do be sure to look out over the ocean from time to time!
Linling: Under the light of the lanterns, the waves grow more beautiful. Ah, I can feel my poetic spirit arise within me already...

## Talk

Linling: Hi. Here to check out the ocean view?

Traveler: Who are you?
Linling: I'm Linling. I'm the registrar for all the boats in these docks...
Linling: ...Actually, I'm employed by the Commerce Guild to do menial tasks for all those stuffy old business people...
Linling: But never mind all that. When you're young, you should fix your vision on something with broad horizons, right?
Linling: Just look how beautiful the sea is today, it's so tranquil! As I like to say, "To be blind to the beauty that poets adore is to view the world from the ocean floor."

Linling: Is it any wonder that I'm out here staring aimlessly at the sea...
Traveler: Do you have Anemo power? Because girl, your poetry just blew me away.
Linling: Why thank you! You have wonderful taste in poetry. Only a small number of rare geniuses see true reason, and it seems you are one of them â€” just like me!
Linling: The way I see it, the Qixing aren't all that. Who knows, I might do a better job than them.
Linling: I mean, let's be honest. They just follow the divine predictions we receive from Rex Lapis during the Rite of Descension to the letter. It's all his work, so what are they so uppity about?
Linling: ...Uh, did I just say that a bit too loud?

Traveler: Goodbye.
Linling: Bye!
Linling: 'Tis true transcendence to view the sea, how blue the skies and seas both be...
