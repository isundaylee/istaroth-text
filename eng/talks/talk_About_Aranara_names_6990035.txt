Traveler: About Aranara names...
Paimon: Arama, Arana, Araja, Arakavi... Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...
Paimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with "Ara"!
Traveler: Right, so if you were an Aranara...
Paimon: Yup, and as for you...
Paimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you "Nara Traveler"...
Traveler: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...
Paimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was "Nara," what would the Aranara call them?
Traveler: "Nara Nara"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.
Paimon: Hehe, yeah.
Traveler: Your name would be "Arapaimon."
