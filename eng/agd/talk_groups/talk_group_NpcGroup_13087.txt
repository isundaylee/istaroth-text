Pain-Grocer: So the rumors of your formidable strength and resilience are true! You are really tough! That was a good fight!
Traveler: Up for another round?
Pain-Grocer: Huh? Are you sure you want to spar with me again? You're so patient!
Pain-Grocer: Well, it's my honor then!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Pain-Grocer: Why are you asking about Grandmaster Hanakado all of a sudden? You're trying to get some information out from me, aren't you?
Pain-Grocer: Well, I'll tell you what I know. He and I are just business partners anyway, so we're not particularly close.
Paimon: Business partners? But you two are just kids!
Pain-Grocer: So what? I've supplied Tsukumomono Groceries dozens of times. Like the small trees and rocks I pulled out when catching Onikabuto...
Pain-Grocer: The stuff was then made into bonsai trees and rock gardens, and they look pretty impressive when placed in the store! They're sold in limited quantities from time to time, and together with Aoi's promotion, it's pretty good business!
Pain-Grocer: Aoi praised me and said that the goods I delivered are great, and could even be worth a third of many precious treasures!
Pain-Grocer: Grandmaster Hanakado always buys them at high prices, saying that he'll use them to build courtyards and hills in his Onikabuto arena and make a camp for his beetles.
Pain-Grocer: So, by helping you and Grandmaster Hanakado in beetle fighting, I'm also helping Aoi's and my own business venture.
Paimon: Okay, now Paimon understands where that name came from...
Paimon: Anyway, it sounds like Grandmaster Hanakado comes from a very rich family... Could his parents be millionaires in disguise?
Pain-Grocer: I don't know much about that. All I know is that every time he buys my goods, I'll earn enough Mora for a few days' worth of Sakura Shrimp Crackers!
Paimon: Sakura Shrimp Crackers? That's it? Seems like he isn't so rich after all...
Pain-Grocer: Huh? What do you mean? ...You must make a lot of Mora then!
Pain-Grocer: Maybe I'll just hang out with you, and you can pay me to be your beetle-battler!
Pain-Grocer: Then I'll get to beetle-fight with you every day!
Paimon: Money... money isn't that important! Don't get so excited!
Paimon: #Besides... Traveler isn't a beetle fighting professional, so even if you come with us, you won't get too many work opportunities.
Pain-Grocer: Is that so? Forget about it then! Anyway... After my bonsai and rock gardens open for sale, don't forget to pay me a visit and buy something!
Traveler: Until next we meet!
Pain-Grocer: #See you next time, Traveler and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon! If you don't mind, come and have beetle fights with me again!
