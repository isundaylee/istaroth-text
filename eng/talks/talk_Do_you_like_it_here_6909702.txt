# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Sethos: Sure do! It's great!
Sethos: I'd like to think I'm a flexible guy who can adapt to any environment, never mind one as pleasant as this.
Traveler: Well, the layout is my pride and joy.
Sethos: I can tell.
Sethos: Some people like to go out and have fun. Others prefer to create a comfy space for themselves at home where they can enjoy some peace and quiet.
Sethos: People enjoy life in different ways, but both approaches are equally valid.
Sethos: You know, this place is real roomy. There are houses and buildings, sure... But, there's also lots of open space...
Sethos: You could build a bunch of different areas, each with a unique design. That way, it'd feel like we were camping in a new place every night!
Sethos: I'd even help out if you wanted!
Sethos: Truth is, I'm fully furnished with ideas as we speak!
Traveler: This is rather embarrassing. I've neglected the place lately...
Sethos: No, no, no! Don't say that!
Sethos: I prefer being out adventuring too, so I try to keep things simple at home. But even then, my pad isn't nearly as neat as this.
