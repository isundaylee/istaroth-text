Traveler: Who are you?
Qilang: The name's Qilang. I'm nobody special, I just come here to pick herbs.
Qilang: I used to spend all my time down at the Wanwen Bookhouse, devouring every book on the natural world I could get my hands on.
Qilang: I never thought that knowledge would actually come in useful for earning a living.
Qilang: I know every herb and its use off by heart now. Even Bubu Pharmacy buys its medicinal herbs from me.
Qilang: It's taken its toll on me though... All this time spent bent over picking herbs has done my lower back in. Now it hurts every time I bend down... *grimace*
