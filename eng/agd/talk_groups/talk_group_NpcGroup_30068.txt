Hosseini: This round of fieldwork has really been a headache...

Traveler: Hello.
Hosseini: ...Hello there. Odd to see you not busy for once. Have you come to chat?
Hosseini: I've been in a bit of a rush recently, so I've barely had the chance to get a few lines in.
Hosseini: Really, it's quite a surprise meeting you here in Ritou. Well, strictly speaking, maybe not. We are all outlanders in the Inazumans' eyes, after all.
Hosseini: Before they get a Residence Permit, all outlanders must remain in Ritou. All that considered, I suppose meeting you here isn't so much of a surprise after all.
Hosseini: In any case, I'm still waiting for the Outlander Affairs Agency to review and approve my application for a Residence Permit, so I can't leave at the moment.
Hosseini: I have been waiting for a while now, though. I wonder when the approval will come down.
Hosseini: Each day spent here is another day's worth of expenses expended and research left undone. Most frustrating indeed...
Hosseini: So far, I've only been able to ask someone to help me find some "ways and means" to go to other Inazuman islands and conduct some preliminary research.
Hosseini: What about you? Since you've been able to go to Tsurumi Island, I suppose that your Residence Permit has been processed, right?
Hosseini: Might you have ideas as to how to speed that up, by the way?

Traveler: How's your research going?
Hosseini: Smoothly enough, I suppose. Before arriving at Ritou, my previous research topic was "The Practical Uses of the Energy Amplifier."
Hosseini: Although things went wrong and our research sample was destroyed, we were able to rescue the situation by recovering some sample data.
Hosseini: I have you to thank for that save, Traveler.

Traveler: All the best, then. See you!
Hosseini: All the best to you too!
Hosseini: Let's just hope this goes smoothly...

Traveler: I took a backdoor, actually.
Hosseini: Ah, to think that you'd have such connections. Well, for someone like me who lacks them, even getting that permit done is quite the strenuous effort.
Hosseini: Since you had a contact, I suppose that the Outlander Affairs Agency didn't charge you a processing fee either, then?
Hosseini: When I went to get my documents processed, I specially mentioned that I was a registered researcher with the Akademiya, to be distinguished, of course, from folklorists or other such academic hobbyists.
Hosseini: Only then did the inspector waive some of the fees. Even so, this is a rather troubling process...

Traveler: "Ways and means"?
Hosseini: Huh, it seems that you're not aware.
Hosseini: Well, since we're partners here, I suppose I could tell you. But don't spread it around, alright?
Hosseini: Now, there's a certain fellow here in Ritou named Harrison. He's an outlander too, just like us, and he has his ways.
Hosseini: If you wish to go somewhere else "on the quiet," you can look for a way near Harrison's store.
Hosseini: That's all I can say. You'll have to find the way yourself.
Hosseini: And don't get caught by the Shogunate's people, alright? And if you do, don't mention me.
Hosseini: I don't have the Mora on me to pay any fines.

Traveler: It was nothing.
Hosseini: No need to be so humble. I would never have been able to wrangle with those monsters who had stolen those samples.
Hosseini: With that data on hand, I reorganized my research into a report that tackled the problem of "how to use the Energy Amplifier to conduct energy conversions."
Hosseini: The Akademiya rated my report quite highly. I believe that they must recognized the academic value of this line of inquiry.
Hosseini: I even daresay that this research has filled in a large gap in our understanding of the Energy Amplifier.
Hosseini: It is of great comfort to me that its value was finally recognized by my seniors in the academic world.
Hosseini: With that under my belt, I can be said to have graduated successfully. I will not stop here, of course.
Hosseini: I've applied to look into a new research topic. I believe that as long as I keep working at it, I will receive the requisite acknowledgment for that work.
Hosseini: One day, I will make Dastur... maybe even Herbad!
Hosseini: And that's why I'm here in Inazuma, of course, to work on this new topic. It's just a shame that I got stranded here on Ritou before I could make any headway...

Traveler: I wouldn't call that previous incident easy either.
Hosseini: That is true. Indeed, it was a most close shave, what with the monsters having made off with the fragments of our sample, after all. I doubt that I would've been able to collect any data by myself.

Traveler: Dastur?
Hosseini: Oh, that? It's an honorific we use for researchers. Unfortunately, I do not yet have the qualifications to be a Dastur.
Hosseini: I'm still an ordinary traveling scholar from the Aramati, so I'm often sent out to conduct filed research.
Hosseini: If I make Dastur, then I might be able to stay at the Akademiya more often.
Hosseini: And when that time comes, I might be able to join such luminaries as the great Pursina and the sagacious Ayesha, and bestow my name upon the fruits of my research, to be used by future generations...

Traveler: Herbad?
Hosseini: Ah, that is an honorific we use for researchers. Those who earn the name Herbad are knowledgeable beyond the pale, leaders among scholars.
Hosseini: In my department, the number of great talents who study alchemy and the function of the ley lines are many indeed.
Hosseini: By contrast, I am not their equal in talent. Truly, I wonder if I can ascend to such heights within my lifetime...
Hosseini: But if I can, then perhaps I might be able to join such luminaries as the great Pursina and the sagacious Ayesha, and bestow my name upon the fruits of my research, to be used by future generations...
Hosseini: And there will be Hosseini Machines, Hosseini Methods, and Hosseini Formulas used throughout the scholarly realms of Sumeru...
Hosseini: Ah, just thinking about it makes my soul sing!
