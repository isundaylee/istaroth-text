# Let's Go, Dodoco!

Message From the Editor: "Let's Go, Dodoco!" is the combined work of an older girl and a younger girl. Every chapter brims with their gentleness and good wishes, as the story is intended as a gift to our readers. I hope this book — in spite of its small volume — can bring you some simple joy after a long day of work.
