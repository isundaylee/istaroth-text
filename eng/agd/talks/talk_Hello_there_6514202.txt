# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello there.
Yves: Hello, hello. Ah, apologies for making you see me complaining like this.
Yves: As you can see, I'm a diver — and apart from working for my boss, I also do a few jobs on the side.
Yves: If you need anything salvaged, you can come to me — we can discuss the payment afterward.
Yves: I'll do my best to help you... so long as my diving equipment remains functional, and I can finish the work assigned to me by my boss.
