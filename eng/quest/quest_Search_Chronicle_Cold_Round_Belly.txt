# Search Chronicle: Cold, Round Belly!


## Talk 1

Ranjit: I'm all set. Or would you like to chat instead?
Traveler: By the way, how exactly are we going to eat the Pyro Regisvine fruit?
Ranjit: Well, we're out in the wild, so simple works best. First, we'll need to trim the fruit's shape without getting burned.
Ranjit: Next, we cut off a small piece, dig a groove into the middle of the fruit, then put in a couple chunks of butter, Whopperflower Nectar, and your preferred spices. Then we roast — all done.
Ranjit: I'd say that Pyro Regisvine's fruit has a more striking flavor than that of apples. Really sears itself into your memories...
Traveler: Tell me about the Tepetlisauri...
Ranjit: Oh, the little ones are awfully cute! What with their big round eyes and roly-poly bellies...
Ranjit: As I said before, they're probably the first things you'll meet if you travel to Natlan through Sumeru. The mines in eastern Natlan are their stomping grounds.
Ranjit: Those mines are also home to the Nanat{RUBY#[D]Children of Echoes}zcayan people. Fine miners and excavators, they are, and skilled appraisers of gems.
Ranjit: Sound boring to you, right? But they're a happy lot, especially their chief...
Ranjit: Whatever the case, be sure to pay them a visit if you find yourself heading to Natlan in the future... Those little Tepetlisauri, I mean. You'll love 'em, I can already tell.
Traveler: Can't think of much to say at the moment.

## Talk 2

Ranjit: Shall we head down, then?
Traveler: Let's go.

Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.

## Talk 3

Ranjit: Ah, it's you two! I've been waiting for ages!
Traveler: Befriended the Pyro Regisvine yet?
Ranjit: Agh, don't even talk about it. You "negotiated" a period of calm... a very, very brief one.
Ranjit: The moment it recovered, it started trying to bump me off again! ... You know what? You were right. It's not possible to make friends with this creature.
Ranjit: Still, its fruit does taste pretty good — like Pyro, in fact. Reckon my Natlan friends will like it!
Paimon: What does that even taste like...?
Ranjit: Wanna give it a try? If you want, I could...
Paimon: E—Err, yeah, no, it's fine! Anyway, are you gonna move on to a Primo Geovishap next?
Ranjit: That's right. I think this one's a winner, to be honest. Primo Geovishaps are quite like the Tepetlisauri, after all.
Ranjit: If you travel to Natlan from Sumeru like I did, I reckon they'll be one of the first things you'll meet.
Paimon: Sure, whatever you say. Paimon doesn't have high hopes for this one either, though... Why couldn't you have gone with the Hatchlings?
Ranjit: ...They don't have round tummies.
Paimon: What?
Ranjit: Geovishap Hatchlings don't have round tummies. I imagine it's all that incredibly quick rolling they do. That can't leave you much of a chance to store up fat...
Ranjit: *sigh* But the main reason's still the lack of... impact. What's a Hatchling to those friends of mine who live alongside Saurians?
Ranjit: But a Primo Geovishap, now that's a different story. Even as a tale, it'll be worth the time of day. And anyway, a strong protagonist's gotta have strong opponents, you dig?
Ranjit: Alright. Let's not tarry, shall we? The Primo Geovishap awaits!
Traveler: Let's away, good sir.
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you in a bit.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.
