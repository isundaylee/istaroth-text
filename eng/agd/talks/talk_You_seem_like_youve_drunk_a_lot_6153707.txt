Traveler: You seem like you've drunk a lot...
Draff: No good hunting session is complete without a good drinking session afterwards!
Draff: What's more, my daughter Diona is one of the top bartenders in Mondstadt...
Draff: That hasn't changed how much she nags me about my drinking, mind you...
Traveler: How long is the hunt over for?
Draff: Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?
