Musheng: Haha! It was the right call to come here during the festival. You just can't beat the festive cheer here in the city!
Musheng: I've heard that the Moonchase Festival used to be celebrated for very different reasons in the past. Something about the adepti's rituals, I believe.
Musheng: But I don't think that what it's about now — gathering together and admiring the moon — is half bad, either!
Musheng: I'm sure that the adepti, too, would be gladdened to see everyone enjoying themselves.
