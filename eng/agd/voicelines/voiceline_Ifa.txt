# Ifa Voicelines

## Hello
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> Hey there. I'm Ifa, a sauro-vet from the Flower-Feather Clan. You've probably heard some things about me already, but it's all good. Whatever impression you have of me, I say let's wipe the slate clean and just get to know each other.
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> Oh yeah, then there's this little dude... that's Cacucu, my assistant. A... "sauro-vet" in a different sense of the word, I guess. I hope the two of you will get along.
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> Nice to meet you, bro!

## Chat: Rest
*sigh* Most things in life aren't one and done. Soon as you're rested up, let's make a move.

## Chat: Snacks
Whenever I get to take a break, I always want a snack... Hmm, I got some candy, fruit, and jerky. You want some?

## Chat: Calls
Did you hear that? Sounded like an animal call. ...Hmm, or maybe I'm just hearing things.

## When It Rains
Watch out for when Cacucu shakes off his feathers, or you'll get drenched... Although, actually, you're probably soaked through already. Yeah, never mind.

## When Thunder Strikes
Did you know that a lot of saurians are actually scared of thunder? It always takes so long to calm them down, hehe. They're so funny sometimes.

## When It Snows
Whew, I can barely open my eyes in this wind, it's so cold... No flying for me in this weather.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Looks like I can either lose my hat or lose my breath... The wind demands a sacrifice.

## Good Morning
Good morning. Don't be fooled, I'm not a morning person. But I have to get to the clinic to feed the critters, or they'll start making a real racket.

## Good Afternoon
Oh hey, I was just about to break for lunch too. Wanna come with?

## Good Evening
I tend to stay home at night. That way, people — and saurians — know where to find me in an emergency. Or if it's a quiet night, then I can just chill out and rest.

## Good Night
G'night. There's no predicting what life's gonna throw at you tomorrow, all you can do is make sure you're well-rested by the time it rolls around.

## About Ifa: Friends
I'd say I've got quite a big circle of friends. Some cause me headaches, some relieve my headaches, and some of them kinda alternate between the two, depending on the day. It's a nice mix, though. They're all great people.

## About Ifa: Fulfillment
I dunno if everyone's this way, but me personally, I like feeling needed. I find it fulfilling. Maybe the key to a fulfilling life is just having plenty of moments that make me feel that way. But everyone needs to figure out for themselves what makes them tick.

## About Us: Reminder
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> All set for your next trip? You know where you're going, feeling okay, got everything you need?
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> Cool, well, you're looking good to me, and Paimon's fed, so I think you're good to go... Actually, wait — there's just one last thing I wanna check first...
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> No way, bro!

## About Us: Making Sure
You've known me for a while now, so be honest — do you ever feel like I get naggy or overprotective? ...No? Fine just the way I am? Phew... That's a relief 'cause I have a tendency to double- and triple-check everything, probably because I deal with animals so much, and they can't talk to me. Anyway, just wanted to make sure that I'm not being a bother.

## About the Vision
This thing is actually pretty useful. Sometimes, if a saurian gets tired from flying, I send a little gust of Anemo to prop them up for a little while. Discreetly, though, so they don't notice I'm doing it.

## Something to Share
Bribing animals with food is pretty effective, bro. But if you do it too much, they start wanting more treats for the same behavior, or even demanding the reward without working for it. So, whenever I can, I prefer to try and teach them how the world works instead: If you get caught in a trap, you'll get injured, and if you eat the wrong thing, you'll get sick — that sort of thing.
It takes more effort that way, but I think it's worth it. Especially since, in some cases, animals can actually be smarter than humans.

## Interesting Things
If you really pay attention to the world around you, you'll notice it's full of fascinating things. I could spend the whole day just nature-watching if I had the time. But unfortunately, work always finds its way to my doorstep.

## About Kachina
I can tell that Kachina has a real soft spot for saurians. If she put in the work, I'm sure she'd make an excellent vet. But since she's already proven herself as a warrior, she's probably better off focusing on that than trying to study medicine with me on the side.

## About Xilonen
I love chatting with Xilonen. She's always brimming with all sorts of fantastic creative ideas. Sometimes, her insistence on raw functionality can result in contraptions that look a little... intimidating, but then again, intimidation is kind of a function in its own right.

## About Kinich
Serious question: Does Ajaw technically count as a living being?
When he came to see me for treatment, I gave him a very thorough checkup but couldn't find anything wrong with him. So I told Kinich, "Just bash him on the head a few times until he starts working again."
And the moment Ajaw heard that, bro, he was suddenly fine again. Strange coincidence, huh?

## About Chasca
Her work as a peacemaker is extremely important. She cures a lot of ills that are beyond my reach.

## About Ororon: Try Not to Overthink
That guy has a very peculiar way of thinking. You just gotta go with the flow around him. I wouldn't bother trying to figure him out, because honestly he never makes all that much sense.
Anyway, he's not a bad person or anything, and he has his own unique ways of showing that he cares. You'll know what I mean once you've gotten to know him.

## About Ororon: But I Can't Help It
...Okay, even though I'm used to him by now, there are still days when I wish I could get inside his head, just to see what is actually going on in there!

## About Citlali
Granny's... Yeah, she's a tough cookie. With a colorful pajama collection, hahaha...
I try not to get dragged into her and Ororon's drama, so whenever she gives me a message for him, I just pass it right on, word-for-word, no questions asked. I figure if I wanna stay out of her line of fire, the less I know, the better.

## About Mavuika
The Pyro Archon gave me a ride once when I had to get to an emergency visit. Bro, it was so crazy. We get there, my head's still spinning at a million miles an hour, and somehow, I have to patch up this injured saurian... I pulled it off, much to my own surprise. I guess sometimes we don't know our own potential until we're pushed out of our comfort zone.

## About Neuvillette
...What's that? You want me to take care of him if he ever gets sick? Um... you know I'm a vet and not a doctor, right?
Hmm... Well, Cacucu's certainly taken a shine to him... Alright, fine, bro. I'll do my best.

## More About Ifa: I
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> That painting on the board outside my clinic — wasn't me, I swear.
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> Hahahaha!

## More About Ifa: II
I can't actually remember what Cacucu's first word was. What I do remember is being startled awake one morning at five o'clock to the screeching sound of "Rise and shine, bro!" ...Heck of a way to be woken up, lemme tell you.

## More About Ifa: III
I passed the flying trials a long time ago now, so theoretically I could call on any qucusaur for help. But ever since Cacucu came along, he's been a little possessive of me — doesn't like seeing me with another qucusaur, I guess. It's all good though. He's a little young for it, sure, but since he feels up to the task, I'm happy to trust him with it.

## More About Ifa: IV
I want to be the kind of guy who makes everyone feel safe when I'm around. It's a rare privilege to be trusted by other people — not everyone's up to it.

## More About Ifa: V
Being a vet's pretty cool. There's always gonna be those moments where you have to say goodbye, but nothing's ever made me regret my choice. Animals are a lot like kids — they're rowdy little rascals, and they can be hard to get through to. But when all's said and done, they're the future, and I'll always protect them.

## Ifa's Hobbies
Singing's a pretty popular hobby in the Flower-Feather Clan. I like to strum a tune and write a song once in a while, too. It could be a good emotional release.

## Ifa's Troubles
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> I think I have it pretty good, to be honest. Nothing keeping me up at night. ...Oh, but it would be nice if Cacucu learned some more useful phrases.
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> The heck are you on about?

## Favorite Food
Fresh fruit's the best, bro — staves off hunger and quenches your thirst in one go. Plus, I can give a few little chunks to Cacucu.

## Least Favorite Food
Fresh fruit is great, but when people add it to a dish, I'm like dude... why can't I just eat it as-is?

## Receiving a Gift: I
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> Hit me up, bro!
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> Where'd you learn how to call dibs, huh? Alright, alright, you can have half.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Mm, really good. I'm gonna grab some fruit juice to wash it down, what flavor do you want?

## Receiving a Gift: III
<color=#37FFFF>Cacucu:</color> For real, now? Bro, look at the mess you made...
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> No, no! Cacucu... It looks perfectly edible to me. Thanks, bro.

## Birthday
Happy birthday! Wishing you good health and eternal youth.
Sure, you can't stop the relentless march of time, but you can always stay young at heart — and besides, dude, a bad mood doesn't do your health any good. So come on, just for today, cast your worries aside and let's have some fun!
Oh yeah, also, what kind of music are you into? I'll play a song.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Is this, like, a warm-up or something?

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
You gotta take care of yourself before you can take care of other people, right?

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
The gun least drawn is the one you'd better keep in good working order... Oh, dude, what am I saying — I'm a medic, not a warrior. I leave my guns holstered unless I absolutely need them.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
<color=#37FFFF>Ifa:</color> Thanks, bro! If you ever need a hand with anything, don't be shy — hit me up anytime!
