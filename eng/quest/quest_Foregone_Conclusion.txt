# Foregone Conclusion


## Talk 1

Yelan: It looks like we're all here. Well then, time for me to announce the results of the assessment process.
Yelan: I won't drone on about the importance of the Tianshu role. Suffice to say that Uncle Tian entrusted me with the monumentally important task of assessing the candidates, and now it falls to me to give him a satisfactory answer.
Qianwei: All of us here know the score. Don't beat around the bush, just get on with it.
Yelan: Qianwei has many pioneering ideas, but some of his plans are lacking in detail, and he easily gets into testy exchanges with other people.
Yelan: Mingbo is reliable, but not quite ambitious enough, and because of his personality, he struggles to win people over.
Yelan: In contrast, Zhiyi is evenly balanced across the board, and enjoys an excellent reputation in Liyue.
Yelan: After much consideration, I have decided to recommend Zhiyi to the Liyue Qixing.
Qianwei: What!?
Mingbo: Oh, uh... Congratulations...
Zhiyi: Thank you. Honestly, I'm a little surprised to hear my name being announced.
Zhiyi: In my estimation, all three of us are worthy candidates for the Tianshu position. As your competitor, I've become keenly aware of your great talents.
Zhiyi: Would either of you entertain the possibility of working with me in the future, and taking on some of my workload?
Qianwei: I'll have to see. I'm in a bad mood. This is the last thing I want to be thinking about right now.
Mingbo: I don't mind... As long as I can help...
Yelan: Okay, well that's all from me. Zhiyi, you'll have some preparation to do. It won't be long before you're informed of your official appointment. I hope you will work hard and make Uncle Tian proud.
Zhiyi: I will live up to the Tianshu name. On this, you have my word.
Zhiyi: I should go. I need to pack my things and then I think a celebratory meal is in order... Would anyone like to join me?
Qianwei: Count me out. I am not in the mood for a celebration.
Paimon: Zhiyi seems pretty relaxed now. This would be a good time to follow him...
Qianwei: Hey, Traveler! Tell me something — what exactly does that guy have that I don't?
Qianwei: If you can't answer that, I'm not accepting this result!
Mingbo: I, uh... also wouldn't mind knowing...
Paimon: Oh no! If we get stuck here, we won't be able to leave...
Yelan: Follow him.
Wenyuan: Yes, Ma'am.
Black Screen Text: After finally persuading Qianwei and Mingbo to leave...
Paimon: Phew... We finally got rid of them...
Wenyuan: Lady Yelan, Zhiyi has gone towards Feiyun Slope.
Yelan: Follow him. Quickly.

## Talk 2

Shanghua: I'm sorry, Lady Yelan. We lost him.
Shanghua: He's too good at this... We weren't able to keep following him without being seen.
Paimon: How the heck did he manage to shake Yelan's subordinates...
Paimon: I guess Zhiyi didn't let his guard down. Still as vigilant as ever?
Shanghua: No, Wupei says he's much more relaxed than usual... Maybe it's just how he's wired. Perceptive enough to sense when he's being watched.
Paimon: But how...
Yelan: Don't blame yourselves. Let's not forget he was trained by Uncle Tian himself. Evading detection is not an unusual skill for him to have.
Yelan: If I'd asked you to tail Uncle Tian, you'd have ended up at a dead end, too. It's fine. So, where did you lose him?
Shanghua: Xinyue Kiosk. He only went in briefly. Wupei and I were watching outside the whole time.
Shanghua: A few moments later, a man dressed in a completely different outfit came out. Wupei had a feeling that it was him, but we couldn't get close enough to check without blowing our cover.
Shanghua: I figured that if we spooked him, it would undo what we've accomplished today so far. Another option would've been to arrest him there and then... But without any evidence, that would've been meaningless.
Shanghua: So I stopped Wupei, and I stayed here to wait for you while that meathead went to ask around in Xinyue Kiosk.
Yelan: Good work.
Yelan: The fish didn't take the bait, but that's okay. As long as he's still swimming around, we'll find a way to catch him eventually... The key is figuring out what he's trying to achieve.
Yelan: Let's go to Xinyue Kiosk.

## Talk 3

Wupei: Could you explain to me how that works? A guy like him comes in, changes his whole outfit right under your nose, and you don't even ask him about it?
Heli: Our customers are free to dress however they please. What grounds would I have to question him?
Wupei: *sigh* Okay, fair enough, but didn't you think it was just a little bit strange?
Heli: Maybe I did, but it still doesn't give me the right to stop him...
Yelan: Enough, let's tone this down a little.
Yelan: I'll make this quick. Just one question: What did he buy while he was here?
Heli: Oh, he didn't buy anything. He just picked up a bottle of liquor that he ordered ages ago.
Yelan: A bottle of liquor?
Heli: Yes, a very strong kind. Fiery with a rich flavor. Not something the average customer would order.
Heli: This gentleman ordered it in person from us a long time ago. He was only here today to pick it up.
Yelan: Liquor... and wineware... I see. Let's go.
Paimon: Where to?
Yelan: Xigu Antiques.

## Talk 4

Yelan: Hey, Ms. Linlang, sorry to bother you — Zhiyi ordered a wineware set from you not long ago, right?
Yelan: We're friends of his. He's been telling us how impressed he is with the quality considering how affordable it was, so we just had to come and take a look for ourselves.
Linlang: Sure. Which model are you looking for?
Yelan: Um... We don't really know a whole lot about wineware... Let's just go with Zhiyi's choice. Would you be able to show us the one he bought?
Linlang: Zhiyi picked up his set not long ago. As a quality imitation of an antique wineware set, it has the look and feel of a luxury item.
Linlang: Just so you're aware, we don't have many of this model left in stock. And now that Mr. Zhiyi has taken one, I'm afraid... it may encourage the price to go up a little.
Yelan: Don't worry. Price shouldn't be an issue. I'm sure we can work something out. But I'm just a little hazy on one thing — did Zhiyi's wineware set include wine glasses, or...?
Linlang: For this set, the wine glasses are sold separately. Minimum purchase is one glass, maximum is four. Mr. Zhiyi bought two.
Yelan: Okay... Thanks, Linlang. Seems there's a little more to buying wineware than I first thought. We'll have to mull it over.
Linlang: Well, don't take too long. We could sell out any day now... Alright, see you next time.
Black Screen Text: You find a quiet place nearby...
Wenyuan: This is turning into a real headache...
Shanghua: I'd just like to point out that we have the self-professed "Grandmaster of Fieldwork" here to thank for being wholly incapable of tailing an ordinary civilian without being seen.
Wupei: It's not like you did any better!
Shanghua: My specialty is information trading, okay? I don't have the physical agility. What's your excuse?
Wupei: I... ugh... fair point.
Paimon: Yelan, so has the plan failed?
Paimon: If we can't figure out where Zhiyi went, there's not much we can do... But why was he buying liquor at Xinyue Kiosk anyway? To celebrate?
Yelan: If so, it's no ordinary celebration.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Yelan: First of all, Zhiyi isn't much of a drinker. On some level, he hates alcohol because of what it did to his father.
Yelan: If he was just looking to celebrate by himself, he wouldn't spend his meager savings on an expensive bottle of alcohol, let alone buy a pair of special wine glasses.
Yelan: No, this is a victory feast... held in honor of Zhiyi's private sponsor.
Yelan: Whoever this person is clearly enjoys hard liquor and has a very high status — hence the need for expensive-looking wineware.
Yelan: Now, where might we find Fatui who match that description, I wonder?
Wenyuan: Fatui officials? Should be either the Snezhnayan Embassy or the Northland Bank.
Yelan: Have both locations surrounded. Take as many people as you need.
Wupei: Lady Yelan, is it time for us to make our move? If so, you can count me in.
Yelan: Get with the program, would you? This is a covert surveillance operation. Zhiyi may be vigilant, but that doesn't mean the same is true for his drinking buddy.
Yelan: In which case, we don't need to change tactics, just change who we're following.
Paimon: Great idea! So we just need to find out who Zhiyi bought that liquor for and follow them instead!
Wenyuan: But Lady Yelan, if we get caught, this could become a major diplomatic incident...
Yelan: I'm well aware. But don't you see? Zhiyi is gambling everything on this. If we really want to catch him, we're going to have to accept a little risk ourselves.
Yelan: Stick to your orders. And make sure we're covering all other bases, too — anywhere else Zhiyi might be going, I want eyes on those locations.
Wenyuan: ...Yes, Ma'am.
Shanghua: Don't worry, Lady Yelan. Zhiyi may be a slippery character, but we'll keep a close watch on the movements of all Fatui officials.
Yelan: I'll be waiting for you at the teahouse.
Yelan: #If I'm guessing correctly, Fatui officials are likely to take action at night. {NICKNAME}, you should go and get ready, then meet me at Yanshang Teahouse.

## Talk 5

Yelan: Perfect timing. Wenyuan just sent word that the Fatui Ambassador, Yusupov, just left the embassy alone. He's heading in the direction of Qingxu Pool.
Paimon: Qingxu Pool? That's the place Zhiyi mentioned in his manifesto...
Yelan: It looks like that's where they've arranged to meet. Sensible choice, I'll give them that.
Yelan: Qingxu Pool is always crawling with monsters. Most people wouldn't dream of going there. It's one place they won't need to worry about being seen.
Paimon: Oh no! We gotta go get them!
Yelan: Let's go. If my hunch is correct, we just might hit the jackpot this time.

## Talk 6

Yelan: There's been some work done on this place in the past, but it's a bit of a labyrinth inside. I can't guarantee we'll be safe once we're underground.
Yelan: The workers left an emergency access route. If we can find it, this will be a much easier journey.
Yelan: Still... Be ready to fight at any moment. Any resistance needs to be taken out quickly and quietly. We don't want to attract too much attention.
Paimon: Don't worry, we're all professionals here!
Paimon: By the way, Yelan, where are your three little helpers at?
Yelan: They have other things to take care of first. We couldn't afford to wait for them, but they'll join us later.

## Talk 7

Paimon: You guys see that? That's gotta be the Fatui Ambassador, here to meet Zhiyi... Looks like he went through that door!
Paimon: That must be the emergency access route, right? Come on, let's hurry!

## Talk 8

Paimon: The water's gone down... Hey, look, is that another way through?

## Talk 9

Yusupov: Mmm... I can tell from the aroma that this is very fine liquor indeed. I'm impressed.
Yusupov: Come on, bottoms up. After you, of course!
Zhiyi: *coughing* ...Sorry, that went down the wrong way. I've never drunk anything this strong before. It'll take me some getting used to.
Yusupov: You'll get there. If you want to stay friends with us, you have to drink with us.
Zhiyi: *cough* ...I'll do my best.
Yusupov: You're more of a lightweight than I thought... Already struggling after one glass?
Yusupov: I thought you were made of sterner stuff. You certainly kept it together when you were poisoning your teacher's soup!
Yusupov: Come on, another round. Less talking, more drinking, haha!
Zhiyi: Sure. You didn't leave me much of a choice, though, did you? Just the mention of poisoning sends shivers down my spine.
Zhiyi: I'm more timid than you realize. Every time I poisoned him, I had to hide away at home for a few days because I was so scared of getting caught.
Yusupov: Look, I know it has not been easy for you, my friend. We appreciate all your hard work.
Yusupov: But I have to say: You really are quite a genius at poisoning people.
Yusupov: I mean, the poison we brought from Snezhnaya is as strong as this wine, but you found a way to turn it into an imperceptible, slow-acting poison and came up with the idea of delivering it through fish soup.
Yusupov: What was it you said... Oh yeah. You said "the soup's fishy flavor neutralizes the pungency of the poison, and this process even makes the soup tastier as a result"... Tsk tsk, how did you think of that?
Zhiyi: It struck me one day when I was fishing. I'm lucky it did, otherwise, I'm not sure I would have been able to fool Uncle Tian.
Yusupov: You have performed excellently! The Fatui will continue to provide the support you need to consolidate your position as Tianshu. Of course, this is as long as you continue to do as we instruct.
Yusupov: Aside from Qingxu Pool, we also have some other requests for you, which we will inform you of in due course.
Zhiyi: Don't worry. Whatever tasks you have for me, I will perform them diligently.
Paimon: Did you hear that? It was poison... That's why Uncle Tian hasn't been feeling well recently. It's all Zhiyi's doing!
Paimon: What a nasty guy! Seize him!
Yelan: #Hold on. Did you bring a Kamera, {NICKNAME}?
Yelan: If not, you can use mine. This is quite a scene. We have to capture it for posterity.
Black Screen Text: You take a picture of Zhiyi drinking with Yusupov...
Yusupov: Ahhh... Excellent liquor!
Yusupov: We've seen no progress on the diplomatic front, and everyone has been eyeing up the treasure of Qingxu Pool. It's been a real headache for me.
Yusupov: But soon, everything will be taken care of, and I can report back on a successful mission. Thank you, Zhiyi!
Yusupov: I remember when I first saw you... I knew right away that you would make a good partner for us. Hey, do you still remember what I said to you?
Zhiyi: How could I forget. You said a lowly commoner like me could never be seen as a serious candidate for the Tianshu, no matter how hard I work.
Zhiyi: "The only way is for you to shine bright in the Tianshu's darkest moment"... I think you were absolutely right.
Yusupov: Yes. Under normal circumstances, the gap between you and other people could only ever grow wider over time.
Yusupov: Just look at your two competitors. Qianwei had wealth, Mingbo had reputation, but you? You had nothing. You were just another nobody!
Yusupov: ...And that's why I decided to help you. Yeah, there is an old saying in the Fatui: Give a starving dog a bone, and it'll guard your home for the rest of its life.
Zhiyi: Yes, I cannot thank you enough for your generous support.
Yusupov: Hahaha... You know, the best thing about you is that you do as you're told, without complaining. Keep up the good work, and I can assure you, you'll never have to worry about Mora again.
Yusupov: Heck, when you're not in the company of the Fatui, you'll be able to throw your weight around as much as you want. How about that?
Yelan: Uncle Gao said that Zhiyi has low self-esteem... Seems he was right.
Yelan: He was worried that whatever advantage he might have now will diminish over time... so the Fatui persuaded him that he should act while he can.
Yelan: Do you have any more film in the Kamera?
Traveler: Plenty.
Yelan: Then get ready to use it. Tonight's grand finale should be coming up any minute now.
Yelan: How well this goes for us depends on how Zhiyi plays his hand.
Yusupov: Is there any more alcohol? Go on, fill me up. I'm in a good mood today, and I'm gonna drink my fill. Make sure to get me home safely afterward.
Zhiyi: There's only a little left. Here, I'll fill your glass. If you like it, I can bring you some more next time.
Yusupov: *gulp* ...Phwoar, this is the good stuff, it is great...
Yusupov: Huh? Ugh... *cough* ... *cough* ...What the...
Black Screen Text: Suddenly, the Fatui official seems to be in pain and slowly drops to the ground.
Yusupov: Zhiyi... You... You poisoned my wine? But when...
Zhiyi: You seem surprised, Mr. Yusupov?
Yusupov: You... How could you...
Zhiyi: How could I not? I've sacrificed years of my life studying and reflecting to prepare myself for this position, and in the end I even had to poison my own teacher.
Zhiyi: You really think I'd put myself through all that just to become your little puppet? I don't want to bow down to anyone ever again, and that includes you.
Yusupov: You imbecile! It's the Fatui who got you to where you are, do you understand? ...If I disappear with no explanation, the embassy will come after you... They'll get to the bottom of this, mark my words!
Zhiyi: Do you see the haystack in the corner? Underneath it is a pile of explosives. And next door in the darkroom are the three undercover agents you sent to infiltrate the Blackcliff Forge.
Zhiyi: I'm gonna stay here till I see you slip into unconsciousness, then I'm gonna set this on fire. Once the flames burn through the hay, they'll ignite the explosives, the ruins will collapse, and everything will be buried.
Yusupov: Wh—What do you hope to...
Zhiyi: I took the liberty of leaving some evidence of your contact with the undercover agents at the Blackcliff Forge. It won't take long for people to join the dots... Two missing-person cases will become one as the "truth" gradually reveals itself.
Zhiyi: The Fatui planted undercover agents in the Blackcliff Forge to steal their signature ruin-grade explosives. Their plan was to blow through the solid floor tiles in the dead of night and seize the treasure of Qingxu Pool.
Zhiyi: *sigh*...But things didn't quite go to plan. Mistakes were made that led to the accidental deaths of the entire crew.
Zhiyi: Faced with the overwhelming evidence, the embassy won't investigate this any further. In fact, they'll be only too happy to blame it all on a rogue operation by you.
Zhiyi: It explains why you acted alone, while exonerating the rest of the embassy of any liability.
Zhiyi: Of course, none of that will have anything to do with me. When all of this comes to my attention, I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to cancel the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan immediately. I guess then, I'll be Tianshu in my own right, with a clean record and well out of the Fatui's reach.
Yusupov: Haha... Hah.
Yusupov: Zhiyi, do you really think you're gonna get away with this? The Fatui has a record of everything! That includes the poison, all interactions between us, even my trip here tonight!
Yusupov: After I die... they'll come looking... and they'll get to the bottom of this...
Zhiyi: A record? Oh, you must mean the one in the hands of your second-in-command, Theofan?
Yusupov: H—How do you know about that?
Zhiyi: Because when you contacted me, I also made contact with your associates. I have Theofan to thank for providing me with the poison I used on you today.
Zhiyi: He'll help me tie up all the loose ends. After all, your untimely demise comes with a few perks for him.
Zhiyi: He has been eyeing your position for a long time now.
Yusupov: That traitor! *cough* ... *cough* ...Zhiyi, you—
Zhiyi: Shhh. Relax... It's over. After tonight, everyone gets what they want. And anyone else in the know is either my accomplice, or about to be taken out of the picture.
Zhiyi: Sweet dreams, Mr. Yusupov.

## Talk 10

Yelan: I did a little surveying on the way here, and found that you'd left yourself three escape routes in case things went south.
Yelan: I have them all surrounded. If you're thinking of trying anything, save yourself the effort. The game's up.
Yelan: We were here the whole time and have pictures of everything. They came out pretty nicely, wanna see them?
Zhiyi: "The game's up"? ...Forgive me, I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, Ms. Yelan?
Zhiyi: I happened to discover a Fatui operation here, so I approached them on the pretext of joining forces and eventually brought them down from within. If it pleases you, Ms. Yelan, I'd be only too happy to have you join me in investigating this matter.
Yelan: This is how you want to play it, huh?
Yelan: Fine, you do you. All we need to do to convict you is establish that the poison in his system is the same as in Uncle Tian's.
Zhiyi: ...
Yelan: Nothing else you wanted to add? Let's leave it there then. Time to go.
Zhiyi: One wrong move and it all comes crashing down... I should have been more careful.
Zhiyi: You followed him here, didn't you? I was so focused on keeping myself out of sight, I forgot he was a potential liability.
Zhiyi: Let's talk about this, Yelan. I gave you my word that I would live up to the Tianshu name, and that much I can still guarantee.
Yelan: Your point being?
Zhiyi: When I take office, I can guarantee that I will act in your best interests. In fact, all of you here tonight can expect very generous treatment in the future.
Zhiyi: I don't deny that I used underhanded methods to get here. But given my lowly origins, what other choice did I have?
Yelan: Hmph, you still don't get it, do you? Even now.
Yelan: #What do you think, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: What will Uncle Tian think?
Traveler: Uncle Tian has always trusted you.
Yelan: Exactly. Zhiyi, clever people can always come up with a good excuse. But while you might be able to get other people to believe you, you'll never be able to deceive yourself.
Yelan: There's nothing wrong with wanting to win other people's respect. But when has Uncle Tian ever looked down on you?
Yelan: He was like a teacher and a father to you, but you chose to repay that by poisoning him... Whatever positive goal you may have started out with, you threw it away in that moment.
Zhiyi: That's enough... I...
Yelan: Of course, what makes this even crueler is that you managed to convince yourself there was "no other way." Uncle Tian was always going to give you this opportunity... even if you'd done nothing at all.
Yelan: Out of everyone in the world, he is the one who trusts you the most. So much that he drank your fish soup without doubting you, not for one second.
Zhiyi: That's enough! ...That's enough.
Black Screen Text: Yelan's subordinates take Zhiyi and Yusupov away.
Yelan: #Sorry, things are about to get extremely busy for me. Let's meet at Yanshang Teahouse tomorrow morning, {NICKNAME}.
Yelan: I'll have someone remove the explosives. Then, there's someone I have to go and see.
Paimon: Need our help with that?
Yelan: No. It could be dangerous... You should leave this one to the professionals.
Traveler: Be careful.
Yelan: Don't worry. As long as they're willing to cooperate, this'll be a straightforward deal.
Yelan: Get some rest. See you tomorrow.

## Talk 11

Baizhu: Ah, there is now no poison left in his system. But recovery from the damage already done will not happen overnight.
Huixin: Dr. Baizhu, is my father going to be...
Baizhu: You needn't worry too much. Keep taking the prescribed medicine, every day, and a full recovery will take at most two to three years.
Baizhu: It's good we caught it in time. A few days later, and the toxin would've built up in the internal organs. At that point, things would've been much more serious.
Baizhu: How did they successfully secure such a seldom-seen poison? It seems the Fatui are extremely resourceful!
Baizhu: Unfortunately for them, they were up against us.
Baizhu: Uncle Tian, we'll be heading off now. Remember to get plenty of rest and avoid over-exerting yourself while you're recovering.
Uncle Tian: Don't worry, I will. Thank you very much.
Uncle Tian: #Ah, you're here, too, {NICKNAME}? Thank you for all you've done to resolve this situation. I'll have to make some tea in a moment, you simply have to try it.
Traveler: Are you feeling any better?
Uncle Tian: Yes. The exhaustion seems to have gone, and my mind is steadily getting clearer again.
Yelan: Luckily, it looks like choosing the Tianshu's successor is suddenly not such a pressing issue after all.
Paimon: Hey, Yelan!
Yelan: My work is mostly wrapped up, so I thought I'd take a minute to check in here.
Yelan: The assessment process comes to an end here, Uncle Tian. In my opinion, Zhiyi is not suitable for the position. But Qianwei and Mingbo both have potential.
Uncle Tian: You have my gratitude.
Uncle Tian: *sigh* ...People can change their loyalties easily, I've always known this. But whenever it happens, it's still a dismal experience.
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or... is Uncle Tian not that surprised?
Yelan: Hehe, don't underestimate Uncle Tian. He wouldn't have appointed me as assessment officer if he hadn't had his doubts about Zhiyi.
Yelan: Normally, the Yuehai Pavilion would be responsible for assessing the candidates. Isn't that right, Uncle Tian?
Uncle Tian: Yes. To be quite honest, I wanted to trust him unreservedly, but I have to be responsible with the position of Tianshu.
Uncle Tian: When I first met Zhiyi, I wondered if he had approached me with a hidden agenda, so I secretly investigated him.
Uncle Tian: I concluded that he had no ulterior motives whatsoever. He just saw me as an ordinary fishing friend.
Uncle Tian: In the end, even he changed... but when did it start?
Traveler: What if none of this had ever happened?
Uncle Tian: I never had any plans to recommend him directly, but I always intended to give him the chance to compete on a level playing field. Family background and fame mean everything to many people, but I don't attach great importance to them.
Uncle Tian: I had no reputation to speak of when I first became Tianshu. I relied on Ganyu's assistance for all manner of things. What I really admired about Zhiyi was his intelligence and resilience.
Yelan: I have to admit, he's a smart guy, and very cautious.
Yelan: The intel suggests that the Fatui saw him as very low risk, but Zhiyi was still extremely careful with the poisoning.
Yelan: He chose that specific liquor from Xinyue Kiosk because the fiery flavor would mask the bitterness of the poison, and he chose to wait until the Fatui official was drunk and had his guard down before delivering it to him.
Yelan: He also installed a secret compartment in the wine pot he bought to hold the poison. As the amount of liquor went down, he'd shake the pot to release the poison from the compartment into the liquor.
Yelan: Afterwards, we also found he had an antidote on him. Had the Fatui official grown suspicious, Zhiyi would have drunk the poisoned wine himself, and then found an opportunity to take the antidote shortly afterwards.
Paimon: But that's still really dangerous...
Yelan: Yes, had he drunk the poisonous wine, he still would've faced serious health consequences despite taking the antidote. He didn't hesitate to put himself in harm's way to achieve his goal.
Uncle Tian: How is Zhiyi now?
Yelan: Well, I mean, he's sitting in a jail cell. Like Yanfei says, everyone who breaks the law has to pay the price.
Yelan: Still, he's cooperating. He didn't turn down my offer to strike a deal. I'll make sure there are plenty of guards around to keep him safe from anything the Fatui might be planning.
Paimon: A deal? Does this have to do with what you said to him when you arrested him?
Yelan: Yes. Zhiyi's not the one I'm interested in. If he was as far as this went, I'd have handed the case off to my subordinates as soon as I realized.
Yelan: But once the Fatui became involved, things got a whole lot more interesting... I thought I might have the chance to catch a big fish.
Uncle Tian: Well, did you?
Yelan: Almost. Unfortunately, it slipped off the hook at the last second.
Paimon: Uncle Tian, Yelan, what are you talking about? Paimon doesn't understand...
Yelan: Zhiyi colluded with the Fatui to try and secure the position of Tianshu. Or, to put it the other way around, the Fatui made an attempt to interfere in the Tianshu selection process.
Yelan: With Yusupov in our hands and a statement from Zhiyi, we could afford to continue with a diplomatic offensive.
Yelan: Also, we'd be able to gain control of Theofan, Yusupov's second-in-command. Then we'd have a pawn in the ranks of the Fatui.
Yelan: Pawns like this can be major assets. They open up all sorts of new options.
Traveler: So this was your real plan?
Yelan: Why else did you think I was investing so much time and effort into this case?
Paimon: So, okay, well... Did your plan succeed?
Yelan: We got halfway. The first part went off without a hitch, and we passed all the information on to Lady Ningguang.
Yelan: But when we tried to make contact with Theofan, he was gone... along with all the evidence.
Uncle Tian: The Fatui must be spying on us. Otherwise, they'd never have been able to respond so quickly.
Yelan: I found out from other sources that the Harbinger "Regrator" got involved.
Yelan: The Fatui's main forces aren't concentrated here. Regrator was only treating this as a peripheral concern.
Yelan: It's a pity that Theofan got away. But knowing which Harbingers are still looking at Liyue is something. It gives me a starting point for my next mission.
Uncle Tian: I have to ask, Yelan, do you have any desire to take over the position of Tianshu yourself?
Uncle Tian: I remember you showed some interest a few days ago at Yanshang Teahouse. In my estimation, you are more than competent.
Yelan: Oh that... I was obviously joking.
Yelan: I prefer my current life. There's danger and there's excitement.
Yelan: Although it'd still be a behind-the-scenes role, as Tianshu, I wouldn't have the chance to get involved in anything truly clandestine or face any real danger.
Yelan: Alright, I'm done here, time for me to go. I'm heading off again in a few days, and I still have to prepare.
Paimon: Where are you off to this time?
Yelan: As you might have guessed... Heh, it's for me to know, and you to find out.
Yelan: But I'm sure if you keep going as you are, getting yourselves involved in other people's business all the time, you're sure to get caught up in another misadventure before too long.
Yelan: Maybe I'll see you the next time danger beckons. Until then, keep your wits about you... A lot of people are watching you for a lot of reasons.
Yelan: If you have any more questions, just ask Uncle Tian. After the recent turn of events... I'd say he owes you one, wouldn't you?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Uncle Tian: What would you like to know?
Traveler: About Zhiyi...
Uncle Tian: Something I've said to Zhiyi, Qianwei, and Mingbo before is that while cunning and scheming are quite crucial, even more important than this is staying true to yourself.
Uncle Tian: Zhiyi and Ambassador Yusupov each saw the other as a means to an end. They thought that if they could just outsmart their opponent, they would emerge the final victor. And yet, in the eyes of Yelan and "Regrator," they are but pawns in a much bigger game.
Uncle Tian: Scheming is an endless endeavor. If you can't cope with it, you're better off staying out of it. It gives you a much clearer view, in any case.
Uncle Tian: Everyone has self-interest, but you cannot let it be your master. So don't fight over fleeting gains and losses. Rather, focus on the direction your heart is leading you, and keep moving forward.
Traveler: About Yelan...
Uncle Tian: I first met Yelan when she was very young. Even back then, she was extremely tough, and she kept her cards close to her chest.
Uncle Tian: An old friend of mine once privately commented to me that Yelan "is always smiling, but never with her eyes. She is a very dangerous person."
Uncle Tian: Something of an exaggeration, in my view. At least, I know she would never hurt the people she trusts.
Traveler: About "Regrator"...
Uncle Tian: "Regrator" is the 9th of the Fatui Harbingers, though likely the first among them where wealth is concerned.
Uncle Tian: However, his "wealth" is not a mere question of how much Mora he has to his name. He has a very unique understanding of wealth... And what he's planning may very well shake the world to its core.
Uncle Tian: Beyond that, I don't have a lot of information about him. If you need to know more in the future, you can ask Ningguang.
Traveler: About the next Tianshu...
Uncle Tian: As Yelan says, now that I'm on the mend, I should have another few years' worth of work in me.
Uncle Tian: During this time, I plan to gradually hand over my duties while mentoring some new candidates.
Uncle Tian: Ah, that reminds me. Qianwei and Mingbo are still waiting downstairs. I must go and have a chat with them shortly.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Uncle Tian: Thanks to you and Yelan, everything turned out okay this time.
Uncle Tian: You can always find me at the wharf if there's ever something else you'd like to discuss in the future.

### Additional Talk 2

Mingbo: So, Zhiyi... is already in prison, I guess?
Qianwei: You think? He poisoned Uncle Tian... I still can't believe he'd do that.
Mingbo: *sigh* ...
Qianwei: Why the long face?
Mingbo: Nothing... I just... I think it's a great shame.
Mingbo: I always thought... he's very smart. If he became Tianshu... he'd be able to accomplish many things I could never hope to.
Qianwei: Don't feel bad. I'll admit that he was a strong contender, but give me three years and I'll overtake him.
Qianwei: When I become Tianshu, I'll make you my deputy. Like the sound of that?
Mingbo: Start by working on your temperamental issues... If you can't keep your cool, your work will suffer.
Mingbo: Right now... you still have a long way to go before you'll be eligible to take the Tianshu position.
Qianwei: I'll get there. One step at a time. And then, before you know it, there'll come a day when you won't be able to find a single flaw in me or my work.
Qianwei: First things first, though... Let's go and talk to Uncle Tian.
