Traveler: Stories?
Everallin: The harbor is not a place where waters and ships cross paths, but also one where stories gather.
Everallin: Many tourists, merchants, and even lovers of books from the land of deserts and rainforests come here.
Everallin: Many people love chatting with me, because that would be the first time they've ever met a Melusine.
Everallin: Thanks to everyone, I've also heard lots of stories from beyond these waters. It's great working here.
