Traveler: Fishing?
Serene: Yes. She said that she met an angler named Delaroche and learned fishing skills from her... Despite that, she's been unable to catch anything — much to her consternation...
Serene: *sigh* I'm not sure how I can help her. I've given it some thought, though — if all else fails, I can play the role of the fish myself...
Serene: But that's not really a solution I'd call "good," so... Could you try helping her?
