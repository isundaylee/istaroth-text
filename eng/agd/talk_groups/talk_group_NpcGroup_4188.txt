Arabalika: #Arama is on an adventure with Nara Traveler. Ararakalari match with Arama, Arabalika wants.

## Talk

Traveler: About Arama...
Arabalika: #Big Iron Chunk is no match for Nara Traveler, and Arama is no match for Vanagni.
Arabalika: #But during adventures with Nara Traveler, Arama will beat Big Iron Chunks someday.
Arabalika: When Arama becomes stronger, Arabalika wants another match with Arama.
Arabalika: Then Arabalika can continue the Ararakalari training, without leaving Vanarana.

## Talk

Traveler: About Ararakalari...
Arabalika: Before many sunrises, Arabalika was so weak in Ararakalari, almost weak as Paimon. Back then, Aradasha could kick the Big Iron Chunks over.
Arabalika: Later, when Arabalika finally beats running mushroom, Aradasha is nowhere to be found.
Arabalika: That's bad. With no Aranara to kick the Big Iron Chunks over, the Big Iron Chunks will stomp their feet and turn Vanarana into a huge mess.
Arabalika: Luckily, the Big Iron Chunks now can't beat Arabalika. It must be blessings from Aradasha.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arabalika: When will Arabalika have another match with Arama...

Traveler: About match...
Arabalika: Nara are so powerful, because they like matches. But many Aranara are like Aranakula, they don't like matches.
Arabalika: #Nara Traveler is strong, should like matches.
Arabalika: #Nara Varuna, and Nara Traveler, which one is stronger? A match between Golden Nara, Arabalika wants to see.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arabalika: #Bye, Nara Traveler, hope Nara Traveler will meet Nara Varuna.
