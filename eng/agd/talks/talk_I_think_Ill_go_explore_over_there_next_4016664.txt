Avena: I think I'll go explore over there next!
Lemta: Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
Avena: Oh, I know, I haven't forgotten! But isn't it the Sabzeruz Festival that's going on right now?
Avena: How could I not throw myself, body and soul, into such an important holiday?
Lemta: Your whole body and soul and one thing, but if you throw your whole wallet at the festival too, you won't have anything left to cover adventuring expenses, you know!
Avena: Oh, wallet schmallet! That's where you're wrong. You can't eat money, it's meant to be spent!
Lemta: *sigh* Really? Well, alright, then...
