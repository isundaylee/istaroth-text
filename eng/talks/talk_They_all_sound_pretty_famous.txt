Traveler: They all sound pretty famous.
Asenath: That's right. The associated literature indicates that the Dragon King, the supreme spirit Apep, was alone amongst the Seven Pillars in not appearing in person.
Asenath: Of the remaining six, these were most important: The Goat King Heryshaf, Minister of Ministers, the Crocodile King Sobek, Captain of Captains, the Ibis King Thoth, Scribe of Scribes...
Asenath: And Hermanubis, greatest of sages.
Asenath: As for the other two, Bennu Most-Radiant and Shesepankh Most-Holy, the texts claim that they refer more to "human souls" and "Jinni."
Asenath: Speaking of Jinni, it's just a shame that I was born this late. I'd love to have seen a legendary being like that in the flesh.
Asenath: Err, sorry, I said that out loud, didn't I?
Asenath: I'd originally intended to just share some ancient knowledge â€” I've always loved these "names and titles" bridging segments in books! Especially when someone starts to rattle theirs off...
Asenath: And the best titles are slightly on the long side.
