Traveler: So, what's with you and the Yashiro Commission?
Kano Nana: Specifically, you're asking why a ninja from the Yashiro Commission would a shrine maiden to look after her, right?
Kano Nana: Because the Yashiro Commission is in charge of the religious and ceremonial affairs as well as other cultural matters in Inazuma. Therefore, the shrine maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine must also follow the orders of the Yashiro Commission.
Kano Nana: Though I suppose a ninja like Sayu who likes to slack off and needs a specific person to look after her is something of an exception...
Kano Nana: Please help me look out for her while you are traveling around. Please!
