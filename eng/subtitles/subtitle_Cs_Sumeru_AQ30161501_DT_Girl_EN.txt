What are all these people doing here
At this hour of the night?
Ah, the triumphant hero returns at last
And to a rather spectacular welcome, even if I do say so myself
You're...
The outcast, expelled from the Akademiya...
Indeed, I am, although these days they tend to call me:
The Doctor
If you're looking for your researcher friend, she has already been taken into confinement
With some basic caution, she could have discovered the listening device on her person
Clearly, she lacks the degree of rigor expected of a true scholar
The people of Sumeru City...
What have you done to them?
I simply made some minor adjustments to their Akasha Terminals
Now they can deposit information directly into the subconscious
As you can see, all these lovely people now believe
This Traveler is a hero who has just saved the world
Hehe... My experiment is a success
And now, it seems they can no longer hold back their sheer adoration
Oh no
What should we do!? These are all just regular people...
Leave now
You need to get out of here
But...
That guy's a Fatui Harbinger! We can't just leave you here...
Nor can I abandon... the people of Sumeru!
Don't worry
We'll meet again outside of the city
I see... You appear to have overridden their mental faculties
With your own consciousness
To possess such a powerful mind...
You must be...
The God of Wisdom
