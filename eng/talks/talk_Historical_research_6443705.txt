Traveler: Historical research...?
Tanjiyy: Yeah, why do you look so surprised?
Tanjiyy: The legend of the God King is part of history, Parvezravan's family affairs are part of history... and so is the mysterious tragedy of the Tanit.
Tanjiyy: To put it simply, think about these questions: How do we piece together the fragmented truth?
Tanjiyy: What purpose did the record-keeper hold when they wrote down those words? What were they thinking?
Tanjiyy: ...All of them are history.
