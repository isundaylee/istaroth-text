Sluasi: Why haven't the materials I ordered before arrived yet...
Sluasi: Hmm. The accessories you're wearing seem rather strange...

Traveler: My accessories?
Sluasi: Ah, I'm sorry. I'm an artisan — whenever I see ornaments and such that I've never seen before, my mind jumps right to "How do I make that"?
Sluasi: Ah, yours are so beautiful — simple yet full of charm. I love them.

Traveler: You spoke of materials you ordered...
Sluasi: That's right — I mean gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine.
Sluasi: I make all kinds of accessories out of gems, but conversely, I can't do my work without them.
Sluasi: *sigh* I just wish the goods would come in faster...

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Sluasi: *sigh* To think that Puca's run off at a time like this...
Sluasi: Well, since she's got friends with her, things can't be too bad, right...?

Traveler: I've got some other things to attend to right now...

Traveler: How's the paint-making going?
Sluasi: They're still in the final adjustment phase. We should be done pretty soon!
Sluasi: It is taking longer than I thought it would, though... But just like with gems, I have to create the perfect paints.
Sluasi: If it isn't perfect work, it isn't worth doing. *sigh* If only Puca would understand that sooner...

Traveler: You spoke of materials you ordered...
Sluasi: That's right — I refer to gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine...
Sluasi: Just like how it is with the paint-making materials you showed me previously...
Sluasi: There is much work for a gem artisan like myself that cannot start without source materials.
Sluasi: Gah, I just wish those goods would come in faster...
