Traveler: You love reading, huh?
Angelique: Of course I do. In fact, I have my own criteria for good and bad books.
Angelique: For example, I prefer our local creative style. I mean, Inazuman light novels do feature detectives and reasoning too, but they all seem to have some sort of inexplicable sentimentality...
Angelique: The cases themselves are plenty to look at, so why must they add all this romance? I'm here for a complete and clear chain of logic. I didn't sign up to read some sappy romance story...
