# When Scholar and Legends Meet


## Talk 1

Soraya: Mt. Tianheng... Skybracer... Hmm...
Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Soraya: Ah, I'm currently researching the history and legends of Lantern Rite.
Soraya: I've heard that this year's Mingxiao Lantern is modeled after an adeptus named Skybracer.
Soraya: From what legends I've been able to gather, this adeptus also fought alongside Rex Lapis for a time.
Soraya: The exact times and the enemies they faced have differed from text to ancient text...
Soraya: But all the sources concur that Skybracer has already passed on, and it has been stated that this adeptus once held Mt. Tianheng up with their own antlers.
Soraya: That's why I came to Mt. Tianheng to see for myself, thinking that if I got lucky, I might find something...
Soraya: But as it turns out, Mt. Tianheng is crawling with monsters. After ascertaining the site for my investigations, I found it to be so full of monsters as to be impassable...
Soraya: Traveler, if you're willing, could you help me investigate and take some soil samples?
Traveler: Soil... samples?
Soraya: Well, that's what we'd say at the Akademiya, but what we really mean is some soil from the area in question.
Soraya: Local legends hold that Skybracer held Mt. Tianheng up with their own antlers...
Soraya: From an academic perspective, it stands to reason that the ground here might have an unusual composition.
Soraya: So please, help me go there and retrieve a soil sample.

## Talk 2

Soraya: Antlers... Mt. Tianheng... Hmm, if this is real...

## Talk 3

Soraya: Have you brought the sample back with you?
Traveler: I've brought it.
Soraya: Thank you very much. Let me have a look.
Soraya: ...Hmm, there seems to be nothing special about the soil here.
Traveler: What were you hoping to find?
Soraya: The legends say that Skybracer used their strong antlers to protect Liyue Harbor by preventing Mt. Tianheng from collapsing.
Soraya: I thought that I could at least find some fragments of those antlers...
Soraya: As I thought, legends are just that, legends... Or has so much time passed since that battle that all traces of it have long since vanished?
Soraya: Still, getting a soil sample is, in and of itself, not a bad result...
Soraya: Traveler, could you accompany me for a while longer? I'd like to head upwards, it shouldn't be too far.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Soraya: This time... I want to get to a vantage point from which I can overlook Mt. Tianheng and study its terrain.
Soraya: The tales say that Rex Lapis and many adepti took part in that battle, and very nearly caused Mt. Tianheng to collapse.
Soraya: If the battle truly was that fierce, then perhaps we might be able to deduce something from the terrain.
Traveler: What are you looking for this time?

## Talk 4

Soraya: We're finally here... That journey would have been tough enough even without those monsters...
Soraya: Hmm... There doesn't seem to be anything special about the terrain here...
Soraya: Huh? What's this in the tree... Oh, it's a Xiao Lantern...
Soraya: Why would there be a Xiao Lantern here? Did someone come here to pay their respects to the deceased adeptus?
Soraya: There's something written here...
Soraya: "May all the world be at peace."
Traveler: A magnificent wish.
Soraya: Indeed. But this wish... How should I put it... It seems a little too magnificent. This seems neither like a wish, nor a way of paying respects.
Soraya: It seems more like a wish that one of those adepti of legend might make.
Soraya: I wonder, who would write such a wish onto a Xiao Lantern? How strange...
Soraya: Regardless, it seems that at least someone remembered to put a Xiao Lantern up here. That adeptus should be quite pleased.
Soraya: Thank you for accompanying me all this way. I'd like to stay here and do a bit more research...
Soraya: Ah, yes. This is for you. Consider it thanks for your help.
Soraya: *sigh* Liyue has so many legends, and yet my research has seen no progress made at all...
Traveler: It doesn't sound like this person was here to pay respects...
