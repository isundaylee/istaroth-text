Erfan: What a blunder... I won't get to watch the competitions during the day if I'm working nights!
Erfan: That said... ah, I can't just dip work and go see the competition during the day, haha.
Erfan: Keeping that in mind gives me some balance. Maybe my classmates might fill me in on what's happening in the competition over some drinks at night.
Erfan: With the gala comes more tourists, and with more tourists comes an increase to my pay. I might even hear some new drunken jokes! Seems like I'm being well compensated for my time!
