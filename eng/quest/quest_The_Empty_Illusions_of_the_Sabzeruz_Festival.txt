# The Empty Illusions of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Paimon: ...Our memories are back!
Traveler: Let's go and try to leave the city today.
Paimon: ...About that... Well, where should Paimon begin...
Traveler: Huh? Paimon, what do you mean?
Nahida: Traveler, aside from your memories that were just restored, I have another message for you.
Traveler: Another message? From who?
Nahida: Listen to it and you'll understand.
Traveler: "...Can't go back... There are countless spaces here. Our Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru City is just one of them..."
Traveler: This is... my own voice!?
Paimon: Traveler, you should be missing two days' worth of memories. Paimon will fill you in...
Black Screen Text: Two days ago.
Paimon: ...It's time to carry out our plan from yesterday!
Traveler: Let's go and try to leave the city today.
Paimon: Okay, let's go!

## Talk 2

Merchant: ...Why can't we leave the city? What is the Akademiya up to now?
Guard: Don't ask me. It's not like I can tell you anything. This is a direct order from the Grand Sage. Just wait until tomorrow.
Merchant: I have a real emergency. My goods have already arrived at Port Ormos. If I don't hurry, they'll be stolen...
Guard: That's your problem. Make sure you make a request in advance next time.
Merchant: B—But it's not like you can just predict business matters in advance... *sigh*
Paimon: It looks like the Akademiya already announced a lockdown for Sumeru City today. How completely unsurprising...
Paimon: Let's go and question them.
Paimon: Hello sir, why can't we leave the city today?
Guard: Here we go again... Don't ask me, I don't know either.
Guard: We just received an order that no one is allowed to enter or exit Sumeru today. They didn't tell us anything else.
Traveler: Of course the Akademiya wouldn't share their plans with a pawn.
Guard: Hmph, angering me won't get you anywhere. If I had that kind of insider info, I would have left this stupid post a long time ago.
Paimon: It looks like he really doesn't know.
Paimon: If we can't get anything out of him, let's take matters into our own hands. Why don't we climb over the walls? Those guards can't be everywhere at once.
Paimon: This is a good spot, and the guard hasn't noticed us at all. Let's hurry...
Traveler: Paimon, stay here.
Paimon: Huh!? Why? Are you going to leave Paimon behind?
Traveler: Leaving the city might trigger disruptions to our memories...
Paimon: B—But what if things get really weird out there and you get into some trouble? Th—Then Paimon won't be able to help you!
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon knows that Paimon can't do much, but we've always been together, haven't we?
Traveler: Don't worry, Paimon.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: ...Okay, Paimon will wait for you.
Paimon: Promise Paimon that you'll come back as soon as possible. Just a quick look!
Traveler: Okay, okay...
Paimon: And please be careful!
Traveler: If we leave together, it'll just be the same as before.
Traveler: We need someone to stay and witness events from this side.
Traveler: So the Akademiya doesn't trust you at all.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ah... Memories...!
Traveler: Let's go and try to leave the city today.
Paimon: Traveler! W—W—Waaaaaah!!!
Traveler: Wh—What's wrong, Paimon!?
Paimon: Paimon thought Paimon would never see you again! Y—You just disappeared!
Paimon: Paimon waited for you for hours and hours at the city wall, and you never came back! You promised Paimon that you were only taking a quick look! *sniff*
Traveler: Wh—What did I promise?
Nahida: #Paimon, calm down. {F#She's}{M#He's} here now. I don't think {F#she}{M#he} understood what you were saying.
Paimon: *sniff*... Paimon doesn't care. Paimon wanted to go look for you, but you also said that Paimon should stay... Paimon was so worried and so scared the entire day...
Traveler: Although I don't remember doing any of this...
Traveler: I won't leave you behind.
Paimon: *sniff* ...Okay, Paimon will forgive you. The most important thing is that you didn't actually disappear... Paimon was so scared that you had gone into another world!
Nahida: Okay, Paimon, can you tell us your perspective of what really happened yesterday...
Black Screen Text: Paimon describes your plan from yesterday...
Nahida: I see. Using two people's different perspectives...
Paimon: After that, you left the city. Paimon kept her eyes on you the whole time, but then you disappeared in an instant...
Traveler: You sure that's what you saw? You weren't zoning out or anything?
Paimon: No way! Paimon was watching you with the fullest attention.
Nahida: What's your perspective, Traveler? You sure you don't have any memory of this?
Traveler: Yes, I don't even know that "yesterday" existed.
Nahida: I guess that explains everything. You also lost your memories the last two times you tried to leave the city. Those days' memories can't be awoken.
Paimon: So if we leave the city, our memories will be completely erased?
Traveler: So they didn't just restrict access to Sumeru City...
Paimon: It really sounds like something big outside of the city is being hidden on purpose!
Paimon: But this way, we'll also never discover what's outside...
Traveler: If our memories will be erased...
Paimon: Something like a message? But how can we send it back?
Nahida: ...Don't look at me like that. I... I'm not used to being stared at.
Nahida: Well... Okay, okay. You want something that can pass on messages, right? Give me some time, and take care of Dunyarzad for me.
Paimon: Yep! Now we're talking!
Nahida: ...I'm done. Here you go.
Paimon: What? Isn't this just an Akasha Terminal?
Nahida: I made some little changes. Akasha Terminals are already capable of sending messages. I just tweaked it so that it can connect to any node.
Paimon: To make something like this... Nahida, you really know the Akasha like the back of your hand! Anyway, we can use this now to record a message, right?
Nahida: Yep. I will help you save the messages. It should be pretty easy to use. I just can't guarantee the user's status and signal coverage when they're outside the city...
Paimon: We'll never know until we try! At least we're taking the initiative now!
Traveler: It's worth a try.
Paimon: Let's go then. Let's expose those sages!
Traveler: I still think you should stay.
Paimon: Ahh... Alright. Paimon isn't as worried about being separated since it happened once yesterday, but... Paimon still isn't happy about it...
Traveler: See you tomorrow, Paimon.
Paimon: Okay! See you tomorrow, Traveler!
Traveler: Can we leave behind something other than memories?
Traveler: They're also erasing the memories of those who leave...
Traveler: Still... Sorry, Paimon.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Do you want some alone time to think? Alright then, Paimon won't disturb you.
Dunyarzad: ...The Dance of Sabzeruz is about to begin. I'm going to go watch it.
Traveler: The Dance of Sabzeruz... It's that time already...
Paimon: Okay, um... Why don't you go ahead, Dunyarzad? We still have some other stuff to do first.
Dunyarzad: Okay then. See you later.
Paimon: Have you figured it out yet, Traveler? Time is ticking away.
Traveler: I think I know the answer now.
Paimon: Awesome! What is it? Paimon wants to know! ...Wait, no, let's meet up with Nahida first. You can tell us both together. This time, we're gonna get to the truth!

## Talk 5

Nahida: You're back. I've been waiting forever for you two. Judging by the looks on your faces...
Nahida: Are you ready to take your Sabzeruz Exam and graduate from the festival?
Traveler: Ask away, Miss Nahida.
Nahida: Hehe, okay, first off... Have you discovered the hidden truth?

## Talk 6

Paimon: People in Sumeru think they don't dream, but the truth is, the Akasha steals their dreams without them knowing it.
Paimon: #And those spaces with no human presence are stolen dreams without their host? That would explain why they sounded so weird when {F#she}{M#he} was trying to describe them...
Paimon: Huh, so people in Sumeru do dream after all. In fact, we're all in one big dream together right now!
Nahida: Correct answer. Now, how did you conclude that the Akasha is capable of this?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ooh, okay. Those dream-controlling creatures in the forest also get their power from the Dendro Archon, right? That would explain why the Akasha has the ability to control people's dreams, too.
Paimon: But... is stealing everyone's dreams really how the Akasha compiles their wisdom? Isn't there anything more to it than that?
Nahida: Dreams are fantastical, complex, and full of imagination. People's brains are the most active when they're dreaming.
Nahida: In other words, dreams are rich bundles of human wisdom.
Paimon: So in other words, the complete opposite of how Haypasia understood it...
Paimon: Paimon remembers her saying that the sages think dreams are "foolish delusions," and the fact that no one dreams is a blessing from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... Hmph, so it was all a dirty trick!?
Paimon: The real story is that the sages from the Akademiya are using the Akasha to steal people's dreams for their own use, huh?
Traveler: Yes, and they don't intend to stop there.
Nahida: Oh? By the sounds of it, you understand the current situation pretty well. So then, what about this samsara?

## Talk 8

Nahida: Correct. The Akasha is keeping each person's brain in a constant dream state, but also separating their consciousness from their own dream.
Nahida: Their disembodied consciousness is placed inside the collective dream of the Sabzeruz Festival along with everyone else's, while their now-vacant dreams are harvested by the Akasha.
Nahida: No one is any the wiser as another day passes in the dream, and so begins another samsara cycle...
Nahida: People "wake up" to yet another dream about the Sabzeruz Festival, the dreams that belong to them are once again harvested by the Akasha... and so it continues.
Paimon: So... this is like a dream factory, and the Akasha is... a dream-harvesting machine. Did Paimon get that analogy right?
Nahida: Very good, Paimon. Using analogies well is an excellent habit to get into.
Paimon: Okay, so that beep we keep hearing is actually from our real-life Akasha Terminals... Taking off our terminals in this dream doesn't do anything...
Nahida: Alright, last question... Who am I?

## Talk 9

Nahida: Hehe. So you noticed.
Traveler: You are Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Nahida: Aww, I thought that one would be the hardest question. That's why I put it last.
Paimon: Pff, that wasn't hard at all. Even Paimon guessed that! Everything about you is different. We just didn't wanna expose you is all.
Paimon: Now that you mention it... Nahida, you've been hinting to us since the very beginning...
Paimon: It's funny thinking back to when we were asking all over the place for info about Lesser Lord Kusanali. Paimon didn't expect to meet you like this!
Traveler: I have a lot of questions for you.
Nahida: Yes, those can wait until we're back in real life.
Nahida: On the other hand, I'd be happy to answer any more questions you have about here and now.
Traveler: But this doesn't seem like a good time.

## Talk 10

Paimon: ...That covers everything that's happened so far.
Traveler: So that message...
Nahida: Yes. Although the signal was choppy and had some interference, we still managed to receive two messages from you when you were outside.
Paimon: Okay, now that you understand what's going on, let's hear the messages together!
Traveler: "...Can't go back... There are countless spaces here. Our Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru City is just one of them..."
Traveler: "...I've entered another space... Before me are flowing sandstone and howling fish... Impossible and surreal sights..."
Traveler: "...All these spaces are empty except for the occasional ones that contain mute puppets rather than people... I can't sense any human presence..."
Paimon: ...That's one heck of an info dump! It sounds like you left the Sumeru City space when you set foot outside of the walls.
Paimon: ...But everything looked completely normal when Paimon was looking out from the inside! That's unbelievable. And if we take your word for it, the other spaces all had very weird contents...
Nahida: There's one final part here... I only received it late last night.
Traveler: ...These spaces have been disappearing one after the other... Absorbed by something like a sun in the sky...
Traveler: *beep* ...And now, even the final space has also disappeared...
Traveler: ...Behind me, a lot of spaces just appeared again from thin air... I get it now! Those spaces are actually—
Traveler: *buzz*
Paimon: Ah... Ugh, why did the message end right there? What did the Traveler want to say? What are those spaces?
Nahida: Probably because "yesterday" just happened to end at that moment.
Paimon: Oh, right, Paimon did hear a beep from the Akasha. Did it come from here or from the message?
Nahida: The message. It should've come from the Traveler's Akasha Terminal.
Paimon: After the beep, Traveler said, "Even the final space has also disappeared..."
Nahida: Traveler, what do you think that "final space" could have been?
Traveler: Was what I left for myself when I left the city?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Ohh, so that's what it is! After the sound of the beep, the final space — the Sabzeruz Festival — also disappears, and we're taken to the next day.
Paimon: Later on, Traveler also mentioned a bunch of new spaces materializing behind them... Do lots of new spaces appear every day?
Paimon: Paimon's head is spinning... Just what are these "spaces," anyhow?
Nahida: Well, consider this, for all the horrors of the Archon War, at its heart, it was just a game where a bunch of gods fought over seven seats.
Nahida: So no matter how strange or spooky things might look on the surface, maybe all they point to in the end is a small and simple secret.
Paimon: Wow, the Archon War, huh? That's an analogy and a half.
Traveler: A "secret," huh...
Traveler: Give me some time. I need to organize my thoughts.
Paimon: Hey, where are you going?
