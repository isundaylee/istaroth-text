# Talk Dialog

Amber: Ooh, where should I go next? This whole place is so lively...
Traveler: Amber, this gift envelope is for you.
Amber: Wow, a gift envelope! Thank you! I heard the people of Liyue exchange them during Lantern Rite as blessings.
Amber: It's beautiful! I'll take good care of it.
Traveler: Are you here for the festival, specifically?
Amber: Sure am! Jean said we worked really hard this year. She thinks we all deserve a break, so she set up a rotating calendar for us to take time off.
Amber: Eula and I got our turn the last couple of days, so we came to Liyue Harbor as soon as we heard about the festivities.
Traveler: No lack of hustle and bustle — or fun things to do — on the streets, huh?
Amber: Yep! We spent a lot of time roaming around the city. We just split up so we could go get souvenirs for everyone at the Knights of Favonius.
Amber: I bought a ton of stuff! A fan for Jean, a teacup for Lisa, a kite for Klee...
Amber: Oh and, this is for you! Grilled Tiger Fish — it's super delicious. Here, try some! I just bought it, so it's still warm!
Amber: Hurry, before it gets cold! I'm gonna keep shopping, okay?
Amber: Fan, teacup, kite... What am I missing? Oh, right! Jewelry...
Traveler: See you.
Amber: See ya! Come find me the next time you're in Mondstadt!
