Guillem: Ever since my neighbor to the east started taking care of that gentleman dog, it's either the man shouting, or the dog barking, every single night!
Guillem: Or both together.
Ethan: I see... Seems you've been through quite a bit.
Guillem: That's not even the important part. The point is that my neighbor to the west one day sued the dog, and the master wound up having to pay a large amount of Mora.
Ethan: Well, that sounds like problem solved, right?
Guillem: If only it were that simple! Later the dog's master fired right back, claiming that the dog's right to bark had to be upheld.
Guillem: Barking rights? Well, would you listen to that? Sounds like newsworthy material if I've ever heard it.
Ethan: Um, sir, actually, I'm in charge of writing on real estate...
Guillem: Real estate... Real estate... Ah, how about this topic, then?
Guillem: There's a large tree in our district that happens to be at the intersection between four houses.
Guillem: The four houses joined hands to sue this tree that blocked their sunlight in court. The judge ruled that they could cut... the sections of the tree that were within the bounds of their houses.
Guillem: I mean, I never — have you ever seen a case like this? Why, I wouldn't be surprised if the situation proves fatal — for the tree, anyway!
Ethan: Uh huh, I suppose.
