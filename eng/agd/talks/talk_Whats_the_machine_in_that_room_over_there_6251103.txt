Traveler: What's the machine in that room over there?
Ding Sr.: Ah, you're asking about the stirring machine, yes? Compared to our village's history, the machine is very young.
Ding Sr.: We used to use a huge tea cauldron for stirring. They said it was an adeptal mechanism of some sort...
Ding Sr.: The traditional process creates a traditional flavor, but we must also meet the quantity demands, so these days our workshop uses new, faster machines.
Ding Sr.: That said, with higher efficiency and more heat, the need to ensure quality is even greater.
Ding Sr.: That's why people like me, with more than thirty years of experience, are needed to make sure things don't go wrong.
Ding Sr.: As for Ding Jr... He's got another decade of buckling down and learning this craft ahead, that's for sure...
