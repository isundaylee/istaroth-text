Traveler: Why are you here?
Orban: For a weapon. One that is destined to be remembered by all who hear its name.
Orban: You can make as many mundane weapons as you like, and they would all be meaningless. That's the life of a blacksmith, not that of a weaponsmith.
Orban: A true forgemaster needs only to build one famous weapon.
Orban: I will use my life's worth of skill and sweat to forge that weapon. Once it is complete, all Teyvat will remember it — and me.
Orban: It is for that reason that I am here on this mountain — for it contains the materials that I have been searching for all this time.
