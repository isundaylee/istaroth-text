Lenne: Inazuman poetry puts some limits on the number of words that may be in any given line. As such, they pay much attention to the length of each word, while the poems that emerge have both a neat look and a unique flavor to them.
Ootomo: Other than the lengths of words and phrases, Inazuman poets also love natural sights such as snow, the moon, and flowers.
Ootomo: Few of them write about freedom or the wind, though.
Ootomo: I plan to ponder the matter of expanding the content of our writing. Who knows? I might actually start a new wave in Inazuman poetry like this.
Lenne: Is that so? Ah, how I wish I could see that new work of yours right this instant!
