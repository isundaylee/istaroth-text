Traveler: How's the paint-making going?
Sluasi: They're still in the final adjustment phase. We should be done pretty soon!
Sluasi: It is taking longer than I thought it would, though... But just like with gems, I have to create the perfect paints.
Sluasi: If it isn't perfect work, it isn't worth doing. *sigh* If only Puca would understand that sooner...
