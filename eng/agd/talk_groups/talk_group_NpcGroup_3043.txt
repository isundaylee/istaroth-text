Nishiguchi: Listen to me. How could such a thing happen...
Nishiguchi: I was robbed of all I had!
Nishiguchi: Ugh, curse those thieves!
Nishiguchi: Ah, now I feel like I'm cursing at myself... Eh, wait. This doesn't have anything to do with me, does it? Haha...
Nishiguchi: Anyway, in the name of Electro Archon and heaven, I know I was wrong! But these were the wealth that I stole— No, took... Uh, earned from all over!

Traveler: Steal?
Nishiguchi: Huh? Did I say that word? Hahah...
Nishiguchi: Uh, what are you doing? Wait, please! Put your sword away. I—I will tell you everything I know!
Nishiguchi: I'll be honest. I was indeed a thief once. But just when I was about to quit my job, all of my savings were stolen!
Nishiguchi: This is probably what I deserve... But if someone could help me retrieve my money, I'll be a good person and atone for the rest of my life.
Nishiguchi: Ah, should I ask Bantan Sango Detective Agency for help?

Traveler: A thief visiting a detective agency...?
Nishiguchi: Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe they'll help me.
Nishiguchi: Anyway, the people from Bantan Sango Detective Agency are far more competent than those useless pieces of garbage at the Police Station. You can ask them for help if you need anything.
Nishiguchi: I've heard that the president of the agency is very talented. She might be able to help me retrieve my wealth, haha...
Nishiguchi: But I don't think I have the money to pay for the commission. Ugh...
