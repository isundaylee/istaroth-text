Traveler: About "The Fourth"...
Goncourt: Haha. You've heard the moniker? Did Lanoire tell you? She's the only person here who calls me that.
Goncourt: That was my stage name when I fought in the Pankration Ring. Goncourt the Fourth. But everyone complained it was too long so they just called me Goncourt.
Goncourt: But Lanoire just calls me "The Fourth," even when I'm not in the arena.
Goncourt: Perhaps I'm some kind of storybook character to her? That actually suits me just fine.
