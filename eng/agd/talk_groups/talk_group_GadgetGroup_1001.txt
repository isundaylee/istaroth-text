Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Tell me about yourself...
Tubby: When breaking new ground, laying foundations, and furnishing a home, it is best to select an auspicious day for the work at hand.
Tubby: I'll teach you more about this another day. There are many methods by which one might tell if a certain day bodes well or ill.

Investigate (Tubby): Well! It seems that we have a visitor... Oh?
Paimon: Ah, it's Tubby! From a distance, Paimon thought it was just a huge finch!
Paimon: So you're the "little helper" Madame Ping mentioned?
Investigate (Tubby): Madame Ping... Oh, you must mean Ping! Yes, she did summon me here. She told me much about you.
Investigate (Tubby): You know, back when we met in the Mondstadt tavern, I had a feeling that we would meet again.
Investigate (Tubby): It seems I was right. But it's still a nice surprise to meet you here.
Investigate (Tubby): You may leave all matters regarding the upkeep of this realm to me.
Investigate (Tubby): Your journey may be far from over... but at least this way, you will not want for a comfortable place to sleep each night.
Traveler: So, what's a teapot spirit, exactly?
Investigate (Tubby): Though it is the adepti who create realms such as this, they generally do not have the time of day to attend to the banal matter of their maintenance.
Investigate (Tubby): Thus, we teapot spirits were created to help guard their realms and manage their affairs.
Investigate (Tubby): You may consider me a butler, if you will.
Investigate (Tubby): Now, allow me to explain this realm to you...
Investigate (Tubby): Have you any blueprints on you? Specifically, blueprints with beautiful rooms, chairs, and the like.
Investigate (Tubby): As long as you have a blueprint, you can refashion this realm however you please.
Paimon: Blueprints? Oh, that's right! Granny handed us some when she gave us the teapot, didn't she? Let's take them out and have a look!
Investigate (Tubby): Yes, these are the blueprints I'm talking about. Go on, open them up...
Investigate (Tubby): Just commit the image of the objects to memory and prepare the necessary materials...
Investigate (Tubby): Then, simply release the thought from your mind and the object in the blueprint shall appear within this teapot.
Paimon: Wow, is that all it takes? Then... we could build a whole city inside, couldn't we!
Investigate (Tubby): Hmm... I doubt it. A golden-eyed adeptus explained this to me at some point in the past.
Investigate (Tubby): He said that even though Sub-Space Creation is a product of adeptal power, even that has its limits.
Investigate (Tubby): This world is not a true one, after all. It provides merely a moment of brief respite from the mortal realm, not a means of escaping it entirely.
Paimon: A golden-eyed adeptus? Paimon wonders — who could that be...
Investigate (Tubby): I hardly remember myself. What's more, I have never seen that adeptus again since...
Traveler: How very strange...
Investigate (Tubby): Well, let's not dwell on that. Have a look around — best you get accustomed to this realm.
Investigate (Tubby): If there's anything you would like to ask, just look for me.

Tubby: Ah, you arrived quickly. Good, good.
Traveler: What's up?
Tubby: I asked you to come here so I could give you a little gift.
Tubby: I do not know if I told you before, but these abodes are private spaces created by the adepti for themselves.
Tubby: Most adepti will use certain methods to seal their abode away from the rest of the world to ensure its purity and avoid being disturbed.
Tubby: Afterward, adepti would create a "Realm Dispatch" for those they wished to invite into their abode.
Tubby: This Realm Dispatch bears signatures of the abode's adeptal energy and that of the adeptus themselves. As such, anyone who has this dispatch can enter or exit the abode freely.
Tubby: Before, this abode was in an incomplete, embryonic state. Those whom you invited into it would only have been able to exit and enter together with you, rather than remain for long periods.
Tubby: But now... Well, take this Realm Dispatch that I have created for you and hold it in your hand — tightly, now.
Traveler: What should I do next?
Tubby: Don't worry. You need only hold this dispatch, and it will draw some of your energy out and into it.
Tubby: Ah yes. I heard Ping mention that you have made friends in a great many places. As such, I suspect that were we to distribute one dispatch to each one of them, we would be here making dispatches for a long time.
Tubby: As such, I have made some modifications to this dispatch. All you need to do is tap the palm of the person you'd like to invite lightly with the dispatch, and your energy signature will remain on them, allowing them to enter and leave your realm with ease.
Traveler: Huh, it's almost like "marking," isn't it...
Tubby: Huh? Well, sort of? But why did you have to put it so weirdly...
Tubby: Ahem, well, here is the Realm Dispatch. Go forth and invite whoever you wish.
Tubby: It seems that this place shall become lively quite soon...
Traveler: I thought it needed some of my energies...
Traveler: You're not going to ask me for help with something again, are you...
Tubby: Hmm? No, of course not. Why was that your first reaction...?
