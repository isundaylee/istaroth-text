Traveler: Fond of planting flowers?
Raef: Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
Raef: She wasn't well previously and is still resting at home even now, so she rarely goes out. But she really does love flowers â€” she looks much better whenever she is around them.
Raef: I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
Raef: Many times, those flowers that do get sent over to me don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
Raef: That's why I ask my colleagues to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.
