Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.

## Talk

Traveler: Katheryne, it's you again!
Katheryne: Hello, it is indeed me, Katheryne, the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. My job is to provide the adventurers with quests and intelligence support.
Katheryne: Since it looks like you're already familiar with the Adventurers' Guild's modus operandi, I'll leave it at that.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Katheryne: Farewell, Adventurer, and thank you for supporting the Adventurers' Guild.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you been following me this whole time?
Katheryne: Hehe, if all expenses are covered, I won't refuse.
Katheryne: But unfortunately, being a receptionist is a year-round job, so I don't get vacation opportunities like that.

Traveler: How are you feeling now, Katheryne?
Katheryne: How am I feeling? ...Was I unwell?
Katheryne: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I can't quite remember what happened before... But since I'm here, I suppose it was no trouble in the end.
Traveler: (So Katheryne doesn't remember... Has the previous puppet been replaced?)
