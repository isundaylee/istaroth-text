# Alright, Iaune, Alright


## Talk 1

Iaune: *sigh* I don't know why this happened...
Traveler: Iaune?
Iaune: Oh, Traveler, nice to meet you. Are you here for some coffee? I'll treat you to a cup.
Paimon: What's wrong? You look terrible. Has someone been forcing you to stay up late again?
Iaune: Thanks for your concern. However, this is my own issue this time.
Iaune: I've been thinking... About the meaning of my work.
Iaune: I've always believed the Maison Gestion to be a just, efficient, strong organization in which everyone is willing to help each other.
Iaune: I believe that under its management, the Court of Fontaine would see itself develop positively.
Iaune: But the way I see it now, it is a ruined mechanical house. Its gears, levers, and apertures are being pulled chaotically... Only its facade remains pristine.
Iaune: It only operates because of a series of coincidences and lessons, not precise consideration or design.
Iaune: I... I want to do something about it, but I can't. I fear that one mistake on my part will send this house tumbling down.
Iaune: Roialte always tells me to relax a bit, since my mistakes cannot make things worse than they already are...
Paimon: Th—That's an odd way of comforting someone...
Iaune: *sigh* Sorry, I shouldn't complain. I came out here to get away from all that for a while, after all...
Traveler: I'll make you a cup of coffee.
Iaune: Really? You know how to brew coffee? That's amazing — I've always wanted to learn, but I can never find the time.
Iaune: I'll leave it to you, then. I'll wait here... and with any luck, work won't catch up with me at the café.
Traveler: Are you on leave today?

## Talk 2

Arouet: Traveler, have you come to help us out? You're most welcome!
Paimon: No, no, we're just here to help a friend make some coffee. He's just... Well...
Traveler: He's feeling a bit down.
Arouet: By "a friend," do you mean Iaune — you know, the fellow sitting over there?
Traveler: You know him?
Arouet: Roialte and I are old friends. He mentioned that a bright, hardworking fellow came to their office recently, and that's Iaune.
Arouet: Don't you worry too much about him — young people who've just started at the Maison Gestion will always find themselves a little dejected at first.
Arouet: They'll be fine once they find a place for themselves there.
Paimon: You sound very experienced. Why's that?
Arouet: Well, I was once a radish planted in the field that is the Maison Gestion, too.
Arouet: But I wasn't satisfied with being a mere radish, and so I left my lot and... opened this café some time later.
Traveler: Sounds like a lot happened...
Arouet: Hahaha, perhaps! But nowadays, I'm just a café owner.
Arouet: Alright, weren't you going to make Iaune a cup of coffee? I'll go adjust the device — come find me once you're ready.
Traveler: Sounds like a real trove of stories to be told...
Traveler: He's feeling the pressure.

## Talk 3

Paimon: What should we put into the coffee this time?

## Talk 4

Iaune: Traveler... You really made me that cup of coffee? Um, I... Sorry for troubling you...
Traveler: Don't worry about it.
Iaune: This coffee... It's way better than the stuff provided at the Maison Gestion! In fact, it's in a whole different dimension...
Iaune: If this was the coffee I drank every day, I wouldn't spend so much time teetering on the brink of sleep.
Iaune: Thanks for the coffee. I'll head back to work once I finish it.
Traveler: Do your best.
Iaune: I will. I need to grow into my work as soon as possible and stand on my own two feet like Roialte does.
Iaune: *sigh* I just wonder how many nightmares I'll have to endure before then...
Traveler: Keep your chin up.
Traveler: Just drink up.
