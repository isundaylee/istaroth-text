Traveler: So, tell me about ikebana...
Sakuya: Ikebana is very important to Inazuma.
Sakuya: In simple terms, you can consider ikebana the act of carefully cutting and processing flowers and other plants before arranging them in a suitable fashion...
Sakuya: In specific, however, you need to take care to grasp the current state of the plants and trim the less presentable parts of them away...
Sakuya: Moreover, your arrangement and placement must be suited to their environment, even down to the angle at which the flowers extend outward...
Sakuya: These details must be given fastidious consideration, and can be a cumbersome process indeed.
Sakuya: Even for someone who loves ikebana like me, it is a most tiring job...
