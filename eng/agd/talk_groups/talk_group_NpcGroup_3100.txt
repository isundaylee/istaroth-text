Traveler: You're pretty relaxed, eh...
Hirano: Ah, well... Ahem, you are right. As the guard of the Kamisato Mansion, I shouldn't really let my guard down.
Hirano: I have a friend who is also a guard at the Tenryou Commission. He told me that he was very worried about those people affected by the Vision Hunt Decree seeking revenge.
Hirano: Now that I think of it, the peaceful Kamisato Clan is far safer than the other two Commissions, who've made a lot of enemies.
Hirano: This might also be because Mr. Thoma is too reliable. I have always felt safe here. Hahaha...

Traveler: About Thoma...
Hirano: When Mr. Thoma first came to the Kamisato Clan, people suspected him on account of his being an outlander.
Hirano: But from my observations, Mr. Thoma is steady and friendly — and he is a truly reliable fellow.
Hirano: I mean, why else would he be the trusted assistant of the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato, right? Haha!
