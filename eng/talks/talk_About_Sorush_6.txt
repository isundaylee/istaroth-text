Traveler: About Sorush...
Jarjar: Since Lady Sorush mentioned it, remember to come try out the new Lightcall Resonance challenge when you get the chance...
Jarjar: So, I need to plan future challenges just perfectly to achieve the desired effect.
Jarjar: I can't let Lady Sorush feel too bored, but I also can't make them too troublesome either!
