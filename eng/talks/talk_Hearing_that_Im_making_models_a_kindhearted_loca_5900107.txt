Ma'asudi: Hearing that I'm making models, a kindhearted local told me there's a place nearby where I can find Crystal Ores. They also said there are some blue ores that look special.
Ma'asudi: Unfortunately, despite that the ores there are of good quality, they are not suitable for my current research.
Ma'asudi: You need ores? Head in this direction and you'll find them.
