# Tatara Tales: Final Preparations


## Talk 1

Xavier: Ha, magnificent! The tests went very smoothly indeed. The onikabuto have been completely purified!
Traveler: Well then, let's...
Xavier: All we need to do now is to plan our route inside, and we can begin in earnest. However, we must avoid those Fatui... it seems that we'll have to take the long way.
Xavier: This thing is rather bulky, so it would be best for us to ensure that there are smooth paths for us to take as we move it inside.
Xavier: As such, I'd like you to re-enter the Mikage Furnace to investigate. If you encounter any broken paths, please help to restore them a little.
Xavier: I have yet to decide our route, but having more roads open to us could not hurt, surely.
Traveler: I'm no expert in fixing roads, you know.
Xavier: You don't have to restore them to... well, perfect reliability. Just place a layer of wooden planks down so that we can move this device across.
Xavier: Ah, you can just grab the wooden planks from nearby. I'll remain here and try to make our machine as reliable as it can possibly be.

## Talk 2

Xavier: Let's hope that everything goes smoothly. The sooner we settle this affair, the better. Who knows what we will happen if we delay further...

## Talk 3

Xavier: Alright, then. Have you checked our roads?
Traveler: They're as smooth as can be now.
Xavier: Alright. Thâ€”Then let us set off after a brief wait...
Traveler: Hey. Are you...
Xavier: I... I'm thinking! I'm thinking of all the things that could possibly happen, you understand?
Xavier: For example, what we'll do if those masked lunatics have already extracted the core when we enter.
Xavier: They might shove it into some Ruin Guard, causing it to go berserk and send us all flying.
Xavier: Or maybe, some sort of elemental creature might emerge as we are purifying the Mikage Furnace, and might devour the core in a single bite.
Xavier: And in the worst case scenario, that legendary serpent might use this opportunity to resurrect itself. Then we'd be doomed! It'd be game over! Game over!
Traveler: Get a hold of yourself, Xavier...
Xavier: Ah! Um, sorry, I... My old habits are acting up again. I always envisage the worst case scenarios...
Xavier: I'll make some plans, and once the time comes, let us go and put an end to this.
Xavier: Please go well, please go well, please go well...
Traveler: It won't be that dramatic.

## Talk 4

Xavier: These Onikabuto should do. Thank you! I shall begin tests immediately.
