Saimon Jirou: Ahh... Iâ€”It's you... I'm really sorry about the treasure, and for having caused you so much trouble. Anyway, I'm very thankful for your help!
Saimon Jirou: Will you continue to travel? To be honest, I never want to leave my house again after what happened...

Traveler: How are you doing lately?
Saimon Jirou: Not too bad, all thanks to you.
Saimon Jirou: The Tenryou Commission has been here asking about my whereabouts as well. Good thing dad covered for me.
Saimon Jirou: He somehow went and got a certificate saying I was unfit for service. Of course, the name on it says "Saimon Katsumi"!
Saimon Jirou: Though it was quite expensive, at least I don't have to worry about being treated as a deserter...

## Talk

Traveler: What are your plans for the future?
Saimon Jirou: The future? Hah, do I look like someone who has a future to speak of?
Saimon Jirou: ...Hey, hey, I'm just kidding. After that near-death experience, I've become extremely optimistic about the future.
Saimon Jirou: I'm done with the adventuring though. My focus should be my family for now...
Saimon Jirou: It just so happens that many of the village fields have gone barren. I'll spend my time farming and living life like the rest of the people here.

## Talk

Traveler: You've become more down-to-earth, I see.
Saimon Jirou: Heh, I suppose so.
Saimon Jirou: My parents are getting old as well, so I can't just sit around and do nothing.
Saimon Jirou: And Konda Village is a place with history. I've also learned my lesson from last time...
Saimon Jirou: This time, I plan to stay home and wait for fortune to come to me! Maybe one day I'll dig up some old artifact and I'll be rich!
Saimon Jirou: Ahem... I mean... I'll have enough money to provide for my parents...

## Talk

Traveler: Come on, where's your ambition?
Saimon Jirou: Shh! You'll get me yelled at by my father...
Saimon Jirou: I start trembling whenever I think of what happened before... I don't dare to have any ideas at this point...
Saimon Jirou: I'll just tend to the fields, and who knows? Maybe one day luck will come my way.

Traveler: See you.
Saimon Jirou: Yup! Good luck to you in your travels!
