Traveler: How about big-time smugglers?
Shajar: If you mean the local Eremites, I was one of 'em once. I know how they do things.
Shajar: As for those smugglers from Liyue and Fontaine...
Shajar: Hmph. I'd be tipped off well before they could move a muscle, and I'd know their movements like the back of my hand.
