## Talk

Fourmon: The lines here are a bit wooden too. Maybe the writing should better reflect the characters' inner psychology and mentality, the audience should be able to understand this part of the plot...
Meilhat: Ah, please refrain, Fourmon. Are you going to obfuscate the dialogue to the point the audience is left guessing again?
Meilhat: Do you recall the last performance? Nobody understood any of it! All they could say was "Didn't understand much but seemed very avant-garde!" And we were trying to write a situational comedy...
Fourmon: B—But of course it won't be like the last time...
Meilhat: Don't be unreasonable, Fourmon. You need to consider the audience's perspective when you try to decide how to communicate the meaning of the play.
Fourmon: You're right. Okay, okay, I'll do another edit.
Meilhat: You'll need to be quick. We have a rehearsal this evening.
Fourmon: ...As you wish, Miss Meilhat.

Meilhat: #I recall Traveler's advice that if we want the audience to give us clear feedback, we need to express ourselves fully first...
Fourmon: That rehearsal went well, didn't it? But... *sigh* You're right. Okay, okay, I'll do another edit.
Meilhat: Be quick about it. We have a rehearsal this evening.
