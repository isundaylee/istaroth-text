# Natlan Shrine of Depths Key

A key that can break the seal on the ancient Shrines of Depths scattered around Natlan.
These Shrines of Depths sealed themselves off when the civilization that built them was lost. Keys lost deep within domains are able to break the seals. Or perhaps that, for a moment, these keys help the seals to forget all that they have lost.
