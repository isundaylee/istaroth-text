# Their Childhood: Good Times


## Talk 1

Verut: It's my turn to catch people, huh? I'll get you for sure, Lovi!
Lovi: I wouldn't be so sure! There's some places even you can't climb up to.
Verut: Well, um, that's because my shoes aren't suited to climbing. If I change shoes, I can definitely get you!
Lovi: Then let's both take our shoes off. That'll make things fair!
Aurele: Stop! You're both not allowed to run around barefoot. There's all sorts of abandoned bits and bobs everywhere. What if you get cut?
Lovi: Okay...
Verut: Fine...
Verut: Um, brother, when you were trying to catch me earlier, you were kinda distracted, weren't you? I ran past you earlier, and you didn't respond at all.
Aurele: Huh? Did that happen? I didn't notice...
Lovi: Exactly! I ran an entire round earlier, and you didn't seem to see me at all!
Aurele: But... Huh? It's you! Why are you here?
Traveler: Why's Lovi here?
Lovi: Dad said that he needed to go out to work. Mom has to work as well.
Lovi: Aurele happened to come to return a book, so Dad asked him to take care of me, so I came over to play with them.
Aurele: Never mind that, let's continue playing. Who's going to do the catching this time?
Traveler: I thought you didn't like hide-and-seek.
Aurele: Well, um, *cough* I've been trying to write a review recently, and I've had some questions that need consideration.
Aurele: I've found that, well, my mind is more agile when I am exercising, so...
Lovi: But he zones out easily and sometimes just stands there talking to himself. He won't react no matter what you say to him.
Verut: Why don't you join us? You're way better than my brother is at hide-and-seek.
Traveler: No problem.
Verut: Hehe, go ahead and do your best. Lovi and I are masters of hide-and-seek.
Verut: Then let's begin. C'mon, Lovi! We've got hiding spots to find!
Black Screen Text: Lovi and Verut run like the wind, while Aurele leaves slowly, pondering as he does...
Traveler: I'm not gonna go easy on any of you.
Traveler: Why the sudden enthusiasm for hide-and-seek?
Traveler: Still hide-and-seek, then?
Aurele: Yes. Mr. Delerue happens to need to go on a business trip, and Aunt Dumay also needs to work, so they asked that I take care of Lovi.
Aurele: So I brought her here to play with us... I hope her dress won't get too dirty...

## Talk 2

Verut: So you found me anyway, huh? Guess you really are better at this.
Verut: I'll head back to the meeting point. I hope my brother does better...
Traveler: Why do you hope so?
Verut: Well, he did say it himself, didn't he? His brain works better after we play hide-and-seek.
Verut: But he has too many thoughts, and he needs to squat on the ground, trying to recall and memorize them for a long time.
Verut: Lovi told me that those ideas of his are very precious things, and so we shouldn't disturb him.
Verut: That's why when we're playing hide-and-seek with him, if we're about to catch him, we purposely take our time until he finishes collecting his thoughts.
Verut: It's just that if it's my brother's turn to catch people, we'll have to wait for him for a long while...

## Talk 3

Aurele: No... This logical sequence doesn't line up. I need to come at this from a different angle...
Aurele: How about... No, no...
Aurele: Huh? Oh. You found me. I'll head back to the meeting point, then.
Aurele: Is this point of view correct? No, it... Actually, is it right or wrong...

## Talk 4

Lovi: I wonder if Aurele will be able to put his thoughts together...
Lovi: Uh, what? You actually found this place? Seriously, how many times have you played hide-and-seek?
Lovi: Well, I'll head back to the meeting point. I'll hide myself better next time!

## Talk 5

Aurele: No, no... The argument is insufficiently rigorous here...
Lovi: Oh well, looks like Aurele's in his own world again. Anyway, thanks for playing with us again!
Traveler: Will he... be okay?
Lovi: As long as he doesn't start drinking coffee like water, as my dad did, he should be fine.
Verut: Leave that one to me! I won't let my brother drink too much coffee... If it really comes down to it, I'll hide all of his coffee from him.
Lovi: *sigh* I was planning to hide my dad's coffee here... But I guess that's a bust.
Verut: It sure is tough being a reviewer...
Traveler: Won't he... be exhausted?
