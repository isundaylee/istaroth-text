# Vera's Melancholy (III)

The Andromeda Empire stretches across half the galaxy group. Every planet within the Empire has its own demons and deities, dragons and monsters.
"I've come up with a story for every star from your home." "That's not possible. Looking from here, the Andromeda Galaxy is only one fifth the size of your moon."
So continues Vera's adventure.
