Huffman: There's still so much cleaning up to do...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Huffman: As I'm sure you're aware, we faced continuous attacks from bands of monsters for the entire duration of the Stormterror incident.
Huffman: Although the Stormterror incident is now resolved, and we've successfully fended off the monsters...
Huffman: The monsters erected quite a substantial number of barricades outside the city over the course of their raids.
Huffman: So while the monsters themselves have been fought back... these barricades aren't about to disappear of their own accord.
Huffman: We can't just leave them here indefinitely, especially now that things are returning to business as usual in the city.
Huffman: Unfortunately, the Knights are short-staffed and there's simply no one to take on the task. As our Honorary Knight, would you be willing to clear up the barricades?

## Talk

Traveler: It is my honor to serve.
Huffman: Spoken like a true member of the Knights of Favonius! Honorary Knight, you have my gratitude.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, I have something else on...
Huffman: Well, I don't doubt that you must have far more important matters to attend to. In which case, never mind, I shall have to think of something else.

## Talk

Huffman: Good day, Knights of Favonius at your service.

## Talk

Huffman: We are currently experiencing abnormal weather patterns. It is dangerous outside. Citizens are advised to seek shelter.

## Talk

Huffman: That dragon could return at any time. The Knights of Favonius will keep watch; everyone else is urged to find shelter immediately.

## Talk

Huffman: This is an emergency. Please be assured that the Knights of Favonius' first priority is to guarantee the safety of everyone in the city.

## Talk

Huffman: Oh, it's you. I salute you, Honorary Knight.
Huffman: How may I be of service to you?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Knights of Favonius.
Huffman: ...So you'd like to know how we're doing lately?
Huffman: Your concern is much appreciated. Thanks to you both, we've managed to solve many difficult problems.
Huffman: I'm just glad that we've never let down the trust of the citizens of Mondstadt.
Huffman: Me and my outstanding colleagues will continue protecting our beloved people, as usual.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Mondstadt.
Huffman: It's a city adored by its archon and its people, which is the reason for the Knights of Favonius' existence.
Huffman: Well, that's all. Our belief is short and simple, but strong. Isn't it?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Huffman: Goodbye. Enjoy the wind of Mondstadt.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Huffman: Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!
Huffman: This is not rhetoric from the Knights of Favonius Handbook, but something I truly wanted to say myself.
Huffman: Even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, our Acting Grand Master will surely bring us through this crisis.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Huffman: Though the end of this crisis is a good thing, it's come with its fair share of troubles, too.
Huffman: Between tallying up the human cost, repairing damaged property, and strengthening our defenses in case anyone tries to make trouble, we've got a busy time ahead of us.
Huffman: During this time, we must all do our best to share the Acting Grand Master's burden.

## Talk

Huffman: Tell me about the Knights of Favonius.
Huffman: Since I don't want to take up your time touring Mondstadt, I'll make it short.
Huffman: The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of this city.
Huffman: ...So you'd like to know how we're doing lately?
Huffman: Thank you for your concern. Me and my outstanding colleagues are protecting our beloved people, as usual.
