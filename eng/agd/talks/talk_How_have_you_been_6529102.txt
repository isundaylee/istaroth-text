Traveler: How have you been?
Nadia: Well... there's been good and bad.
Nadia: Urville found a job at Lumidouce Harbor. It's tough work, but he says that's a good thing. He's been eating more lately, so he should be stronger than before.
Nadia: If he gets stronger, he should be able to join the Fleet without any issues. That's always been a dream of his, and I hope it comes true for him.
