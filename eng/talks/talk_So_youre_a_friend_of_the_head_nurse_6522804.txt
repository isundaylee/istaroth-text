Traveler: So you're a friend of the head nurse?
Ottnit: Yeah. And her infirmary is quite spacious, it's perfect for us to get together and chat over milkshakes.
Ottnit: Sigewinne's vision is much closer to humans than most Melusines. We all like to hear her describe the surroundings, and then draw them.
Ottnit: ...But as we're still in the Fortress of Meropide we have to keep things low-key.
Ottnit: The terrain here is quite complex, but that's ideal for us smaller types to move about without anyone noticing.
