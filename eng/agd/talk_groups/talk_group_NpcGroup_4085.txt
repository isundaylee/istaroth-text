## Talk

Homayun: If the present rainforest could not fight off pollution, we could only try to change the surrounding environment...
Homayun: Gotta go to the House of Daena and request some previous research... Or go ask Rifaet.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Homayun: The Withering has always been one of the tough issues that Amurta wanted to conquer.
Homayun: It is true that while vision holders and forest rangers are working together to control the zones, the Withering won't impact Sumeru people's daily lives all too much.
Homayun: But beyond dealing with the symptoms, we researchers want to cure the cause.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is only responsible for documenting their findings, but he'd be able to discern any anomalies with his keen eyes...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Homayun: Okay, goodbye.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rifaet...
Homayun: Oh? He's a very knowledgeable young researcher. He's not very articulate, but he's familiar with all kinds of literature. Have you heard of him?

## Talk

Traveler: I've heard of him...
Homayun: How rare. He's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here.
Homayun: If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, even fewer young researchers would know about him.
Homayun: I prefer him though, compared to that Vikram fellow. Rifaet is more like a researcher in my opinion.
Homayun: But I don't know what those sages think. After all, they're the ones who have the final say.

## Talk

Traveler: Never heard of him...
Homayun: Well, he's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here. That Vikram always steals the limelight.
Homayun: If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, not many would have heard his name.
Homayun: I prefer him though, compared to that Vikram fellow. Rifaet is more like a researcher in my opinion.
Homayun: But I don't know what those sages think. After all, they're the ones who have the final say.

## Talk

Homayun: We cannot rest on our laurels even though the pollution of the rainforest has decreased...
Homayun: I must go to the House of Daena and request to requisition some previous research... Or go ask Rifaet.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Homayun: Rainforest life is among the foremost concerns of the Amurta.
Homayun: Although the taint caused by the Withering has been greatly alleviated, no one can say for sure that no new problems will arise.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is mainly responsible for documenting their findings, true. But I reckon he'd be able to discern any anomalies in those writings with his keen eyes...
