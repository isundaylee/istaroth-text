# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: The Wonders of Adeptal Amber


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hello— Mountain Shaper—!
"Kichiboushi": Hello— Mon-Mon—
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Argh, seems like the adeptus isn't at home...
Traveler: Let's not be impolite to the adepti, now.
"Kichiboushi": Paimon, what are adepti?
Paimon: Hmm... They're very special people... Or very special animals?
"Kichiboushi": Like Kichiboushi?
Paimon: Uh, not exactly! They have mystical powers...
"Kichiboushi": They can "kapow"? Then, Kichiboushi also adeptus.
Paimon: Um, adepti are much more ancient, and they have a certain... Prestige? Dignity?
"Kichiboushi": Oh. Then Kichiboushi, not adeptus. Ioroi is adeptus!
Paimon: Ugh, this is pretty hard to explain.
Traveler: The adepti are ancient powers who defend Liyue.
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi understands. Ioroi protects Chinju Forest, so not adeptus.
Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure that's not how it works, but if it clears up any misunderstandings...
Paimon: But since we've got this adeptus' abode in front of us, let's take a picture of Kichiboushi right here!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Kichiboushi, pose for picture!
Paimon: Good Kichiboushi!

## Talk 2

Paimon: That was a great shot!
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha! Kichiboushi, handsome!
Paimon: This kid's got zero humility...
"Kichiboushi": Ooh. Paimon, adepti use what magic?
Paimon: The adepti are super powerful. For example...
Traveler: Let's start with the amber around here.
"Kichiboushi": What is amber?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers this one. Mountain Shaper has flowers that can create amber to trap bad things that invade his land inside them.
"Kichiboushi": Mon-Mon, very powerful. Defends Liyue by trapping bad things.
"Kichiboushi": Long ago, the very, very bad Four Oni of Ogata came into the forest and bullied many bake-danuki. Ioroi transformed into an official, gave them bake-danuki food to eat.
"Kichiboushi": Later, Ioroi and Otogi King threw them into paper and sealed them.
Paimon: Huh, so there's that sort of story too. No wonder Ioroi panicked when he saw that picture of Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi is not adeptus, not defending Liyue. But Ioroi protects the forest. He protects tanuki.
Traveler: Different people have different things they need to defend.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Traveler: You'll figure it out once you're older, Kichiboushi.
Paimon: That's why you've gotta train hard and become a super strong bake-danuki!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Of course! The world-famous bake-danuki, Kichiboushi!
Paimon: Paimon's really curious to know what Ioroi used to look like before he was sealed. He was probably a ball of fun!
Paimon: Huh, Paimon's suddenly reminded of those Treasure Hoarders who were trapped in amber...
Traveler: They even took us for adepti messengers...
Paimon: That feels like it was so long ago now. But at the same time, it wasn't, right?
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Paimon: Ahem. Well, when we came to Liyue...
Paimon: #"The Rite of Descension only happens once a year! Ahaha, I, {NICKNAME}, am gonna have all that delicious food! Come on, Paimon, let's go!"
Traveler: "And all the offerings, too! Paimon's flying over there right now!"
"Kichiboushi": ??
Traveler: Best we stop misrepresenting events...
Paimon: Okay, okay...
Black Screen Text: You explain what happened in Liyue in simpler terms.\nYou stop at the point where you went to seek the adepti out in Minlin.
Paimon: #...As for what happened next, {NICKNAME} and Paimon went to that Liuli Pavilion place we were at earlier.
"Kichiboushi": Mon-Mon and Clow-Clow, very powerful! They built a moving house!
Paimon: Clow-Cl— Cloud Retainer really loves gourmet food as well! We had to make lots of delicious stuff before we could meet with her.
"Kichiboushi": Greedy, like Paimon.
Traveler: Like Paimon indeed.
Paimon: Hey!
"Kichiboushi": Is Paimon adeptus? Paimon is very powerful.
Paimon: Uhh, this is kinda complicated. That was praise, sure, but Paimon doesn't feel so good about it...
Paimon: But either way, Paimon isn't an adeptus!
"Kichiboushi": Want to play with adepti!
Paimon: The adepti don't generally appear before people. But we can have a look around. It's pretty nice here.
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi, go!
Traveler: She can fly, too.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Thank goodness we found you! Are you alright, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": *whimpers*
Paimon: Don't worry, it's okay. But don't run off by yourself next time, alright?
Traveler: You're like his big sister, Paimon.
Paimon: Paimon's older than Kichiboushi. Of course Paimon's the big sister!
Traveler: Though I could hardly tell...
Paimon: Hey!
"Kichiboushi": #Mm-mm! Thank you, {NICKNAME}. Thank you, Paimon.
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi, almost sealed! Very scary. But Paimon calling Kichiboushi, so not so scary.
Paimon: Ah, right, Ioroi did say that some smaller tanuki were also sealed...
"Kichiboushi": Inside amber, very scary. Dark, cannot see. Cannot talk. Cannot move. Cannot "kapow"! Like becoming stone.
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi is stone, but still very powerful. Can talk, can see. But cannot move.
Traveler: Would you like to help Ioroi, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Then, help other stone tanuki too!
Paimon: But we're here with you right now, Kichiboushi. We won't let you be sealed!
"Kichiboushi": Yey!
Paimon: But you mustn't be too naughty, either!
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Yes.
Paimon: That's a good boy! Shall we stop here for now? You must need some rest too, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Not tired!
Paimon: Ooh, isn't this a pickle. If Kichiboushi won't be good, then Paimon doesn't know where we should go next...
"Kichiboushi": Mm...
Black Screen Text: Kichiboushi begrudgingly admits to being tired...
Paimon: Phew! Kichiboushi really is like a child.
Traveler: And you're getting better at dealing with then, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: Really? Maybe that's because Paimon's been traveling with you for so long! Hehe.
Traveler: Oh, treating me like a kid now, are we?
Paimon: No, no! Haven't we been accompanying kids a lot? You know, like Dusky Ming and Changchang...
Paimon: Paimon's definitely learned a lot from traveling with you.
Paimon: And this time, the lesson is... Bake-danuki and adepti might not get along.
Paimon: We've got to give our next destination some thought...
Traveler: Hmm, come to think of it, we have had to take care of many children...
Paimon: Exactly! Like Dusky Ming and Changchang...
Traveler: Aye, we'll protect you.
Paimon: That's right! With us around, there's no way you'll be sealed, Kichiboushi!
Traveler: You're like his mom, Paimon.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Paimon's like his granny.
Paimon: #"Ooh, {NICKNAME}, you've got to eat more. You're still growing! How will you grow unless you eat more?"
