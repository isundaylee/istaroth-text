# The Chasm Charters

Lan: You're back. The Adventurers' Guild welcomes you.
Traveler: Tell me about The Chasm...
Lan: What, you want me to tell you what's in there? Who knows, seriously?
Lan: Some say that the some miners dug up what they call "Wish Granter," but that they got the opposite of what they wished for when they wished upon it. Others say that they dug up some old dragon-king's tail down there. All tales as tall as mountains, of course.
Lan: Really, there's no point asking me about The Chasm. I'm not actually sure what happened there either. Just go ask Muning â€” this was also one of the Ministry's requirements, by the way.
Traveler: Tell me more about the commission...
Lan: *cough* Well, you can see the people who depend on The Chasm for their livelihood everywhere you go out there. I'm sure you don't mind spending time interviewing them, but I've got Guild business to attend to.
Traveler: Tell me about Muning.
Lan: Oh, him? Heh. I suspect that the Ministry sent him out to The Chasm to get him to shape up a bit.
Lan: He's pretty good at what he does, alright, but he's one cocky kid as well. You can't have that kind of flighty character in the Ministry, you know? So yeah. The Chasm might help him grow up a bit.
Traveler: See you.
Lan: Yeah, sure. Oh, right... Ad astra abyssosque!
