Faruzan: You youngsters need to make sure you're getting enough exercise. You don't want to be huffing and puffing while your elders are still going strong! Why, this is a walk in the park compared to the field studies that Haravatat used to send us out on...
Faruzan: *sigh* Never mind. No point in dredging up the past... Go on then, I suppose you ought to rest if you really are tired.
Faruzan: I've seen too many junior scholars ruin their health for the sake of their academic pursuits. Tsk tsk... Let that be a cautionary tale. Those who fail to heed the advice of their elders do so at their own peril!

Faruzan: This is a nice little challenge, isn't it? Getting out into the world with your friends, exploring all its nooks and crannies... It's exactly the sort of thing you should be doing when you're young.
Faruzan: Back when I fell into those strange ruins, I didn't have a single other person to talk to. I had only myself to rely on... Now that was a true challenge, let me tell you.
Faruzan: *sigh* That said, I wouldn't recommend that experience to anyone...

Faruzan: I know that many of the younger generation see me as a sort of legendary figure. Why, my stories and my accomplishments can even be found in Kshahrewar textbooks.
Faruzan: But it does seem that people aren't quite used to having a legend living among them. No one takes my courses, or pays attention to my research... Even securing research funding can be a struggle...
Faruzan: If I was lucky enough to have one of my predecessors here in the flesh, I'd be waiting on her hand and foot! Serving her tea, massaging her shoulders, asking her all sorts of questions... *sigh* What happened to this generation? Where is their inquisitiveness, where is their respect?
