Traveler: "Ways and means"?
Hosseini: Huh, it seems that you're not aware.
Hosseini: Well, since we're partners here, I suppose I could tell you. But don't spread it around, alright?
Hosseini: Now, there's a certain fellow here in Ritou named Harrison. He's an outlander too, just like us, and he has his ways.
Hosseini: If you wish to go somewhere else "on the quiet," you can look for a way near Harrison's store.
Hosseini: That's all I can say. You'll have to find the way yourself.
Hosseini: And don't get caught by the Shogunate's people, alright? And if you do, don't mention me.
Hosseini: I don't have the Mora on me to pay any fines.
