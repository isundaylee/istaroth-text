Traveler: Aramuhukunda's story.
Arakarman: In the most ancient stories, Aramuhukunda had already left his mark.
Arakarman: Perhaps Aramuhukunda appeared first, then there were stories.
Arakarman: In Aramuhukunda's own story, his enemies were Big Iron Chunks that could block out the sun and cut off rivers. There was also Marana that could turn Vana into Valuka.
Arakarman: But Aramuhukunda and his partner Aradasha, together with the Golden Nara Varuna, defeated the monsters that Aranara could not defeat.
Arakarman: However, after that, Aramuhukunda was just a story, and not in Vanarana anymore.
Arakarman: Perhaps he went to a place far, far away with Nara Varuna.
Arakarman: Perhaps he is waiting for us in Sarva.
Arakarman: Perhaps he stepped alone on the path to facing the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: #But because his story still exists, Aramuhukunda is still in Vanarana. The rivers know him, the trees know him, and even Nara {NICKNAME} now knows him.
