# Good Medicine Tastes Bitter


## Talk 1

Chenxiang: Doudou, be a good girl, you'll only get better if you take your medicine...
Hongdou: No! I don't want to! I hate it, it tastes gross...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Chenxiang: Oh, hello Traveler. Doudou is quite a sickly child. This is the medicine she needs to take, according to the prescription Dr. Baizhu gave me.
Chenxiang: But she refuses to take it. She complains she doesn't like the taste... *sigh* Unfortunately, herbal medicine is bitter, that's just how it is...
Chenxiang: The only time she ever agrees to take it is if she gets to have a bowl of Almond Tofu afterwards.
Chenxiang: Traveler, if you have the time, could you go and pick me up a portion of Almond Tofu? I should stay here â€” I may still need to talk her into it...
Traveler: Okay.
Chenxiang: Thank you. Just one portion for Doudou is enough.
Traveler: What illness does she have?
Chenxiang: *sigh* I wish I knew. Whatever it is, Dr. Baizhu says it's nearly impossible to cure, and that just keeping the symptoms at bay takes a lot of medication.
Chenxiang: I fear she might need to take medicine her whole life. And starting at such a young age... It doesn't bear thinking about.
Chenxiang: I just wish I were the one with the illness... But the best I can hope for is that things don't get any worse for the poor child.
Chenxiang: Anyway. Please go and fetch me a portion of Almond Tofu, just the one will do.
Traveler: Hey kiddo. Not liking the medicine, huh?
Hongdou: It's sooooo bitter!!! Lulu's medicine is way less bitter than mine!
Chenxiang: Doudou... Lulu and her friends were just pretending. That wasn't real medicine they were drinking, it was some leftover sugary water from a bowl of Almond Tofu.
Hongdou: Oh... So Almond Tofu won't make me get better? Then... I guess I do have to take that icky medicine...
Chenxiang: That's right! Good girl. As soon as you're better you can eat whatever you like!
Hongdou: Why can't they make medicine taste sweet like Almond Tofu? So unfair...
Chenxiang: *sigh* There's no getting through to her... Anyway. Please go and fetch me a portion of Almond Tofu, just the one will do.

Hongdou: No! I don't want to...
Traveler: Hey, if you take your medicine, I've got some Almond Tofu for you...
Hongdou: Almond Tofu? But I still have to take the medicine first...
Chenxiang: Doudou, be a good girl, you'll only get better if you take your medicine... Aaaaand, there's Almond Tofu waiting for you...
Hongdou: Wah... But, Mr. Baizhu is so clever... why can't he make the medicine Almond Tofu flavor...
