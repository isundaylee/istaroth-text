Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: It's great that I don't have to worry about the flowers in my store being blown away by the wind.
Flora: That said, the Dandelion Seeds have also been blown all across the region of Mondstadt by this storm. Who knows, perhaps they will bloom throughout the land.
Flora: When I think about it like that, the storm doesn't seem so scary anymore, haha.
