Khaldun: Studying ancient history through linguistics and semiotics is tunnel-visioning. It's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions from it.
Khaldun: This is where you Haravatat would make mistakes. See Faruzan.
Yavanani: You Vahumana are no better.
Yavanani: Your sociological approach to history would be putting the cart before the horse.
Yavanani: It is meaningless to try to find some universal rules and norms that can explain all events throughout history.
Yavanani: As for Faruzan, her points are out of date. Can't even be used as a reference.
Khaldun: Hmph. I beg to differ.
