# Question and Answer


## Talk 1

Swan: Hey, Honorary Knight! Wait up a moment!
Traveler: Who, me?
Swan: Haha, who but you would be Mondstadt's famous Honorary Knight?
Swan: That said, you haven't gotten a copy of the Knights of Favonius Handbook yet, have you? It contains the vast majority of the principles that Knights should follow, as well as some knowledge for common use.
Swan: As an Honorary Knight, you should at least be familiar with some of this.
Swan: I requisitioned a copy from the Knights just for you. Please give it a read.
Swan: Once you're done, I'll quiz you a little. This will involve some content recorded in the handbook, as well as some common-sense questions.
Swan: Depending on how you answer, I'll also be giving you a small gift.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'm ready.
Swan: Alright, let's begin.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I need to swot up a little more...
Swan: Okay then... Make sure you read through it carefully.

## Talk 4

Swan: Now, please listen to my questions.
Swan: To the northwest of Mondstadt are some ruins. Legend holds that it was once a city where a tyrant ruled from his tower. It has since been occupied by Dvalin, who shelters himself there.
Swan: My question is this: What is the official name now given to these ruins by the Knights of Favonius?

## Talk 5

Traveler: Dvalin's Den

## Talk 6

Traveler: Stormy Terry's Tower

## Talk 7

Traveler: Stormterror's Lair

## Talk 8

Swan: Correct! The ruins are indeed called "Stormterror's Lair."

## Talk 9

Swan: ...I see you've chosen to go your own way on how to remember some of these things.
Swan: But the official name given to that place by the Knights is in fact "Stormterror's Lair."
