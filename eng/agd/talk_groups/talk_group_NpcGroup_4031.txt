Traveler: You're not from around here, are you?
Qishan: You have a sharp eye. I'm from Liyue, and currently working here part-time while I prepare for an exam.
Qishan: Ever since I was a kid, I've loved watching the ships come in and out of Liyue Harbor and seeing how they dock and load and unload their cargo...
Qishan: Over time, I grew fascinated with all sorts of ships. I'm hoping I can go to the Akademiya for further technical training.
Qishan: When I'm not working, I'll discuss questions I have about ships with the researchers and students I've met at work.
Qishan: At first, I felt bad about bothering them during their free time. I didn't realize how much the Akademiya students enjoyed talking with me!
Qishan: There's an old expression in Liyue that says it best: Where there's a will, there's a way. I'll definitely pass the Akademiya exam!

## Talk 3

Rafiq: If only we could find a way to increase the cabin capacity...
Qishan: Wouldn't that affect the ship's hull though?
Qishan: At least, simply changing the material wouldn't cut it.
Rafiq: But based on my calculations, if this cabin here could be opened up to the one next door...
Rafiq: But you said that wouldn't work, so maybe it really isn't possible...
Rafiq: Speaking of which, does everyone in Liyue know as much about ships as you do, Qishan?
Qishan: Ahem... Not necessarily.
Qishan: After all, we have people working in all sorts of industries in Liyue.
