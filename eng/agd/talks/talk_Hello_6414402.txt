# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello.
Vanita: Hello.
Vanita: ...
Vanita: Sorry, my colleagues and I are not good at small talk. It's easy to get distracted by talking after all.
Vanita: This is the Wikala Funduq. Many people come here to do business every day. Interest rates can incite disputes, so this place must be strictly guarded.
Vanita: Oh, right, I must also remind you that if you are new to the city, it's best not to trust those who wear the uniform of the Eremites.
Vanita: Especially those who peddle dangerous goods related to obtaining knowledge. They are driven by money and are not afraid to cross the lines considered unforgivable by the Akademiya.
