Traveler: Why don't you consider your "work" again?
Tairona: Ah, that's right! Once I enter Mualani's shop, I wouldn't be able to leave. That would mean I would also no longer be able to work. That's a perfectly valid point.
Tairona: ...But if we were to look at it that way, then in the interest of fairness, shouldn't I also pose the question to my other hobbies?
Tairona: I've got a lot of hobbies, you know. Surfing, kayaking, swimming, water polo...
Tairona: If I were to also count their votes, then the final vote would probably be very different.
Tairona: Hmm... Guess I'll do a more comprehensive count of the votes later. This will be a problem for future me...
