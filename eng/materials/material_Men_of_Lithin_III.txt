# Men of Lithin (III)

A fantasy novel doing the rounds among the tribes of Natlan that is said to be translated from a popular work by the reputedly famous Fontainian author K'n-yan. The Natlanese who have visited the Court of Fontaine, however, claim to have been unable to find the original â€” nor has anyone managed to find a local who's ever heard of an author named "K'n-yan".
