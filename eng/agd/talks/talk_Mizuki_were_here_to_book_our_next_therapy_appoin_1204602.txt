# Talk Dialog

Paimon: Mizuki, we're here to book our next therapy appointment...
Hyakujitsuhaku Shion: Ugh...
Shiba Murasaki: Agh... It hurts...
Paimon: Oh no... What's wrong with them?
Aikawa Susumu: They've been like this ever since they woke up...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...It's an extreme case of indigestion.
Paimon: Huh? How come? Did they eat too many nightmares last night?
Aikawa Susumu: I doubt it... We only had four customers yesterday, including you two.
Paimon: Paimon blames the other two...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You're right. Something's definitely wrong with their nightmares... Our ability to digest dreams isn't just a matter of quantity. It depends on the emotional intensity, too.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Point being, no normal person should ever have a nightmare of this magnitude...
Hyakujitsuhaku Shion: *retching*
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The situation is dire. If I can't find a way to help them digest the dreams soon...
Paimon: What can we do? Let us help!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We need to find those two customers from yesterday, and figure out the cause of their bad dreams. Without knowing that, I have no way of treating them.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler, Paimon, I know you spoke to them both. Think you can track them down?
Paimon: Let's see... Hmm, they did say they were gonna get counselling from Emura Ichigensai again. Chances are, that's where we'll find them!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Lead the way. I'm coming with you.
