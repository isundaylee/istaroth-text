Traveler: About Arapacati...
Araphala: I gave several Unrivaled Fresh Fruits to sister, she is less angry after eating them.
Araphala: Last time she was angry, was when we made all that smoke in Vanarana.
Araphala: Araphala will give her more Unrivaled Fresh Fruits, when that happens again...
Araphala: No, not again.
