# Good Medicine Is Hard to Come By


## Talk 1

Maruf: *sigh* This condition is tricky. I'd better get Dr. Zakariya's help.
Traveler: Is someone gravely ill?
Maruf: Eh? Ah, Traveler! Nobody's gravely ill. It's just that a patient's got a severe case of headache.
Maruf: I gave him some medicine, but it didn't really work that well.
Traveler: Have you tried prescribing other medicine?
Maruf: Ahem... That would've been far beyond me. You see, with my limited experience, I can only come up with this many prescriptions...
Maruf: They can treat mild conditions alright, but when it comes to serious ones, they're next to useless.
Maruf: Luckily, Dr. Zakariya at Bimarstan has offered to prescribe medicine and get the ingredients ready for me...
Maruf: Traveler, can I ask you a favor?
Maruf: I've got some patients to attend to, so could you visit Dr. Zakariya in my stead and ask him to prescribe something?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Maruf: I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: Does Zakariya ever come to the village?
Maruf: He occasionally has people send herbs and stuff over, but he's too busy to show up in person, really.
Maruf: Anyway, about that prescription — I'm counting on you, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Maruf: *sigh* This condition is tricky. I'd better get Dr. Zakariya's help.
Traveler: Is someone gravely ill?
Maruf: Eh? Ah, Traveler! Nobody's gravely ill. It's just that a patient's got a severe case of stomachache.
Maruf: I gave him some medicine, but it didn't really work that well.
Traveler: Have you tried prescribing other medicine?

## Talk 3

Maruf: *sigh* This condition is tricky. I'd better get Dr. Zakariya's help.
Traveler: Is someone gravely ill?
Maruf: Eh? Ah, Traveler! Nobody's gravely ill. It's just that a patient suddenly can't see well.
Maruf: I gave him some medicine, but it didn't really work that well.
Traveler: Have you tried prescribing other medicine?
Maruf: Ahem... That would've been far beyond me. You see, with my limited experience, I can only come up with this many prescriptions...

## Talk 4

Maruf: Anyway, about that prescription — I'm counting on you, Traveler.

## Talk 5

Zakariya: Why am I having more and more patients lately...
Traveler: About Maruf...
Zakariya: Maruf? Did he run into some little-understood illness again?
Black Screen Text: You describe the condition Maruf is treating...
Zakariya: *sigh* How many times have I told him? He's fully capable of handling something this simple on his own — without needing my help!
Zakariya: I bet the patients are exaggerating their discomfort again, thinking that a mere village doctor is unable to treat their "serious illness."
Zakariya: That's why Maruf wants my prescription to reassure them.
Zakariya: Looking after the villagers for so many years has definitely not been an easy task for Maruf... I'll write up a prescription right away. Please take note, Traveler.
Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient with...
Traveler: A stomachache.
Zakariya: Ah, I see. To treat stomachaches, the prescription that I gave him last time will do.
Zakariya: Brew up a herbal soup out of the raw ingredients listed in the prescription and add three *Henna Berries*.
Zakariya: After that, keep boiling the soup on a *low flame* until *the ingredients become soft and mushy*.
Zakariya: Um... Just in case you forget, I'll write it down.
Black Screen Text: Zakariya writes down the prescription...
Zakariya: Please deliver the prescription to Maruf.
Zakariya: To be honest, I wouldn't say what I prescribed is "medicine." Instead, it's more of a... How should I put it...
Zakariya: Well, it's more of a mild, nutritious supplement.
Zakariya: One can be as creative as they want with the prescription. The worst thing they might end up with is a useless soup, that's all.
Zakariya: *sigh* Actually, all Maruf had to do was to adjust his original prescription very slightly. Why couldn't he put more trust in himself?

Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient...
Traveler: Who can't see well.
Zakariya: Ah, I see. To treat someone with impaired vision, the prescription that I gave him last time would do.
Zakariya: Brew up a herbal soup out of raw ingredients listed in my prescription and add a *Starshroom*.
Zakariya: After that, keep boiling the soup on a high flame. In fact, I'd suggest a brief *high flame* first before leaving it on a *low flame* for a bit longer, until *the soup deepens in color*.
Zakariya: Um... Just in case you forget, I'll write it down.
Black Screen Text: Zakariya writes down the prescription...
Zakariya: Please deliver the prescription to Maruf.

## Talk 7

Maruf: Ah, Traveler, you're back! What did Zakariya say?
Traveler: About Zakariya's prescription...
Maruf: It says to use the soup he prescribed last time as the base? I see... Let me check the instructions more carefully.
Maruf: Eh? His writing is, um, unsurprisingly still so hard to understand.
Maruf: Traveler, he told you how to brew it and what ingredients are needed, right?
Maruf: Could you watch my steps? Let me know if I make any mistakes.
Maruf: The ingredients are... Ugh... Totally unintelligible...
Traveler: Starshroom.
Maruf: How do I brew it?
Traveler: Brew on a high flame throughout.
Maruf: For how long?
Traveler: Until the ingredients float.
Maruf: Got it. Allow me to check the prescription one more time, just in case we missed something.
Black Screen Text: Maruf starts brewing the medicine...
Traveler: Until the ingredients turn mushy.
Traveler: Until the soup deepens in color.
Traveler: Brew on a low flame throughout.
Traveler: A high flame first, and then a low flame.
Traveler: Henna Berry.
Traveler: Mint.
