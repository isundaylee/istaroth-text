Traveler: How bad is it up on the mountain?
Riese: Well, you should wear more layers for starters, or you might freeze.
Riese: Quite a few of my colleagues haven't dared to come back after making just one trip here.
Riese: Hmm? You want to know why I don't fear the cold?
Riese: Well, it's because of my indomitable will and my frigidity-proof physique... and the three or four layers that I'm wearing under this armor. Those are keeping me very warm indeed.
