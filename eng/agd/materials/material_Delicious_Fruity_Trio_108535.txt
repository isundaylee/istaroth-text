# Delicious Fruity Trio

A dessert with a romantic flair. The crispy and flaky tart shell and refreshing fruit fillings melt in your mouth. The harmonious coalescence of brown and white colors on the meringue reminds one of a stretch of gilded cloud in the warm sunlight. A pleasant surprise to your tastebuds indeed.
