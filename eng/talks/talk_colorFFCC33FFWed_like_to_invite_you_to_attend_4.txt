Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Flora: Is there a music event going on in the city? I'm only familiar with flowers, though, not music.
Paimon: Nah, this one's taking place in Inazuma. And it's totally fine if you don't know much about music, you just need to enjoy it! If there's a tune you like, we could play it for you right now, y'know?
Flora: Well... I do have something in mind. Its name escapes me, but I can hum the tune, at least. Will that do?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Flora: Nice, woohoo!
