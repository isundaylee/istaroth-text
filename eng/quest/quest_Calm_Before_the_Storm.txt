# Calm Before the Storm


## Talk 1

Paimon: Excuse us! We come bearing news of a matter requiring your assistance. Uh, it's all in this letter.
Traveler: Why are you suddenly talking like Xingqiu...
Xu: A letter? Oh, I see... This again...
Traveler: Again?
Xu: Oh, don't mind me, I was just speculating. Let me give this a read.
Paimon: Can he actually read this thing? ...Is it even written in the common tongue?
Xu: Hmm... Yes, this script is inimitable by the uninitiated.
Xu: Honored guests, you must both be weary from your long journey. Please allow the Feiyun Commerce Guild to be your hosts for tonight.
Traveler: Wait, what?
Xu: Please rest assured that the matter written about has been duly received. We just need some time to prepare.
Xu: Please take a seat here in Liuli Pavilion, where you may enjoy some light refreshments while taking in the ocean view. Consider it a small token of our esteem.
Paimon: Yay, tasty snacks! They're giving us the VIP treatment!
Xu: Of course. We treat visitors with the utmost respect here at the Feiyun Commerce Guild. When honored guests grace us with their presence, far be it from us to shirk our duty to them.
Xu: Please, this way.
Traveler: We're not here to stay.
Traveler: You know something about this?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Here we are at the Feiyun Commerce Guild. There sure are a lot of swanky places in Liyue Harbor!
Paimon: Let's go give them the letter.

## Talk 3

Paimon: And Paimon thought we'd get kicked out or turned away at the door!
Paimon: Paimon didn't think Guhua Geek had so much clout...
Xu: Thank you for your patience.
Xu: With the amount of wealth and power Gentry Maocai has, it will take more than a slap on the wrist to get through to him.
Xu: For him to correct the error of his ways, he must feel for himself the same suffering he has inflicted on Chang the Ninth.
Xu: Since Gentry Maocai's business has to do with Cor Lapis, we simply need to buy up all the stock there is in Liyue. That will put him in a rather sticky situation.
Xu: Deprived of the necessary raw materials, even the best craftsperson in Teyvat would be unable to make their product.
Paimon: Great idea! That'll be sure to mess things up between him and the Fatui.
Paimon: But... Liyue is huge. Is it really possible to buy up every last bit of Cor Lapis in the harbor?
Xu: With the timescale we are on, it is indeed a challenge. Hence, as stated in the letter, we must ask for your further cooperation in the matter.
Xu: First, there are a number of vendors in the city you will need to buy from. I've marked their respective locations on your map.
Xu: There is also some unsold Cor Lapis at the Chasm. You will need to purchase that too.
Xu: Finally, there is Chang the Ninth's batch.
Paimon: Alrighty... so three sellers in the city, another one at the Chasm, and then Chang the Ninth. Roger that!
Xu: Of course, we are not expecting you to cover the costs.
Paimon: Wow, so many Mora! ...With cash like this, Paimon could rent out Liuli Pavilion and eat there for a whole month!
Traveler: The Feiyun Commerce Guild is certainly generous with its resources.
Xu: Heh. Well, this is not the first time we've had to do something like this. It's just par for the course now.
Xu: All you need to do is strike a deal. The Feiyun Commerce Guild will handle the transportation and other trifling matters.
Xu: Once you have purchased all the Cor Lapis, please proceed to the Feiyun Commerce Guild's warehouse where you can see the rest of the plan unfold.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I'll take all your Cor Lapis.
Bolai: All of it? Though my business may not seem so big, I should warn that I can get what you need, both legitimately and... not so legitimately. Best you give me an actual number.
Bolai: All of it would be far more than you actually want.
Traveler: It's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Bolai: Fei— Feiyun Commerce Guild!? Well, why didn't you say so?
Bolai: If it's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild, then sign on the dotted line, and I'll start getting things in order right away!
Traveler: Feiyun Commerce Guild only ever does legal business.
Bolai: What are you saying? Of course my business is all above board. Feiyun Commerce Guild, you say... Hmm.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I'll take all your Cor Lapis.
Changshun: You want ALL my Cor Lapis? Ahh, I've already agreed to several orders.
Changshun: That said, none are in writing. The buyers are being incredibly indecisive.
Traveler: Then let the Feiyun Commerce Guild take it off your hands.
Changshun: Oh, it's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Hmm, seems business trends are about to change in Liyue...
Changshun: Oh, ahh... nothing. Just talking to myself. Come, let us sign a contract.
Changshun: Don't worry about my prior client, he hadn't made any down payments or anything. Quite common in the industry.
Changshun: Thank you for your patronage, we hope the Feiyun Commerce Guild will continue to do business with us!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Are you out of Cor Lapis too?
Ivanovich: Oh, I thought you were here to purchase Snezhnayan products.
Ivanovich: No, that I still have, although I ship it all to factories in Snezhnaya. I don't do retail.
Ivanovich: Too much hassle, not enough return. Sorry.
Traveler: Does "we'll take it all" still count as retail?
Ivanovich: Wha— Ah, no, no, no. Give me a second to think. Um...
Ivanovich: A—Alright, I'll do it. Just need you to sign for it.
Ivanovich: (Clearly no shortage of cashflow in Liyue...)
Traveler: So you're rejecting the Feiyun Commerce Guild's business?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hello there, are you in charge of the Cor Lapis here?
Shizhuang the Strong: Aha, finally! I thought you might come — I hear the Feiyun Commerce Guild has been buying up all the Cor Lapis stock in Liyue Harbor.
Shizhuang the Strong: As it happens, I do have a batch of Cor Lapis that hasn't been shipped yet. It's all yours if you name the right price.
Traveler: I have a bad feeling about this...
Shizhuang the Strong: The original buyer's price was already quite high, so... The best I can do is 7,000,000 Mora.
Paimon: Are you serious!? We spent less than 2,000,000 Mora on the rest of Liyue's stock put together!
Shizhuang the Strong: I'm afraid it has to go to the highest bidder. I'm breaching an existing agreement by selling to you, so it has to be worth my while.
Traveler: That's over four times what it should be, you crook!
Shizhuang the Strong: Look, you have your problems to deal with and I have mine. You can take it or leave it, so if you're not buying, please leave me alone.
Paimon: Alright, alright! We'll pay, even if it is a ridiculous price.
Paimon: When we get back, we'll just have to tell the guild that we'll sell to this gentleman at four times the normal price in the future.
Shizhuang the Strong: Wait! Surely there's... no need for that?
Traveler: Maybe you should think twice before affronting the Feiyun Commerce Guild!
Shizhuang the Strong: Please, don't do this. It's not even your money, why be so frugal with it?
Paimon: It might be the Guild's money, but we'll have a tough time explaining to our boss why we spent so much in one go.
Paimon: If he asks, all we can do is mention your name and say you gouged us over the price...
Shizhuang the Strong: I—I understand... I'm sorry, please, I don't want any trouble with the Guild.
Shizhuang the Strong: There's just one other thing, though... There's been an issue with the delivery of this batch. Several carts were ambushed by hilichurls.
Shizhuang the Strong: I don't know where, exactly. But, if I can't retrieve the goods, I can't sell them to you either.
Shizhuang the Strong: So... maybe you could go and look for the carts? There should be five of them in total. If you can find them all and tell me where they are, I'll sign the contract right away.
Traveler: You have a deal!
Shizhuang the Strong: Thank you very much. This is a lot to ask, I know.
Paimon: #That's that then. Well, no time to lose. Come on, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Market price?
Shizhuang the Strong: Oh, yes of course... I mean, I do hope to carry on doing business in Liyue in the future.
Traveler: Take our money and hand over the goods!
Traveler: It's poor form to just raise the price without good grounds.
Traveler: How much does it cost, exactly?

## Talk 8

Paimon: Let Paimon see... Yep, that's it!

## Talk 9

Paimon: That's it alright. That's a big old stash of Cor Lapis.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Another one down!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Aw yeah, we found it! Check out all that Cor Lapis!
Paimon: Make a note of the location. We'll send the Feiyun Commerce Guild to collect it later.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Here we go! Loads of Cor Lapis here.
Paimon: Quick, make a note of the location.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Here, we've made a note of the carts' locations. All five of them. Can you sell us the Cor Lapis now?
Shizhuang the Strong: Ah wonderful, thank you both. Yes, let's make this official. I also hope you could put in a good word with your boss for me.
Paimon: Done and dusted! Yeah!
Traveler: Nice work back there, Paimon.
Paimon: We make a great team, don't we?
Paimon: Now for the final stop on our Cor Lapis crawl — to Chang the Ninth's place!
Traveler: How did you know that bluff would work?
Paimon: Paimon's got a knack for this business malarkey, don't ya think?

## Talk 14

Chang the Ninth: Just who I was hoping to see! I was just thinking to myself, Gentry Maocai's thugs have been mysteriously absent for a while now...
Chang the Ninth: You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Paimon: Oh, don't worry... You won't be hearing from them again!
Chang the Ninth: Oh? ...Wh—What happened?
Traveler: Not only that, but we'd like to purchase your Cor Lapis.
Chang the Ninth: Eh!? ...O—Oh, I see now — you're in this trade too. So, you're trying to beat him to the post, eh? Appearances can be deceiving, that's for sure.
Chang the Ninth: ...But I don't care who you are, a discount of seventy percent is simply impossible. The maximum I can do is forty percent off, and even then I'm only breaking even—
Paimon: No need. We'll take it at the market rate.
Chang the Ninth: You mean... you're not trying to force the price down? ...Wh—What's going on!? Have I died and gone to heaven!?
Chang the Ninth: I can't believe it! I will make a profit on this batch after all!
Chang the Ninth: ...But Gentry Maocai's thugs could still come back after I've sold it...
Paimon: If Paimon told you they're not gonna bother you again, then you'd better believe they're not gonna bother you again!
Traveler: Rest assured, you are safe selling to us.
Chang the Ninth: Hmm... Okay then. My situation can hardly get worse from here in any case.
Chang the Ninth: But tell me, what on earth do you plan to do with so much Cor Lapis?
Paimon: Actually, it's for a commission. Can't go into too much detail.
Traveler: We'll send someone to collect the goods later.
Chang the Ninth: Thank you, thank you a million times over! I really don't know what to say...
Traveler: Don't thank us yet, wait till we've finished at least.
Paimon: Good people always get what's coming to them in the end... And so will the nasty people!
Paimon: #Anyway, let's get going, {NICKNAME}, because apparently we have a show to watch at the Feiyun Commerce Guild's warehouse!
Traveler: See, things are never quite as bad as they seem.
Traveler: Just trust me.
