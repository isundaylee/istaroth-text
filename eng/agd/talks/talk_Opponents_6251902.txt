Traveler: Opponents?
Keshen: That's right! There are many types of foe...
Keshen: Charge forward during missions and take the lead in fighting bandits. Treat them as your opponents and use all your abilities against them.
Keshen: During drills, I fight against Sergeant Lin with real weapons as if I'm fighting a real opponent, practicing to fight against enemy leaders...
Keshen: Of course, the Sergeant has at least ten more years of training than me, so I usually get knocked down, but he's always careful not to hurt me.
Keshen: You can also have friendly spars with the hired guards during break time to hone your hand-to-hand combat skills.
Keshen: Those will definitely come in handy when you're fighting at close range and can't use your spear.
Keshen: In short, fighting against different opponents will teach you how to fight in different environments.
