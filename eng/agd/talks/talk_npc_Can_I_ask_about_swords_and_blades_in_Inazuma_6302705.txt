Traveler: Can I ask about swords and blades in Inazuma?
Amenoma Tougo: Oh, are you also interested in the Inazuman weapons? Seems like you're something of a master of the sword yourself.
Amenoma Tougo: We Inazuman artisans use a special material called Jade Steel, which is produced from Tatarasuna, when forging weapons. It makes the sword tougher and sharper. That's the reason why Inazuman weapons are some of the best in the world.
Amenoma Tougo: Naturally, we have also inherited the techniques of forging weapons using Jade Steel. The key to that is using our perseverance to bring out the strength of the steel.
