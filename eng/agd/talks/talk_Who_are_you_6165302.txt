Traveler: Who are you?
Myweiss: Me? Well, I used to be known as Myweiss the Lovebard... but not anymore. Now I go by Myweiss, Grim Reaper of Romance!
Myweiss: What is love but a lie we tell to fool children? Only idiots would believe in something so stupid.
Myweiss: Ugh, men! They say one thing and do another...
Myweiss: ...My ex-husband, for example!
Traveler: Tell me more about your ex.
Myweiss: Hmph. His name was Davy, a bard in name and name alone... Who knows what I ever saw in him.
Myweiss: After we were married, he chastised me for having my own pursuits â€” said I should be taking care of things at home...
Myweiss: ...Meanwhile, he was all smiles in front of other girls. I observed him for a time and to be fair, they were all just people in his audience. Still, I felt like there was an accident waiting to happen there...
Myweiss: Anyway. I get it now. Love is a big hoax, and I need to make sure the women of Mondstadt wise up to it!
