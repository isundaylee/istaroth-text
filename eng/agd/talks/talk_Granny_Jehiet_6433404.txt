Traveler: Granny Jehiet...
Kurash: Speaking of her, I was shocked when I met her for the first time!
Kurash: Appearances do change over time, but I'm certain Granny Jehiet is "The Lioness" in the legend!
Kurash: I didn't expect her to be living here... and even adopt a little boy.
Kurash: It's so unbelievable, I mean, she is "The Lioness" after all...
