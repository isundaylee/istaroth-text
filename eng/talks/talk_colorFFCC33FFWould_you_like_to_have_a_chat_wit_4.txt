# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Diluc: ...A chat of the idle variety?
Traveler: I forgot, you're not a fan of small talk...
Diluc: No, it's fine. I don't mind.
Diluc: It's only fair that I set aside some time for you.
Diluc: Hmph. How perceptive of you. Yes, I am.
Diluc: Whether it's human avarice lurking in the shadows or a conspiracy from outside the human world...
Diluc: Evil-doers are only waiting for us to let our guard down.
Diluc: ...
Diluc: This is not what you wanted to talk about, is it?
Traveler: Never mind...
Diluc: Hmm...
Diluc: I think I need to engage in a little introspection...
Diluc: But I will also try to find some conversation topics that align with your interests.
Traveler: Knowing that Mondstadt has a protector like you puts my mind at ease.
Diluc: Hmm...
Diluc: That's a given.
Traveler: You look so unhappy all the time, I thought I'd check in...
Diluc: Unhappy...? Nothing of the sort.
Diluc: I'm just thinking. Observing. Or planning.
Diluc: However... I appreciate your concern. I didn't mean to worry you.
Traveler: Are you still preoccupied with Mondstadt's security?
