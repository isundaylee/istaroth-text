Traveler: Surely it isn't as simple as that...
Victoria: Hmph. Sharp people always make enemies of others.
Victoria: Some people were born in the sun, and thus take light and warmth for granted.
Victoria: But love, piety, holiness... all these wonderful things were built on the blood and tears of sinners.
Victoria: Can you all not see it, or do you just look away?
Victoria: If that's the case, then don't ask or think about it too much. When sin comes knocking, judgment will soon follow.
Victoria: Take what I've said as a warning. Take this with you, too. I hope it will keep you vigilant.

Traveler: Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
Victoria: My child, I sense that whatever grave sin you carry with you is weighing heavily on your heart... The best place for you now is surely the confessional?
Victoria: ...Heh. Just kidding, I say that to everyone.
Victoria: But please do not come to me with such trivial questions next time.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Victoria: Goodbye.
Victoria: When you are ready to repent, come and find me!

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Victoria: Ever since Stormterror appeared, there have been many more people coming to confession. This is an unexpected boon.
Victoria: But it matters little. Even if Stormterror hadn't arrived, I have ways and means of making people confess... of their own accord...
Victoria: In a manner of speaking, of course. Don't think about it too much. *chuckles*
