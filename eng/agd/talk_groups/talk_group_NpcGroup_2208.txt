Verr Goldet: Hello there! I presume that you've heard about these meteorites sending people to sleep?
Verr Goldet: We've set aside quite a number of the guest rooms so that they can be available when victims are brought in. So, space is tight. If you want to make a booking, you should do it as early as you can.

Traveler: I'd like to buy something to eat.
Verr Goldet: What'll you have? We have dishes from both Mondstadt and Liyue, and our Almond Tofu is particularly popular.

Traveler: Who are you?
Verr Goldet: My name is Goldet and I come from Mondstadt. I am the boss here at the Wangshu Inn.
Verr Goldet: Lest you think I was the boss' wife.
Verr Goldet: I'm the boss, with a capital "B-O-S-S."
Traveler: I've heard the rumors...
Verr Goldet: Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
Verr Goldet: What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
Verr Goldet: All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
Verr Goldet: Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
Traveler: Whose is this kitty?
Verr Goldet: *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
Verr Goldet: Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
Verr Goldet: You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief — you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.

Traveler: Tell me about your husband.
Verr Goldet: Over there. He's the innkeeper.
Verr Goldet: Don't be led astray by the cheeky grin on his face. He is a rather formidable martial artist.
Verr Goldet: I also practice martial arts, as do the kitchen staff. It is a hiring requirement.
Verr Goldet: You have to have nimble use of your hands and feet when you're serving guests, don't you think?
