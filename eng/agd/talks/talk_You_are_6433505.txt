Traveler: You are...
Kumar: I'm one of the residents here in Vimara Village. If you came around often before, you might've seen me here.
Kumar: Not that any of that matters now, though. By the grace of Lesser Lord Kusanali, my illness has been completely healed!
Kumar: I'm not sure if you've heard, but we have this disease here in Sumeru that causes scales to gradually cover someone's body until they are rendered immobile...
Kumar: To be honest, I was prepared for the worst, but thanks to our archon's miraculous touch, I have a future again.
Kumar: Hah, let's see who dares to doubt her power now!
