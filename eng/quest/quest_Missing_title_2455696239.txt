## Talk 1

Gendou Ringo: You want a fortune slip?
Paimon: Geez, she's so cold.
Traveler: Yes, I'd like one...
Gendou Ringo: Got it. Here's how it goes. First, shake this... thing over here.
Traveler: Isn't it called a Fortune Slip Box?
Gendou Ringo: Yes. A Bamboo Slip will drop out from it. Give it to me, and I'll give you a matching strip of paper.
Traveler: I'm pretty sure they say it's a Fortune Slip...
Gendou Ringo: Whatever.
Paimon: Paimon's got a question! If... What do we do if we get one that means bad luck?
Gendou Ringo: It's fate. You got a problem with that? Huh?
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Isn't there that shelf-like thing outside we can use to...
Gendou Ringo: Tsk.
Paimon: Did she seriously just say "tsk"?
Gendou Ringo: Let me see... Oh right, so it's like this. "Tie the inauspicious slip onto the Fortune Slip Hanger to change ill fortune to good"...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, right! If you get a slip with ill fortune, just tie it to that shelf, that'll do.
Gendou Ringo: Huh, what a bunch of... No, sorry. We at the Grand Narukami Shrine are most gentle indeed. Even if you should draw a slip with bad luck, you shall have a chance to turn it around.
Paimon: Something about this doesn't seem right...
Paimon: #Let's go draw a slip, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 2

Gendou Ringo: Give me that bamboo slip.
Traveler: Râ€”Right.
Paimon: This shrine really seems to lack the whole divine affection thing, huh...
Gendou Ringo: Here.
Paimon: Let's see how our luck's going...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, yes. You can only draw one fortune slip each day. Please remember that.
Gendou Ringo: It's too tiring otherwise... Wait, no. If not, you won't be able to use the Fortune Slip Hanger to... No, that's not right either. What was I supposed to say?
Gendou Ringo: "Fortune slips are the manifestation of our archon's will. It is our place as mortals to respect it and do all we can."
Gendou Ringo: See? Elegantly put. So please remember, you can only draw one fortune slip each day.
