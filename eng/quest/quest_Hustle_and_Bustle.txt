# Hustle and Bustle


## Talk 1

Navia: What do I have to do to get you to yell from the top of this mountain? Name your price.
Clorinde: You really want to hear it that bad, huh?
Navia: I'm just curious is all. I have a feeling you'll say something amazing.
Clorinde: Hmm... I will pass.
Clorinde: I prefer to let actions speak louder than words.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Clorinde said Neuvillette offered to deliver her gifts to Wriothesley.
Paimon: So if we go to the entrance of the Fortress of Meropide, maybe we'll run into Neuvillette!
Paimon: But, we don't know exactly when he'll show up...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Oh! Paimon almost forgot to ask the most important question!
Paimon: Did, uh, something... happen recently, Furina?
Furina: Huh? What do you mean?
Paimon: Uh... Well, you know, with you enlisting the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and all...
Furina: Oh, well, yes.
Paimon: Really!? Oh no...
Paimon: Paimon is so sorry for your loss... Although Paimon may have not known the person, please accept Paimon's deepest—
Furina: Woah, woah, woah. It's not like that, Paimon!
Paimon: Huh? But Paimon just thought... Since you hired the services of a Funeral Parlor and all... Hey, it's not that big of a stretch!
Furina: Really, Paimon. It's not like you don't know me. Do I look like I know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
Furina: Miss Hu Tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
Furina: Not too long ago, I read a collection of horror stories from Liyue. The content was spectacular. In fact, I still feel the need to sleep with the light on even now...
Furina: ...Anyway, that's not the point!
Furina: Now that Fontaine's biggest star has returned to the stage, I figured it's about time the industry enjoyed a breath of fresh air!
Traveler: You might even call it a "breath of fresh t-AIR-or"!
Furina: Hey, that's pretty good! I'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
Paimon: Paimon sees! That makes a lot of sense.
Paimon: So did you come to Liyue just to enlist the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor?
Furina: Well, not exactly...
Furina: My original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. But then I ran into Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli, and well, you know the rest. I suppose it was meant to be.
Zhongli: It was a fated meeting indeed.
Hu Tao: Zhongli sure loves his lofty turns of phrase. But if you ask me, it's all thanks to that man who stopped to ask for directions.
Paimon: Oh? Who was it?
Furina: It's someone you know. Wanna take a guess?
Traveler: Let me think...
Traveler: ...It was Neuvillette, wasn't it?
Furina: What! How did you guess that on your first try!?
Hu Tao: Very impressive, my friend. Your guessing game is spot on today!
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone about your encounter with Navia and Clorinde at the top of the mountain...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon never thought Neuvillette would be the type to get lost...
Furina: I'm sure he didn't get lost. Even I was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
Furina: He was already getting ready to leave by the time I arrived. He just wanted to ask someone about the quickest way to get back to Fontaine.
Hu Tao: Yep. That's exactly what he asked.
Hu Tao: This area is full of mountains and rivers. It's normal to not know the fastest route.
Traveler: (For him, though, swimming would probably be the fastest route of them all.)
Paimon: So were you the one that pointed him in the right direction, Hu Tao?
Hu Tao: Of course. I am also a "guide" of sorts, you know. So naturally, I also have a great sense of direction.
Hu Tao: But, speaking of your friend...
Paimon: What about him?
Hu Tao: He doesn't get out much, does he?
Traveler: No... No, he doesn't.
Hu Tao: Ah, no wonder! He was stiff as a board and way too polite... I would have never guess he was here on vacation if you hadn't told me.
Furina: All in all, he was only here for half a day. I'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation...
Zhongli: Oh? This gentleman you speak of must keep a demanding schedule.
Hu Tao: I'm sure he does. You didn't see him, but he was dressed like he was about to attend some important meeting. It wasn't anything like what someone would wear on vacation.
Zhongli: Is that so...
Paimon: Wait, you didn't see him, Zhongli?
Zhongli: Unfortunately, no.
Zhongli: At the time, it appeared as if Director Hu and Miss Furina were having quite the productive conversation. I know matters of business can take much discussion, so I decided to fetch some tea for them.
Hu Tao: What a shame. That gentleman seemed like a sophisticated sort of guy. I actually think you two would have hit it off!
Zhongli: Is that so?
Traveler: (Judging by how Zhongli is acting... And taking into consideration Neuvillette's true identity...)
Traveler: (Could Zhongli have been avoiding him on purpose?)
Zhongli: Mm?
Traveler: (Oh, I see.)
Traveler: It is what it is.
Traveler: It's truly a pity.
Zhongli: Haha, to borrow Miss Furina's turn of phrase, perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.
Furina: #Well, with {NICKNAME} around, I'm sure you'll have a chance to get to know each other at some point.
Paimon: #That's right! {M#He's}{F#She's} got more friends than {M#he}{F#she} knows what to do with!
Traveler: I have a certain charm about me.
Traveler: I'm good with people.
Furina: Well, that's certainly true!
Furina: Oh, that reminds me. If you get the chance, you should try and talk Neuvillette into loosening up a bit.
Furina: Just tell him the Palais Mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. He shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
Furina: Even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
Furina: If he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. He'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what I mean.
Traveler: That does make sense.
Hu Tao: Seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
Traveler: He's the fair and impartial Iudex of Fontaine, head of the highest court in the land.
Traveler: Otherwise known as, the demon who controls all the paperwork in Fontaine.
Hu Tao: Aiya, sounds like a pretty uptight sort of guy all right.
Hu Tao: Oho, I've never heard of a demon that boring before.
Hu Tao: In my experience, a leader needs be able to roll with the punches. That also includes knowing when and what to prioritize.
Hu Tao: It seems like your friend still has a lot of growing to do.
Furina: (If I remember correctly, he's already several thousands of years old...)
Furina: You're quite right, Miss Hu Tao!

## Talk 4

Zhongli: Oh?
Zhongli: #{NICKNAME}, Miss Furina, those two individuals over there appear to recognize you.
Paimon: Oh! It's Navia and Clorinde!
Paimon: Hey! Over here!
Navia: We saw you all chatting over here, and were wondering if we could join in.
Clorinde: Please excuse the interruption.
Hu Tao: Oh, so polite!
Hu Tao: #No apologies necessary. Any friend of {NICKNAME} and Miss Furina is a friend of mine!
Navia: Ha, straight to the point. I like it!
Black Screen Text: Everyone circles around you and begins to introduce themselves.
Navia: It's getting late...
Navia: If we want to catch a boat back before dark, we should probably get going.
Clorinde: Indeed.
Clorinde: Then... Miss Furina...
Furina: Oh... Uh, yes?
Clorinde: When are you planning to head back? Do you need us to escort you?
Furina: Oh, um, I... I don't think that will be necessary...
Furina: I mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. You don't need to look after me...
Clorinde: Um, I didn't mean it that way.
Clorinde: It's normal for friends to travel home together if they run into each other on the road.
Navia: There are a lot of mountainous roads in this area. I imagine they'll be even harder to navigate after dark.
Hu Tao: Exactly! Just like in those ghost stories...
Hu Tao: Eight paths converge in a wood. Beside them an old house is stood. If you dare to go inside, not a soul will greet your eye...
Hu Tao: But if you take a closer look, there may be something you mistook. A candle flickers to and fro, yet there is no wind to make it so. What is its secret, what could it mean, in this wood where mystery screams...
Furina: Waaaaaah!
Furina: My dear demoiselles... Uh, ladies... No, uh, I mean... friends! Please take me with you!
Clorinde: Of course.
Traveler: F—Furina...
Hu Tao: Hehe, gotta say, Furina, you are really quite the character.
Hu Tao: By the way, did I hear you mention that Clorinde used to work under you?
Hu Tao: Then you must have also been a leader at some point.
Furina: Ah... Well, that's, uh... all in the past now...
Furina: Besides, being a leader is hard. It wasn't the right job for me.
Furina: I prefer how things are now. I can come and go as I please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
Zhongli: I see. Well, you've certainly picked an apt place to relax. Qiaoying Village is an exemplary choice.
Traveler: Well, have you all had a good time?
Furina: Only the best! And I've learned a lot, too!
Furina: Thank you so much, Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli.
Hu Tao: It's fine! You've thanked us more than enough already.
Hu Tao: The next time you're in this neck of the woods, I'll treat you to some dim sum in the city!
Furina: Dim sum... Is that some kind of Liyue term for snacks or desserts?
Hu Tao: They are a part of it! It's basically a tableful of as much tea, sweets, and good company as you can manage.
Furina: Oh, so it's basically a tea party! Sounds great!
Paimon: Make sure to order the Winter Melon Cake and the Lotus Flower Crisp! They're so sweet and delicious. Paimon knows you'll love them!
Furina: Oh, okay! I'll be looking forward to it then.
Paimon: Wait, but... didn't you guys say you were here on vacation? How come you're all going home empty handed?
Traveler: You're not bringing home any souvenirs?
Navia: Of course I am! I bought tons of fun things to bring home with me!
Navia: A kite, a parasol, a little tin frog that jumps... Oh, and a stuffed toy of a mythical beast...
Navia: Clorinde is the one who didn't buy anything for herself.
Paimon: So all you're bringing back with you is that tea?
Clorinde: And some tea-flavored hard candies. They're for Sigewinne.
Navia: Clorinde isn't much of a shopaholic.
Clorinde: Well, one of us has to practice restraint.
Navia: Hey, I'm hardly reckless with my Mora. I'll have you know, all the purchases I made today were well within my budget.
Traveler: What about you, Furina?
Furina: Me? Oh, well, I bought some tea, of course. I just had to try all the varieties recommended in The Steambird.
Furina: Other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. A little bit of this, little bit of that...
Furina: They should all be things I can use... I think.
Traveler: So you fell for a few marketing traps, then.
Paimon: Uhh... Now Paimon's even more confused...
Paimon: If you bought that much stuff, where did it all go? Into one of Lyney's Magic Pockets?
Furina: Oh, actually...
Clorinde: Monsieur Neuvillette took them with him.
Paimon: Oh, so that's what happened...
Paimon: ...Wait, whaaaaat!?
Paimon: Why did he take them? He's not... hoarding treasure, is he?
Navia: Hahaha, that's quite the imagination you've got there, Paimon.
Navia: Monsieur Neuvillette just saw the amount of bags we had, and offered to take them back for us.
Navia: I felt a bit bad at first.... But, uh, I really did have a lot of stuff, hehe...
Clorinde: He even offered to deliver my gifts to the Fortress of Meropide for me once he's done with the day's work.
Clorinde: Neuvillette is a man of his word. If he says he can do something, then he means it.
Navia: See, even Clorinde was happy to take him up on his offer.
Navia: If even his trusty subordinate agreed, then who was I to refuse?
Hu Tao: Wow, he seems like a real gentleman! Maybe he's not as uptight as I thought.
Hu Tao: If only the Funeral Parlor had an employee as thoughtful, proactive, and responsible as him.
Hu Tao: Right, Zhongli?
Zhongli: Indeed.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Qiaoying Village is known for its tea. But you know what else they have with tea? That's right, dim sum!
Paimon: Didn't Gaming say something about dim sum being eaten in the morning? Paimon wonders if we can still get some at this time of day.
Traveler: Afternoon tea might be more appropriate at this point.
Paimon: Oh, well that's fine too. Paimon doesn't care what kind of tea it is, as long as it comes with some tasty snacks!
Paimon: Now, let's see what kinds of yummy things we can find around here... Uh...
Paimon: P-Paimon's not seeing things, is she? Is that Furina standing between Zhongli and Hu Tao?
Traveler: Whoa!
Paimon: Wonder what they're talking about.
Paimon: Zhongli knows a lot of stuff. Maybe he's telling Furina about Qiaoying Village?
Paimon: ...Oh! Or maybe Hu Tao is trying to rope Furina into being one of her clients.
Traveler: Wanna make a bet?
Paimon: Hey, this isn't the Fortress of Meropide!
Paimon: But, Paimon could be convinced for the right price. Let's say loser buys the winner three huge bowls of Seafood Congee!
Paimon: Since Zhongli is there, Paimon bets things are pretty tame...
Paimon: It's decided then! Paimon votes for "tour guide Zhongli"!
Traveler: Then I vote for "hustler Hu Tao".
Paimon: Alright! No time to waste! Let's go see who's right!
Paimon: Good afternoon, Hu Tao, Zhongli, and Furina!!
Paimon: (Oh great, now Paimon's shouting too...)
Hu Tao: Oho, well aren't you a sight for sore eyes! Seems like our luck just keeps on growing!
Zhongli: That we were able to meet you both without prior arrangement must mean that this is quite the serendipitous meeting indeed.
Furina: #Huh? Oh! So both of you are acquainted with {NICKNAME} and Paimon then.
Traveler: I have keenly felt the passage of time since our last meeting.
Hu Tao: Oh? Looks like someone's learned a thing or two from Zhongli.
Furina: #*ahem* I must admit, I'm a bit surprised to see you here, {NICKNAME}.
Furina: But seeing as you're a hero who's been all over Teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
Furina: Since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite!
Zhongli: It appears you have been to Fontaine then.
Zhongli: #{NICKNAME}, given your proclivity to spread good deeds wherever you go, it's no surprise that you would make the acquaintance of a celebrity as illustrious and celebrated as Miss Furina.
Furina: Th—That's quite high praise...
Furina: What I mean to say is, you flatter me, Mr. Zhongli.
Furina: Although I've built up a certain following within Fontaine, it is no reflection of strength or wisdom.
Furina: I stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
Furina: (There is definitely more to Mr. Zhongli than meets the eye. I could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
Furina: (Given his breadth of knowledge on both academic and worldly matters, there's no way he hasn't heard about what happened in Fontaine...)
Furina: (...Is he just feigning ignorance for my benefit?)
Hu Tao: No, no no. Aiya, you're no common tourist. I simply won't have you talk about yourself that way.
Furina: (Huh? Does that mean Hu Tao also knows...!)
Hu Tao: You may not have heard, friends, but—
Furina: Uh, ahem, Miss Hu Tao...
Hu Tao: Miss Furina is now one of my esteemed clients!
Furina: Oh... Yep!
Paimon: Huh—!?
Traveler: Did you hear that, Paimon?
Paimon: Okay, okay. You win...
Paimon: *sigh* Guess Paimon will have to break into the hidden stash at the bottom of her shoe.
Furina: Huh? What's this about winning something?
Hu Tao: Don't tell me... You two were placing bets on us?
Traveler: It was Paimon's idea.
Paimon: Nuh-uh!
Paimon: We just saw you guys standing on the side of the road and couldn't help but take guesses as to what you were talking about.
Hu Tao: Oh, I see. That means you, my friend, must have guessed that I was trying to promote my business to Miss Furina.
Traveler: Well, you know me.
Hu Tao: That I do, my friend.
Hu Tao: What was Paimon's guess then?
Paimon: Paimon thought Zhongli was showing the newbie around.
Furina: Ah, by "newbie" you mean me, right?
Zhongli: If that's the case, then Paimon's guess was also correct.
Furina: Oh, that's right! Mr. Zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
Paimon: Ha! You see! Paimon was right too!
Paimon: Since both of our guesses were right, there can't be a winner or a loser!
Traveler: Fine. Keep your secret stash then.
Paimon: #Hey, don't be upset, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: How about this. You buy Paimon a bowl, and Paimon will also buy you a bowl.
Paimon: Uh... As for the third bowl...
Hu Tao: Since I was the subject of the bet, perhaps it should go to me? You know, as a congratulations for the huge deal I just struck.
Traveler: I'll buy you a bowl any time you want.
Hu Tao: Hehe, I was just joking. Anyway, I should be the one treating you. The Funeral Parlor is about to bring in quite the sum, after all.
Traveler: She's Hu Tao's "esteemed client."
Traveler: So many chums all in one place!
Furina: I'm pretty sure you didn't learn that one from me...
Traveler: Judging based on the hat, I'd say so.

## Talk 6

Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, look! It's Neuvillette! We lucked out!
Neuvillette: Oh, it's you. It has been some time since our last meeting.
Neuvillette: Few people frequent this location. Since I was able to conclude my work early for the day, I thought I might take a walk and avail myself of this area's peace and quiet.
Paimon: You call this early...? Do you always work this late, Neuvillette?
Neuvillette: Strictly speaking, that depends on the agenda for the day.
Neuvillette: I am hardly bereft of time, however, so working late is of little consequence to me.
Paimon: Really? If you have so much time on your hands, then why did you only go to Qiaoying Village for half a day?
Neuvillette: Hmm...?
Neuvillette: First, I should clarify that I was referring to my lifespan rather than the time at my disposal on any given day.
Neuvillette: Second... I was unaware you possessed knowledge of my trip to Qiaoying Village.
Black Screen Text: You give Neuvillette a quick summary of everything that happened today...
Neuvillette: I see. Thank you for informing me.
Traveler: So did you deliver the gifts?
Neuvillette: Yes. They have been safely delivered.
Wriothesley: I have to hand it to Clorinde.
Wriothesley: Just a simple gift delivery, and she has the great and mighty Iudex at her beck and call.
Neuvillette: I was just passing through. It was merely an act of convenience.
Wriothesley: Alright. Then I hereby confirm receipt of the goods on behalf of the staff of the Fortress of Meropide.
Neuvillette: A verbal receipt of confirmation? Is such a formality really necessary for a small matter such as this...
Wriothesley: Guess not.
Wriothesley: This quantity of tea, though... Seems a little excessive for a gift, don't you think? Before you know it, they'll start accusing me of taking bribes.
Neuvillette: Ah, about that...
Neuvillette: Much of that is my own excess, I'm afraid.
Wriothesley: Oh? Why, what happened?
Neuvillette: It was buy ten boxes get half off.
Wriothesley: Ah! That explains it then.
Wriothesley: Well, go ahead and leave them to me. I'll get through this stash as fast as I can.
Neuvillette: You have my thanks.
Neuvillette: There's something else I'd like to give to you.
Wriothesley: This is...
Wriothesley: A stone... slate? Engraved with a symbolic design?
Neuvillette: While that is an apt description, it is, in actuality, a legal codex.
Wriothesley: ...A legal codex, huh... Hmm...
Neuvillette: Before the advent of modern writing utensils, information was recorded on stone slabs such as this. The law was no different.
Wriothesley: Okay...
Neuvillette: Since ancient times, the scales of justice have symbolized the fairness and impartiality of judiciousness.
Neuvillette: As a tribute to that sentiment, this slate was designed after a traditional legal codex and engraved with the symbol instead of text.
Neuvillette: During my travels recently, I chanced upon a roadside stall offering tourists the opportunity to try their hand at the ceramic arts... So I decided to have a go...
Neuvillette: We joked with Clorinde some time ago about gifting you a legal codex. So, here you go.
Wriothesley: Ah, so that's what this is about.
Neuvillette: I did not expect you to remember it as well. In any case, I hope this can be considered as a reasonable attempt to join in on the banter.
Wriothesley: It is a very good attempt.
Wriothesley: I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Even your sense of humor centers around the law. That's an impressive level of commitment.
Wriothesley: A gift of this significance deserves to be put on display, and I know just the place... Front and center in the Fortress's showroom.
Neuvillette: Ah, surely there's no need for such a grand gesture...
Wriothesley: Just kidding. I don't have anything like a showroom.
Wriothesley: But we do have a storage room... We can put it next to all the mechanical parts Sigewinne has collected.
Neuvillette: That sounds good to me.
Paimon: So that's what you were doing in Qiaoying Village!
Neuvillette: Indeed. Of course, while I was there, I also took the opportunity to taste the local spring water.
Neuvillette: The aftertaste is much purer than what I have delivered to me in Fontaine. It stands to reason that the long-distance transport has a tendency to imbue the water with extraneous emotion...
Neuvillette: If you want to experience the true flavor, you simply have to go the source... Perhaps I should organize some time off to do the same elsewhere.
Traveler: As they say in Liyue: "A balance between work and play is sure to keep your troubles at bay."
Neuvillette: Then we are of the same mind. It appears my desire is justified.
Paimon: If you say so. But you know you don't have to justify a vacation, right? You can just take one.
Paimon: After all, you're hardly "bereft of time." You can do whatever you want.
Neuvillette: You're quite right. I suppose I suffer not from a lack of opportunity but rather a lack of inspiration.
Neuvillette: However, after reading a few articles about Liyue's holiday traditions, the idea popped into my head and made itself quite at home...
Neuvillette: Seeing as I was free of responsibilities for the morning, I decided to depart at once.
Traveler: And how was it?
Neuvillette: Refreshing. My spontaneous outing seemed to inspire quite a few other spontaneous decisions as well.
Neuvillette: Take, for example, my foray into ceramics. At first, soil from the ground is granular and unforgiving, but add the right amount of water, and it becomes soft, moldable, and able to take shape.
Neuvillette: In the past, I never thought about how quotidian vessels were crafted. But now, I have participated in their very making.
Neuvillette: This is also something I made today.
Traveler: Oh wow. What a big... ladle?
Paimon: That's a ladle? Paimon thought it was supposed to be some long-necked sea creature!
Neuvillette: That was indeed one of my inspirations.
Traveler: It's amazing.
Neuvillette: Really? You like it?
Neuvillette: To tell you the truth, given your unexpected arrival, I find myself quite unequipped to give you the welcome you deserve.
Neuvillette: Around an important holiday such as this, human custom would dictate that gifts should be in order...
Neuvillette: But I'm afraid, this is all I can offer, if you'll have it, that is.
Traveler: Can I really keep this?
Neuvillette: That is precisely why it would do me such a great honor if you accepted.
Traveler: Then I accept.
Neuvillette: You are most welcome. Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Oh, that reminds me...
Black Screen Text: You pass along the advice for Neuvillette's vacation...
Neuvillette: Hmm, approve a leave of absence request for myself...
Neuvillette: That sounds like it could easily lead to a vicious cycle of self-indulgence, something which couldn't be in further violation of protocol.
Neuvillette: But... I suppose I understand her point.
Neuvillette: My proclivity to refrain from personal outings does, in part, originate from a sense of responsibility toward my duties. But it is also due to a lack of desire to engage in the human world.
Neuvillette: But now I see that the human world is indeed full of many interesting places to discover.
Traveler: I could have told you that.
Traveler: Thank you!
Traveler: You made it by hand and everything...
Traveler: The color also really matches your style.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Hu Tao: Oh, that reminds me. A new year of work is about to begin.
Hu Tao: If there's anything you want to talk about, Zhongli, you know you can come to me. I'm all ears.
Zhongli: Does the Director have any concerns?
Hu Tao: It just seemed like you were a bit preoccupied today, and much less talkative than usual. You barely said anything other than "Is that so?" and "Indeed".
Hu Tao: If you ask me, I'd say you're having a mid-life crisis. You're getting to be around that age, after all.
Zhongli: Is that so?
Hu Tao: ...
Zhongli: Haha, I jest.
Zhongli: Given its distance from the city, Qiaoying Village enjoys a much slower pace of life.
Zhongli: Surrounded by such peace and tranquility, I also seem to have developed a proclivity for inactivity.
Zhongli: I apologize for making you worry.
Hu Tao: Ah. Um, I see.
Hu Tao: #What do you think, {NICKNAME}? Is this atmosphere putting you in a lazy mood too?
Traveler: Out of mind, out of sight...
Hu Tao: Wow! You are getting really good at these kinds of lines!
Zhongli: Indeed.
Traveler: Different worlds should not collide?

### Additional Talk 2

Navia: Well, everyone, make sure that you've got all your belongings with you before we leave.
Navia: If there's any souvenirs anyone still wants to buy, the time is now.
Clorinde: Reliable as ever, Miss President.
Navia: Huh, what is that supposed to mean?
Furina: Clorinde is right, though. You really are reliable!
Navia: It's not what she's saying, it's the way she's saying it!
Furina: I will say, I never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, Clorinde.
Furina: The tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
Clorinde: Well, I try to keep my professional and private life separate. That includes my behavior.
Navia: #You take care now, {NICKNAME}, Paimon.
Traveler: Don't worry. Your partner is very strong.
Navia: Trying to act cool now, are we? Haha, well I guess it's not an act for you, is it?
Clorinde: You are indeed quite strong.
Furina: Hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. I'm really glad I decided to come to Qiaoying Village.
Furina: Maybe we could go on another trip together sometime?

### Additional Talk 3

Neuvillette: Lantern Rite marks the start of the new year in Liyue.
Neuvillette: In the spirit of the season, then, I wish you a year of success as vast and endless as the open ocean.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: The mountain air is so refreshing! It makes Paimon feel like she could float around all day and never get tired!
???: ...Cream! Gummies! Bulle Fruit!
Paimon: #Huh? {NICKNAME}, did you hear that...
???: ...Sunshine! Blue Skies! Good Vibes!
Traveler: I heard it too.
Traveler: Something about Bulle Fruit and good vibes.
Paimon: Right? So Paimon wasn't just hearing things.
Paimon: That voice sounds really familiar...
Paimon: Well, we've got the time. Why don't we go check it out?
Traveler: Okay. Let's go see what's up.
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon make your way up the mountain in search of the source of the shouting.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Oh! Paimon almost forgot to ask the most important question!
Paimon: Did, uh, something... happen recently, Furina?
Furina: Huh? What do you mean?
Paimon: Uh... Well, you know, with you enlisting the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and all...
Furina: Oh, well, yes.
Paimon: Really!? Oh no...
Paimon: Paimon is so sorry for your loss... Although Paimon may have not known the person, please accept Paimon's deepest—
Furina: Woah, woah, woah. It's not like that, Paimon!
Paimon: Huh? But Paimon just thought... Since you hired the services of a Funeral Parlor and all... Hey, it's not that big of a stretch!
Furina: Really, Paimon. It's not like you don't know me. Do I look like I know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
Furina: Miss Hu Tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
Furina: Not too long ago, I read a collection of horror stories from Liyue. The content was spectacular. In fact, I still feel the need to sleep with the light on even now...
Furina: ...Anyway, that's not the point!
Furina: Now that Fontaine's biggest star has returned to the stage, I figured it's about time the industry enjoyed a breath of fresh air!
Traveler: You might even call it a "breath of fresh t-AIR-or"!
Furina: Hey, that's pretty good! I'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
Paimon: Paimon sees! That makes a lot of sense.
Paimon: So did you come to Liyue just to enlist the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor?
Furina: Well, not exactly...
Furina: My original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. But then I ran into Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli, and well, you know the rest. I suppose it was meant to be.
Zhongli: It was a fated meeting indeed.
Hu Tao: Zhongli sure loves his lofty turns of phrase. But if you ask me, it's all thanks to that man who stopped to ask for directions.
Paimon: Oh? Who was it?
Furina: It's someone you know. Wanna take a guess?
Traveler: Let me think...
Traveler: ...It was Neuvillette, wasn't it?
Furina: What! How did you guess that on your first try!?
Hu Tao: Very impressive, my friend. Your guessing game is spot on today!
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone about your encounter with Navia and Clorinde at the top of the mountain...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon never thought Neuvillette would be the type to get lost...
Furina: I'm sure he didn't get lost. Even I was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
Furina: He was already getting ready to leave by the time I arrived. He just wanted to ask someone about the quickest way to get back to Fontaine.
Hu Tao: Yep. That's exactly what he asked.
Hu Tao: This area is full of mountains and rivers. It's normal to not know the fastest route.
Traveler: (For him, though, swimming would probably be the fastest route of them all.)
Paimon: So were you the one that pointed him in the right direction, Hu Tao?
Hu Tao: Of course. I am also a "guide" of sorts, you know. So naturally, I also have a great sense of direction.
Hu Tao: But, speaking of your friend...
Paimon: What about him?
Hu Tao: He doesn't get out much, does he?
Traveler: No... No, he doesn't.
Hu Tao: Ah, no wonder! He was stiff as a board and way too polite... I would have never guess he was here on vacation if you hadn't told me.
Furina: All in all, he was only here for half a day. I'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation...
Zhongli: Oh? This gentleman you speak of must keep a demanding schedule.
Hu Tao: I'm sure he does. You didn't see him, but he was dressed like he was about to attend some important meeting. It wasn't anything like what someone would wear on vacation.
Zhongli: Is that so...
Paimon: Wait, you didn't see him, Zhongli?
Zhongli: Unfortunately, no.
Zhongli: At the time, it appeared as if Director Hu and Miss Furina were having quite the productive conversation. I know matters of business can take much discussion, so I decided to fetch some tea for them.
Hu Tao: What a shame. That gentleman seemed like a sophisticated sort of guy. I actually think you two would have hit it off!
Zhongli: Is that so?
Traveler: (Judging by how Zhongli is acting... And taking into consideration Neuvillette's true identity...)
Traveler: (Could Zhongli have been avoiding him on purpose?)
Zhongli: Mm?
Traveler: (Oh, I see.)
Traveler: It is what it is.
Traveler: It's truly a pity.
Zhongli: Haha, to borrow Miss Furina's turn of phrase, perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.
Furina: #Well, with {NICKNAME} around, I'm sure you'll have a chance to get to know each other at some point.
Paimon: #That's right! {M#He's}{F#She's} got more friends than {M#he}{F#she} knows what to do with!
Traveler: I have a certain charm about me.
Traveler: I'm good with people.
Furina: Well, that's certainly true!
Furina: Oh, that reminds me. If you get the chance, you should try and talk Neuvillette into loosening up a bit.
Furina: Just tell him the Palais Mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. He shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
Furina: Even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
Furina: If he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. He'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what I mean.
Traveler: That does make sense.
Hu Tao: Seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
Traveler: He's the fair and impartial Iudex of Fontaine, head of the highest court in the land.
Traveler: Otherwise known as, the demon who controls all the paperwork in Fontaine.
Hu Tao: Aiya, sounds like a pretty uptight sort of guy all right.
Hu Tao: Oho, I've never heard of a demon that boring before.
Hu Tao: In my experience, a leader needs be able to roll with the punches. That also includes knowing when and what to prioritize.
Hu Tao: It seems like your friend still has a lot of growing to do.
Furina: (If I remember correctly, he's already several thousands of years old...)
Furina: You're quite right, Miss Hu Tao!

### Additional Talk 6

Zhongli: Oh?
Zhongli: #{NICKNAME}, Miss Furina, those two individuals over there appear to recognize you.
Paimon: Oh! It's Navia and Clorinde!
Paimon: Hey! Over here!
Navia: We saw you all chatting over here, and were wondering if we could join in.
Clorinde: Please excuse the interruption.
Hu Tao: Oh, so polite!
Hu Tao: #No apologies necessary. Any friend of {NICKNAME} and Miss Furina is a friend of mine!
Navia: Ha, straight to the point. I like it!
Black Screen Text: Everyone circles around you and begins to introduce themselves.
Navia: It's getting late...
Navia: If we want to catch a boat back before dark, we should probably get going.
Clorinde: Indeed.
Clorinde: Then... Miss Furina...
Furina: Oh... Uh, yes?
Clorinde: When are you planning to head back? Do you need us to escort you?
Furina: Oh, um, I... I don't think that will be necessary...
Furina: I mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. You don't need to look after me...
Clorinde: Um, I didn't mean it that way.
Clorinde: It's normal for friends to travel home together if they run into each other on the road.
Navia: There are a lot of mountainous roads in this area. I imagine they'll be even harder to navigate after dark.
Hu Tao: Exactly! Just like in those ghost stories...
Hu Tao: Eight paths converge in a wood. Beside them an old house is stood. If you dare to go inside, not a soul will greet your eye...
Hu Tao: But if you take a closer look, there may be something you mistook. A candle flickers to and fro, yet there is no wind to make it so. What is its secret, what could it mean, in this wood where mystery screams...
Furina: Waaaaaah!
Furina: My dear demoiselles... Uh, ladies... No, uh, I mean... friends! Please take me with you!
Clorinde: Of course.
Traveler: F—Furina...
Hu Tao: Hehe, gotta say, Furina, you are really quite the character.
Hu Tao: By the way, did I hear you mention that Clorinde used to work under you?
Hu Tao: Then you must have also been a leader at some point.
Furina: Ah... Well, that's, uh... all in the past now...
Furina: Besides, being a leader is hard. It wasn't the right job for me.
Furina: I prefer how things are now. I can come and go as I please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
Zhongli: I see. Well, you've certainly picked an apt place to relax. Qiaoying Village is an exemplary choice.
Traveler: Well, have you all had a good time?
Furina: Only the best! And I've learned a lot, too!
Furina: Thank you so much, Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli.
Hu Tao: It's fine! You've thanked us more than enough already.
Hu Tao: The next time you're in this neck of the woods, I'll treat you to some dim sum in the city!
Furina: Dim sum... Is that some kind of Liyue term for snacks or desserts?
Hu Tao: They are a part of it! It's basically a tableful of as much tea, sweets, and good company as you can manage.
Furina: Oh, so it's basically a tea party! Sounds great!
Paimon: Make sure to order the Winter Melon Cake and the Lotus Flower Crisp! They're so sweet and delicious. Paimon knows you'll love them!
Furina: Oh, okay! I'll be looking forward to it then.
Paimon: Wait, but... didn't you guys say you were here on vacation? How come you're all going home empty handed?
Traveler: You're not bringing home any souvenirs?
Navia: Of course I am! I bought tons of fun things to bring home with me!
Navia: A kite, a parasol, a little tin frog that jumps... Oh, and a stuffed toy of a mythical beast...
Navia: Clorinde is the one who didn't buy anything for herself.
Paimon: So all you're bringing back with you is that tea?
Clorinde: And some tea-flavored hard candies. They're for Sigewinne.
Navia: Clorinde isn't much of a shopaholic.
Clorinde: Well, one of us has to practice restraint.
Navia: Hey, I'm hardly reckless with my Mora. I'll have you know, all the purchases I made today were well within my budget.
Traveler: What about you, Furina?
Furina: Me? Oh, well, I bought some tea, of course. I just had to try all the varieties recommended in The Steambird.
Furina: Other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. A little bit of this, little bit of that...
Furina: They should all be things I can use... I think.
Traveler: So you fell for a few marketing traps, then.
Paimon: Uhh... Now Paimon's even more confused...
Paimon: If you bought that much stuff, where did it all go? Into one of Lyney's Magic Pockets?
Furina: Oh, actually...
Clorinde: Monsieur Neuvillette took them with him.
Paimon: Oh, so that's what happened...
Paimon: ...Wait, whaaaaat!?
Paimon: Why did he take them? He's not... hoarding treasure, is he?
Navia: Hahaha, that's quite the imagination you've got there, Paimon.
Navia: Monsieur Neuvillette just saw the amount of bags we had, and offered to take them back for us.
Navia: I felt a bit bad at first.... But, uh, I really did have a lot of stuff, hehe...
Clorinde: He even offered to deliver my gifts to the Fortress of Meropide for me once he's done with the day's work.
Clorinde: Neuvillette is a man of his word. If he says he can do something, then he means it.
Navia: See, even Clorinde was happy to take him up on his offer.
Navia: If even his trusty subordinate agreed, then who was I to refuse?
Hu Tao: Wow, he seems like a real gentleman! Maybe he's not as uptight as I thought.
Hu Tao: If only the Funeral Parlor had an employee as thoughtful, proactive, and responsible as him.
Hu Tao: Right, Zhongli?
Zhongli: Indeed.
