Traveler: Huh, I haven't seen you around before...
Xana: Hmm? Oh, if you're talking about where I was then, I was at the Fontaine Research Institute â€” there's nowhere better to go if you want to learn how to make awesome clockwork meka!
Xana: There's a super cool, super huge machine there too... but one day, I will make something larger still!
