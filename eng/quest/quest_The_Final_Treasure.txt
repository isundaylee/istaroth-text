# The Final Treasure


## Talk 1

Miitoboru: Ahoy, here you are. I thought you'd be too busy flying around the islands with those wings o' yours.
Miitoboru: Bet you've long forgotten your old mate Miitoboru, sitting there slowly soaking away in the ocean.
Paimon: We're here now, aren't we!
Paimon: So, you said you needed our help. What's up?
Miitoboru: It's not that important... Remember when you helped me find the missing pieces of my body?
Miitoboru: How can I put it... I'm not sure if it's because I've fulfilled my wishes, or if these waters are slowly diminishing my ability to talk...
Miitoboru: Recently, I find myself sleeping most of the time rather than staying conscious...
Traveler: Is it because the machine was turned off...
Miitoboru: #I see... So it's because of some contraption that I became your Waverider and could communicate with you, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: Oh... Does that mean that once the effects of the machine wear off, Miitoboru won't be able to talk anymore?
Paimon: #We gotta do something before it's too late, {NICKNAME}...
Miitoboru: Haha, there'll be no need for that, Paimon... I am quite content that I had the chance to talk to you at all.
Miitoboru: Argh... The more I think about it, for me, as a ship, to have gotten to talk to you in the past few days... It really is a wondrous thing, the stuff dreams are made of...
Miitoboru: But now, I need to ask you for one more favor...
Traveler: Tell us.
Miitoboru: Remember when I told you that once we found my body, I'd take you for a cruise? Well, it seems my body was reduced to a slew of sorry shipwrecks...
Miitoboru: And most of the treasure was taken away, leaving nothing good for you...
Miitoboru: But this time, I swear as a mighty pirate ship, there be treasure ahoy, and a fine treasure at that! Or else may I be strangled by seagrass and fed to the fish! Just trust me one last time!
Paimon: #Well, {NICKNAME}, since Miitoboru probably won't be able to speak soon...
Paimon: #And... Since there really is treasure this time... Let's go, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Paimon, you never change.
Paimon: Time to set sail!
Miitoboru: Argh! Come on then, me hearties! Time to come aboard!
Traveler: Oh, go on then...
Traveler: Is Miitoboru also affected by the machine...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whew, that was close. Paimon was sure we were gonna sink!
Paimon: Kosekimaru, you're amazing!
Miitoboru: #Haha, a talking ship is still just a ship. {NICKNAME}'s superb sailing skill was what saw us safely through the storm.
Traveler: Do you wanna go again?
Miitoboru: Haha, I'd rather not.
Miitoboru: *sigh* I'm afraid I may have triggered the thunderstorm. These waters are less stable than they once were...
Miitoboru: #But... we've arrived! {NICKNAME}, Paimon, the treasure is right up there!
Paimon: Isn't this the place we first visited when we were looking for treasure? There was nothing here but half of Kosekimaru's hull!
Miitoboru: I am certain that there's treasure up there this time. It's... What did I call it again? It's the intuition of a mighty pirate ship!
Paimon: Wait a minute... You said you had two things to tell us, right? And the first one was that you'd remembered your name. What was the other one?
Miitoboru: Hahaha, I thought you'd already forgotten. I'll tell you when you come back!
Traveler: You're too kind.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Kosekimaru, Kosekimaru!
Paimon: We found the treasure. Look, it's a model pirate ship! Your intuition finally worked this time!
Paimon: So, what's the other thing you wanted to tell us?
Miitoboru: ...
Paimon: Kosekimaru?
Miitoboru: (The ship named Kosekimaru does not respond...)
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: ...Hmph, but he said he'd tell us when we returned.
Paimon: Kosekimaru... you're a big fat liar!
Traveler: Kosekimaru can't speak anymore...
