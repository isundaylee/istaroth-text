# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Want to chat?
Tighnari: Of course. Anything you want to talk about?
Tighnari: If you let me start the conversation, it would definitely be about plants.
Traveler: It's fine. I was expecting that, anyway.
Tighnari: Oh? So you're ready for class?
Tighnari: Then let us begin with the basics. Botany is a branch of biology that focuses on the morphology, taxonomy, ecology, genetics, and evolution of plants.
Tighnari: The basic taxonomical classification of plants is as follows:
Traveler: Zzz... zzz...
Tighnari: No daydreaming, sleepyhead! This is what you asked for.
Tighnari: ...Heh, alright, I'm only teasing. People who don't work in this field don't have to bash their heads against the books.
Tighnari: However, you spend a considerable amount of time traveling and traipsing through the outdoors. It would behoove you to learn a thing or two about common plants.
Tighnari: For instance, discerning a plant's growth patterns to orient position, how to use stems and leaves to acquire potable water...
Tighnari: Which fruits are edible and palatable, which herbs are suitable for cooking with meat...
Traveler: Oh no, I'm starting to drool...
Tighnari: Hey, what's the matter with you!? Is this what happens when you hear anything remotely about food?
Traveler: It's mostly Paimon's fault...
Tighnari: Ah yes, your little partner...
Tighnari: She doesn't seem the most... intellectual sort, but she cares deeply about you.
Tighnari: Even if it's only for the sake of protecting your companion, you should learn more about the natural sciences.
Tighnari: Ah... Sorry, I slipped into training mode there for a second, look at me, talking to you like you're a rookie Forest Ranger. ...Please forgive me.
Tighnari: Anyway, you're smart enough to understand what I meant.
Tighnari: If you ever wish to learn more about flora, my door is open any time.
Traveler: Professor, I'm hungry.
Traveler: *yawn*
Traveler: Teach me something, Professor.
