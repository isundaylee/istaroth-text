Diona: #Oh? It's you, Traveler.
Diona: *sniff* ...All clear! No scent of alcohol on you!

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Diona: Hmph, adequate.
Traveler: Just adequate?
Diona: Well, the grass here isn't as soft as the spot where I usually take my afternoon nap.
Diona: There aren't as many butterflies here as in the meadow I like to go to.
Diona: And I can't hunt freely here like out in the wilderness.
Traveler: I'll... look into making some improvements.
Diona: But... there's no smell of alcohol hanging in the air here...
Diona: ...And no drunkards kicking up a fuss.
Diona: So... I think we can keep it the way it is...
Traveler: Any suggestions?

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Diona: Uhh, I'm actually pretty busy here!
Diona: ...Still, I suppose a quick chat won't hurt.
Diona: Let's do it — I know lots of great topics!
Traveler: Do you chat with other people a lot?
Diona: Well... the old drunkards try to chat with me all the time.
Diona: I never answer them, but that's still not enough to shut them up!
Diona: I always make a point of making them the most disgusting cocktail I can come up with.
Diona: But they drain every last drop and then ask for another glass! Ugh!
Diona: Why do things have to be this way...?
Traveler: What do you like to chat about?
Diona: ...I like to share my hunting tips with others, but...
Diona: ...The guys at the tavern only wanna talk about the harvest, girls they like, card game strategies... stuff like that.
Diona: I hate it. I make it pretty obvious that I'm not listening, but there's always someone at the bar rattling on to me.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Diona: Uhh...
Diona: #...Actually... there is something I wanted your help with, Traveler.
Diona: See, most of the time I'm either making cocktails or hunting, so I always tie my hair up like this.
Diona: But... it's so relaxed here, there are no chores to do, plus nobody else has to see, soooo...
Diona: I was wondering... would it be better if I... wore my hair down...?
Traveler: Whatever you like.
Diona: Heh, really!?
Diona: Well, in that case... could you help me with it?
Diona: ...Wait! Firstly! I want to make it quite clear that this is not because I just enjoy the feeling of having my hair brushed, okay!? Ahem...
Diona: And be gentle by the way. If you start tearing out hairs, hehe... I might just bite back!
Traveler: I'm sure wearing it down would look just as lovely.

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Diona.
Diona: #Morning, Traveler!
Diona: Hey, if you're going out for a bit of sunshine... and if you wanted to take me with you... I wouldn't mind!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Diona.
Diona: #Good night, Traveler.
Diona: *sigh* If only the grown-ups at the tavern would behave responsibly and go home after dark, like you.
Diona: Then I wouldn't have to be on duty all the time.

Diona: Hunting isn't easy, you know! You need the right techniques and weaponry.
Diona: Competent hunters go into the city every week to maintain their weapons, sometimes spending quite a bit of Mora.
Diona: With this smithy, ha! I can do maintenance myself.

## Talk

Diona: Oh, how familiar... This place is very similar to my hometown.
Diona: But you don't have any bars and drunkards here, right?
Diona: Purrfect, hehe! I'll find a room to settle down in!
