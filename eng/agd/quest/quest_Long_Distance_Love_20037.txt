# Long Distance Love


## Talk 1

Godwin: ...Ugh, I am so ready to just get back to Mondstadt...
Godwin: Oh, Traveler! Hi! Can I ask you a favor?
Godwin: As you can see, I'm with the Knights, and I'm on patrol right now.
Godwin: I told my girlfriend I would send her a letter before too long, just to let her know I'm safe and sound.
Godwin: Then things got busy and I forgot all about it... dear me. Could you deliver this *letter* to her for me? Her name's *Glory*...
Traveler: Wait— Glory?
Paimon: The blind girl... Dandelion Seed collector...
Paimon: Aha! You must be Godwin? Glory mentioned you!
Godwin: Wha— How do you know Glory?
Traveler: She had us run an errand for her.
Godwin: She made you run an errand, you say? I hope it wasn't anything dangerous...
Paimon: She just asked us to get her some Dandelion Seeds, that's all. She said by releasing them into the wind, they would convey her heart's desires to you.
Godwin: Dandelion Seeds, eh? That does sound like my Glory alright.
Traveler: Hang on, she said you were supposed to be somewhere far away from Mondstadt?
Godwin: Yes— erm, well that was the plan... Let me, uh, fill you in.
Godwin: Did you hear about the time the Grand Master left Mondstadt and took four out of every five knights with him?
Godwin: Right, well, I was one of the ones assigned to that expedition. But unfortunately... just as we were getting ready to set off, I realized I'd lost the keepsake that Glory gave me. By the time I was done looking for it, they'd already left...
Godwin: I—I still haven't figured out how to catch up with them, and in the meantime I've just been milling around here...
Godwin: I can't bring myself to go back to Mondstadt. I can only imagine what the knights would think of me if I just came crawling back...
Godwin: Also... I promised Glory I would send her letters and gifts from all around the world. I said I would send her the world!
Godwin: If she found out I'd never even made it out of Mondstadt...
Paimon: You don't want to lose face.
Godwin: Please, deliver this *letter* to *Glory* for me won't you? I bet she's worried sick about me.
Traveler: Okay.
Godwin: I can't thank you enough, Traveler! Please keep everything I just told you a secret though.
Traveler: Why not try the dandelion hotline?
Godwin: There is so much I want to say to Glory, far more than a handful of Dandelion Seeds could ever hope to carry.
Godwin: Thank you for taking her my letter. And remember, not a word about any of this!

## Talk 2

Godwin: Thank you for delivering my letter. *sigh* All I want to do is go back and see Glory... If only...

## Talk 3

Glory: Hello. I know that voice... Traveler! It's you, isn't it?
Glory: What brings you here today?
Traveler: Someone told me to bring you this letter.
Glory: A letter... for me? Who would do that...
Glory: ...Godwin.
Glory: Have you seen him? I guess that must mean he's okay— Did he say when he'll be back?
Glory: Sorry, forget all that. I'm sure he must be far too busy to answer all these questions, I don't want to put any more pressure on him.
Glory: But could you read the letter to me?
Glory: Quietly... No one needs to hear this but the two of us.
Traveler: Okay.
Glory: Wow, you read it so nicely... Is this something you do a lot?
Traveler: That's the end of the letter.
Glory: Liyue Harbor... Wow, Godwin really is seeing the world after all!
Glory: Thank you, I will treasure this letter. Next time you see *Godwin*, do tell him I'm thinking of him.

### Additional Talk 1

Glory: What is it? Is there something else you need to tell me?

### Additional Talk 2

Godwin: Did you deliver my letter?
Traveler: Glory sends her best wishes.
Godwin: Phew... At least she's not mad at me after that long silence.
Paimon: How do you know about Liyue Harbor when you've been milling around Mondstadt this whole time?
Godwin: Ah, yes... All my stories are based on things the Grand Master has told me. He's been everywhere.
Godwin: Anyway, thanks again. You have been a big help.
Godwin: Here, take these Dandelion Seeds. I picked them myself.
Godwin: Next time Glory asks you for more Dandelion Seeds, I'd appreciate it if you could help her out again.
