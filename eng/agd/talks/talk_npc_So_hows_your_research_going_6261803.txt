Traveler: So, how's your research going?
Khedive: Since you've helped me so much so far, I could tell you a few things, no problem.
Khedive: We came here to monitor the anomalous energies that have been radiating from deep below and study the effects they are having on The Chasm.
Khedive: It seems clear now, though, that the situation we face is far more complex than we first imagined.
Khedive: If it wasn't for your valor, I doubt that we'd have gotten anywhere near as much data as we have.
