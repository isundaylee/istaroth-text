# Gourmet Supremos: Within Our Duties


## Talk 1

Xudong: Ah, so this is Sumeru...
Parvaneh: What are you sniffing?
Xudong: Didn't you say Sumeru has a lot of spices? I don't smell any of them!
Parvaneh: Spices are sealed in the warehouses. How can we even smell them at the harbor?
Julie: Whoa... That's a huge one... Is that the Divine Tree that holds the Akademiya?
Julie: Does it bear any fruit? Hmm... maybe... Divine Fruit?
Parvaneh: There's no such fruit.
Julie: If researchers feel hungry when reading, they could pick some of these fruits to eat...
Parvaneh: We have canteens...
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe, everyone, there's no point staying at the port.
Kamei Munehisa: Doesn't Ms. Parvaneh have some business at the Akademiya? We should head off now. Can't afford to waste time.
Traveler: You came to Sumeru too?
Xudong: Traveler, I didn't expect to meet you here!
Paimon: It's been a while. Are you here to look for ingredients for some tasty food?
Xudong: Sort of... But before we start to look for any, we need to run some errands with Parvaneh.
Parvaneh: Actually, it's my paper on "Omni-Spice." I've finished it and am about to report to the Akademiya.
Parvaneh: But you guys don't have to come with me! I'll catch up with you after this is over.
Parvaneh: A bunch of people just flooding into the Akademiya... They would've thought I was hijacked!
Xudong: Are you feeling embarrassed now?
Parvaneh: Huh!? Why would I feel embarrassed!?
Parvaneh: There's nothing fun in the Akademiya. All you can do is wait for me there...
Julie: That's all right. I've always wanted to go to the Akademiya, but I've only heard about it from people in the guild...
Kamei Munehisa: Ms. Parvaneh, Mr. Xudong was just worried that you could run into something sticky.
Kamei Munehisa: After all, you have been away for too long. No one knows what would happen on your return.
Xudong: Mr. Kamei gets me!
Parvaneh: What are you even talking about? My tutor is too nice to make things difficult for me.
Parvaneh: I've been in contact with her. She's read my draft.
Parvaneh: I'll just have to submit the finalized version this time.
Xudong: That'd be great. You could just take us as tourists.
Parvaneh: Going to the Akademiya for a tour... Seriously?
Parvaneh: Come if you want. I should be able to get it over with in no time.
Julie: And after this...
Parvaneh: I'll take you for tasty food... Don't worry I won't forget.
Julie: Yay!
Parvaneh: Traveler, you should come with us. You offered us so much help, now it's my turn to treat you in Sumeru.
Traveler: Time to dig in.
Parvaneh: Then let's get going. It should take a while to get to the Akademiya from here.
Traveler: Hehe, free meals.
Paimon: Hey! That sounds weird!
Traveler: I'm here for the free meals!

## Talk 2

Julie: Wow, such a huge tree!
Kamei Munehisa: Watch your step when you walk. Don't fixate on that tree, Ms. Julie.
Xudong: Ah! I smell it! The aroma of delicacies!
Parvaneh: Just go and play somewhere, and I'll catch up with you in a minute...
Xudong: No way. We must make sure everyone enjoys the savory meals. No one should be left out.
Parvaneh: You are unbelievable... Fine, the Akademiya is up there. Let's get going.

## Talk 3

Farzah: Haha, Parvaneh, you are back. I've been waiting for so long.
Parvaneh: Sorry I'm late, Ms. Farzah. Something happened on the way and it took me a while.
Farzah: No worries! Your paper is well-written, and your research looks very promising, too! I've heard a lot of good words about it.
Parvaneh: Thank you. I brought the whole paper with me...
Farzah: Well... great work, Parvaneh.
Farzah: I'll take a good look at it later. With your academic ability, I'm sure there won't be any issue.
Parvaneh: Y—You are too kind, Ms. Farzah...
Xudong: Did Parvaneh just blush? You don't see that every day.
Kamei Munehisa: It is really something to be proud of to be recognized by your mentor.
Julie: Hmm... What's going on?
Traveler: What is it?
Julie: I don't like that mentor of hers...
Kamei Munehisa: And why is that, Ms. Julie?
Julie: Don't know. It's just a feeling...
Julie: Maybe I'm too exhausted. Don't tell Parvaneh. I don't wanna upset her.
Parvaneh: What are you guys talking about?
Julie: Urgh... It's nothing! I—I'm starving...!
Parvaneh: Haven't you eaten already? You really have a voracious appetite, don't you?
Kamei Munehisa: Ms. Julie is not a sedentary person. Of course she gets hungry fast.
Xudong: Parvaneh, have you gotten it over with your business?
Parvaneh: Almost. I'll just have to wait for the paper to be formally reviewed, which should be completed in the next few days.
Parvaneh: After this... Hmph, I can work on the projects that I like.
Parvaneh: The "Omni-Spice" has not been refined. I shall perfect it when I have a whole team!
Parvaneh: I still have things to do before my paper gets approved. You better stay at Sumeru City.
Parvaneh: I can't afford more time to look for you...
Xudong: No worries. The whole city is enough for a tour.
Xudong: Now that you're done here, how about you show us around?
Xudong: And.. some Sumeru local specialties maybe?
Parvaneh: Finally, huh? I can see that look on your face...
Parvaneh: Let me see... Let's go to the headquarters of the Corps of Thirty.
Kamei Munehisa: Eh? Thirty people? That can't be all they have.
Parvaneh: It's just a name, don't worry... Anyway, let's go and take a look.
Paimon: Julie, why are you silent? Something wrong?
Julie: Huh? No, no. I—I'm just hungry! I'll be fine with some food.
Parvaneh: How do you even manage to stay in shape with that appetite...

## Talk 4

Parvaneh: This is the place!
Parvaneh: Stationed here is the Corps of Thirty, responsible for the defense of Sumeru City.
Parvaneh: The name came from its founders. There were exactly thirty of them.
Parvaneh: The entire Corps has expanded, but the name remains in memory of the founders.
Julie: Like The Four Winds in Mondstadt. Pretty easy to understand.
Xudong: It's just like the Liyue Qixing in Liyue...
Kamei Munehisa: Eh? Why are you all looking at me?
Kamei Munehisa: Hmm... We have the Tri-Commission in Inazuma.
Traveler: Regions have their names in a similar way.
Paimon: It appears so, but it's more than thirty people when we talk about the Corps of Thirty in Sumeru.
Kamei Munehisa: That guard there looks like a Martial Artist. He looks really worried.
Traveler: Is anyone in trouble!
Paimon: Why are you getting excited? It's not a commission!
Yunus: Ah, you must've come to Sumeru City for a visit.
Yunus: I'm Yunus, a logistics officer of the Corps of Thirty in the Citadel of Regzar.
Xudong: You look worried... Ran into some trouble?
Yunus: Yes. Monsters in the wild have been restless for reasons unknown. We've had to send someone out to drive them away.
Yunus: They move so fast in large numbers. People we sent to deal with them got whacked every time.
Yunus: I was wondering what meals our cook should prepare for them.
Yunus: Ah, it seems that another bunch of our men should be back now...
Yunus: Now, if you'll excuse me. Have a good time in Sumeru City.
Kamei Munehisa: What a man of action...
Parvaneh: Whew... I'm glad he didn't talk to me. I'm afraid of dealing with people from the Eremites...
Parvaneh: Let me see... We'll head to Adventurers' Guild next.
Parvaneh: Though I don't think it would be any different from the guilds of anywhere else...
Parvaneh: But Julie may want to see it.
Parvaneh: Ugh... Julie?
Julie: Huh? What was that?
Parvaneh: We are going to visit the Adventurers' Guild. Are you coming?
Julie: Yeah! I've always wanted to visit there. L—Let's roll!
Traveler: Do you need my help!?
Paimon: Chill out! It's no serious business.

## Talk 5

Xudong: Is this the Adventurers' Guild?
Kamal: Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. Anything you're here for?
Kamal: If you're looking to take commissions, just ask Katheryne over there.
Xudong: You seem dispirited, Julie. Are you feeling exhausted?
Julie: Yeah, I'm a little tired.
Kamei Munehisa: We hardly got any rest after getting off the ship, and I'm exhausted too.
Kamei Munehisa: We should get something to eat soon and turn in, Parvaneh.
Parvaneh: That sounds good. Shevirme's grill should still be open, so we ought to feast there.
Xudong: Let's roll. I didn't expect Sumeru City to be so big that it wore me out just window shopping!
Xudong: Finally, local Sumeru delicacies! Can't wait!

## Talk 6

Shevirme: Parvaneh? You're back?
Shevirme: Are those your friends behind you?
Parvaneh: Yes, they just got to Sumeru and I've been showing them around the city.
Parvaneh: I saw you're open and wanted to get some Shawarma Wraps. Got enough ingredients for us?
Shevirme: Are you kidding me? Of course I do! Six rolls, one for each person, right? Give me a few minutes!
Paimon: Wow, Paimon can't wait!
Black Screen Text: Shevirme starts to cook...
Xudong: The smell, the taste... It's heavenly!
Kamei Munehisa: What an amazing flavor, completely different from Inazuma's cooking.
Parvaneh: How is it, Julie?
Julie: Delicious, thanks...
Parvaneh: Why are you so polite all of a sudden? Are you feeling okay?
Traveler: So what's next?
Xudong: We reserved lodging and will check in soon.
Xudong: We'll leave Sumeru after Parvaneh's thesis gets officially passed.
Traveler: Hold on.
Xudong: After her thesis is accepted, she has to stay with the Akademiya to do research work, so she can't come with us anymore.
Xudong: It's what she wants. She talked to us about it and we all understand.
Xudong: That might be true, but it will feel like we're missing something.
Paimon: So that's why Julie's seemed distracted the whole way...
Xudong: That's probably the cause.
Xudong: Even though everyone tried to avoid the subject, Parvaneh will likely remain with the Akademiya.
Xudong: ...
Xudong: Come on, this is not the end of the world. It's not like we'll never see her again!
Xudong: We can even bum a meal off the Akademiya when we come back later.
Xudong: Parvaneh told us before that she kept in touch with her mentor, so she should get the result for her thesis in two or three days.
Xudong: Yeah, come back to the Akademiya tomorrow and hang out with us.
Xudong: Since we have no idea when the next time will be after we leave Sumeru.
Traveler: Parvaneh's not leaving with you?

## Talk 7

Kamei Munehisa: Shameless. She doesn't deserve the title of a researcher!
Kamei Munehisa: Plagiarizing and deceiving... That's what she learned at the Akademiya!?
Kamei Munehisa: How can Ms. Parvaneh get scolded by such scum!?
Xudong: Chill, Mr. Kamei. This is the Akademiya. The Corps of Thirty is right down there.
Xudong: Try anything rash and we'll all get busted!
Kamei Munehisa: Hmph... If we were back in Inazuma, I'd let my blade do the talking!
Paimon: Why is everyone so angry? What's going on...
Xudong: Traveler, you couldn't have come at... a worse time...
Traveler: What's going on?
Xudong: She's over there. I'll brief you on what happened.
Xudong: Last night we went back to the inn with Parvaneh for a little chat.
Xudong: Parvaneh was suddenly called away by a man from the Akademiya, who said something went wrong with her paper and she needed to discuss it with her mentor.
Xudong: She was supposed to go alone. But we were a bit worried, so we went with her.
Xudong: We heard outside that the researcher Farzah was talking to Parvaneh...
Xudong: They started arguing, then Parvaneh came out, slammed the door, and bumped into us.
Xudong: She explained to us that her paper might have been plagiarized by Farzah to... make some deals with someone.
Xudong: We talked all night and couldn't come up with any good ideas, so today we came with her to talk to Farzah again.
Xudong: Since Mr. Kamei got really angry, we're staying here, while Julie has gone with Parvaneh.
Xudong: I could feel the tension in the air. Don't know how things are going over there...
Parvaneh: I'll never cooperate with you. I've told you that!
Nète: Miss Parvaneh, I sincerely advise you to reconsider. This kind of win-win business is hard to come by.
Parvaneh: Win-win? I'm not trying to win. I didn't write this paper to make money!
Nète: Hmph... This is not what we agreed on, Miss Farzah.
Farzah: I'm not gonna lie to you. You can get your research out to the public faster by working with Mr. Nète.
Julie: Sounds like a liar...
Julie: Stay away from Parvaneh.
Julie: Or I won't be so polite.
Nète: Hmph... Miss Farzah, I presume something's wrong with the security of the Akademiya? Since when could an Adventurer come in here and give us cheek?
Parvaneh: Julie, it's okay.
Parvaneh: Ms. Farzah, I'll never trade "Omni-Spice" for even one Mora.
Parvaneh: Since I wrote the first word of this paper, I've told you I'll provide the research results to anyone in need for free.
Farzah: *sigh* Why won't you just listen...
Nète: See, I knew it would come to this.
Nète: That's all right, Miss Parvaneh. You can rest assured I won't make it difficult for you.
Nète: Even if you don't want to work with me... We'll find another way.
Black Screen Text: Farzah and Nète take their leave...
Julie: Parvaneh, are you alright?
Parvaneh: This is bad...
Traveler: Parvaneh!
Xudong: Those two... They must've been planning this for a while.
Parvaneh: My mentor... No, Farzah's had her eyes on my spice from the start. No wonder she was always so eager to discuss my paper with me...
Parvaneh: Now she's developed a whole new project based on my paper, and made another seasoning to sell.
Traveler: What do we do?
Parvaneh: It's practically impossible for us to stop her from making an advanced "Omni-Spice"...
Xudong: Looks like there's no other choice. We can only go with my dumb idea.
Paimon: You already have an idea?
Xudong: Of course not. It took us a whole night to figure it out.
Xudong: Yes, I'm a chef... But I started out as a restaurant owner in Liyue Harbor, and I know a trick or two about running a business.
Xudong: Parvaneh briefed me with some details, and I think I know how Farzah will make money off "Omni-Spice."
Xudong: Those two misers will have to keep the spice formula to themselves if they want to make any money.
Xudong: And my stupid way is the exact opposite of their plan, and that's...
Xudong: To give the formula away to the public for free first.
Xudong: If everyone had the formula for free, few would buy it when Nète tries to sell it.
Paimon: But how do we give it to the people out there?
Xudong: Hehe, guess what the Gourmet Supremos do best? We make meals with all ingredients and spices...
Paimon: Are you saying you're going to spread the formula by making dishes with it?
Traveler: But Parvaneh's paper...
Parvaneh: It's okay...
Parvaneh: It's just some dumb paper. No worries.
Parvaneh: I had intended to give the "Omni-Spice" formula to everyone for free with my resources at the Akademiya anyway.
Parvaneh: Nothing wrong with giving the formula away in the most straightforward way.
Julie: Parvaneh...
Kamei Munehisa: Ms. Parvaneh...
Xudong: Parvaneh is indeed a true researcher at the Sumeru Akademiya. What an answer.
Xudong: Then let's do what we planned last night!
Xudong: Nète might have drummed up many to help him sell the formula. We must get ahead of him!
Xudong: Julie, please ask the Adventurers' Guild for a list of villages that demand a lot of hard labor: fishing, lumbering or hunting. As long as it takes toil!
Julie: Leave it to me!
Xudong: Mr. Kamei, please help us collect spices we are gonna need for cooking dishes.
Kamei Munehisa: I'll take care of that. Ms. Parvaneh has told me where to find Harra Fruit.
Xudong: I know I can rely on you. Traveler, could you help Mr. Kamei find Harra Fruit for us?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Xudong: We'll leave it in your hands, then.
Xudong: Parvaneh and I will go back to the inn and figure out the menu. And when you're ready, we'll meet here.
Xudong: Traveler, let me show you the rendezvous.
Xudong: Let's roll. I didn't expect to have such fun in Sumeru City. This trip really is worth my time!
Traveler: Save some meal for me.
Xudong: No problem. I'll leave the most savory one for you!
Traveler: But Parvaneh's research...
Traveler: Is there any way we can stop her?
Traveler: How can this be...
Traveler: Where's Parvaneh?

## Talk 8

Kamei Munehisa: Harra Fruit should be over there.
Kamei Munehisa: Let's split up and end this quickly.
Traveler: Sure.
Kamei Munehisa: I just noticed there are traces of monsters around.
Kamei Munehisa: We could run into monsters if we keep going. Please be careful.
Kamei Munehisa: Please rendezvous with me once you have the Harra Fruit.
Kamei Munehisa: I'll be counting on you then.

## Talk 9

Kamei Munehisa: Sorry, I haven't found any Harra Fruit... Anything on your end?

## Talk 10

Kamei Munehisa: Great. These should be enough.
Kamei Munehisa: I need to gather some other ingredients nearby. Traveler, please go back and check on Ms. Julie.

## Talk 11

Kamal: Physical labor? If I must, I'll say Vimara Village, Caravan Ribat, and Port Ormos.
Kamal: Vimara has farmers. Caravan Ribat and Port Ormos have a lot of menial laborers too.
Kamal: But why do you want to know? Got a job to offer?
Julie: A good friend of mine asked me to look into this.
Kamal: I see. Let me mark the locations on the map for you. They're all quite a way from the city, so try not to get lost.
Julie: Thank you!
Traveler: How did it go?
Julie: Thanks to this mister's help, we got the locations.
Julie: The rendezvous is not far from here, Traveler. Let's hurry.

## Talk 12

Xudong: Thank you, Mr. Kamei, the ingredients should be enough. Parvaneh and I have decided on the menu.
Xudong: We'll only need to wait for Julie to tell us where to make the meals.
Julie: We're back!
Xudong: Great. Did you get any information?
Julie: We'd better go to Vimara Village and Caravan Ribat. They are marked on the map.
Xudong: Sweet! We've got no time to waste. Let's visit Vimara Village first.

## Talk 13

Nabati: Field trip again...
Nabati: Parvaneh? Why are you here? Didn't you go back to the Akademiya to submit your paper?
Nabati: And why are there a bunch of people behind you? What is all this!?
Parvaneh: Well, it's a long story...
Black Screen Text: Parvaneh tells Nabati what happened...
Nabati: Food for marketing. That's new.
Nabati: But how could Farzah do this? It doesn't make sense. There's no news of her project being suspended, and she is getting paid as usual.
Nabati: Why are we doing business with a Fontaine guy...
Parvaneh: Anyway, this is the situation. Come and help me! Think about the tons of homework you copied from me!
Nabati: I didn't copy you! Don't forget, you referenced my outline!
Xudong: Old acquaintances we've got here...
Nabati: Hi there, I'm Nabati. I do research on the human body at Amurta.
Nabati: Though my project hasn't been approved...
Parvaneh: We went to the Akademiya together long ago, but we didn't really work together since we were studying different subjects.
Nabati: Thank god we didn't. I could've choked on your weird dishes.
Nabati: Don't stare at me like that. Let's get down to business.
Nabati: You want to make dishes that appeal to the local taste in Vimara Village, right?
Traveler: Any thoughts?
Nabati: Vimara is located in a very convenient spot. It's a key area along the waterway to Sumeru. And if you go along the waterway, you will get to Port Ormos.
Nabati: And most ships dock at Port Ormos.
Nabati: Hard labors like loading cargo and repair work are mostly done at Port Ormos.
Nabati: Over time, many people went to work there. Now only elders and kids stay at the village.
Nabati: And slackers like me, of course.
Xudong: Do you know what kind of food the folks like here?
Nabati: Hmm... Light meals I guess. And fish is a regular dish here.
Nabati: This place is so far away from the city that seasonings are hard to buy. Sometimes the dishes are incredibly bland.
Nabati: The elders couldn't tell the difference, but I just couldn't stand it...
Nabati: A peculiar guy from Fontaine did try to sell the spice you mentioned, but the residents here simply couldn't afford it...
Xudong: Hehe, then it'd be great for you to try Parvaneh's "Omni-Spice."
Xudong: Let's get back to business. Mr. Kamei, Julie, please help me set up the pot.
Xudong: Mr. Nabati, I'm now introducing to you, the amazing "Omni-Spice."
Xudong: Any dish with this "Omni-Spice" will have a delicious taste.
Xudong: If you don't believe me, you can try the "Fish With Cream Sauce" made with this "Omni-Spice."
Xudong: Traveler, please help us find some fresh fish and drop it off to Parvaneh. I'll have to go through the recipe a few more times...
Xudong: Just checked this recipe five times. Whew... Hopefully we can make it right...
Traveler: They don't seem to have any hard labors to do...

## Talk 14

Parvaneh: I must be crazy to actually do this... Ah! Traveler, did you get the ingredients?

## Talk 15

Xudong: Everything is ready... I've just checked the recipe twice more. Seven times in total. There won't be any problems.
Traveler: Did you really remember that?
Xudong: If there's a problem, I'll find a way out.
Xudong: Alright, show's on!
Black Screen Text: Xudong starts cooking...
Nabati: This is delicious! And it doesn't seem to have any special spices...
Xudong: That's what makes the "Omni-Spice" so special! It brings out the flavor in the food, giving it an amazing taste.
Xudong: More importantly, "Omni-Spice" is not difficult to make.
Nabati: How much is this "Omni-Spice"? I'd like to buy some to try.
Parvaneh: I'll give you the formula. Since you are a researcher, I'm sure you can make one on your own.
Nabati: Wait, you're just giving it to me like that? This could sell for a lot of Mora! That Fontaine peddler put a high price on the spice.
Parvaneh: And you're not happy about it? Take it, and be sure to share it with others. Don't just use it for your own food.
Nabati: Okay. Parvaneh, you are crazy...
Parvaneh: I think I am too. But it's good to be crazy once in a while.
Xudong: Anyways, the formula is in your hands. Remember to share!
Xudong: Since we can head to Port Ormos via the waterway, let's go there next.
Traveler: You sure everything will be okay?

## Talk 16

Parvaneh: We're back to Port Ormos again.
Julie: So many people here. Where do we even start?
Kamei Munehisa: How about I beat someone in a duel and then recommend the spice to them?
Parvaneh: Why do you have to beat someone in the first place...
Julie: Eh? Where did Xudong go?
Neriman: Whoa...! So many port stevedores in Liyue!
Xudong: Yeah. We got whacked every time we finish unloading.
Paimon: Since when did he start chitchatting with that guy...?
Traveler: One of Xudong's talents I guess...
Neriman: *sigh* Life's so hard. Especially when you have to cook for yourself after getting off work. I feel exhausted just thinking about it.
Xudong: Not for me. I have a special spice that can easily help me make delicious meals.
Traveler: Well that was abrupt!
Neriman: What... Are you here to peddle goods like the Fontaine guy? I don't have time for this.
Neriman: I'd rather you just give me an offer like that Fontaine vendor did. And just to be clear, I don't have much in my pocket to handle some fancy spice.
Paimon: Uh-oh! Busted!
Xudong: Wait, our spice is nothing like what the Fontaine guy was selling to you.
Xudong: We'll make a dish with the spice for you to try. For free.
Xudong: That way you'll see how good this spice is.
Neriman: This is too good to be true...
Xudong: Chefs are generous. Traveler, please help us find two Potatoes and drop them off to Parvaneh.
Xudong: Hmm... Let me think about making a "Potato Boat" for this mister.

## Talk 17

Parvaneh: Here he goes again... Traveler, did you get the ingredients?

## Talk 18

Xudong: That should do. Let me heat the pot up...
Black Screen Text: Xudong starts cooking...
Neriman: Finished already? Where's the spicing?
Xudong: Like I said, with this "Omni-Spice," any dish can become a delicious one.
Neriman: This must cost a pile of Mora. The Fontaine peddler put a high price on his spice, too...
Xudong: Here, this is the formula of "Omni-Spice." It's easy to prepare. You can make some back at home.
Neriman: Wh—What do you mean? You don't want my Mora?
Parvaneh: We want nothing from you. Instead, we kindly ask you to share this formula to the public.
Xudong: Well, you got it for free. It'd be nice to give it to others as a free favor, wouldn't it?
Neriman: That makes sense... Thanks.
Paimon: Xudong's got quite a way with words. Paimon didn't see that before...
Xudong: That's one of the skills a chef must master. You can't take care of customers of all kinds without a silver tongue, can you?
Traveler: It's so hard to be a chef at Liyue Harbor!
Xudong: Okay. Our final stop would be "Caravan Ribat."
Xudong: Parvaneh said she knows Maryam, owner of Gilded Journey. And she told her about our spice marketing.
Xudong: Let's hope it goes well this time, too.

## Talk 19

Maryam: You're finally back. I thought you'd give up halfway through.
Maryam: I heard it from Parvaneh. You tried to give the spice away for free in response to that Fontaine guy?
Maryam: What a stupid idea for an Akademiya researcher.
Parvaneh: Ahem...
Xudong: Sorry, the idea came from me. I'm a chef.
Maryam: Hmm... Since I know Parvaneh, I can help you promote this "Omni-Spice."
Maryam: You must have been tired after all the work.
Maryam: Hey chef, the ingredients are all ready in the kitchen, and there's a fire and a pot outside. You can cook something anytime.
Maryam: And take a good rest when you're done. The lady researcher must be tired even if you are not.
Xudong: I dare not refuse it.
Xudong: Traveler, could you please help me gather some Padisarahs? It's certainly been a long day for everyone, and I wanna prepare a fine meal to treat everybody.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Xudong: I'll prepare the rest of the ingredients. When you get the Padisarahs, please give them to Parvaneh. Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: How are you holding up?
Xudong: No worries. It was way more exhausting back when I was making banquets back in Liyue.

## Talk 20

Parvaneh: It's great Miss Maryam is willing to help... Traveler, did you get the Padisarahs?

## Talk 21

Xudong: That should be enough. I'll take care of it. It won't be long.
Black Screen Text: Xudong starts cooking...
Julie: Ah, that smells good! What did you make?
Xudong: This is "Tandoori Roast Chicken." It sounds weird, but does have a good taste.
Parvaneh: When did you learn to cook this? I've never seen you do that before.
Xudong: Flicked through the recipe yesterday. It's in my mind now.
Kamei Munehisa: You are such an exceptional chef, Mr. Xudong...
Parvaneh: I might have been able to speed up my research if I'd known you sooner...
Parvaneh: That Nète guy... seems to be exactly where we're going, and he's always one step ahead of us.
Parvaneh: He didn't seem to be able to sell any spice... But why has he been keeping pace with us?
Julie: I don't have a good feeling about that Nète guy...
Maryam: I guess you're well rested. Take this letter. That Nète guy from Fontaine asked me to give it to you.
Traveler: He's here?
Maryam: The guy's left. He paid me to prepare the ingredients and wait for you to come.
Maryam: He told me to give you the letter after you have rested.
Maryam: Sorry for not telling you this. But he paid a lot.
Xudong: Parvaneh, what does it say?
Parvaneh: ...Bunch of sentimental crap. He said he has business to talk about with us at the Akademiya.
Kamei Munehisa: Hmph, I guess that scum's had enough and is appealing to arms?
Parvaneh: It would actually be better if that was the case...
Xudong: Well, if Nète said so. We're so going there for a meet-up.
Xudong: Traveler, could you come with us for another trip?
Traveler: Sure.
Xudong: Hehe, I'll be looking forward to it, then.
Xudong: Then let's get going. Time to see what this guy wants.
Traveler: I'll teach him a lesson.
Traveler: When did he give it to you?

## Talk 22

Nète: Welcome! Welcome, everyone. I've been waiting for you.
Julie: What are you up to? Stay away!
Nète: Easy, Miss Adventurer. I don't wish to fight you, nor do I have the ability to.
Nète: Your plan has worked. Your free spice is taking over the market. It'll be even harder for me to promote a new spice.
Nète: You've won this one. Please go easy on this poor businessman.
Kamei Munehisa: You're lying through your teeth... I have never met a man more loathsome than you.
Nète: Hahaha! It seems like you haven't dealt with many businessmen, then.
Parvaneh: You are not with Farzah?
Nète: She might be working on her new formula. Locked herself in her room and won't come out... But to be honest, I don't really care about this.
Nète: You know, I did tons of work just to skirt around some boring clauses... And she wouldn't even get down from her high horse as a researcher. I also had to find resources to promote her spice because she refused to do it herself.
Nète: I was wrong. She's not the right pick for a business partner.
Nète: But now I think you're perfect for business.
Nète: You have plans and are willing to get your hands dirty. Plus, you have pretty decent skills.
Traveler: Are you here to cause trouble?
Nète: Relax, I just want to ask... Are there any opportunities for me to invest in you?
Traveler: What?
Parvaneh: Do you know what you're talking about?
Kamei Munehisa: You are so unpredictable.
Julie: Hmph. Liar.
Xudong: Are you serious?
Nète: Of course I am. What makes you think I'm not?
Nète: Your spice formula is taking root on the market, enjoying popularity and reputation among consumers.
Nète: The formula Ms. Farzah is making will be of higher quality, but it's somewhat difficult to promote.
Nète: And I know you are not willing to cooperate with her.
Nète: So here's my offer: I'll invest in your spice and organize resources for the business.
Nète: Part of the profits I made from Ms. Farzah's formula will be used to promote your formula for free, and the rest of the profits... will be all yours.
Nète: You don't have to pay a single Mora. You just need to put my "trademark" on the back of your formula.
Nète: What do you say?
Parvaneh: I say no. I've told you before. I don't want anything to do with you.
Parvaneh: And why would you even want to invest in our formula? Ms. Farzah is a more experienced researcher who has way more resources than me.
Nète: Experiences, resources... Those can be improved in many ways.
Nète: But you cannot build your word of mouth like that overnight, hehe...
Nète: Huh, I think I've said too much. Well, I guess that's it for today. I have to go back and see if Ms. Farzah is starving in her lab.
Nète: I will stay in Sumeru for some time. I sincerely look forward to working with you one day. So long.
Black Screen Text: Nète leaves...
Julie: I'm so sick of him...
Kamei Munehisa: He could be more tricky than monsters...
Xudong: Farzah, Nète... I guess the whole thing is not as simple as we had hoped for.
Xudong: Looks like we won't be able to leave Sumeru for now. We must look into this.
Parvaneh: *sigh* I just wanted to do my research. Why did I get into this mess...
Xudong: Haha, it is what it is. A restaurant must be cleaned before it can be opened to customers.
Xudong: Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Xudong: Traveler, looks like we're gonna team up again. We might still need your help in the future.
Traveler: Sure.
Xudong: That's the spirit!
Xudong: But... What is this Nète plotting...?
Traveler: As long as there's free meals.
Traveler: What are you trying to do?
