Traveler: About Kaeya and Diluc
Paimon: Strange...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Paimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?
Traveler: How are they alike, again?
Paimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...
Paimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!
Paimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?
Traveler: Uhh... I still don't see it.
