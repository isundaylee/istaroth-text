Ernest: Huh? Where did you come from? What do you want with me?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Ernest: I'm the cellar manager here. Occasionally I oversee stock transportation.
Ernest: The role isn't stressful, and the boss is extravagant â€” he pays me quite well.
Ernest: Even without all that, just being in the company of this priceless stash is amazing.
Ernest: Just think of how few people ever get a chance to even see such magnificence, let alone work with it.

## Talk

Traveler: What's over there?
Ernest: The wine cellar. What would I be doing here otherwise?
Ernest: Let me tell you, don't get any ideas about this wine here...
Ernest: You'd never have the chance to put them into action anyway...
Ernest: No, no. It's nothing.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ernest: Off you go then. Take care now.
