Traveler: How have things been lately?
Hiiragi Chisato: Thanks to you, I'm doing very well.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you for delivering the letter for me earlier! You know, it's very difficult for Kamaji and I to write to each other due to our respective positions.
Hiiragi Chisato: I believe that he must be very busy with the Kujou Clan's affairs. I don't want to bother him too often... Eh? He said that he wanted to visit me personally?
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah... I don't think it would be possible based on the bad blood between our clans. Still... I'm very glad to know that he'd do that for me.
Hiiragi Chisato: If it wasn't for you, we'd probably have been unable to reach out to each other for a long while. I'm most grateful to you.
