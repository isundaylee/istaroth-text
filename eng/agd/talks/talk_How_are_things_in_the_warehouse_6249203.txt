Traveler: How are things in the warehouse?
Jin: Same old. The tea leaves that meet our standards are sent to the warehouse, where they're first categorized by type. Leaves are then divided into top, medium, and bottom quality by type, and each quality is further divided into tiers A, B, and C. They are then labeled accordingly, and their locations on the shelf and the time at which they were placed in the warehouse are recorded...
Jin: When the merchants come, we take the leaves out of the warehouse, occasionally picking some to make aged teabricks...
Jin: I know the warehouse rules like the back of my hand, and I'm passable at identifying good and bad tea. But Uncle Luo always worries when I'm working on my own. When there's a large batch to be warehoused or shipped, he always comes down to watch the process.
Jin: I wish he'd just trust me for once, you know?
