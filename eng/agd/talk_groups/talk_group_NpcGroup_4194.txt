Arapas: The soup using Vanarana water, tastes almost the same with that using "Living Spring"...

## Talk

Traveler: They are both nice water, after all.
Arapas: #Well said, Nara Traveler. Nara Traveler, so smart, as if you have been drinking Vanarana water all the time.
Arapas: #This time, soup using Vanarana water for Nara Traveler. Next time, I will find nicer water.

## Talk

Traveler: The taste is key...
Arapas: The taste... Hmm...
Arapas: #I heard that follow the running river and you find a big area of water with strong scent. Nara Traveler wants soup with that water?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arapas: #Bye, hope Nara Traveler will always have delicious water to drink.

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds much too strong...
Arapas: #Really? Nara Traveler, so strange. You said water with scent is delicious, but you hate water with too much scent.
Arapas: Guess clear water is better for soup.

## Talk

Arapas: The soup at Festival Utsava... Very "shocking." So I am going to look for nicer water in the north.

## Talk

Traveler: The north?
Arapas: I heard that there is Vana's river source's source in the north. The water there is clearer than moonlight. A pot filled with that water looks as if is holding nothing but air.
Arapas: #Soup cooked with that water, will make Nara Traveler and Aranara happy. I am sure.
Arapas: So, in my "special cooking training," I will follow the direction that tree shadows point to, and find nicer water than Vanarana water.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arapas: #Hope to see Nara Traveler in the north.

## Talk

Arapas: Vanarana water is nice. But I heard, in the north, there is sweeter and clearer water...
