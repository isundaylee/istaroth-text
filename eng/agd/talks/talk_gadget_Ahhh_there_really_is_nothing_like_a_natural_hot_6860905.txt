Visitor's Message: "Ahhh, there really is nothing like a natural hot spring!"
Visitor's Message: "The tingly wingly sensation of a steady stream of bubbles against your body â€” it defies description!"
Visitor's Message: "It would be ideal if we could put up some more signs showing the exact temperatures of each hot spring, so guests could choose the ones that suit them best..."
Manager's Reply: "Dear visitor, many thanks for your valuable suggestion. In line with our usual practice, we will first observe how the Koholasaur youngsters react before deciding if the water temperature is suitable for our foreign visitors."
Manager's Reply: "Thanks to your suggestion, we'll make it our aim to ensure that a little Koholasaur is stationed in each hot spring in the future!"
