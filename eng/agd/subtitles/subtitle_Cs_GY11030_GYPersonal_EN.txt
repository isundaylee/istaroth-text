Most benevolent among all adepti are the Qilin
They drink only spring water and eat only whole grain
But perhaps the mountainous dwellings of adepti in Jueyun Karst
Might be too lonely for her human side
Under moonlight did one see her last
She stood by the precipice's edge
And upon the mist-veiled mountains she gazed
Her thin figure was immersed
In the vast sea of clouds
One noticed her loneliness
And sought to convince her to go back to the human world
But
Just then
She said thus:
"Liyue Harbor feels"
"Even lonelier than Jueyun Karst"
"When I look at the sea of clouds in Jueyun Karst"
"I merely feel the loneliness of a solitary cloud gazer"
"When I step into the sea of people in Liyue"
"I feel the loneliness of an inhuman"
"That doesn't belong in the human world"
