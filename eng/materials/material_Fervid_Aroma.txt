All one would then need was some friends for company and a few jugs of fine wine, and this would be the perfect dining experience.
For those who travel together often, barbecue places are perfect when considering the number of seats and amount of food needed. As for those who move alone, the raucous atmosphere of such establishments allows them to conceal their movements, alongside providing safe conditions for observing, tracking, or even plotting.
