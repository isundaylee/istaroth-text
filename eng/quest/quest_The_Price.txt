# The Price


## Talk 1

Przheva: ...Did you close that deal?
Alexandra: The old cargo ship has just been unloaded. Don't worry.
Przheva: The ship didn't leak, right? And about <color=#00E1FFFF>the cargo...</color> All hidden?
Alexandra: Yes, all hidden somewhere safe and secret.
Alexandra: But... what about the old stuff that have been replaced?
Przheva: Just throw them away. With the new cargo in hand, the old stuff is of no use.
Alexandra: I—Is that okay?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ooh! The box is open! It's surprisingly easy.
Traveler: Let me see...
Paimon: Umm, anyway... Let's see what it has first.
Paimon: Looks like... there're only some worn clothes and a stack of letters.
Paimon: It says...
Paimon: "To the south of Devantaka Mountain, the old ship leaves port."
Paimon: What does that mean? How can there be a ship in the mountain?
Traveler: Maybe it's some kind of code...
Paimon: Well... we'll just have to figure it out.
Traveler: The Fatui must be plotting something.
Traveler: The box could have something to do with those two Fatui...

## Talk 3

Paimon: The south of Devantaka Mountain... That's a huge area.
Paimon: The view is good here. Let's wait and see if there's anyone coming.
Black Screen Text: You wait here with Paimon...
Paimon: Look... Somebody's coming this way!
Przheva: Why are you so late? Did you run into any trouble?
Alexandra: ...Sorry, someone must have opened the box. I'm afraid our plan...
Przheva: Tsk, did we get caught? But... it's not like the higher-ups have sent anyone here lately...
Alexandra: Maybe... Maybe it was Nika? Those kids have been badgering me to take them out to play...
Przheva: *sigh*... That's why I told you not to get too close to those folks, unless necessary.
Alexandra: But their parents are always away from home, I just...
Przheva: Forget it. Either way, we're leaving here today.
Paimon: Leaving? Do they mean... leaving Sumeru?
Alexandra: We don't have any helpers. Can the plan... work? I mean, what if the higher-ups found out about us...
Przheva: Stop worrying... Haven't you had enough yet?
Przheva: Living in fear, never to be trusted for a single second...
Przheva: Today is our last chance to get away from the Fatui!
Alexandra: I—I know, but...
Paimon: These two... want to leave the Fatui?
Traveler: I'll go have a look.
Paimon: Okay. But be careful. They are the Fatui after all!

## Talk 4

Przheva: Hehe, someone has shown up after all.
Traveler: You found me?
Przheva: You've been eavesdropping for a while without moving.
Przheva: As the wind blew just now, the bush you were hiding in swayed differently from the one next to it.
Paimon: Y—You Fatui really are something...
Przheva: #{M#Blond}{F#Blonde} hair... and a strange Seelie. You must be the "Traveler" mentioned in the report.
Traveler: That's right.
Przheva: Since you're here, I assume you have checked the stuff in the box.
Przheva: I'm surprised that Alexandra's trick actually worked.
Traveler: What do you want?
Przheva: As you heard, Alexandra and I want to get away from the Fatui.
Przheva: Stop looking at me like that. For your information, we're neither higher-ups in power nor front-line soldiers.
Przheva: We are at best some pawns left in a random place waiting to be deployed.
Przheva: There are plenty of people like us, but... most of them won't get any orders all their lives.
Przheva: Being a Fatuus, one could only spend the rest of their life in the distrust from others.
Przheva: We don't want to end up like that. Instead of wasting life here, we'd rather take the risk and free ourselves from the Fatui.
Alexandra: But getting away is far from easy. If we get caught, there will be... serious consequences.
Alexandra: So we thought up a plan to fake death in an attempt to escape.
Alexandra: But our "death" must be proved by someone who is convincing.
Przheva: Traveler, you are such a notorious figure for the Fatui, and... Hehe, you've always been at odds with the Fatui.
Przheva: You are the ideal witness to the death of two Fatui.
Traveler: What made you so sure that I would come here?
Przheva: I wasn't sure whether you would come, but I would wait until you come.
Przheva: Patience is one of the few strengths I have.
Przheva: Traveler, now that we've told you the whole story, it's your choice if you want to help.
Przheva: If your answer is yes, we'll give you a handsome amount of rewards in return.
Alexandra: And don't worry, the money is earned by doing serious work. I can assure you!
Alexandra: I... I cooked dinner for those kids, sewed clothes, told stories, and took them out...
Alexandra: And Przheva helped others with hunting and handling prey...
Alexandra: If we manage to leave the Fatui, we will make a living out of these skills! And...
Przheva: Enough, Alexandra! That's too much information!
Alexandra: Oh... right! Okay...
Przheva: Anyway, it's all up to you, Traveler.
Traveler: I'll help.
Przheva: Thank you, Traveler. You will get rich rewards.
Przheva: Then it's a deal. Now let's go separate ways and get ready.
Przheva: Alexandra, you go take care of that.
Przheva: And Traveler, please follow me.
Traveler: Aren't you afraid I'd back out?
Przheva: Then we'll fight as hard as we can, and in the end... die at your hands.
Przheva: It sounds much like our original plan, right?
Traveler: You'd better have enough money.
Przheva: Of course, it'll be a very generous amount.
Traveler: What if I hadn't come here today...
Przheva: Then we would go back and suspend the plan until you come.
Przheva: We've been planning this for so long. It wouldn't hurt to wait a bit longer.
Traveler: So you said all those things just for me to hear?
Traveler: Did you set this trap for me?
Przheva: Relax. We wouldn't have had time for that.

## Talk 5

Przheva: This is the place, Traveler. Listen, it's a simple plan.
Przheva: We are two... ahem, evil Fatui coming over to this forest for some evildoing.
Przheva: And you, out of indignation or righteousness, try to stop us.
Przheva: Just as Alexandra and I are about to run, a group of monsters appears and strikes us down.
Przheva: Being outnumbered by the monsters, you have no choice but to pull back. When you are back with helpers, Alexandra and I are already gone.
Przheva: That's the plan. What do you think?
Traveler: Well crafted, I have to say.
Przheva: For the story to make sense and our failure to seem more natural, I've put a lot of thought into it.
Przheva: But why hasn't Alexandra returned by now? Just setting up some lures for monsters doesn't take that long.
Nika: Alexandra! Alexandra! *sob*...
Paimon: Wait, Paimon heard someone over there!
Przheva: Shoot! Alexandra must be in trouble!
Paimon: Hey! Wait! Where are you going!?
Traveler: Let's follow!
Paimon: What happened...
Traveler: Just sounds like how the Fatui would end up.
Przheva: Right. The pawns in the Fatui out there collecting intel normally end up like this.
Przheva: We made this plan just because we don't want to be one of them.

## Talk 6

Alexandra: Sorry... ahem... Przheva...
Przheva: Don't talk. I'll patch you up.
Nika: *sobbing*... I'm sorry...
Traveler: Why are you here?
Nika: I'm... I'm here to pick mushrooms... *sob*...
Nika: Alexandra... looks so sad these days...
Nika: So we talked about cooking something great to surprise her.
Nika: Alexandra once took us here and picked all those delicious mushrooms, and I thought I'd pick some myself.
Nika: B—But I got lost in the woods, and before I knew it, I was surrounded by so many mushrooms.
Nika: To save me, Alexandra... Alexandra... *sob*
Alexandra: *cough*... It's... It's okay, Nika... I'm fine...
Przheva: ...Looks like there's a change of the plan.
Przheva: Alexandra sustained serious injuries, and other Fatui must have noticed that we left the town without permission. If I take her back now, we will only get arrested for inspection.
Traveler: Then what about your plan...
Przheva: Hehe... Just go along with it and see what will happen.
Przheva: I happened to see a group of the Eremites heading this way on my way here.
Przheva: Traveler, you send the kid off the forest to the Eremites. I will take Alexandra and leave.
Przheva: ...
Przheva: Remember our plan? Looks like now we have to do it for real.
Przheva: The Eremites must think that two evil Fatui are doing something evil here, and that saving Nika is just a cover-up.
Przheva: If we come under attack by the monsters... well, it serves us right.
Nika: *sob*... Alexandra... I will never make any trouble again...
Przheva: ...Good thing this kid didn't have the mood to listen to what we just said. No need to worry about him.
Traveler: But what you did was for saving the kid...
Przheva: Trust me, few would believe in "the Fatui's heroic sacrifice."
Przheva: "The evil Fatui eating their own bitter fruit" is much more acceptable.
Przheva: Remember the place where you eavesdropped on Alexandra and me for the first time? If... we manage to get away, I will leave a letter there.
Traveler: So you knew from the beginning...
Przheva: With only one chance, we have to be careful.
Traveler: We should save Alexandra first!
Alexandra: I'm fine, Traveler... Ahem... I can take it...
Alexandra: ...But if we miss this chance to get out of the Fatui, I'd rather... ahem, *coughing*!!
Nika: Alexandra, where are you going? Please come back with us! Everyone is looking for you!
Alexandra: Listen, Nika... The Traveler will take you back... ahem...
Alexandra: I'm... gonna take a rest here. I will be back if I'm feeling any better...
Nika: B—But...
Alexandra: When did I ever lie to you? Ahem... Just be a good boy, will you?
Nika: *whimper*... Okay...
Alexandra: Traveler, please take good care of him...
Traveler: I'll be right back.
Przheva: Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: But you are not evil...
Traveler: Then what do you do now?

## Talk 7

Berat: I didn't know this errand could take that long... how exhausting...
Berat: Wait! Who's there!
Berat: Nika... and Traveler, what are you doing here?
Traveler: Please take care of Nika!
Paimon: W—We are running out of time! Please watch Nika for a while!
Berat: What? What did you mean? Wait a moment!
Traveler: Someone's under attack over there!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Alexandra should be around here. Where... Where are they?
Traveler: Alexandra!
Paimon: Where are you!
Berat: Stop shouting! You will only attract the monsters!
Berat: Nika told me the whole story. I'm so surprised that Alexandra and Przheva are Fatui members.
Berat: I thought they were good folks when dealing with them...
Nika: Alexandra is a good person! Przheva is tough... but also a good person!
Berat: Umm, but they are Fatui! Who knows if they are just acting nice but actually with ulterior motives?
Berat: I mean, I've heard plenty of shady deals of the Fatui.
Berat: Maybe they were just scheming something and using saving Nika as a cover-up?
Traveler: They...
Berat: You don't know about that. And it's not like we can find them...
Berat: One of them is wounded... so according to my experience, the monsters must have... well...
Nika: Berat! Could you keep looking? Please!!
Berat: Nika, if I wasn't here alone, I promise I would search the whole forest out.
Berat: But there's only me here. The monsters are one thing, and what if there're other Fatui here...
Berat: Ahem, anyway... Traveler, I say we go back to the city first. I'll report this to my superior and follow his order.
Black Screen Text: Berat takes Nika and leaves...
Paimon: His response is just as Przheva expected...
Paimon: But did they... manage to get away?
Paimon: There's not much we can do now. Let's head back.
Paimon: Przheva said if they managed to leave, they would leave a letter at the place where they were.
Paimon: Let's go take a look if we have time.
Traveler: They... are not bad...
Traveler: Przheva!

### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: There're some... worn clothes and a stack of letters.
Traveler: What does the letter say?
Paimon: Let Paimon see...
Paimon: It says "To the south of Devantaka Mountain, the old ship leaves port."
Paimon: What does that mean? How can there be a ship in the mountain?
Traveler: Maybe it's the clue to some treasures.
Paimon: And we don't know who left the box here.
Paimon: Anyway, let's go take a look!
Traveler: Maybe it leads to a treasure trove.
