Traveler: Why did you come to Ritou?
Tiger Li: Because of my big brother! He's a great businessman!
Tiger Li: I heard from my parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
Tiger Li: He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I also left home and snuck in here with him.
Tiger Li: I really miss my mom, but my brother's still here, so I've gotta stick it out here!
