# Dinner of Judgment

Rosaria's specialty. The seemingly dark thorns make it hard to know how to begin tucking in. After some effort, you manage to clear the ornamentation away... and to your surprise, the first taste of the tender chicken unveils a shockingly lovely taste. As Rosaria studies your reaction, she seems pleased.
