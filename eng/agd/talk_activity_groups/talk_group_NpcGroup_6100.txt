## Talk

Wayna: Greetings, friend. I hope you've been holding up well.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Wayna: I am the chief of the Scions of the Canopy. You may call me Wayna.
Wayna: Some people like to call me "Uncle Wayna," but please don't follow their example. Seriously, I'm not that old.
Wayna: To me, "maturity" is more like a fashion style.
Wayna: All it means is that I have the most adventuring experience out of everyone in the tribe. It's got nothing to do with my real age. Understand?

## Talk

Traveler: I trust you've been well?
Wayna: Of course, of course. Everything here has been going fine.
Wayna: What about you? Thinking about taking some risks again?
Wayna: I'd consider everything you've done to be quite risky, you know. Going to the Night Kingdom, and breaking Citlali's Spiritspeaker Stone... In my opinion, both of those are extremely important yet risky endeavors.
Wayna: It's good to have the spirit of adventure, but it can also be a double-edged sword. I know you won't like to hear this, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit more careful.

## Talk

Traveler: You too, see you later.
Wayna: Farewell for now, my friend.

## Talk

Traveler: About fighting the Abyss...
Wayna: Ah, well... I suppose it's not going too badly.
Wayna: If war with the Abyss was seen as just another type of extreme sport, then there'd be nothing about it that we Scions of the Canopy couldn't handle.
Wayna: Just like jumping off a cliff — some would jump straight back, others land safely, while others might fly off to even farther places.
Wayna: Every outcome has a value of its own, and thus, deserves to be remembered.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Abyss...
Wayna: Haha! Our old enemy's gone all quiet now.
Wayna: Our long battle with the Abyss has been like an extreme sport marathon, but there's nothing that the Scions of the Canopy can't overcome.
Wayna: Like with cliff-jumping, some come straight back up, others land safely, and still others fly off to yet farther places.
Wayna: Every outcome has a value of its own, and thus, deserves to be remembered.

## Talk

Traveler: Don't worry about me. I'm pretty amazing.
Wayna: Haha, confidence. I like it!
Wayna: I've heard about you — the outlander who can use phlogiston. That's more than just pretty amazing, if I do say so myself.
Wayna: In that case, these should be useful to you, right? Take 'em — and no need to be polite about it.
