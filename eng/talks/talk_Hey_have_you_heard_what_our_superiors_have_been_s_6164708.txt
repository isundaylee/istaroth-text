Mikhail: Hey, have you heard what our superiors have been saying? Inazuma, long under the Sakoku Decree, has become an open country again!
Lyudmila: What? Did they seriously abolish it?
Lyudmila: First the Vision Hunt Decree, and now the Sakoku Decree... These were both the direct decrees of the Electro Archon. Is she preparing to do something big soon?
Lyudmila: Oh no. If the Electro Archon plans to involve herself in external affairs again, won't this affect our influence over Teyvat?
Mikhail: Oh, come on, you're being such a worrywart.
Mikhail: With Her Majesty the Tsaritsa on our side, Snezhnaya's eternal greatness is assured! There's absolutely no reason for us to worry!
Mikhail: In fact, I'd say that Inazuma opening up is instead a great opportunity for us Fatui to expand our strength there.
Mikhail: Indeed, everything that's happening is well within our control!
Lyudmila: Well, I sure hope you're right...
