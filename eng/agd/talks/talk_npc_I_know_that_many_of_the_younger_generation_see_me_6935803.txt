Faruzan: I know that many of the younger generation see me as a sort of legendary figure. Why, my stories and my accomplishments can even be found in Kshahrewar textbooks.
Faruzan: But it does seem that people aren't quite used to having a legend living among them. No one takes my courses, or pays attention to my research... Even securing research funding can be a struggle...
Faruzan: If I was lucky enough to have one of my predecessors here in the flesh, I'd be waiting on her hand and foot! Serving her tea, massaging her shoulders, asking her all sorts of questions... *sigh* What happened to this generation? Where is their inquisitiveness, where is their respect?
