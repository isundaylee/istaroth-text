A lively, energetic fish famous for its petal-shaped tail.
Most such creatures lived out their lives peacefully as ornamental fish. But when it was discovered that their meat was flavorful, less bony, and very fatty, they would also come to find themselves carefully prepared and served up on meal tables.

## Glaze Medaka

A lively, energetic fish famous for its petal-shaped tail.
This species has inscrutable behavioral patterns, and they can often be seen bursting into struggling fits out of the blue, as if bearing some sort of unseen pain. This phenomenon, however, does not occur at all when they are alone. Some researchers believe that this peculiarity stems from their natural desire to perform.

## Sweet-Flower Medaka

A lively, energetic fish famous for its petal-shaped tail.
It might be because this fish has a sweet tooth, but every bone in its body seems to serve as an antenna to seek out sweet treats. Following this absolute ideology, they swim through every creek and river in Teyvat in search of tasty sweets. True egalitarians, they will never reject any morsel, and certainly not because there's a hook attached. Have bait, will bite, as they say.
Beginner friendly.

## Aizen Medaka

A lively, energetic fish famous for its petal-shaped tail.
Long ago, there was a funny story that said that you could get Aizen Medaka by throwing normal Medaka into a pot of blue dye. This was most likely born from a child's over-active imagination, but has nonetheless given rise to not a few unscrupulous fish hawkers. This in turn has given rise to some conversations that go something like "Hey, is it just me, or is the blue on your fish washing off?" In response, the Ministry of Civil Affairs specifically posted this notice: "The market is a wet and wild place. Beware of influxes of blue fish."

## Dawncatcher

A rare species of Medaka that has a brilliant sheen. It seems like a variant species of the normal Medaka, but it has a very different appearance and living habits.
There is a rumor that these fish have the mystical ability to predict the weather. If they leap out of the water to catch the dawn's first light as it pierces the skies, then there will surely be a fine, sunny day to come.

## Crystalfish

A rare Medaka that glitters like crystal. Its patterns are very intricate indeed, to the point where it is often called the "Medaka Aesthete."
Some merchants will claim that these Medaka will lay a crystal pearl under certain extreme conditions and that this pearl is both an item of great price and a sign of quality. This has made these fish very sought after by people from all walks of life and caused their market value to soar. However, this is just amusing to the fishermen, who know the inside story: That object is merely a Loach Pearl that the fish ate by mistake. It rolled into the fish's salty intestines, only to spat back out of the mouths of merchants with an agenda. Some grounds for a price hike that is!

## Lunged Stickleback

A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames "The Cutter" and "Hard-To-Get."
Unlike others of its kind, the lunged stickleback can live in dried, muddy pools for a long time. Other than its gills, it can also breathe through its vestigial scales, which is a feature much more similar to that of amphibians. As such, apart from dealing with uninvited anglers, it also has to deal with an academic vote of no confidence in it still being a stickleback.

## Betta

A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames "The Cutter" and "Hard-To-Get."
Among sticklebacks, this sort would either count as the proudest, or a rather close second place. They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse. A hobbyist once observed one such specimen charging at waving seagrass, as if such flagrant dancing was some major provocation against the stickleback king or something.
"If you encounter one underwater, do not look it in the eyes." â€” Angler's Atlas, Betta Chapter

## Venomspine Fish

A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames "The Cutter" and "Hard-To-Get."
The Venomspine Fish's most well-known trait is its poisonous spines, which contain a neurotoxin that is fatal to smaller prey but proves far weaker against large organisms, mostly only causing mild confusion or hallucinations.
"Fill 'er up, Rex, my good lad! Fill 'er up to the brim for big brother!" â€” A certain fisherman from Liyue who was accidentally pricked.

## Akai Maou

A stickleback with a fierce appearance and a manner to match. It will fight anyone and anything under the sea for food â€” a veritable and much-feared robber in red. Its fiery-red coloration seems to have much to do with Pyro, for while they cannot quite become flame generators, they do have some control over high temperatures. They can convert energy from their food and focus it on their dangerous snouts, making them underwater scoundrels indeed.
"Need to drill wood to make a flame? This is your best friend." â€” Angler's Atlas, Akai Maou Chapter

## Snowstrider

A rare stickleback that only dwells in snowy, mountainous regions. It is quite possibly due to this that it has a much cooler temperament as compared to other sticklebacks. This species has an unusually great love for the bitter cold, almost as if they were parent and child. Though they can live in warmer waters, but any removal from such conditions is like striking a spiritual blow to them, and they will become depressed and refuse to multiply.
"Not a recommended catch." â€” Angler's Atlas, Snowstrider Chapter

## Golden Koi

A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.
With the horn on its head and its scaleless form clad as if in golden armor, it looks every bit like a king underwater. In truth, its bloodline and behavior could not be more different from that of a dragon â€” it can neither call forth the wind and rain nor the power of domination and is actually often the victim of food-snatching due to its weak character. A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic. As such, it lost the nickname "Descendant of Dragons," and is now termed the "False Dragon" instead.

## Rusty Koi

A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.
This is a variant species of Koi, and is sometimes termed the "awakened dragon" amongst them. In stark contrast to its rather shabby appearance, the Rusty Koi has shed its opulent gold tabard in exchange for a hard armor of rusty bronze. Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory. In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea monsters and has thus been given the nickname "Ironbone Dragon" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization.

## Brown Shirakodai

A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname "Queen of the Waters."
Earthen-colored patterns run across its body, and its temper is also as steady as stone. They can go a bit overboard, however, and will sometimes lie at the bottom and not move an inch, just like a rock, leading some buyers to think that they've bought some hopelessly moribund old fish.

## Purple Shirakodai

A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname "Queen of the Waters."
Lovely purple patterns run across its body, and they love to swim together in schools to fend off natural dangers and predators. But once this quirk of theirs was grasped by seasoned fisherpeople, they realized that all one needed to do was to lure a single fish into the trap, and all the rest would follow.

## Tea-Colored Shirakodai

A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname "Queen of the Waters."
Tea-colored patterns swirl around this inquisitive fish that seems strongly interested in everything around it. Unfortunately, its method of expressing interest in anything is to have a nibble to see if it can be eaten. This isn't a malicious move by any means, but it has landed this species in hot water many times all the same.

## Abiding Angelfish

A rare and valuable butterflyfish variant from Liyue. At present, it can only be found near water bodies around the abodes of the adepti. Its pale white lines are very striking, and it has greater longevity than other members of the species and is thus regarded to be a lucky fish blessed by the adepti.
Most people from Liyue will refuse to eat this fish on principle, given the common respect for the adepti, but some fear no such superstition and claim that eating these fish can help one extend one's years.

## Raimei Angelfish

A rare and valuable butterflyfish variant from Inazuma. It loves water bodies suffused with Electro, and seems to derive joy from electric currents.
It is said that these fish were once from the same line as the Abiding Angelfish of Liyue, until traveling merchants exported them to Inazuma. There, their behavioral patterns underwent an unexpected shift. At present, some researchers have begun to use them in conjunction with Electro Slimes for experiments.
"Ma... Mah... Mah tung ith numm..." â€” A certain greedy gourmet after trying a Raimei Angelfish dish.

## Pufferfish

Round and short pelvic fins, a plump body, and a plain face make up most people's first impression of the pufferfish. This is by and large an accurate assessment of its character as well: dull, slow, and lazy. However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique â€” this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannon from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it. Truly, it is a first-rate killer in the water.
"Pufferfish ahead? Watch for spittle!" â€” Angler's Atlas, Pufferfish Chapter

## Bitter Pufferfish

A rare pufferfish variant. As the name suggests, this creature spreads bitterness wherever it goes in the underwater world. Its water cannon projectiles are slower and smaller than those of its ordinary counterparts, but the power of such attacks is undiminished due to the incredibly bitter pheromones within. During their courtship phase, an observer might bear witness to the curious sight of males and females of this species blasting each other with these water cannons. Perhaps passing on the bitterness of life is also a manifestation of love.

## Divda Ray

A strange cartilaginous fish that was once thought to be a fantastical creature, only recorded in some ancient scrolls of art on Watatsumi Island. As the seal over Enkanomiya was opened, their true forms were laid bare before the eyes of all.
It is said that the bodily forms of these curious creatures will change color as time passes. When they are young, they are as gold as sunlight. Rays at this stage of life earned the name "Divda" in those ancient scrolls, which means "the tail end of innocence."

## Formalo Ray

A strange cartilaginous fish that was once thought to be a fantastical creature, only recorded in some ancient scrolls of art on Watatsumi Island. As the seal over Enkanomiya was opened, their true forms were laid bare before the eyes of all.
It is said that the bodily forms of these curious creatures will change color as time passes. When they are young, they are as gold as sunlight. Later in life, however, their colors deepen, and their two 'wings' will be colored with a purple as deep as the night. Rays at this stage of life earned the name "Formalo" in those ancient scrolls, which means "the maw of greed."

## True Fruit Angler

Medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm them. 
Specimens with a greenish tint are the common species in this lineage. They look like an unripe fruit on a tree branch, hence the nickname "True Fruit." 
However, there are very few bones in this fish. The meat is fatty and rich, but if it's not handled properly, or you remove its gallbladder too late, the fish's meat will be as sour as unripe fruit. Therefore, "making this fish delicious" has become the standard by which all chefs are measured.

## Peach of the Deep Waves

Medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm them. 
This species' whole body is pink and the tail fin is green, colors that are associated with the Zaytun Peach. These fish are, as their name suggests, so sweet that they are considered "ideal for dessert."
Doubtless, owing to various factors, the fish dessert that the fish chefs were hoping to create did not pan out. Because this type of fish is rare and expensive, it is often farmed as an ornamental fish. 
There is a large customer base that doesn't want to spend too much Mora on this kind of pufferfish, but nevertheless can't get enough of its bright colors. There are even enterprising businessmen who have managed to reverse this phenomenon, modeling their Zaytun Peaches after these pufferfish. The sales of those are pretty good.

## Sandstorm Angler

A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm it. 
This sandy-colored, plain-looking fish is an important breed. Researchers have managed to deduce the ecological characteristics of the whole pufferfish lineage from the anatomy of this species. With its immense strength and strongest horns amongst its kind, this fish acts as an "underwater workhorse." They have evolved their protective coloration as a result of long-term activities in the riverbed and the bottom of the lake, along with spending all their days with pervasive river and lake sand as companions.

## Sunset Cloud Angler

A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm it.
As the longest-living species of pufferfish, they have a light gray color and are easy to identify. The color comes from their unique way of survival â€” their cutis contains a substance similar to bile, which is far more acidic than that of other fish, causing them to be shunned by many underwater creatures.
But when cooked in a special way, the acidity actually adds to the freshness of the fish. As a result, this fish sells very well. At Sumeru's fish markets, you can often see signs that say: "Do not keep Sunset Cloud Anglers in the same tank as other fish meant for consumption."

## Lazurite Axe Marlin

A fish with unique morphology and Sumeru's cousin to the butterfly fish. This fish has a broad skeleton and a unique curved body. Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name "Axe Marlin." This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the "Anchor Hook Butterfly," and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.
Although its namesake is a weapon, and its strength surpasses that of many other fish, Axe Marlin mostly have a kind personality, especially those with blue and gold stripes on the body. Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.
Their strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts â€” to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites.

## Halcyon Jade Axe Marlin

A medium-sized fish with unique morphology and Sumeru's cousin to the butterfly fish. This fish has a broad skeleton and a unique curved body. Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name "Axe Marlin." This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the "Anchor Hook Butterfly," and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.
The jade-colored Axe Marlin prefers to live in areas where aquatic plants flourish, and where its shape easily blends in with the background. Small fish that wander through the grass often bump into their camouflaged bodies and become dazed, but the marlin doesn't feel provoked, and will instead offer shelter to its neighbors.

## Streaming Axe Marlin

A fish with unique morphology and Fontaine's cousin to the butterfly fish. This fish has a broad skeleton and a unique curved body. Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name "Axe Marlin." This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the "Anchor Hook Butterfly," and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.
It is said that these sea-blue Axe Marlins were a special type that migrated from Sumeru to Fontaine. Compared to their more mild-tempered cousins in Sumeru, Streaming Axe Marlins are tougher and can survive in far more inhospitable environments. They are also known to travel extremely long distances, comparable even to those covered by some merchant vessels. As a result, some sailors see them as an emblem of courage and patience.

## Rippling Heartfeather Bass

Peculiar fishes that look like a heart from the side, which are said to be related to bass. Their dorsal and ventral fins are comprised of flexible bones that are as slender as feathers, hence why researchers proposed the name "Heartfeather Bass."
As an important subspecies of the Heartfeather Bass family, Rippling Heartfeather Bass are much better at swimming than their appearance suggests â€” they can even travel across roaring waves. It is said that their fins produce a rippling sound when they swim above the water against the current. Identifying the fish is already extremely challenging given their protective coloration, so most anglers have never heard this unique sound with their own ears.

## Blazing Heartfeather Bass

Peculiar fishes that look like a heart from the side, which are said to be related to bass. Their dorsal and ventral fins are comprised of flexible bones that are as slender as feathers, hence why researchers proposed the name "Heartfeather Bass."
"Blazing Heartfeather Bass" have a unique coloration that shines like sunlight, making them extremely eye-catching in the water. This is said to be a special self-defense strategy which causes other fish that rely on their vision to mistake them for unknown burning objects, keeping potential predators away as a result. Contrary to their flaming appearance, they actually maintain a low body temperature and have a relatively modest food intake. Sometimes, they even go out of their way to stay in the shallows just to get some sunshine.

## Maintenance Mek: Initial Configuration

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.
Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."
Made of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in "group shifts" â€” when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift. In the eyes of ordinary people, these "Iron Fishes" seem to be able to reproduce themselves in a never-ending stream. Catching a few of them from time to time is certainly no cause for a guilty conscience.

## Maintenance Mek: Water Body Cleaner

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.
Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."
Compared to the mass-deployed "Initial Configuration" model, the "Water Body Cleaner" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of "bait" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.

## Maintenance Mek: Situation Controller

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.
Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently "nose out" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish."
Under certain conditions, Maintenance Meks will treat the food of some underwater creatures as targets to be cleaned, and thus sometimes find themselves embroiled in conflicts in which they are at a disadvantage due to their small size and lack of power. Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. 
To protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.
However, the plan to further enhance "Situation Controllers" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these "Situation Controllers" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.

## Maintenance Mek: Platinum Collection

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates.
Compared to the other batch-produced models, these special limited-edition "Platinum Collection" meks stand out with their clean and bright casing. When trying to attract support from wealthy merchants for the Maintenance Mek project, the development team would send them a fish tank containing one of these exquisite contraptions as a gift â€” and fine gifts they were indeed! Unfortunately, none of these attempts worked, so the development team adjusted their plans and tried to sell them off as toys to make up for the lack of project funds instead.
In the end, due to the accident that we all remember, the whole development team was dismissed and all of their future projects were canceled. At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the "Platinum Collection" batch are no exception â€” they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive "fishes" in Fontaine. According to an in-depth investigation and cross-examination of the existing data by journalists of The Steambird, "the deployment of Maintenance Meks has not made any significant difference to the pollution levels of Fontaine's waters, and the effect of the project is still in question." Nowadays, surviving "Platinum Collection" meks still wander the waters of Fontaine, and they are considered among the most prized of catches. After all, a "Platinum Collection" mek is now as rare as the most valuable Ornamental Fish in other nations.

## Maintenance Mek: Gold Leader

Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka groups, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.
Compared to other mass-produced models, this special "Gold Leader" assistance meka utilizes a clear gold outer casing along with special control equipment. The project team designed it to fulfill the role of a command relay station in particularly complex underwater environments, receiving and re-transmitting commands from the controller to all other meka within the group, effectively fulfilling the important role of leader.
However, as the whole maintenance meka project stopped functioning, these leader meka lost their reason for existence. Only their highly recognizable clear golden casing gives them value in the eyes of the anglers who collect them.

## Jade Heartfeather Bass

Peculiar fish that look like a heart from the side, which are said to be related to bass. Their dorsal and ventral fins are comprised of flexible bones that are as slender as feathers, hence the proposed name "Heartfeather Bass."
Jade Heartfeather Bass are named for the jade-like coloration they take on in the water. Despite their gentle appearances, they possess remarkable resilience and can adapt to diverse aquatic environments. The clear water in Chenyu Vale is especially suitable for them, where they thrive and live a carefree, comfortable life.

## Floral Rapidfighting Fish

Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking "blades" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name "Rapidfighting Fish."
Owing to their vivid pink hue, these Rapidfighting Fish have been given the prefix "Floral," which has caused some tourists to mistakenly associate them with the Flower-Feather Clan or Qucusaurs. It is said that this color provides particularly effective camouflage against their natural adversaries, especially when in shallow waters against a backdrop of reddish-brown rocks.

## Diving Rapidfighting Fish

Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking "blades" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name "Rapidfighting Fish."
These bluish-toned Rapidfighting Fish are capable of diving down into deeper waters. But due to their fondness for the warmth of direct sunlight, as well as all the fun they have playing with young Koholasaurs, they tend not to stay at the bottom for very long...

## Magma Rapidfighting Fish

Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking "blades" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name "Rapidfighting Fish."
This subspecies of Rapidfighting Fish, living as they do in liquid Phlogiston, possess exceptionally tough skins that are particularly resilient to high temperatures, earning them the moniker "the fish that can't be grilled." Of course, most fishing enthusiasts who get their hands on a Magma Rapidfighting Fish tend to treat them as precious ornamental fish, nurturing them with loving care rather than sending them to the kitchen...

## Greenwave Sunfish

Medium-sized fish with a flat body and a gentle temperament, these fish are considered to be one of the least irritable creatures in the waters of Natlan. Capable of consuming almost anything, their utterly indiscriminate eating habits make them natural cleaners of the underwater world, a trait that has earned them high praise among locals.
Legend has it that in the distant past, Greenwave Sunfish inhabited waters where the nutrient levels were excessively high, to the point that thick layers of algae would float upon the surface. It was thanks to their presence that this algae was kept in check. Even today, the crystal-clear, azure waters of the People of the Springs may be in part a testament to their contribution.

## Dusk Sunfish

Medium-sized fish with a flat body and a gentle temperament, these fish are considered to be one of the least irritable creatures in the waters of Natlan. Capable of consuming almost anything, their utterly indiscriminate eating habits make them natural cleaners of the underwater world, a trait that has earned them high praise among locals.
In some folk tales, the intertwining colors with which the skins of these Sunfish are adorned, with their bright reds and light blues, are said to be the result of them having "drunk the remnants of the sunset." Both sunlight and firelight are cherished and revered by the people of Natlan, and as such, writers from Liyue and Fontaine have seen this story as epitomizing the "unique romance of Natlan."

## Phony Phlogiston Unihornfish

A peculiar type of fish with a single horn. Round and firm, its belly is as bouncy as a balloon.
The horn-shaped crystals that grow on the head have some similarities to solid phlogiston, but research indicates that these "horns" are clear and sparkling when they are newly hatched, like polished glass. But after living in a liquid phlogiston environment for an extended period, the accumulation of numerous colored substances causes the current colorful appearance, and gives rise to their joking nickname of "Phony Phlogiston."
Every few years, the "Phony Phlogiston" crystal on the Unihornfish's head will slough off fragments as it grows, and these fragments are incredibly precious ingredients for creating dyes. Graffiti aficionados consider them to capture the "color of flame."

## Pseudoshark Unihornfish

A peculiar type of fish with a single horn. Round and firm, its belly is as bouncy as a balloon... Actually, there really is a balloon-like swim bladder in there.
While the Phony Phlogiston Unihornfish can provide graffiti enthusiasts with precious paints, they can only live in liquid phlogiston environments. Thus, the Graffiti Alliance began to explore raising this kind of fish in ordinary aqueous environments. To accomplish this, the previous Graffiti Alliance's leader's previous predecessor began to work with the Natlan Fishing Association, expending an enormous sum to import clockwork fish from Fontaine, using "Maintenance Mek" tech to build an ecological simulation mek with onboard data collection capabilities and conduct extensive observations and research. Alas, the results were most disappointing: the horn-like crystal structures on Unihornfish heads ceased to shine with flame-like light after the fish left their liquid phlogiston environment, and so, the plan ended in failure.
Fortunately, due to the way their dorsal fin extends above the water while they swim, these mek Unihornfish look kind of like sharks from a distance. Thanks to this, the People of the Springs ended up buying an appropriate quantity of these "Pseudoshark Unihornfish" from the Graffiti Alliance and Natlan Fishing Association. They are used for giving tourists who go surfing a thrilling yet safe experience, as well as to scare lawbreakers in certain waters.

## Secret Source Scout Sweeper

A nimble, fish-like mechanical construct reminiscent of the technology in ancient ruins. It can move in various liquid environments, including liquid Phlogiston â€” perhaps it was designed to detect and automatically approach heat sources. 
Due to this "heat-seeking" trait, skilled fishers can use heat-emitting bait to lure and capture them. When disassembled, they yield remarkable components from ancient civilizations, making these "mechanical fish" highly valuable...

## Lantern Fiber

Used in Lantern Rite as material with which to construct Xiao Lanterns.
This commonly encountered fibrous material can be processed into lantern wrappings so that the lanterns can float away, carrying their beautiful wishes far afield.

## Wick Material

Used in Lantern Rite as material with which to construct Xiao Lanterns.
The commonly encountered velvety material can be processed into lantern wicks so the lanterns can float away, carrying their beautiful wishes far afield.

## Plaustrite Shard

Used in Lantern Rite as material with which to construct Xiao Lanterns.
A mysterious shard of elemental rock that can float by itself. It is the secret to the flying lanterns. It is also said to be the thing that powers the Jade Chamber's floating mechanism.
