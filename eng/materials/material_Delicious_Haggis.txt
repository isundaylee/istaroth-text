# Delicious Haggis

A dish with strong and distinctive flavors. After venturing a nibble, the mellow and rich taste of the offal and various spices serve up layer after layer of piquancy to your taste buds. As you savor the flavor, the abundant meaty aroma fills your mouth with a bountiful aftertaste that lingers long after you have finished. No wonder it inspires such strong emotions in the hearts of poets, and they can seldom resist dedicating a paean to this dish after trying it.
