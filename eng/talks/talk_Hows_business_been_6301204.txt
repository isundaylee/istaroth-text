Traveler: How's business been?
Ramsay: It was quite good at first. Exotic items from faraway lands will sell well anywhere, after all.
Ramsay: But later on, the Resistance emerged in Sangonomiya due to the confiscation of Visions by the Shogunate. Business has gotten worse ever since that war started.
Ramsay: That just won't do. How can there be a healthy market in this environment? The way I see it, the Shogunate is stabbing itself in the foot... *sigh*
Ramsay: But though the current situation is grim, the weather in Inazuma remains very comfortable. And Komore Teahouse is very safe and secure. So all in all, I'm in no hurry to leave, haha.
