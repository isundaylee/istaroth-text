# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello.
Hosseini: ...Hello there. Odd to see you not busy for once. Have you come to chat?
Hosseini: I've been in a bit of a rush recently, so I've barely had the chance to get a few lines in.
Hosseini: Really, it's quite a surprise meeting you here in Ritou. Well, strictly speaking, maybe not. We are all outlanders in the Inazumans' eyes, after all.
Hosseini: Before they get a Residence Permit, all outlanders must remain in Ritou. All that considered, I suppose meeting you here isn't so much of a surprise after all.
Hosseini: In any case, I'm still waiting for the Outlander Affairs Agency to review and approve my application for a Residence Permit, so I can't leave at the moment.
Hosseini: I have been waiting for a while now, though. I wonder when the approval will come down.
Hosseini: Each day spent here is another day's worth of expenses expended and research left undone. Most frustrating indeed...
Hosseini: So far, I've only been able to ask someone to help me find some "ways and means" to go to other Inazuman islands and conduct some preliminary research.
Hosseini: What about you? Since you've been able to go to Tsurumi Island, I suppose that your Residence Permit has been processed, right?
Hosseini: Might you have ideas as to how to speed that up, by the way?
