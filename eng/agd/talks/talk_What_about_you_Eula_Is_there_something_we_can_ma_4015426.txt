# Talk Dialog

Paimon: What about you, Eula? Is there something we can make for you?
Eula: Hmm... I don't want to put too much on your plate. It wouldn't be fair to ask you to make so many potions at once.
Eula: Beidou came all this way... Her order should take priority.
Eula: Any potion requests I have on my end, I'll just submit to Lisa later — the same goes for anything the Reconnaissance Company needs as well.
Paimon: Aww, you're so considerate of other people.
Eula: Oh, uh, you think so...? The Knights have always looked after me so well... Maybe it's rubbed off on me a little, or something.
Eula: But I still have a lot to learn... The next time things get heated, I should approach the situation in a more level-headed way.
Traveler: I think you're doing great.
Paimon: Exactly! Compared to when we first met, you're practically picking up friends left and right!
Paimon: It's just like that Tone-deaf Bard once said — the winds always change their course!
Eula: Thanks, you two... Your kindness... really means a lot.
Traveler: Everyone can see how hard you're trying.
