Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Luke: That Viktor keeps saying that this place is as boring as ever, but I can certainly feel the festive atmosphere.
Luke: I'll have you know that I take the greatest pleasure from watching the dejection of those imbeciles who confess their feelings come the festival, only to be rejected. Hah...
Luke: *cough* But back on topic, there's one thing that I don't get...
Luke: ...How did this commemorative festival become a day for lovers, anyway?
Luke: Is this what the people of Mondstadt call "freedom"?
