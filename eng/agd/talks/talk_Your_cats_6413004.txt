Traveler: Your cats...
Butrus: Uh, are they my cats? I don't think so...
Butrus: I don't know where they came from either. Since I fed one, they've been coming to me one after another, bringing their families with them to have meals.
Butrus: I can't help it either. The kittens are too cute, and I just can't stop my hand from feeding them fish!
Butrus: There are even cats that came running from the inn owner's home, and they wouldn't leave. There, those two on the side.
Butrus: But you know, they can't be blamed. I heard that their owner is going senile, and the cats are tired of hearing his rambling.
