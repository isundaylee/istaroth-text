Emilie: You look tired. Need a break?
Emilie: I tend to find that distracting the mind by focusing on something else is an excellent way to relax. We could chat about today's news stories, for instance.
Emilie: Or anything else you'd like to talk about, of course.

Emilie: I didn't realize quite how strong the enemies that you have to fight are...
Emilie: If you've invited me here, it must be because you're confident that my skills will come in handy.
Emilie: So, no need to be coy, alright? I'm here to help however you need.

Emilie: That experience, of holding onto hope as you search for the one... It's a beautiful thing, worth treasuring.
