# To the Sky-Road


## Talk 1

Paimon: Is that the Altar? That's gonna be hard to reach.
Paimon: #We can fly just fine, but how about {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and Bona?
Bona: Did you forget that I'm an adventurer of the Flower-Feather Clan? I have plenty of flight experience myself.
Bona: #I can get over there, easy, even with {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} in tow.
Traveler: I have a flying license, too.
Bona: That'll do. I'll lead the way, so just follow.
Traveler: Is this going to be a race?
Bona: Wow, hey, you sure this is the time to get competitive? Relax! I'll lead the way, so just follow!
Paimon: #Hmm... This feels like it could get super dangerous, and we can't know what might happen, so hold on tight, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, Bona, that was super quick! We almost couldn't keep up back there!
Bona: Haha, sorry, sorry. I just couldn't help myself after seeing the Altar of Primal Flame just up ahead...
Paimon: So all we gotta do is use this Altar, and we can go to the Tonatiuh, right? But even if a huge wind current were to lift us off the ground, who knows how long we'd have to fly before we get up there?
Paimon: Ugh, just thinking about it is getting Paimon all worried.
Traveler: Don't be scared, Paimon.
Paimon: Alright, if you say so. But don't stray too far from Paimon, you hear?
Bona: Anyway, so what we've gotta do now is put the Pyrophosphorite on the Altar, right? But, ah, we've got two on our hands, so... Let's put them both up there, just to be safe.
Traveler: How exciting!
Bona: Right? I'm getting super excited too. No real adventurers would wanna miss out on a challenge like this!
