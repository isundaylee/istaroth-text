Traveler: What's on your mind?
Tang Wen: I'm thinking about how times can change oh so quickly...
Tang Wen: Just like how I couldn't return to Liyue to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree, and yet I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. My greatest wish is to see history with my own two eyes.
Tang Wen: It is my belief that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must first document it completely.
Tang Wen: My time in Inazuma has really got me thinking about how history can be winding, and yet change so very suddenly, too...
Tang Wen: Fortunately, I'm no longer some student who needs to worry about her next thesis.
Tang Wen: Those graduate students who had Inazuman history as their subject are probably in for it now: in the worst case, they might even have spend several sleepless nights rewriting their theses.
