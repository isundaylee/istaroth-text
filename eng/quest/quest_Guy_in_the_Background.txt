# Guy in the Background


## Talk 1

Quinn: Ooh... The sweetness of the freshly squeezed fruit really takes the edge off of the fiery liquor. It goes down smooth, but still has a kick to it.
Quinn: This is some masterful mixology right here! I could serve this Mondstadt Sunset as-is! But where does it get its name?
Quinn: If you look carefully, you can see the fruit juices settling in the liquor. Don't you think it looks like the view from Starsnatch Cliff at sundown as the sunlight pours out over Mondstadt?

## Talk 2

Quinn: Whew, this drink doesn't pull any punches... If anything, the cool of the dandelion seeds seems to add to the fieriness of the liquor! My tongue is numb, but I can't tell whether it's the burn or the chill...

## Talk 3

Quinn: Hey! This is just straight liquor — you call this mixing a drink!?

## Talk 4

Quinn: What a novel sensation. Thick foam, refreshing beer and some crushed sweet flower too... A session beer through and through!

## Talk 5

Quinn: The taste is passable at best, but just look how beautiful it is... The key to making a good Mondstadt Sunset, apart from making sure it's well shaken and stirred, is to let it sit long enough for the juices to settle...

## Talk 6

Quinn: This is... just straight liquor, no? I can't see anything special about it.

## Talk 7

Quinn: Which is why I ask, how can you call this a mixed drink?

## Talk 8

Quinn: Ooh... The texture is like that of regular beer, but where is that residue coming from? Did you put something in it?

## Talk 9

Quinn: Haha... Whatever this is, it sure isn't a Mondstadt Sunrise! You used the wrong ingredients, didn't you?

## Talk 10

Quinn: ...This is just straight liquor!

## Talk 11

Quinn: Oi! At least put something else in the mix. All this is is straight liquor!

## Talk 12

Quinn: Haha, gotta love a good old beer— Hang on, what's this sediment doing in here...

## Talk 13

Quinn: What in Teyvat have you put in this!? My tongue is all numb!

## Talk 14

Quinn: My oh my... That was simply— Oh no! It's all gone...
Quinn: Make me another, won't you? Just one more, just like the last one... Please!

## Talk 15

Quinn: Hmm... Nothing to write home about. But surprisingly good for a beginner!
