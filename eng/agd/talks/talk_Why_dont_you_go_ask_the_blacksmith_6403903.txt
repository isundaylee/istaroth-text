Traveler: Why don't you go ask the blacksmith?
Iradj: The blacksmith, huh... I'd better not.
Iradj: The boss there is my adoptive father. He's always talking about wanting us to come back and take over the family business.
Iradj: He's been a great father to us, so we always feel bad whenever we have to turn him down...
Iradj: So, it's best that I don't bother him with this sword matter.
