Traveler: How have things been lately?
Kiminami Anna: I have learned some new recipes since we last met. The new products I made have even been approved by my mom.
Kiminami Anna: Once my cooking skills are as good as my grandpa's were back when he was working as the royal head chef of the Shogunate, I will probably be able to take over this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: My father will be stunned when he gets back, oh yes he will, indeed!
Kiminami Anna: Oh right, you can also invite Miss Kamisato here too. If it's you asking, I think she will definitely agree to come, hehe.
