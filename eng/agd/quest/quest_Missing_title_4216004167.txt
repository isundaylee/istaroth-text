# Missing title (4216004167)


## Talk 1

Phonia: Let the wind lead, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
Traveler: And you are...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, intelligence officer of the reorganized 7th Company, and also one of the people who proposed this Wargame.
Phonia: Currently, my main tasks are the development and maintenance of alchemical recon equipment, collecting intel, and analyzing enemies. If you need help, just contact my acting superior.
Traveler: Sounds like reporting work...
Phonia: Well, we all work for the Knights of Favonius, and we're all on the clock right now, so rather than indulging ourselves in exchanges of meaningless information, our time would be best used discussing useful intel...
Phonia: I am but an ordinary cog in the machine that is the Knights of Favonius. Aside from my duties, any information about me is of no significance to you.
Traveler: Well, "cog" is a rather peculiar way to describe yourself.
Phonia: It is only the truth. I'm just an ordinary person without any particular talent or ambition. I'm just here to do what I can.
Phonia: And that's fine by me. I worry about nothing outside of my duties, and I live an ordinary life. A good way to avoid troubles, really.
Traveler: Err, could you tell me a bit about yourself anyway?
Phonia: I've told you all that's worth hearing. Or would you like to hear something more personal? Let me think...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, 26 years old, single. I currently live in the third room on the third floor of the third building to the right of the city gates. I have a roommate called Ematol, who also happens to be my tenant, and the monthly rent is... I forget, it's not important.
Phonia: My hobby is sleeping. After work, I just go home and sleep. If it's too noisy, I'll have some wine to help me sleep. I don't remember what kind of wine I used to drink, but that's not important either. As long as it can get me drunk, it's good wine.
Phonia: As for where I was born, how I spent my childhood, what my parents did before I was born, and all that, I suspect such things are far less significant.
Phonia: If you don't need any more information from me, please allow me to continue my analysis work. Of course, if you do have any questions about the Wargame, please feel free to consult me at any time.
Traveler: Your acting superior?
Phonia: Yes. 7th Company was only reorganized recently, so we haven't yet settled on our captaincy.
Phonia: The 7th Company is temporarily designated as a "Combined Arms Company," which integrates knights with a range of capabilities into a single combat unit, with a balance of ranged and melee firepower. Such a unit is also very reliant on reconnaissance.
Phonia: In time, the expeditionary force's No. 2 — the venerable Commander Frederica Gunnhildr — might become our Company's Captain.
Phonia: After all, Commander Frederica has served for longer than many Knights have been alive, and her experience in battle is unmatched. It wouldn't be too much to say she is perfectly suited for leadership.
Traveler: Wait. That Gunnhildr?
Phonia: Correct! Commander Frederica is the Acting Grand Master's mother, and is renowned throughout Mondstadt.
Phonia: She's been on active duty on the front lines for decades now, never tiring or slowing. When the youths of Mondstadt talk of their dreams of being a hero, the name "Frederica" is never far from their lips.
Phonia: And I was one of them! When I joined the Knights of Favonius, it was because of my admiration for Commander Frederica...
Phonia: Of course, I later realized that I was only talented enough to be just one more cog in the machine. As for the heroic protagonists of the storybooks that can take on a hundred foes all alone... that's another story.
Traveler: So Jean's mother... will be your captain?
Phonia: That's only my speculation as an intelligence officer. As I see it, the 7th Company will likely be one of the most formidable units, and so Commander Frederica would be the most suitable candidate for Captain.
Phonia: Though Commander Frederica's position in the Knights of Favonius has long surpassed any ordinary Captain, she's never been one for pushing pencils. She's always insisted on staying on the front lines, toe-to-toe with foes.
Phonia: In principle, the Knights of Favonius value ability and experience equally, so after she returns, perhaps we'll see the Acting Grand Master giving orders to Commander Frederica...
Traveler: Isn't that also Jean's last name...?
Traveler: Wargame?
Phonia: Yes. As I'm sure you've seen, the scourge of monsters wandering the wilds remains one of the issues that all nations in Teyvat must deal with.
Phonia: In short, I've drawn inspiration from the Millelith General Staff's previous methods, collating all manner of reports in order to construct this Wargame.
Phonia: By simulating battles between monsters, we can learn the best strategies to defeat them while in a non-combat environment. If you're interested, please give it a try yourself.
Traveler: It looks like... a game of chess?
Phonia: You're certainly right about that. There are indeed similarities between the conduct of Wargames and chess, so the comparison is quite apt.
Phonia: "Playing chess" is enough to help conduct valuable tactical analysis, and that's also where the charm of Wargames lie. You can just think of it as a regular "chess game."
Phonia: In any case, I've applied for permission from the Acting Grand Master. Everyone is free to take part in these simulations, and all participants will be entitled to a thank-you gift.
Phonia: So if you have the time, Honorary Knight, I hope that you, too, will take part in our simulations. After all, I doubt that there are many in Mondstadt who know more about monsters than you do.
Traveler: I see. I'll give it a go when I have time, then.
Phonia: My thanks. We've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. I look forward to witnessing a commanding performance from you, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Everyone can participate?
Phonia: The battlefield brims with uncertainty. No matter how thorough the investigation, the fog of war, which no wind can disperse, will still shroud about three-quarters of it.
Phonia: As such, the more participants we get, the more likely we can simulate even the most unpredictable of monster behavior patterns.
Phonia: All strategy and theory can only be based on real tactical results. No matter what the battle situation, only the success of our strategies can determine victory or defeat.
Phonia: Such simulations help to expose our weaknesses, such that we Knights can improve them in real future combat scenarios.
Traveler: Nice! Clear as mud, though!
Phonia: It's alright. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details. Just focus on doing battle.
Traveler: Got it. So I'll play the chess, and you'll do the rest?
Phonia: Precisely. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details — simply command.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Alright. You stay safe as well.

## Talk 2

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Traveler: Err, bomb structures, you say...?
Ematol: That's right! I mean, you must have seen the Spark Knight's lovely, gorgeous Jumpy Dumpties too, yes?
Ematol: Though I, Ematol, am just a lowly, bog-standard alchemist of no significance, I still have a dream!
Ematol: Not to delve into the structures of gold-mercury amalgams, but to achieve even a twentieth of the might bestowed upon Jumpy Dumpties by their construction!
Ematol: And that's why I've been working on an all-new design! Explosive speed — perfected! Shockwaves — shattering! Craftsmanship — simple. Cost... reasonable... Ah, I get the shivers just thinking about it...
Ematol: ...Ah, uh, sorry. Got carried away again, didn't I? Anyway, if there are any bombs... I mean, any things I can do for you, please let me know, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Alright. I shan't disturb you, then...
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Weapons Officer?
Ematol: That's right, that's me! We work in logistics, in the rear-line, so it's normal that you haven't heard of us. What we do is develop and test experimental equipment.
Ematol: For example, I'm currently designing a new long-range projectile... Anyway, if there's anything I can do for you, Honorary Knight, feel free to let me know!
Traveler: Are you taking part in the Wargame as well?
Ematol: Well, uh... To be more precise, Phonia... I mean, Commander Phonia, pulled me into this business...
Ematol: I mean, I'm not the brightest spark, so this "complicated tactics" stuff flies right over my head. I'd love nothing better than to study explosives, and follow in the Spark Knight's footsteps, setting them off, free as the wind...
Ematol: Ah, but if you need help repositioning the Wargame board, do let me know! Ematol, 7th Company Weapons Officer, shall be glad to render her services!
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Phonia: Thank you for your help, Honorary Knight and your Helper in White. You are indeed the famed heroes of Mondstadt — your Wargame records are marvels worthy of repeated breakdown and analysis.
Traveler: Hehe, go us!
Paimon: #Hehe, well, Traveler's faced down countless monsters in real life! Guess we've been a big help to the Knights of Favonius after all, huh?
Phonia: Yes, this Wargame has gone very well indeed. Both the 7th Company and the Knights as a whole could gain much from analyzing these results.
Phonia: This way, our efforts to improve security in the areas surrounding Mondstadt should go more smoothly. For example, we'll be better able to deal with sudden attacks of Slimes on older folk, or hilichurls assaulting caravans...
Paimon: Y'know, Paimon somehow feels like that's happened waaaay too many times... Wait, does this mean that they'll never happen again?
Phonia: ...
Paimon: R... Right?
Phonia: It will take some time, but we...
Ematol: Phonia! Phonia! Listen— Oh, it's you, Honorary Knight, and your Helper in White! Hey there!
Phonia: ...What is it this time?
Ematol: C'mon, what's with that face? I was just going to give a report regarding the Wargames...
Ematol: Hmph. Anyway! While I was "wargaming in silence" — just as you requested, by the by — I discovered something incredible!
Paimon: Something super duper incredible?
Ematol: That's absolutely right! You see, even though these are just simulations, if we multiply explosive power by ten times...
Ematol: Wouldn't that miniaturized explosive arrow we developed previously be enough to beat a Ruin Guard in one hit?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ?
Phonia: ...
Phonia: Let me just ask you this first... Why did you have to multiply the power by ten?
Ematol: Well, that would make the simulation results prettier, wouldn't it? I mean, it might not be possible in real life, but such data is always exciting, right?
Ematol: So long as we work hard toward that goal, we might someday get those very results! To create a beautiful explosion that has almost one-tenth of a Jumpy Dumpty's power... Ahhh...
Phonia: Well, you should have multiplied the explosion's power by a hundred times, then.
Ematol: Huh? Oh, right! Well, that's Phonia for you. If we multiplied the explosive force by a hundred times, then we could... We could defeat just about any monster!
Ematol: Especially if we also used the enhanced model equipped with the Spikey Fish King-Type Tactical Core. That could destroy a whole group of Ruin Graders with one shot—
Phonia: Really? Then why stop there? Why not multiply it ten million times? Perhaps we might even blow the Favonius Cathedral up to where it can have a nice chat with the Fontaine Research Institute.
Phonia: And then, once the church strings you up for all to see, I can finally cut ties with you and find a normal tenant to rent out my house to.
Ematol: Uhhh... I was kidding, you know? Just kidding, I swear!
Phonia: Don't worry, so was I. I'm your direct superior, in any case. Were you to be strung up in public, I'd be on the hook for negligence as well. Besides, I can't find anyone to rent the house out to, anyway.
Paimon: Wait, so the joke's that you don't actually have prospective tenants... Wait, that's a terrible joke!
Phonia: Aaanyway, thanks again for your help, you two. And Ematol? When you get back, you're going to reflect on changing simulation parameters of your own accord — no arguing.
Traveler: Just glad I could help.
