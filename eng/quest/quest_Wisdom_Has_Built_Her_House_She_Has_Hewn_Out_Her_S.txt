# Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars


## Talk 1

Mendas: Hey! Who are you?
Paimon: Whoa! Bandits!
Mendas: Bandits? How rude! I am Mendas, a scout! And this is Hugeweh.
Traveler: We are adventurers just passing by.
Mendas: Here... the Matriarch has forbidden us from harming foreign adventurers, you must hurry up and get out of here!
Mendas: Gah. If only Jeht were here. She's better at dealing with outsiders...
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Jeht?
Mendas: Well, what's the matter, then? She joined us some time back and is highly valued by the Matriarch.
Mendas: She's practically the Matriarch's shadow... Hmph, none of us tribespeople even come close to that kind of treatment.
Traveler: We actually kind of know her.
Mendas: ...
Mendas: Well, if you're Jeht's friends, I won't stop you. You may move on. The tribe's campsite lies ahead.
Mendas: Jeht isn't back yet, but Aderfi, Masseira, and Yuften are in at the moment. They're pretty friendly to outsiders.
Mendas: You can look for them... But if you have lied to us, you will find us less merciful.
Traveler: We're supposed to be her friends.

## Talk 2

Mendas: Oh. It's you. Please, proceed.

## Talk 3

???: B—But... I don't know what those outsiders wanted... It's not my fault! Please let me explain, Matriarch Babel...
Babel: ...
???: Please... Please! Give me one more chance, Matriarch... My Lady! I will prove my loyalty to the Tanit... Please believe me... I would gladly offer my life...
Babel: Silence.
Babel: She who knocked your teeth out can also remove your tongue.
???: ...! No, please don't...
Babel: I don't understand... If you're willing to give your life for the Tanit, why are you still standing before me, alive?
Babel: And another thing... Why did you address me as "My Lady"?
Babel: I don't speak the language of the snowlands, and I do not care for the sophistry of the so-called "civilized world"... There is no such thing as "My Lady" here.
Babel: And do enlighten me. What makes you think I'm not your family anymore... but some "Lady"?
Babel: Your tongue is tainted with outsider poison, your mind stained by their gold. You cannot remain here.
Babel: I shall speak no further. Lead him away... He was once one of us, so you know what to do.
Black Screen Text: The weeping man is taken away, leaving an uneasy silence...
Black Screen Text: After a while, the crowd begins to disperse, making room for you to see the Matriarch.
Paimon: (Uh, what just happened...? Whatever it was, it sounded scary!)
Traveler: (I'd hate to get on her bad side...)
Traveler: (Shh...)
Babel: Hmm...?
Babel: Ah... My apologies, children. I was a little distracted. I forgot you were there.
Babel: I'm terribly sorry that you had to see... that. I'm at fault. As the Matriarch of the Tanit, I'd like to make amends.
Paimon: Uh, n—no need! Y'know, what with that "teeth and tongue" stuff and all...
Babel: Heh... We were simply meting out punishment against a traitor. All the same, I am sorry for having given you such a terrible first impression as Matriarch.
Babel: The city has its laws, and the tribe has its rules — please, do not pay it too much mind.
Babel: #So you two are Traveler and Paimon, yes? Jeht talks about you two a lot.
Traveler: We came to look for her.
Paimon: This doesn't seem like a good time, though.
Babel: Ah, no need to be so polite! Indeed, I should say that you have impeccable timing.
Babel: It was I who approved her invitation in the first place. That is how you got safely past the Tanit's hunting grounds.
Babel: Hehe. While I do feel bad saying this... I invited you here to help Jeht with some unfinished business.
Paimon: "Hunting Grounds"?
Babel: Don't worry. We weren't trying to hunt you. You are an honored guest here. For so long as we remember our guests' faces, we shall never do them harm on our land.
Paimon: ...That still isn't very reassuring...
Babel: Haha. Now then, don't let me spoil the fun for you young folks... Look, Jeht is here.
Jeht: Matriarch Babel, I have returned.
Babel: How did it go with that fellow?
Jeht: I made sure that he was given sufficient dignity.
Babel: ...That's good. But do not be proud of this deed, child. This was a tragic affair. He was my tribesman, and yours also.
Jeht: ...I understand.
Babel: Haha, alright. This is not a good day to preach. The friends you have been waiting for have finally arrived, so set your tears aside and greet them with joy.
Jeht: ...Matriarch Babel? What do you...
Traveler: Long time no see.
Paimon: Hey, Jeht! We're here to see you!
Jeht: #Traveler! And Paimon, too! You really did come!
Jeht: Thank you, Matriarch Babel! I shouldn't have gotten mad at everyone about it...
Babel: Now, now, of course I'm happy to see you all together. Whatever it is that you want to see or do, I've already approved it. You can put your doubts to rest.
Babel: A word of caution, however... The road ahead of you will be fraught with danger and intrigue, so be on your guard. Please stay safe...
Messenger: Matriarch Babel, Azariq has sent me to deliver a message to you.
Babel: Understood...
Babel: If you'll excuse me, I have tribal affairs to attend to. I'll leave you young ones to catch up.
Jeht: Thanks!
Black Screen Text: Babel hurries away together with the messenger.
Paimon: Jeht, you've changed a lot since we last saw you!
Jeht: Hehe, got a good eye, haven't you, Paimon? So, what's different about me?
Paimon: You look a little more tanned...
Jeht: Hey! Mouthy as always, huh!?
Traveler: You've matured.
Traveler: You've mellowed out.
Jeht: #Is that so? Hehe, after all we've been through, one probably should mature, even if just a little.
Paimon: #Traveler's right. You look like you've really come into your own.
Jeht: Really? I just learned a lot of survival skills here, that's all. Been busy keeping myself alive, you know?
Jeht: Matriarch Babel has taken good care of me all this time, and I've helped her out with a lot of things... I'm grateful that she's accepted me as a member of the tribe.
Traveler: And have you been doing well since we last met?
Jeht: #Hehe, did you think I was pining after you like some lovesick maiden?
Paimon: Whoa! Hang on a moment! Where did you learn to say all that?
Jeht: Hahahaha! Aw, and here I thought I'd get you to blush!
Jeht: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. All the boys in the tribe are like that, talking nonsense like this... It's annoying. They can't beat me anyway.
Jeht: Ahem... To be honest, it's been tough living, but we're all looking out for each other and helping each other out, so we can all survive.
Jeht: Still, the first days were rough, and I occasionally thought about the days back when my father would teach and protect me... Hehe, and to think that I used to find him annoying when he was around.
Jeht: But the good old days won't put food on the table today, and Matriarch Babel and the rest of the Tanit have been taking good care of me... so it's better to look ahead.
Jeht: Since the Tanit have accepted me, I'm learning to make myself more useful to everyone.
Jeht: Anyway, let's not dally. I've got some errands to run, and since you're here, why not join me?
Paimon: Whoa, is that what you do with old friends?
Jeht: Hehe, sorry, sorry. People are just busy sometimes, you know?
Jeht: Hmm... let me think. Yuften needs help feeding the crocodiles, so let's go there first!

## Talk 4

Katheryne: #Hello there, Traveler! If it's convenient, there's a message for you here!

## Talk 5

Mendas: Hey! Who are you?
Paimon: Whoa! Bandits!
Mendas: Bandits? How rude! I am Mendas, a scout! And this is Hugeweh.
Traveler: Jeht invited us here.
Paimon: Yes! Jeht sent us a letter, and that's why we're here!
Mendas: A letter? Show me.
Black Screen Text: You give Jeht's letter to the scout for review...
Mendas: Well, if you're Jeht's friends, I won't stop you. You may move on. The tribe's campsite lies ahead.
Mendas: Jeht isn't back yet, but Aderfi, Masseira, and Yuften are in at the moment. They're pretty friendly to outsiders.
Mendas: Don't hesitate to seek them out... But if you dare deceive us, you will find us quite unfriendly indeed.

## Talk 6

Yuften: Hello, stranger. What d—do you need?
Traveler: Hello there. I'm Jeht's friend.
Yuften: Oh, the M—Matriarch told me about you. You're good folk.
Yuften: If you're looking for Jeht, sh—she's still out... Please go to meet Matriarch Babel first. She has b—been waiting for you for a long time.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Yuften: She's a good kid.
Traveler: And...?
Yuften: She's made friends, is very happy, and talks like a l—l—little antelope... I'm very... very happy for her.
Yuften: Hmm, it's getting busy up there. Matriarch Babel has returned. O—okay, you should probably meet her. Please don't keep her w—waiting too long.
Traveler: Hello... do you need any help?
Yuften: Huh? I d—don't need... Why are you asking?
Yuften: Oh, you mean the way I t—talk, right?
Yuften: Haha... I'm used t—to it, and I hope you will be, too. Speaking a little slower makes your train of th—thought all the clearer.

## Talk 7

Masseira: #Hello. Traveler, I presume?
Traveler: Yes...
Masseira: Shh... Let me guess... You're here to find someone. Your friend, yes?
Traveler: Yes, but...
Masseira: Jeht is a good girl. I'm glad she has a friend like you.
Traveler: Thanks...
Masseira: Hehe. Anyway, if you don't mind a little advice... You look like a real killer, that you do. But "companions"? Those will prove to be your undoing... Your fatal weakness.
Traveler: I don't understand what you're trying to say...
Masseira: Then consider my words but a breeze in your ear. Hmm... Matriarch Babel's not back yet, so you can go talk to Yuften. He's right by the creek where we raise crocodiles. You can't miss it.
Traveler: You already know my name?

## Talk 8

Aderfi: Hello, young ones. What do you need?
Paimon: Well... We're here to see Jeht. Is she around?
Aderfi: Jeht? Yes... she's here. Why are you looking for her?
Traveler: We're her friends.
Aderfi: Friends...? Oh.
Aderfi: #She's mentioned you before, I think. Something about a "brave and reliable young man." Hmph, she's been hanging around outside for too long, I see, to be making friends with rich people in fancy clothing and such.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Hey, what's that supposed to mean!?
Aderfi: Sorry for speaking so rudely, but I care little for receiving outsiders. You should seek out Matriarch Babel instead.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Aderfi: She's a good kid.
Paimon: So...?
Aderfi: What do you mean "so"? She's a good kid. I don't want to see her come under the bad influence of outsiders. Like I said before, if you need anything, seek out Matriarch Babel. Don't bother me.
Aderfi: Well, I have nothing much else to say to you... Why don't you go find Masseira? He's a strange old man. Who knows, maybe you'll get a warmer welcome there.
Traveler: What do you do here?
Aderfi: What do I do? I do business, exchanging our trash for trash from the city.

## Talk 9

Jeht: Come with me. Don't let the crocodiles bite your foot!
Paimon: Whoa...!

## Talk 10

Jeht: Unlike in the rainforest, the crocodiles here are docile and much smaller.
Jeht: They've sacrificed a lot to adapt to living in the desert.

## Talk 11

Jeht: Aderfi has a lot of nice stuff that you can't find or trade, and people like to go there to do business.
Jeht: Y'know, to get things like... gadgets, toys, new clothes... and cosmetics...
Paimon: Oh? Do you wear makeup?
Jeht: What do you even mean by that? Lapis lazuli eye shadow is an essential sunscreen for us desert folk, and we can use concealer to hide scars. Makeup's super useful!
Paimon: Huh, so that's it...

## Talk 12

Jeht: Hehe... It's good that you were able to come.
Paimon: We're glad to see you too, Jeht! There's so much we'd like to tell you, but... Hmm, where should we even begin?
Jeht: I know, right? There's so much we all want to say, but now that we've met... Hehe, "where should we start," huh?
Jeht: I've learned a phrase here in the tribe, and it goes something like "the closer your home, the more reticent your heart." And, y'know, it describes our situation perfectly.
Paimon: Whoa, is this tribe always so... er, eloquent?

## Talk 13

Yuften: H—Have you finished, Jeht?
Jeht: Yeah. I'm going to wash now! Your crocodile food stinks — smells of raw meat!
Yuften: Haha... And d—does that or traitor-blood smell worse?
Jeht: Hey! Not funny!
Yuften: Thank you. By the way... th—there's one more thing that I want to a—ask of you...
Yuften: This is the cured c—c—crocodile meat that I promised to give Aderfi previously. Pass it on to him for me, would you?
Jeht: Sure, sure, I'll give your c—c—crocodile meat to Aderfi, no problem!
Yuften: H—Hey! Th—that was uncalled for!
Jeht: Hahaha, smell ya later!

## Talk 14

Jeht: I'm here, Aderfi!
Aderfi: Oh? Here to show off your new outsider friends?
Jeht: Sort of! By the way, here's the crocodile jerky from Yuften!
Aderfi: Ah, thanks. You're so considerate...
Jeht: Hehe, no worries! By the way, about Benben... can you still fix it?
Aderfi: Don't worry, it's nothing serious. I'll be able to get it back to you in a couple of days.
Jeht: Oh... okay! Then I'll get going!
Aderfi: Stay safe.

## Talk 15

Jeht: Heh... running here and there really works up a sweat...
Traveler: Are you always this busy?
Jeht: Haha, it's fine. I don't like being idle, actually.
Jeht: Ah, but look at me. I didn't invite you guys here so you could come run errands with me!
Jeht: Well, so here's the story: Matriarch Babel recently agreed to let me bring Dad's... my father's remains, and those of my mother, to be buried in the Eternal Oasis.
Paimon: Oh? So that's a real place? Paimon thought that it was just a myth.
Jeht: Well, the last time we parted, I was so lost... I honestly didn't know where to start looking for it. Matriarch Babel, however, seems very sure that the Eternal Oasis lies in the middle of this desert...
Jeht: The Tanit tribe holds that the never-ending sandstorm at the heart of the desert conceals the Eternal Oasis.
Jeht: Unfortunately, that area has been sealed off by the tribe as a taboo place. No one can approach except scouts on patrol.
Paimon: Taboo...? Is it dangerous or something?
Jeht: Yes. Some older folks believe that ancient spirits roam there, hungering for souls and flesh... But that's probably just a myth. I don't believe it.
Traveler: Sounds like a terrifying place...
Jeht: Yeah, but I'm not afraid. I've seen lots of spooky stuff in my time. As long as my blade can strike it, I'm not afraid of it.
Jeht: As for things my blade can't strike, we'll just have to outrun it.
Jeht: Basically, I can bypass the taboos of the elders and explore the Eternal Oasis.
Jeht: That'll let me fulfill a long-cherished wish of mine, and secure the future of the tribe too. They believe that this is where the secrets of the mistress of flowers lie.
Jeht: If these secrets can be discovered... They'll give the tribe a new lease on life!
Jeht: I know that this is my duty and honor. But I've been thinking, and I've been getting this feeling that I should invite you to witness it with me.
Jeht: After all... since my father passed, that leaves you as my most trusted friends... the closest thing I have to family right now. That's why I wanted to ask you to join me on this wayward little trip of mine.
Paimon: Jeht... You can rest easy. Of course we'll help!
Traveler: We won't let a friend down.
Jeht: Thanks so much, you guys!
Jeht: Ahem... First, we need to go to the ruins of Gurabad to look for this "Jinni Fragment" thing...
Jeht: I don't quite understand it, but the tribe's stories say that she's the only one who knows how to open the way to the Oasis, so we'll have to find her...
Jeht: Umm... And that's all I can tell you, really. I think Azariq can tell you more. So... Shall we go?
Traveler: Let's.
Jeht: Okay, then we're off! I have so many other things I wanna say!
Traveler: I don't feel like leaving just yet...
Jeht: Well, if you want to hang around a little more, that's fine. I'm here. Whenever you want to go, I'll be right behind you.
Jeht: Heh... Having you around really puts me at ease. Azariq's supposed to be waiting for us at the Gurabad ruins, so let's take a break first before heading out, shall we?
Traveler: We didn't come all this way just to leave, you know.
Jeht: Hahaha, I knew you'd say that! You won't go unrewarded, rest assured!
Traveler: Why has Babel given you special permission, if I might ask?
Jeht: It's probably on account of that "afraid-of-nothing" attitude of mine that Matriarch Babel has taken special care of me...
Jeht: And it might also be because... I'm a "half-outsider," so I'm able to forego some of the taboos that the elders valued... That's what I think, anyway.
Traveler: Doesn't sound easy.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Jeht: Well? Are you ready to go?
Traveler: Yes, let's go.
Jeht: Okay, let's move out!
Traveler: Not yet. I still want to rest a bit.
Jeht: Be my guest. If you need anything, come to me anytime!
Traveler: About the Eternal Oasis...
Jeht: My father always dreamed of that place. I didn't know my mother very well... But she also kept records of it.
Jeht: They said they wanted to live in this place for the rest of their lives... So it must be an oasis of dreamlike beauty, I think.
Jeht: Hey, don't laugh at me for my rudimentary knowledge. I followed my dad on adventures and saw some impressive sights, but this was the only one that stuck with him...
Jeht: I wonder what kind of place it is...
Jeht: Alas... Haha, it's no use getting upset now. We'll find out when we step outside together!
Traveler: See you soon.
Jeht: Well, come back to me when you're ready to go!

### Additional Talk 2

Aderfi: Alright, alright. I've got my work to do, and you've got yours. There's no need to look around here anymore.

### Additional Talk 3

Masseira: If you need to see Jeht, you'll have to wait for Matriarch Babel... Why, you ask? Well, you'll see...

### Additional Talk 4

Yuften: G—Go see the Matriarch. I'm sure she and Jeht will be very h—happy to see you.

### Additional Talk 5

Aderfi: Ah, it's you...
Aderfi: You've already met the Matriarch? If you haven't gotten kicked out, that means you're our honored guest... Well, feel free to wander as you like, then.
Traveler: Are you a merchant?
Aderfi: Hmm? You've got a good eye, I must say. Yes, I am indeed a merchant. I sell the various things that the tribe lacks. Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools...
Aderfi: What would you like? If you should need something, I'll have it. And if I don't, just tell me what you need, and I'll get it for you, whether it's from the city, or even from Fontaine!
Aderfi: Ah... Right, you're an outsider. Well, in that case, you have my apologies, but my shop is not open to you.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: You've got lots of books here. May I read them?
Aderfi: The books? Oh! Right, those are here at the request of Matriarch Babel. I'm sure you've heard, and seen, that the city people have taken to using this thing called the Akasha, which they mount on their ears.
Aderfi: Their libraries have been emptied of a great number of obsolete books, and the Matriarch had me purchase and safe-keep them for everyone to read free of charge. Hmph... I operated at a loss there.
Aderfi: As for the Akasha, we did ship a set in from another tribe, but it was... very inconvenient to use, not to mention quite arcane indeed. We could not disassemble or repair it, for the wiring was too centralized...
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I'd say that reading books on your own is far better than relying on some strange machine to stuff information into your brain.
Aderfi: After all, who knows what back doors you might open if you just let people into the door of your mind?
Traveler: See you.
Aderfi: Don't let me get in your way.
Traveler: What are you selling here, anyway?
Aderfi: Straight to the point, hmm? I like buyers like you. Unfortunately, I don't sell to outsiders.
Aderfi: Um, this is not due to xenophobia or some kind of base prejudice. It's more that... Our tribe and the merchants in the cities don't share economic spheres, if you can glean my meaning?
Aderfi: I only serve the Tanit tribe, you know, as our exclusive distributer of goods. All trade and other transactions have to go through Matriarch Babel, and I take a small cut of that.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.

### Additional Talk 6

Masseira: Spoken to Babel, have you? Ah, she's probably busying herself somewhere else again... You would sooner stop the wind than stop her.
Masseira: Haha... You know, youngster, speaking of the wind... I'd like to remind you of a kind of desert wind that we call "Zibri."
Masseira: At first, you won't sense anything, until the sandstorm rises over the horizon, and the air itself begins to ascend and burn. Only then will you realize...
Masseira: ...That you can no longer smell anything, for the heated air has smothered your sense of smell, seared your nostrils...
Masseira: By then... Heh. By then, it will be too late.
Traveler: I'm afraid I didn't catch your drift...
Masseira: It's nothing... I just mean to say that you should be careful of the sandstorms.

### Additional Talk 7

Yuften: Those crocodiles are a v—very gentle... Still, be careful when you feed them...
Yuften: Watch your fingers...

### Additional Talk 8

Aderfi: Ah, it's you.
Aderfi: Matriarch Babel mentioned you previously, honored guest. Please, have a look around.
Traveler: Are you a merchant?
Aderfi: Hmm...? I thought I had already introduced myself... I sell the various things that the tribe lacks. Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools...
Aderfi: What would you like? If you should need something, I'll have it. And if I don't, just tell me what you need, and I'll get it for you, whether it's from the city, or even from Fontaine!
Aderfi: Ah... Right, you're an outsider. Well, in that case, you have my apologies, but my shop is not open to you.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: You've got lots of books here. May I read them?
Aderfi: Books? ...Oh, right, you mean the ones Matriarch Babel requested... See, it's been fashionable for city people to wear Akasha on their ears for some time. You must have seen them.
Aderfi: Their libraries have been emptied of a great number of obsolete books, and the Matriarch had me purchase and safe-keep them for everyone to read free of charge. Hmph... I operated at a loss there.
Aderfi: As for the Akasha, we did ship a set in from another tribe, but it was... very inconvenient to use, not to mention quite arcane indeed. We could not disassemble or repair it, for the wiring was too centralized...
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I'd say that reading books on your own is far better than relying on some strange machine to stuff information into your brain.

Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: About Benben...
Aderfi: Benben... Ah, you mean the little machine that follows Jeht around.
Aderfi: I've examined it before. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but as for how it can be restored to its former, energetic state...
Aderfi: I have my ways... but I don't think I could tell you.
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I think it's best that it stays with me till the repairs are done.
Aderfi: Anything else you'd like to ask me?

### Additional Talk 9

Yuften: Hello... Guest of Tanit...
Yuften: J—J—Jeht mentions you often. She's a good kid.
Traveler: What are you up to?
Yuften: Planting crops and f—feeding the fish. Sometimes, I also do some b—b—butchery. Crocodile skin and meat is v—very useful.
Yuften: We get clean spring water all year around h—here, so it's just right for raising crocodiles. Th—that's why we fenced this place up.
Yuften: Crocodiles are easy to care for, and they can be harvested for lots of skins and meat. Unfortunately, f—fields are a d—different story...
Traveler: You have fields around here?
Yuften: We do... but only for testing. Matriarch Babel invited some outsiders to c—c—come and provide us with Anahitian Blessing, and she got all these old books from the city...
Yuften: S—s—so we've tried our hand at farming according to the contents of these books.
Yuften: But the oases in the canyon are too narrow and lack nutrients. We need to find a way to f—fertilize the soil.
Traveler: Tell me about the Anahitian Blessing...
Yuften: The outsiders didn't want to reveal the fertilizer's composition. As such, we've had to rely on the people who provide it to f—fertilize the soil... which isn't good.
Yuften: Th—that's why the Matriarch wants me to d—do some research here to r—reverse engineer our own Anahitian Blessing.
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Yuften: Th—that's alright. Please take some crocodile jerky, dear guest. It's just over there...
Traveler: Crocodiles, you say!?
Yuften: Hehe, yes. I—I take care of them. These are quite large and obedient...
Yuften: This one's c—c—called Sedim. Very fierce and strong, and skin's very vibrant. It'll make for a good satchel. And there's that one, Karam. It's small but plump. Rather gentle, too.
