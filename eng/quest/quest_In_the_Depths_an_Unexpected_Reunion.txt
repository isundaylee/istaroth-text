# In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion


## Talk 1

Paimon: Looks like we can't explore any further... Hmm, is there any way to open up this tunnel?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hi there! You must be "Yuehui," right? We've been sent by the Adventurers' Guild.
Yuehui: Ah, great, good to meet you. Yes, I was the one who posted that commission.
Yuehui: Wait a second... You look kind of familiar. Are you a famous adventurer, or something?
Traveler: It's complicated.
Yuehui: Oh, uh, alright then. I'll start by introducing myself. I'm Yuehui, a miner, and I received a Mining Permit for The Chasm just recently. I have a handful of other guys in my crew.
Paimon: Seriously? They actually give permits out for The Chasm?
Yuehui: Yes, the folks over at Yujing Terrace finally came to their senses and are now allowing a limited amount of ore mining near the surface. We were among the first to gain approval.
Yuehui: But some things have happened recently that put all the miners on edge.
Paimon: Really? What happened? We haven't heard anything.
Yuehui: So... it's hard to say exactly how big of an issue it is. Could be something, could be nothing. The main thing is that it's just very... strange.
Yuehui: While one of the miners was on a break, he suddenly noticed a few hilichurls walking his way. They seemed like they were in a daze or something.
Yuehui: They walked right by him without giving him a single glance. They just made a beeline for the depths of The Chasm.
Yuehui: After that, the miner started observing his surroundings more closely, and noticed the same thing happening time and time again.
Paimon: Hmm... are the hilichurls just curious? Maybe they just wanna take a peek inside...
Yuehui: Not likely. The strange part is that in all the time this miner has been watching the hilichurls...
Yuehui: ...he's never seen any of them come back out.
Yuehui: It seems to be a one-way trip. Once the hilichurls go in, they never emerge again.
Yuehui: And it seems to be happening more and more frequently as of late.
Yuehui: "What are these hilichurls up to?" "What happens to them after they go inside?" "Is there a disaster brewing?"
Yuehui: These are the kinds of thoughts going through the guys' heads now. Everyone's driving themselves crazy worrying about it.
Paimon: Uhhh! Paimon's not surprised... Paimon feels spooked just hearing about it.
Traveler: I don't dare imagine what's going on inside The Chasm...
Yuehui: Exactly. The deepest fear is the fear of the unknown, you know? So we have to get to the bottom of it before everyone can put their minds at rest.
Paimon: Do we... do we really wanna take this commission? Um, thanks Mr. Miner, Sir, we need to consider it first—
Traveler: We'll take it.
Paimon: Hey! You could at least pretend to consider Paimon's opinion first!
Traveler: When strange things like this happen...
Paimon: Oh, so that's where you're coming from. Hmm, well okay then, maybe we will find some clues about your twin.
Paimon: You'll really regret it if you don't go, huh?
Yuehui: So, what's your verdict? Will you take the commission? No pressure, but I gotta say... I'm not loving the prospect of my Mining Permit going to waste.
Paimon: Yup, we'll take it. We're kinda curious ourselves now, too.
Yuehui: Great. You're doing me an enormous service here. Now, let me give you the rough location that the hilichurls keep heading to...
Traveler: I'm inclined to think the Abyss Order is involved.
Traveler: "Strange" is definitely the right word...
Traveler: Never mind that. Let's focus on the task at hand.

## Talk 3

Paimon: What the... It's a city?
Paimon: A whole city that's... floating in the air... upside down!?
Traveler: I'm at a loss for words.
Paimon: #Just look at this place, Traveler... Doesn't it remind you of something?
Paimon: Wait, what was it again...
Traveler: "The Defiled Statue."
Paimon: Yes, that's it! It's just like that. Just as strange, just as upside-down, and just as spooky.
Paimon: In which case... Maybe whatever's going on in The Chasm really is connected to the Abyss Order.
Paimon: Oh, we gotta get to the bottom of this...
Paimon: ...Oh...
Dainsleif: ...
Traveler: Dainsleif!?
Dainsleif: The feeling is mutual. I certainly hadn't expected to meet you here, either.
Paimon: Long time no see, Dain... Wait, but how did you suddenly end up here in The Chasm?
Dainsleif: The Chasm? So, we're in the depths of The Chasm, are we. Interesting... This is one place where I have never set foot before.
Traveler: I have a lot of questions for you.
Dainsleif: I understand how you must feel. Last time, we met suddenly and parted hastily.
Dainsleif: Now our paths cross again... Fate, it seems, owes you an explanation.
Traveler: First, tell me what you're doing here.
Dainsleif: That much should be self-explanatory. I came upon the trail of another Abyss Herald recently, and began pursuing it.
Dainsleif: Unfortunately, I got as far as cornering him before he resorted to the same trick that they all do...
Dainsleif: I was hot on his heels when I followed him through the portal, but as usual, it was to no avail. It took me to the wrong place.
Traveler: So you had the same issue with the portal last time?
Dainsleif: Correct. Based on my recent experiences, I can only conclude that the Abyss's portals are not simply pathways from point A to point B, but gateways to an entire network.
Dainsleif: Where they emerge on the other side is their choice. It can be anywhere within the network.
Paimon: Sounds kinda similar to how Teleport Waypoints work...
Dainsleif: In short, though I was right behind your twin last time when I entered that portal, the next moment that I realized where I was...
Dainsleif: ...I was all alone, back in the ruins known as Stormterror's Lair.
Paimon: Oh yeah, about that — whatever happened to the eye of the first Field Tiller?
Dainsleif: It's in a safe place. You can be sure that I will learn the truth of the "Loom of Fate" operation sooner than it could ever fall into the Abyss Order's hands.
Traveler: Why don't you tell me who you really are?
Dainsleif: Hah. So that title stuck in your memory.
Dainsleif: I by no means went out of my way to conceal it from you. It once stood for the glory of Khaenri'ah, but now...
Dainsleif: ...It is but a cruel joke. My curse to bear.
Dainsleif: Twilight Sword was my title as captain of the Royal Guards when I witnessed the destruction of my entire homeland firsthand. I believe my reluctance to raise it in conversation is quite justified.
Paimon: #Sounds like your {F#brother}{M#sister} was right...
Traveler: #What is the history between you and my {F#brother}{M#sister}?
Dainsleif: We were travel partners.
Dainsleif: We both partook in a painful journey of searching for our fate, but regrettably... we did not make it to the journey's end together.
Traveler: The journey's end...
Dainsleif: Before you continue questioning me, I ought to warn you...
Dainsleif: If my suspicions regarding the portal network are correct, then the fact that there is a portal leading here tells us that the Abyss Order has their eyes on this location.
Paimon: You mean the Abyss Order is plotting something here? Actually, Paimon and the Traveler suspected that, too.
Dainsleif: I mean that it's highly likely that even as we speak, the Abyss Order is watching our every move.
Paimon: Uhh, don't say that! You're giving Paimon goosebumps!
Traveler: Let's go and investigate.
Dainsleif: Huh, a wise choice. There appears to be light from a fire coming from near that rocky wall. Let's take a look.
Traveler: I'll trust you. For now.
Traveler: What happened between you?
Traveler: Who is the "Twilight Sword"?
Traveler: #So you didn't actually catch up with my {F#brother}{M#sister} last time?
Traveler: What was going on with that portal just now?
Traveler: I was not expecting that.
Traveler: This is not what I was expecting...

## Talk 4

Yuehui: It took a huge amount of work to get this Mining Permit... I hope it was worth it. The rest is up to you.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Is this where that miner guy wanted us to investigate?
Paimon: #Just look at this place, Traveler... Doesn't it remind you of something?
Paimon: Wait, what was it again...
