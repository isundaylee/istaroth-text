# Talk Dialog

Collei: Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
Traveler: Greetings.
Collei: #It's {NICKNAME}! Whatcha doing here?
Traveler: Here to see you, Collei.
Lisa: Do you come to visit Collei often, cutie?
Collei: #{M#He}{F#She}'s amazing. All of us in Gandharva Ville already have a lot to thank {M#him}{F#her} for.
Traveler: Collei and I are very good friends.
Lisa: Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
Collei: And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
Collei: Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
Collei: Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Kaeya? Oh, and Jean?
Lisa: Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
Lisa: Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
Traveler: And we meet again, Lisa.
