Traveler: Is this a personal interest or is it purely academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it be both?
Kimiya: My mentor kept shaking their head after I said that according to legend, Alchemical Divination was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali. But I don't think it's time to give up yet.
Kimiya: I just need to work out the rationale for this interpretation, even the tiniest one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
