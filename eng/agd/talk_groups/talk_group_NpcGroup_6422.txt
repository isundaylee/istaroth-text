Semino: Music is the language of the soul.
Semino: ...Mm, communicating is tough, but I'm sure the Wayob can see things my way.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there a language barrier of sorts?
Semino: Ah... Well, communicating across languages requires a little more time and effort, yeah.
Semino: After all, each instrument has its own character.
Semino: Calm, mellow, lively, and those that love to steal the show. Finding a stage where they can coexist in harmony is tough stuff.
Semino: The Iridescence Tour is what's got my eye right now. If I had a chance to talk with the organizers, I'm sure we'd have a fruitful time!

## Talk

Traveler: I'll help you ask the Wayob when I get the chance.
Semino: Really, you'd do that for me? There's no need. I was just kidding!
