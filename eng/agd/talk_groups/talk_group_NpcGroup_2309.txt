Traveler: Do you wanna play with me?
Little You: Ooh, can I, can I!? Now I don't have to play with my shadow! ...Okay, let's play hide-and-seek! Hide-and-seeeek!
Little You: Little Liu, Little Xing, and Dongdong always want to play that but everyone wants to hide and no one wants to seek.
Little You: Okay, first we'll go hide and then the game will start. No peeking! ...Wait, I still need to tell the others...
Little You: #QUICK! HIDE! HE'S COMING!!!

Little You: Thanks for the offer, but I can do it.
Little You: I'm the one my whole family worries about, and I've had enough of it.

Little You: My big brother is the smartest person I know. He can do anything I ask him to! But even he couldn't catch my shadow...
