## Talk 2

Chef Mao: Eh, is it really that simple? On second thought...

## Talk 3

Chef Mao: No problem. Next time. Few things work out the way we want on the first try.

## Talk 4

Chef Mao: That's amazing. Well, next time I'll make some snacks and we'll have fun while we eat.

## Talk 5

Chef Mao: I often play a few rounds with the regulars of Wanmin Restaurant. The peppers are still pretty spicy, hahaha.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Any recommendations?
Chef Mao: Black-Back Perch Stew is our signature dish. Sure, you might find it in other restaurants too, but I guarantee you it won't taste anywhere near as good as ours.
Chef Mao: A generous helping of fish, cooked with a special blend of chili oil made from Jueyun Chili and Violetgrass. Beautifully tender, bursting with flavor. I've never had a single complaint from anyone who's eaten it!
Chef Mao: ...It's a little spicy for some people, though, so not all would eat it in the first place.
Chef Mao: Why not have a taste? If you like it, you can always buy some more.

## Talk 7

Chef Mao: Here for the Wanmin Restaurant experience? Hi, I'm Chef Mao. Everyone in Chihu Rock will have heard of me.

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Yes, that's correct. A while ago, a customer named Tingfang ordered a bowl of Jewelry Soup from me. He paid in advance, saying that he wanted it delivered to the Dunyu Ruins.
Chef Mao: I still need to man the restaurant, so I don't have time to make the delivery. It would be great if you're willing to go in my place.

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Ah, right. Yes, someone named Tingfang did order Jade Parcels from me.
Chef Mao: He paid quite promptly, and asked that I deliver it to him near Guyun Stone Forest at a later time.
Chef Mao: But I need to man the restaurant at the moment. So, could you deliver it to him for me?

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. A kid named Zi'rui ordered Mora Meat from us.
Chef Mao: He wanted us to deliver it to a place near Luhua Pool.
Chef Mao: Since I have my hands full manning the restaurant at the moment, could you help me with that delivery?

### Talk 7 related talk 3

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Indeed. A fellow named Tingfang ordered some Jueyun Chili Chicken and asked for a delivery.
Chef Mao: This Jueyun Chili Chicken won't hold up if you *fly or climb all over the place, if you touch anything elements, or if you take too long*. Neglect one of these and you could ruin the taste.
Chef Mao: If something happens along the way, come back here and I'll make another serving. Whatever you do, don't bring the name of Wanmin Restaurant down.

### Talk 7 related talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: A guest named Ling'guan ordered some Come And Get It from us, mentioning that it should be delivered to Jueyun Karst at a later time.
Chef Mao: As if Jueyun Karst was a border that ordinary mortals could trespass!
Chef Mao: Ahem. Well, whatever the case, could you help us deliver this order to Jueyun Karst? Let's see if we can get it there in time.

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. That boy Zi'rui ordered some Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup from us. As I recall, he should be off wandering in the Guyun Stone Forest right about now.
Chef Mao: So many young people, all headed out to that weird place — what is Liyue coming to nowadays?
Chef Mao: Whatever the case may be, could I trouble you to deliver this meal to him? *Just don't fly about too much,* or the soup'll spill out.

### Talk 7 related talk 6

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: You heard correctly. Someone named Tingfang ordered a serving of Jewelry Soup earlier before heading off to Qingxu Pool.
Chef Mao: I don't know what matter he needs to attend to, but I can say with confidence that you can't find any fault with our Jewelry Soup.
Chef Mao: Could I trouble you to deliver this Jewelry Soup for me? *Just try not to use your wind glider to get there*, or some of the soup might spill.

Traveler: Tell me more about the Wanmin Restaurant.
Chef Mao: Well, I'm the chef. I may not be quite the culinary legend that my daughter is, but you can be sure the Wanmin Restaurant is a cut above all those time-honored brands you see around!

Chef Mao: Your daughter?
Chef Mao: That's right — Xiangling! My dear daughter, and my best apprentice ever.
Chef Mao: I only taught Xiangling how to cook so that she could inherit the Wanmin Restaurant from me one day. I had no idea she'd turn out to be such a pro. Her abilities far exceed my own.
Chef Mao: But she's more than just an excellent chef. She has a real gift for innovation — she's constantly creating all these wonderful new dishes. That really sets her apart from what the time-honored brands do. And it makes her dishes all the more special for people who are used to traditional cuisine.
Chef Mao: I started to worry that the restaurant might be too constricting for her. So I sent her off for a while to do some exploring and perfect her art.
Chef Mao: If anyone is going to revolutionize Liyue cuisine in the future, it'll be her. No doubt about it!

### Talk 9 related talk 1

Traveler: How's business going?
Chef Mao: Oh, come on. How could business here at Wanmin Restaurant's be slow?
Chef Mao: One taste of our handiwork will turn most people into regulars.
Chef Mao: ...Speaking of regulars, we've had a young lady with a strange headdress come in pretty often lately. The vegetarian dishes on our menu seem quite to her taste.
Chef Mao: But I've noticed that she only ever orders the vegetarian dishes, and in very small amounts, too.
Chef Mao: I gave her a larger portion out of sympathy, but she seemed quite reluctant to accept it. Is she trying to maintain her physique? Young ladies nowadays really are serious about such things...

### Talk 9 related talk 2

Chef Mao: Which type of cuisine do you do?
Chef Mao: Type of cuisine? Oh, we don't bother ourselves with that kind of thing here.
Chef Mao: Li style and Yue style are all Zhongyuan Chop Suey to us.
Chef Mao: We just concern ourselves with making the most delicious food imaginable using everyday ingredients, universally loved flavors, and truly excellent cooking.
Chef Mao: Food exists to feed the hungry. It's that simple. These people who go putting systems and frameworks around everything are just amateurs that are overcompensating... They don't understand what cooking is really all about.
