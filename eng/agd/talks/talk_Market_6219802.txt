Traveler: Market?
Tu: That's right, I've heard people say that The Chasm is about to be bought over by the Yanshang Teahouse and turned into a grand market.
Tu: I'm not overstating things, either. A couple of days earlier, I came across some people from Yanshang Teahouse who'd come looking for Muning the manager.
Tu: So, just by chance, I heard them discussing some kind of monetary transaction.
Tu: How did it go again...? Let me think.
Tu: "Thanks to the second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, I was able to raise this sum of Mora. And I would also like to thank you representatives of the Yanshang Teahouse for making a trip down to this quiet spot specifically."
Tu: I mean, just listen to that. They must mean that Muning's been in contact with Yanshang Teahouse to liven this place up in collaboration with the Feiyun Commerce Guild, am I right?
