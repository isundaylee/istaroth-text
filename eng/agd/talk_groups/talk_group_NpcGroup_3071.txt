Li Xiao: Ah, my homeland...
Li Xiao: ...Hmm? What do you need?

## Talk

Traveler: Why did you sigh?
Li Xiao: Sorry that you had to see that. I just... can't hold my homesickness back anymore.
Li Xiao: I came to Inazuma as a representative of our merchant guild, but I got stranded because of the Sakoku Decree.
Li Xiao: The merchant guild didn't want to give up on the business foundation that they have built throughout these years, so they forced me to stay here.
Li Xiao: ...I thought the lockdown would only last several months before it got lifted. I never expected it to go on for so long.
Li Xiao: I don't even know if my lover and my parents are okay back home or not, alas...

## Talk

Traveler: About your homeland...
Li Xiao: I grew up in Liyue Harbor. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing business everywhere.
Li Xiao: It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
Li Xiao: I wanted to go home after this trip, but that got canned by the lockdown in Inazuma...
Li Xiao: Even more surprisingly, my mischievous little sister snuck out of doors and boarded the same boat bound for Inazuma.
Li Xiao: Ah, if I don't take good care of her, how can I face my parents?

Traveler: Goodbye.
Li Xiao: Yeah, see you!

## Talk

Li Xiao: Oh, archons be praised! At last, I gaze upon my homeland once more!

## Talk

Traveler: Congratulations.
Li Xiao: Thank you! I just... couldn't hold my feelings of homesickness back anymore.
Li Xiao: Before this, I went to Inazuma as a representative of our merchant guild, but I got stranded there because of the Sakoku Decree.
Li Xiao: The merchant guild didn't want to give up on the business foundation that they had built throughout the years, so they forced me to stay there.
Li Xiao: ...I thought the lockdown would only last several months before it got lifted. I never expected that it would have gone on till recently.
Li Xiao: Laugh if you like, but the moment I saw my parents and lover again, my eyes just started brimming over with tears...

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a bit more about yourself...
Li Xiao: I grew up in Liyue Harbor. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing business everywhere.
Li Xiao: It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
Li Xiao: Now that I've finally returned home after being stuck in Inazuma for all this time, I've had some time to think things over.
Li Xiao: I've decided to only do business in Liyue for the time being. I might earn less, but I'll be able to spend more time with my family.

Traveler: See you.
Li Xiao: Mmhmm, goodbye.
