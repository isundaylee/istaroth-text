# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Neuvillette: If you mean what I'd like to do right now, I think I would enjoy taking a nice walk.
Neuvillette: But, if you're asking about the long-term, then I'd want all life to be able to live on in the original forms that are rightfully theirs.
Neuvillette: It's merely that... as of now, even existence in such a natural state must be fought for most fiercely.
Traveler: Sounds kinda intense.
Neuvillette: You're right. I'm saying that more for myself to hear than anything else.
Neuvillette: If you too find yourself subject to grave injustice, yet bound by rules that are twisted and warped...
Neuvillette: You must be willing to step up and right those wrongs.
Neuvillette: If you cannot break free from the eggshell, the world is naught but a prison where you are blinded and confined.
Neuvillette: Don't be afraid of bleak desolation and poverty outside the prison, and don't fret about your stable rations being cut off once the prison is destroyed.
Neuvillette: Outside that world... I'll always be waiting for you.
Traveler: Okay, I'll remember that.
