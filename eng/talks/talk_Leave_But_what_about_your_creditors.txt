Traveler: Leave? But what about your creditors?
Brek: They really took me for a ride with this loan. When I borrowed that sum, I had no idea they'd come up with so many terms and charge me interest that was sky high.
Brek: If I were only expected to pay back the principal, I wouldn't exactly be overjoyed, but I could accept it. But now they're telling me that the interest alone has grown to three times the principal!
Brek: If they think I'm gonna pay that, they're delusional. I was hoodwinked. This was never my debt to begin with!
