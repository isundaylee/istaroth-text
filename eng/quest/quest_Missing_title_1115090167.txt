# Missing title (1115090167)

Traveler: What kind of dishes are you looking for?
Matsumoto: Simpler dishes do a better job at revealing the chef's true mastery over the culinary arts.
Matsumoto: For example, these Egg Rolls from the Kiminami Restaurant. The dish needs to be at least of this level for it to be worthy of my critique.
Matsumoto: If you can't make something of this level, then I suggest you give up, as you are only wasting my time.
