Traveler: What fighting style is that?
Flash-Fist Ling: "Of all the martial faculties in the world, speed reigns supreme"!
Flash-Fist Ling: Do you not know? This is called the Dance of the Frenzied Turtle!
Flash-Fist Ling: Check it out — was that fast or what!?
Traveler: I didn't see anything...
Flash-Fist Ling: Hmph, your mind can't believe your eyes, that's all!
Flash-Fist Ling: The reason you didn't see it is that I was too fast for you! Now is that fast or what!?
Traveler: Does this have any practical applications?
Flash-Fist Ling: Whether it does or not, it is right to practice it! I am not merely learning a martial art form — I am heeding divine guidance in pursuit of the Way!
Flash-Fist Ling: All in all, I've spent tens of thousands of Mora on this! As long as I practice it, it'll all be worth it. Right!?
