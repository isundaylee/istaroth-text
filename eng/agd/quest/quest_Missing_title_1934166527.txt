# Missing title (1934166527)

Chasca: No wonder I had a nagging feeling that I should come over and have a look... Well met, "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini."
Chasca: Let me guess. You're here for the Flower-Feather Clan's warrior trial?
Traveler: That's right. I'm here to certify its difficulty!
Chasca: You won't be disappointed, then. I've got nothing but the highest standards for Qucusaur Riders.
Chasca: Teaching's not my strong suit, so when I was invited to design these stages, I went with "recalling tough challenges and piling them in one after the other."
Chasca: The result was... a ninety-nine percent failure rate on the part of our tribe's warriors â€” on the first stage, no less. As a result... There wasn't any choice but to take Irade's advice and tune the difficulty down a notch.
Chasca: But I doubt that even the trials as they originally stood would have truly stretched you. If we wanted that... We'd have to go with situations even I would prove helpless in.
Traveler: Thanks for the kind words, but I don't need special treatment!
Chasca: No, I do believe you worthy of such respect. I'm no teacher, but I've never misjudged the strength of those I meet.
Chasca: And as far as yours is concerned... only the most trying of challenges would befit you.
Traveler: I need to consider the stages' suitability for ordinary warriors, though...
Chasca: ...Fair enough. You've got a task to complete, and we'll have more opportunities in the future.
Chasca: One day, I'll lay out a banquet table of battle that "transcends" the pinnacle of Qucusaur Rider ability, just for you.
Traveler: The universality of the stages is not to be overlooked either!
Traveler: Haha, don't put me on a pedestal, now!
Traveler: I could've come for you, for all you know.
Chasca: Oh? That so...
Chasca: So you wanna "transcend" my record, then? That's just my speed. I'll have you know that I started by stuffing these stages full of tough challenges that I've faced in the past.
