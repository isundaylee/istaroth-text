Nilou: In a funny way, what you're doing here in this domain reminds me of my dance practice at the Grand Bazaar.
Nilou: Maybe you dance with danger, and I dance for artistic reasons... But we both share the same desire to perform our best.
Nilou: Of course, this is your show. So in here... you lead, and I'll follow.
