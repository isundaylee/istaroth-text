Traveler: And you are...
Zakai: I'm a fisherman and a fresh fish wholesaler. I mainly supply seafood to restaurants in Sumeru City.
Zakai: I also provide research materials for several researchers of Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta.
Zakai: My buyers are all long-time clients, and our cooperation has always gone smoothly. It's just that I have to dig in my heels whenever it comes to the price of replenishing their stock...
Zakai: I keep thinking to myself, why should larger quantities be cheaper? Are my crates of fish not all of the same quality?
Zakai: If I start giving out discounts all willy-nilly, won't my buyers worry that there may be problems with my products?
