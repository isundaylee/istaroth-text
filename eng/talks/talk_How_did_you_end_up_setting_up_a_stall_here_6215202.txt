Traveler: How did you end up setting up a stall here?
Old Chou: *sigh* Well, it's a long story. I was once a Treasure Hoarder, doing some business near The Chasm. Uh, please, put your sword away. I've turned over a new life and gone legit.
Old Chou: Of course, I did have some Mora stashed away when I split from the crew, but it all went down the drain after a while due to... some circumstances. As such, I was forced to set up shop here and earn a little cash that way.
