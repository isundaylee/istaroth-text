Wei: Mr. Qiang! I wish to purchase a weapon for self-defense, as I shall be embarking on a journey within the foreseeable future! What would you advise for someone of my stature?
Mr. Qiang: Let's see... A feeble gait, spindly legs, zero core strength, no fighting instinct, lily-livered; hopeless at offense and useless in defense...
Mr. Qiang: I would strongly advise you against buying a weapon from here, because of the disgrace you would surely bring to my store's reputation if you ever did have the misfortune of being set upon by bandits.
Wei: ...
Mr. Qiang: Ugh. Okay, well, look. A good-quality sword would be wasted on you, so I would strongly advise you to invest in a crossbow instead.
Wei: What I'm hearing you say is... I have a natural gift for archery. Is that...?
Mr. Qiang: Look lad, you're vastly overestimating your ability level here. My six-year-old grandson took this crossbow with him when we went hunting in the hills the other day, and he took down a half-decent-sized boar with it.
Mr. Qiang: Now. I admit you might not have his burly physique or martial prowess, and we have to factor in that you're a clumsy one, too. But if you were attacking from behind, with the element of surprise, I think that even you would have a one-in-ten chance of hitting your target armed with this thing.
Wei: ...That was incredibly painful to hear.
Mr. Qiang: Don't like what I have to say? I'm afraid if you want to be a fighter, you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, boy! Don't expect your confidence to come from other people fawning over you...
Wei: But... I don't want to be a fighter or anything, it's just for self-defense...

Wei: Hello, are you a fellow fan of the opera?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the opera.
Wei: You're not from around here are you? Lots of the people at the Heyu Tea House have come specially to watch the opera there. Especially when the renowned house actress Yun Jin is performing!
Wei: She has an immaculate physique and spellbinding presence... Her voice is so powerful and every movement she makes just seems effortless...
Wei: It's a shame I'm going on a trip soon as it'll be a long time before I get to see her perform again. *sigh*

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Wei: Hey! You can't leave halfway through, it's poor etiquette...

Wei: How's it going, having a good time?
Wei: If you're new in town you should definitely check out the gala at the Town Square. It's the perfect opportunity to sample all sorts of local Liyue delicacies.
