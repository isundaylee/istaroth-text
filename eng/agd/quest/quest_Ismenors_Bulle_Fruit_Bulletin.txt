# Ismenor's Bulle Fruit Bulletin


## Talk 1

Ismenor: Are you out here on a stroll as well?
Traveler: About Bulle Fruit...
Ismenor: Ah, my young friend, have you brought any Bulle Fruit? Please, share it with me, and we can eat while we talk.
Ismenor: Statues are wordless poems, so one shouldn't appreciate them on an empty stomach. A duelist told me so, during the final duel of his life.
Traveler: Bulle Fruit is ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Ismenor: I even did as advised, and set aside some Mora to thank you for the Bulle Fruit. I suppose I should wait until you've got the fruit to give it to you...

## Talk 2

Ismenor: Thank you. Looking at your expression, you seem interested in that duelist? Well, it was a long time ago...
Ismenor: (Falls into a pensive state)
