Traveler: Are you the Electro Crystal guy?
Sanden: Oh, you must be here about the commission I posted?

Traveler: Got them here.

Traveler: Masks for festivals...
Sanden: Oh, don't take it the wrong way. You don't have to wear a mask to the festival, and I'm not forcing you to buy anything.
Sanden: Masks used to be mainly used for ceremonial affairs, but nowadays it's become a festival staple.
Sanden: There are many types of masks, each with its own unique points. I've been referencing different things to improve my mask-making craftsmanship.
Sanden: In the legends, the monster-slaying yaksha of Liyue always wore a special kind of mask. As curious as I am... I probably won't ever get to see them with my own eyes...
Sanden: It'd be great if I could take a look at a tengu mask too...

Traveler: Long time no see, Mister.
Sanden: Wow, it really has been a while. Did you have fun with Miss Kamisato at the festival last time?
Sanden: Haha, it wasn't as lively because it was getting a little too late, but it's good that you guys had fun.
Sanden: If you two come to the festival again, it'd make me really happy if you could wear the masks that I made!

Traveler: A tengu mask, huh?
Sanden: Yep, I'm talking about the mask that the tengu usually wear. It's normally red and said to be a symbol of their identity. In ancient times, they used it to intimidate others, too.
Sanden: Madam Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission wears one such mask on her head.
Sanden: But tengu masks are normally carried on a tengu's person. One can only look at them from afar with no real opportunity to take a closer look...
Sanden: *sigh* What a shame... If I had the chance to study one up close, I should be able to learn a lot from it...
