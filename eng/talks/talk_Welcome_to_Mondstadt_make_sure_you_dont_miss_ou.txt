Lawrence: Welcome to Mondstadt â€” make sure you don't miss out on the Windblume Festival!
Lawrence: The Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt, and the legend of the Windblume carries still to this day.
Lawrence: Even now, most Mondstadters believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time.
Lawrence: Of course, there are also the more traditional amongst the Mondstadters who think that the key purpose behind the Windblume Festival is to celebrate Mondstadt's liberation. For them, this festival is more suited toward remembrance than love.
Lawrence: I believe that both these perspectives are fine. Everyone should get to choose the way they wish to celebrate.
Lawrence: I hope that everyone can find their own joy during this Windblume Festival, including you! Happy Windblume Festival, friend!
