# Blazin' Trails


## Talk 1

Xinyan: This is the Glacial Spring Water you were looking for.

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: Xinyan sprinkles the flower with spring water...
Blazing Heart: I'm feeling a lot better now. Thank you very much.
Blazing Heart: Now, I'll send you to your destination.
Paimon: Whoa!

## Talk 3

Mona: Argh, I'm going to lose my hat...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm? This scent... I think we've arrived at a mountain near Liyue.
Paimon: But it's so dark here...
Xinyan: Wait, listen, there's a voice... Can you hear that?

## Talk 4

Xinyan's Mother: The reason the birds sing so sweetly is because they drink the spring water from up on mountaintops. Xinyan, we're not singers in this family, none of us are. What makes you think you can be any different?
Xinyan: Oh, so I just need to go drink some of this spring water, and then I'll be able to sing? I'll be right back, Mama!

## Talk 5

Xinyan's Father: You mustn't stay out so late in the mountains by yourself, child! You scared the bejesus out of me! ...Here, this is the spring water you were looking for.
Xinyan: Really? Oh, you're the best, daddy!

## Talk 6

Xinyan's Mother: Where did she run off to this time?
Xinyan's Father: To find somewhere she could sing, no doubt. *sigh* She can't be persuaded, and we can't stop her from walking out the door. Did you really have to lie to her like that?
Xinyan's Mother: How was I supposed to know she'd go running off looking for spring water! *sigh* When is she going to come to her senses...

## Talk 7

Dock Worker: Get down from there! You can't set up a stage here! If you can't sing, you should be keeping your mouth shut, not putting on a public performance! Ugh.
Xinyan: Aaaah, don't tear down the stage!

## Talk 8

Uncle Zhu: Xinyan, my dear child, why are you playing that crass instrument again? It's not ladylike.
Jixiang: Oh, Xinyan, your mother has asked me to teach you some embroidery when I can find the time. It's an elegant and enjoyable craft. Just come to Auntie's house whenever you're free.
Uncle Hai: Quit making that racket by the side of the road! If you have to play, play something classy!
Paimon: Wh—Why are they being so mean!?
Mona: Ugh, these people...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Paimon: ARGH! That's it! Why are you not yelling back? What happened to your rock 'n' roll spirit?
Xinyan: Hehe...
Paimon: And now you're laughing!? Aren't you mad?
Xinyan: Sometimes it's hard to get mad when you hear the same thing a hundred times. Still... thanks, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Uh what?
Xinyan: Auntie Jixiang, how are you doing?
Jixiang: Oh, dear child, I've been waiting to hear from you for a long time. This weekend, I'll be free...
Xinyan: Auntie, stop thinking about me for a hot sec, your stove is still on, and you're cooking soup, right? Hmm... you see, it's all burnt.
Jixiang: Oh! How did this happen!?
Xinyan: Oh my, Uncle Zhu, Little Zhu is playing in the mud by the river again! Didn't you tell him to not do that?
Uncle Zhu: What? That rascal is up to his old shenanigans behind my back again, is he? Oh, well, we'll see about that!
Xinyan: Hehehe...
Xinyan: Sorry, Uncle Hai, I'll move my stage someplace else. But, your musical taste needs to evolve if you wanna keep up with the times.
Xinyan: Maybe you didn't know, but even the most famous opera singer in Liyue likes listening to my boorish music.
Uncle Hai: What did you say? Is that true? You're not making this up, are you? Huh, I'll have to look into this.
Mona: They're all gone...
Xinyan: See? Knowing the right words to say and when to smile can solve almost any problem.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If that's the case, then what's your rock 'n' roll spirit for?
Xinyan: My rock 'n' roll spirit isn't something I just use to win an argument. That'd be a real waste.
Xinyan: Rock 'n' roll is a revolution! Transforming your identity and destiny, saying goodbye to concessions and cowardice... it does them all. And most importantly, it lets you do it with art rather than words!
Xinyan: My rock 'n' roll has an unbreakable spirit, like a flame in a rainstorm that refuses to go out, or the magma that never stops boiling under the surface of the land.
Xinyan: Okay, let's go.
Xinyan: Let's go that way! There's a side path right there.

## Talk 9

Little Fei: *sobs* Why don't Little Meng and Little Lulu want to play with me?

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey, is that...
Mona: Another door. More delightful individuals await us on the other side, I assume?
Xinyan: Let me handle it. Piece of cake.
Little Fei: Miss, your hairstyle is really strange.
Xinyan: Is that so? I think it looks really cool. Take a closer look if you don't believe me.
Little Fei: Your hair sticks out from your head, and you wear spiky things in it... nobody else has hair like that.
Xinyan: You're looking at it the wrong way. If I don't look like anybody else, once you've seen me, you won't be able to forget me even if you try. You'll still recognize me if you ever see me again in the future.
Little Fei: Hmm... yeah, you're right!
Xinyan: Your clothes, hair, even the way you walk and talk... It's not just for the eyes of others. It's your style, so you should go with whatever you like.
Little Fei: Really? But if I wore a jacket with a picture of a puppy on it, people would say, "Hey, Little Fei likes stupid little puppies."
Xinyan: Then you should ignore them. So, you like puppies, huh?
Little Fei: I do.
Xinyan: What about your friends?
Little Fei: Well... yeah, they do too.
Xinyan: Well then, your friends are gonna love that jacket.
Little Fei: ...'Kay. Miss, how come you don't do your hair in a nice braid? People would love that.
Xinyan: I can't help myself, I just like the styles with personality. *sigh* Plus I had no idea how so many people would dislike it before I started wearing my hair like this.
Little Fei: So why don't you change it now?
Xinyan: Well, this hairstyle suits my music and my lifestyle. The regular ones are boring, they're so uninspired. Plus they get in the way when I'm head-bobbing away on stage.
Xinyan: If people don't like it, that's up to them. I ain't gonna change it.
Little Fei: What about your friends? Do they not like it, too?
Xinyan: Course they like it! They all say that they think it looks amazing.
Little Fei: ...Your friends are nice to you. That's cool. Not like my friends... they left me here on my own. *sobs*
Xinyan: Hey now, why are you crying? What's wrong? You can talk to me.
Little Fei: Little Lulu and Little Meng... they're ignoring me... *sobs* We were gonna meet at the docks today, but they still haven't shown up...
Paimon: These kids are way too young to be standing each other up like this!
Xinyan: Stay right here, I'll go take a look around. I'll bring them to you once I find them.
Little Fei: O—Okay! Thanks, Miss. I'll never say anything bad about your hair again.
Xinyan: See, now you're talkin' sense! I'll see you later.

## Talk 11

Xinyan: Excuse me, are you Little Meng? Little Fei is waiting for you at the docks. He's been waiting so long now that he's in tears about it.
Little Meng: Ugh! Why is he so dumb, he could have just come here and found us... Never mind, I'll go find him instead.
Paimon: He ran off. We should catch up to him.

## Talk 12

Xinyan: Excuse me, are you Little Lulu?
Little Lulu: Are you looking for me, Miss?
Xinyan: Didn't you promise to meet Little Fei at the docks? Why aren't you going to meet up with him? He's crying 'cause he thinks you've abandoned him.
Little Lulu: Huh? That silly dumb-dumb, why didn't he just come to look for us? We prepared a surprise gift for him.
Paimon: A surprise gift? How strange...

## Talk 13

Little Lulu: You dumb-dumb, we were preparing a surprise gift for you! We didn't think that you wouldn't come to try and find us... and definitely didn't think you'd start crying about it...
Little Fei: I'm sorry for being such an idiot...
Little Lulu: No, I'm sorry! You're not an idiot. I guess we shouldn't have been so secretive about it.
Little Meng: We didn't come to the docks to meet you because we wanted to give you a big surprise for your birthday.
Little Fei: Huh? This is...
Little Meng: We've brought you loads of yummy Lotus Heads. And here's a handwritten birthday letter from me and Lulu, too... please don't call our handwriting ugly, okay?
Little Lulu: Tee-hee!
Little Fei: You guys... Hehe, thank you...
Paimon: Whew... and all's well that ends well!
Kaedehara Kazuha: It was all just a misunderstanding.
Xinyan: Well, sometimes that's just what friends do. If my friends had ditched me to plan a surprise, I'd have gotten upset too.
Mona: Is that a hint for us to prepare a surprise for you, too? Very clever...
Xinyan: No! I was just speaking my mind...
Mona: Hehe, I know. I was just joking... seeing if I could give you a fright.
Paimon: Uh... everyone... Paimon's hungry...
Traveler: That rumble had no business being that loud!
Xinyan: It's almost lunchtime, so how about... we have lunch at my house? It's not far from here.
Paimon: So even your house is in this mirage?
Xinyan: Yep. I just noticed, there's the same road in here as the one that leads to my house in real life.
Xinyan: Even though we're in a mirage, I reckon some things will always remain the same. In real life, after a bad quarrel with the neighbors, or a disappointing show...
Xinyan: The one place I'll always go is my house. Because... everyone has to go home eventually.

## Talk 14

Xinyan: Here we are. Please come in! Make yourselves at home, no need to take off your shoes!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you for your hospitality.
Mona: Oh, chairs! We can finally unwind for a bit.
Xinyan: Huh? Did you guys hear a sound coming from the other room...? You all keep resting here, I'll go have a look.
Xinyan: The lights aren't even on, and there's no one— woah!!
Xiangling: Dun dun DUN!!! Happy Birthday!
Xinyan: What are you two doing? Why are you sitting in the dark inside my house? You scared the bejesus outta me!
Xiangling: Yun Jin, you were totally right. She does get spooked!
Yun Jin: It's your birthday, so we planned a surprise party for you.
Xinyan: You girls really shouldn't pull these pranks while pretending to be all sweet and innocent...
Yun Jin: Eh? Come on now, what's wrong with that? Who says that being cute and innocent means you can't pull pranks? Back me up, Xiangling?
Xiangling: Totally, Yun Jin! Guoba pulls pranks on me all the time, too.
Xinyan: Alright, alright, you win.
Xiangling: Beidou needs to do something today, so she's asked me to bring some gifts along from her, for you.
Xiangling: So here they are! A custom-made dagger, and the score of a composition from abroad!
Yun Jin: As for my offerings, I had these gold hairpins and iron hair ties custom-made for you by my family.
Xinyan: Iron hair ties!? You're telling me that your family used their one thousand years' worth of experience to make... hair ties?
Yun Jin: What's the problem? Hair ties may look simple and unassuming, but they actually require a lot of intricate craftsmanship to make!
Xiangling: Hehe, my gift is one-of-a-kind. A little while ago, I came across a bespectacled blacksmith on the street. The way he worked and talked, it felt almost like he could see right through stones.
Xiangling: I was skeptical, so I asked him to help me make a bet, and when the merchant cracked the stone open, there was indeed a piece of raw jade inside! Hehe, I took the jade on the spot and ground it into a pendant, which I then strung on a cord. You can use it as an accessory.
Xinyan: Wow, you made a jade pendant for me?
Xiangling: Yeah! Oh, don't wear it around your neck! Put it on your guitar! Every day, I see how much you pamper that guitar, so I thought you should jazz it up a bit.
Xinyan: I don't know if I can bring myself to hang this thing anywhere except in a display case on an altar! Thank you, Xiangling. You're so thoughtful.
Yun Jin: Hehe, Xiangling has always been thoughtful. But the blacksmith you mentioned who could see through stones... can you tell me more about him? If the story's interesting enough, I might have to put it into my play.
Xiangling: I'm not exactly sure, but I hear that he was sick for a while, and was so disoriented during that time that he couldn't remember anything, and felt as if his body didn't belong to him...
Xiangling: And then, all of a sudden, he recovered! He's all fine now, except for some reason, he can now tell the difference between valuable and worthless stones just by looking at them.
Yun Jin: Hmm... that's certainly peculiar.
Xiangling: Let's not get into that. The food is getting cold. Let's eat!
Yun Jin: Wait, Xinyan, didn't you pick up a trick from an outlander merchant? The one you taught me on my last birthday.
Xinyan: Hmm? Oh, you mean making a birthday wish?
Yun Jin: Yes, that's the one. They also light candles and cut cakes in other regions, but we didn't have time for that, because we were too busy bringing the food over.
Xinyan: It's fine, I can just use my imagination.
Yun Jin: Okay, let's count to three and you can make a wish.
Yun Jin: One...
Xiangling: Two...
Yun Jin: Three...
Xinyan: Hmm, what should I wish for this year...
Xinyan: My wish is...

## Talk 15

Xinyan: Oh, I'm back?
Paimon: What happened? Paimon was just peering through the crack in the door.
Mona: Given that we are in a mirage, Xinyan, did anything significant happen inside the house?
Paimon: Paimon knows, Paimon knows, she ran into some of her friends who were throwing her a birthday party!
Mona: Yes, I heard all that! I mean something she did herself.
Xinyan: ...Oh! I made a wish.
Xinyan: It's pretty interesting, now that I think about it. When I entered the room, I found Xiangling and Yun Jin, two of my best friends!
Traveler: They are my friends too.
Xinyan: That actually happened in real life. They paid me a surprise visit on my birthday, set a table with delicious food, and persuaded me to make a birthday wish.
Mona: Xinyan, what was your wish?
Xinyan: My wish was to "perform with someone completely unexpected."
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, I wonder who this unexpected person might be?
Xinyan: I've just figured it out.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, you already know the answer?
Xinyan: Mm-hmm. However, before I tell you the answer, I'd like to clear the water veins that flow through the mountains.
Traveler: They're both well-known in Liyue.
