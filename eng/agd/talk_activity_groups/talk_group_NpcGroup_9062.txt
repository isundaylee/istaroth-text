## Talk

Aloy: #Hey there, Traveler. I sure get to see a whole lot of new things traveling with you.
Aloy: I gotta say, I'd love to watch Sylens try and wrap his head around this, uh... teapot of yours.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Aloy: If you're asking whether it's a comfortable place to stay, I mean, sure. Of course it is.
Aloy: But um... I couldn't really see myself living here for the long term. Sorry.
Traveler: Is there something wrong with the place?
Aloy: No, nothing's wrong at all, everything's great. Very charming.
Aloy: It's just that I'm more used to camping out in the wilds.
Aloy: I'm sure you know by now — back where I'm from, not a day goes by without something to watch out for.
Aloy: Like giant machines running around all over the place, or hostile tribes that always seem to have it out for you, or evil machines bent on global extinction...
Aloy: To go from a life like that to something so safe... It'll take me some time to adjust, that's all.
Traveler: You want to go on an adventure?
Aloy: Yes! Don't get me wrong, this is a nice place, but I need to get out. If I stick around here too long, my bowstring's gonna snap.
Aloy: Next time we head out, I want you to give me the full story on these Ruin Guards I hear you talking about.
Aloy: They sound like my kind of prey. Aim for the glowing part, right?
Aloy: That, plus after you defeat them, you can salvage their components...
Aloy: Strange components, sure, and probably not the kind that I could use to modify my gear. Still, they've gotta have their uses, I guess?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Aloy: Sure. Something new to share with me?
Aloy: You know, I've heard a lot of stories about you since arriving in this world.
Aloy: For example, the time that you helped the knights from Mondstadt to defeat a dragon.
Aloy: And the time that you teamed up with the adepti in Liyue to defeat an ancient god from the ocean.
Aloy: Gods and dragons... Can't believe they really exist here.
Aloy: But whatever the crisis may be, you always step forward and join up with those who want to fight back, don't you?
Aloy: It's because of people like you that both cities were able to survive and prevail.
Traveler: I only made a small contribution...
Aloy: If that's what you call a small contribution, I think it might take saving the whole world to count as a major one.
Aloy: Seriously, though, if the world ever does need saving, bring me with you.
Aloy: I've saved a world once before. I might be able to give you some pointers.
Traveler: Like "Never save the world on an empty stomach"?
Aloy: Ha, yeah, that's right. Trying to save the world when you can't stop thinking about food is pretty tough... The end of the world deserves your full, undivided attention.
Aloy: Seriously, though. Trying to save the world is exhausting, especially when you're not even sure who's trying to end it.
Aloy: The worst part is, once you find out who's responsible, they're always so full of themselves, making out like you're the one in the wrong.
Aloy: You can't reason with them. It always comes down to a fight. I guess that's just the way it is.
Traveler: Like "There's strength in numbers"?
Aloy: Maybe. But sometimes you need to take the world on your shoulders in order to save it.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Aloy: Of course. I want to go out exploring with you again. Visit new places, see new things.
Aloy: On that note, I've been meaning to ask you something. When we've been out on the hunt in the past, I've noticed you've actually got an edge over me.
Aloy: How did you learn to hunt like you do? Or rather... who taught you?
Traveler: I guess I'm self-taught.
Traveler: Nothing fancy, I'm afraid...
Aloy: Ha. And modest about it too. So I guess you started out with natural talent and then worked at it relentlessly.
Aloy: Plus, you go on all these adventures to hone your skills. That's what's really shaped you into who you are today.
Aloy: A lot like me, I guess.
Aloy: I started out okay. Then Rost really trained me up.
Aloy: He was a great hunter. And an even better man.
Aloy: ...
Aloy: I hope he'd be proud of who I am today.
Traveler: I'm sure he would be very proud.
Aloy: Thanks. But to be honest, the only reason I started training in the first place was to win the Proving and get a boon from the Matriarchs. I wanted to know who my parents were.
Aloy: Back then, I never thought I'd be uniting everyone against an evil machine and its army.
Aloy: In fact, I probably would have found the idea of everyone uniting together even more far-fetched than the part about the evil machine.
Traveler: Nobody knows what the future holds.
Aloy: Yeah. But I actually kind of like that feeling of not knowing.
Aloy: Going out into the world, exploring the unknown, embracing new challenges, that's what I'm used to.
Aloy: But didn't you tell me before that you aren't from this world? You came here as a traveler, too, didn't you?
Aloy: And you ended up staying to look for your missing sibling, correct?
Traveler: #Yes. I wonder where {F#he}{M#she} is now...
Aloy: #Don't worry. As long as {F#he}{M#she} is still in this world, the two of you will meet again.
Aloy: That's if I have a say in the matter. As a fellow outlander, I won't let you do this alone.
Aloy: I'll be ready to help whenever you need me.
Aloy: Wherever the hunt leads, I won't turn you down.
Aloy: In the meantime... when you have a moment, tell me more of what you know about this world.
Aloy: Starting with hilichurls, Abyss Mages, and Geovishap Hatchlings... I still don't know where any of their weak spots are!
Traveler: I would love to visit your world.
Aloy: If you ever do have the chance, you should take it.
Aloy: My world has its troubles. But it's worth seeing. And worth saving.

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Aloy.
Aloy: Good morning. The coast looks clear. Don't forget to come get me before you head out.

## Talk

Traveler: Evening, Aloy.
Aloy: Good evening. It's so quiet here, I mean, completely still... That's gonna take me some getting used to.

## Talk

Aloy: This camp is interesting. The lodgings and the furniture are crude, but if you look closely, the layout does seem to have an order to it.
Aloy: It's tribal. Feels a bit familiar... but different, too.
Aloy: Maybe if I stick around long enough, I can learn something from this land.

## Talk

Aloy: For a makeshift base, this is well put together. Whoever was responsible clearly knew what they were doing.
Aloy: The tents are sensibly positioned in relation to one another, and the fencing shows they were well aware that danger can approach from any direction.
Aloy: It's reassuring when you know you can rely on your companions.
