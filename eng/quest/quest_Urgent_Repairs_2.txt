# Urgent Repairs


## Talk 1

Traveler: Will do.
Terrified Magar: Great. You do that, and I'll— I'll, uh, keep watch.

## Talk 2

Terrified Magar: Thank you, Traveler. Ugh, trust me to find a way to balls everything up...
Terrified Magar: If I can't even take a cart of wine from A to B without running into trouble... What good am I for anything?
Terrified Magar: I'll be fired from the Winery if I don't get my act together... That is, if Mr. Connor isn't on to me already. Ugh, I bet Mr. Elzer's drafting up my dismissal letter as I speak... It's hopeless, it's all hope—
Traveler: Whoa Nelly! Calm down.
Terrified Magar: *sigh* Well, even if my job situation is beyond hope, I should still get this cart to its destination.
Terrified Magar: The cart's also been damaged... Traveler, could I trouble you to help me find what I need? Just one *Sturdy Plank* will be enough.

## Talk 3

Terrified Magar: You should be able to find a *Sturdy Plank* in the forest. Bring it to me when you find one, yeah?

## Talk 4

Terrified Magar: That'll do the trick. I should be able to fix the cart now. I think. I hope...
Terrified Magar: Shoot, they're back! Help me, Traveler!

## Talk 5

Terrified Magar: Phew... Thank goodness you are here, Traveler.
Terrified Magar: But I don't know how I'm going to fix my cart now, after that.
Terrified Magar: There's damage everywhere... I guess I'll have to patch it up as best I can. Whatever I do, it's not going to be a permanent fix.
Terrified Magar: Never mind. As long as it holds together for the journey into town, I can figure out the next step once I'm there.
Terrified Magar: I thought there was some rope in the cart... Gah, they must have made off with it.
Terrified Magar: Traveler... Why don't you take a look in the woods over there for me? If there's a *Rope* around, that would be perfect.

## Talk 6

Terrified Magar: Take a look in the woods over there for me, would you? If you find a *rope*, bring it to me.

## Talk 7

Terrified Magar: Thank you, Traveler. That will do nicely.
Terrified Magar: This should hold out long enough to get me to Springvale. Once I've dropped off the goods there, I'll head back to the winery and update them on what went down.
Terrified Magar: Hopefully Elzer doesn't fire me on the spot when he sees what's happened to his cart...

## Talk 8

Traveler: Alright. Don't you worry.
Terrified Magar: Phew... Thanks. Meanwhile, I'll... have a— a think about how to fix the cart.

## Talk 9

Traveler: I'm afraid I have to go...
Terrified Magar: Don't go... Please. If I try, I—I'll only mess it up again. I need you. You're my only hope.

Terrified Magar: Uh... But you're the only one around here who can help me, so... Thanks in advance...!
