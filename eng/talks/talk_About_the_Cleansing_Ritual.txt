Traveler: About the Cleansing Ritual...
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae did ask us to make some arrangements for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual earlier.
Inagi Hotomi: Later, she said that new developments had precluded the need for us to continue our preparations. She even asked me to give the Memento Lens to a blond-haired outlander.
Inagi Hotomi: I never expected that the "new development" that Lady Yae mentioned was you.
Inagi Hotomi: You have my thanks. I do not know how you managed it, but healing the Sacred Sakura was no mean feat. You have my utmost thanks as a shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine.
