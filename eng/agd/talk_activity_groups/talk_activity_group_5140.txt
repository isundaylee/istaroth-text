Peixiu: Oh, there are a few places to verify over here too... All of them are hidden paths that can't be seen by just looking at the shape of the mountains...
Peixiu: #Well, Traveler, is everything going smoothly?
Traveler: About mapping...
Peixiu: Hmm, it's tiring work, but verifying and updating maps is extremely important to people who rely on them to travel.
Peixiu: And it'll help them identify potentially dangerous areas, so they can plan ahead and avoid them.
Peixiu: As expected, the deserted areas which had to be surveyed seem to have been occupied by various monsters and fungi...
Traveler: About the surveying team...
Peixiu: Of course, the more people we have, the better. It's not just because places with difficult terrain are inherently dangerous, but we may even run into all sorts of strange monsters...
Peixiu: N-Next time, I should ask Lan to send a few more people.
Traveler: I'd say it's going well.
Peixiu: That's such a relief! But do let me know if you encounter any trouble, and I'll mark it on the map...
