# Cleanup At Dawn


## Talk 1

Adelinde: Clean the place again, and I want it spotless this time! This is about making a good first impression!
Moco: Sorry, Ms. Adelinde!
Hillie: We'll be more careful this time, Ms. Adelinde!
Traveler: What's up?
Adelinde: Ah, hello, Traveler. Welcome to the Dawn Winery. The storm may have passed, but here at the Winery we're still cleaning up the mess it made.
Adelinde: I'm trying to organize the cleanup operation, but these girls, theyâ€”
Moco: Sorry, Ms. Adelinde!
Hillie: We'll be more careful this time, Ms. Adelinde!
Adelinde: Yes, you've said that already, thank you very much! Now, why don't you put your efforts into cleaning instead of standing here apologizing to me? Shoo!
Adelinde: These kids... Ugh, they're so sloppy. I don't know how we'll ever get through it all at their rate of progress. And even after that, there's still the indoors that needs cleaning.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I can help.
Adelinde: Do you know how to sweep? Actually, scrap that, we're so short-staffed that I should be taking all the help I can get.
Adelinde: Follow me indoors, there's plenty of cleaning that needs doing in there, too.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'm an excellent sweeper.
Adelinde: Really? That's wonderful. Well, since you're willing, I'll gladly take you up on the offer.
Adelinde: Follow me indoors, there's plenty of cleaning that needs doing in there, too.

## Talk 4

Adelinde: Finished?
Traveler: All done.
Adelinde: Wonderful, this was a huge help. I can't imagine how long this would have taken me by myself.
Adelinde: And if I'd gotten the girls to do it... Who knows how many items they'd end up destroying in the process...
Adelinde: Thank you, please take these. I do apologize for troubling you, a visitor, with the work of a Winery maid.
Adelinde: Next time you visit, the Winery will be spotless.
