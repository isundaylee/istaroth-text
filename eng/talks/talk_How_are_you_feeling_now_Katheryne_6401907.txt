Traveler: How are you feeling now, Katheryne?
Katheryne: How am I feeling? ...Was I unwell?
Katheryne: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I can't quite remember what happened before... But since I'm here, I suppose it was no trouble in the end.
Traveler: (So Katheryne doesn't remember... Has the previous puppet been replaced?)
