# The Wingless One of Tlalocan


## Talk 1

Coyllur (???): ...♪
Paimon: Huh? What's that sound? Seems like it's coming from that bridge.

## Talk 2

Coyllur: Chasca! I summoned a qucusaur! They do still respond to me after all!
Coyllur: ...Although unfortunately, someone else summoned it away again before I had a chance to go for a flight...
Chasca: Oh really? That is unfortunate... But if you can do it once, you can do it again. Keep at it, and you'll pass the trial eventually.
Coyllur: You're right! You know, I almost thought about giving up, but I'm glad I didn't.
Paimon: Hey, Chasca! How's Coyllur doing?
Coyllur: Huh? Who are you? And how do you know my name...?
Chasca: #Ahem, these are, uh... my friends. Traveler and Paimon.
Chasca: You came up in conversation the other day, because... I was telling them about up-and-coming warriors in our tribe.
Coyllur: #Oh, Traveler, huh? So that's you? ...Uh, what do you mean up-and-coming? *sigh* I'm closer to being wingless than I am to passing the trial...
Coyllur: Anyway... We haven't met before, have we? You look so familiar somehow...
Chasca: #Hmm... Maybe you saw him in the stadium? Or anywhere, really. He's been all over Natlan lately, so it's not surprising that you've seen him around.
Coyllur: ...If you say so...
Traveler: ...Yeah, that must be it.
Allpa: Coyllur! Chasca!
Allpa: Here you are. I've been looking everywhere for you two.
Coyllur: Oh, Elder Allpa! What's the matter?
Allpa: I thought I should tell you myself... We're going to redo the flying trials.
Coyllur: Redo them? How come? This is so unexpected... and I can't believe you came out here just to tell us that in person...
Allpa: It's embarrassing to admit, but... due to time constraints, we didn't do a proper inspection of the arena before the last round of trials began. Then we started to notice many candidates performing worse than expected...
Allpa: So we redid the inspection afterwards, and found a number of issues which likely impacted candidate performance.
Allpa: This was entirely our mistake, and I apologize unreservedly. I know it doesn't make up for it, but I thought bringing you this message in person was the least I could do.
Coyllur: Oh, okay...
Allpa: #Chasca, these people you're with... Are they Traveler and Paimon?
Paimon: Huh? You've heard of us?
Allpa: I have indeed. Gathering intel is an essential part of being a warrior — plus, you've already made quite a name for yourself in Natlan. Actually, I've been meaning to invite you to enjoy our tribe's hospitality for some time.
Paimon: Hospitality? Ooh! That includes food, right?
Allpa: Of course it does. If you'll let us host you, you'll be treated quite lavishly. Mighty warriors are highly revered in our tribe.
Allpa: Besides, we still owe you for your help during the war. Without you, we would have suffered far worse at the hands of the Abyss... So I'd like the chance to show you our gratitude, on behalf of the whole tribe.
Paimon: Mighty warriors, plural? So Paimon counts, too...? Hehe, Paimon's starting to like you a lot!
Allpa: That should go without saying. Your flying skills are the envy of our tribe.
Traveler: That's a good point...
Paimon: The Flower-Feather Clan seems like a really nice bunch of people! We definitely need to take her up on this offer!
Traveler: Last time was just a... flying visit...
Allpa: Well, I'd love to stay, but I'm afraid I still have to inform the other candidates about the retrials. With our younger generation's future on the line, there's no time to lose.
Coyllur: Wait, Elder Allpa! ...Lemme help. The sooner everyone gets the news, the better.
Allpa: Very well... In that case, Chasca, could I leave you to entertain our guests?
Chasca: Sure thing.
Allpa: Okay, let's meet by the obsidian totem pole later. Coyllur, let's get going.
Coyllur: Okay!
Black Screen Text: Allpa and Coyllur fly away, riding a qucusaur....
Chasca: ...Alright, they're out of earshot. I'm just gonna come out and ask:
Chasca: ...That qucusaur who responded to Coyllur's call — that was your doing, wasn't it?
Traveler: ...!
Chasca: I grew up with these creatures. I could tell something was off the second I saw it.
Chasca: #His whole demeanor seemed less like a qucusaur and more like... well, you. So I figure you must have been pulling the strings somehow.
Traveler: I can't believe you saw through it...
Chasca: #He looked very flustered when Coyllur asked for a ride. So I whistled to give him a chance to escape.
Chasca: ...And judging by the look on your face, that was a welcome intervention, huh?
Chasca: It's alright, if you'd rather your hidden talents remain hidden, I respect that. I won't press you for answers, and I'll keep my speculations to myself.
Chasca: You're the kind of person I'd still trust even if you had superpowers. I know you'd use them for good.
Traveler: Technically, I deceived Coyllur... Does that count as "for good"?
Chasca: I think the ends justify the means in this case. She just lacked confidence, and you helped her resolve her internal conflict.
Chasca: If you hadn't intervened, I likely would have gotten my "mom" to help out instead... Although, having said that, there's a small chance she might've recognized her and seen through the whole thing... that would've done more harm than good...
Traveler: Well, luckily no harm was done in the end.
Chasca: Yeah. Anyway, if you're free now, how about I give you that tour I promised?
Traveler: We never got to check the place out properly.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa, where did the time go? We should meet back up with Chasca before it gets any later. To get to the totem pole, we need to head north, right?

## Talk 4

Chasca: I can see where Pixica's coming from. The view from up high really is spectacular. I don't usually notice, because I tend to just zoom along without taking in the scenery...

## Talk 5

Chasca: Nice one.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Do you think Coyllur's feeling better now? Let's go back to that bridge and check!

## Talk 7

Paimon: We've notified all the Wingless on the list now, right? Where to next?
Chasca: The trial arena. It's not far from the tribe.

## Talk 8

Mutota: ...Are you sure you don't want to reconsider, Pixica?
Pixica: I appreciate it, Boss. But honestly, I'm pretty happy with my life nowadays...
Chasca: Pixica, they're redoing the flying trials... Huh? Mutota?
Mutota: Ah, did Allpa send you? I was just telling Pixica the news, actually.
Mutota: The way things are in the tribe these days... I mean, you don't need me to tell you. This here is no future for a seasoned warrior like you.
Pixica: Come on, Boss, do you have any idea how long it's been? I've been Wingless for years now. I'm not cut out for that anymore.
Pixica: Of course I'll do my part if we ever need to defend the tribe, but there's really no point in me trying out for the flying squad now.
Pixica: I've already made my peace with it. Not everyone has what it takes to return to the sky after going Wingless... Elder Allpa's perseverance is something else.
Pixica: And like... it's okay if I'm not destined for greatness. I might not have the qucusaurs' approval, but with my hot air balloons, I can still reach the skies...
Pixica: Handling these balloons every day, seeing how the customers react, the looks on their faces... That's enough for me.
Chasca: Finding something you love doing can be just as hard as passing the flying trial. It's worth holding onto.
Mutota: *sigh* Fair enough... It's your choice, I won't force you.
Pixica: Oh, by the way, you should try taking a balloon ride if you've got the time! Once you've been up there for yourself, you'll see why I love it so much!
Traveler: I'm a little busy at the moment.
Pixica: No problem! If you ever wanna give it a try, you know where to find me!
Traveler: But next time, for sure.

## Talk 9

Huascar: A retrial? What's the point? I pretty much treat life like it's a game, haha... no qucusaur's ever going to approve of that, no matter how many times I try.
Chasca: Huascar... I can assure you, qucusaurs wouldn't judge you for something like that.
Huascar: Well, they must be judging me for something. Maybe I lack fighting spirit, or just don't have the talent... Not everyone's a natural like you.
Huascar: Don't waste your time on me. You'll have better luck with the ones who still have their heads in the clouds.
Huascar: In the meantime... Hehe, I think I'm gonna treat myself to a few more games of "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"!
Paimon: Yeesh. There's Wingless, then there's being a total lost cause...
Chasca: He used to be a fierce warrior, actually. But fighting spirit alone won't win you the qucusaurs' approval.
Paimon: Are all qucusaurs so strict? The ones in Floating Target Balloons and Eyes on the Feathered Prize seem pretty chilled out.
Chasca: It's one thing to hang out and have fun, but quite another to take to the skies with a human life on your back.
Chasca: Giving a ride to someone who's unqualified endangers not only the Rider, but also the qucusaur themselves. If the Rider makes a mistake, they both suffer the consequences.
Chasca: So we have a mutual understanding with the qucusaurs: if someone isn't up to standard, we have to reject them... even if it means breaking their hearts.

## Talk 10

Zhunan: *sigh*...
Chasca: Hey, Zhunan. Gazing out at Ochkanatlan again, huh?
Zhunan: ...Chasca? What are you doing here, is something up?
Chasca: The flying squad is hosting retrials again soon. Wanna give it another try?
Zhunan: Heh, maybe you're forgetting the definition of "Wingless." I've failed so many times already that I've decided to call it quits for good. I'm done.
Zhunan: Elder Allpa always goes out of her way to come and tell me when a new trial is coming up, and it's nice of her to think of me... but nothing's gonna change. I'm not going to suddenly pass just because they're holding another trial.
Chasca: They're making some big changes to the arena this time, so the flying experience should be smoother than before. Coyllur's gonna try again.
Zhunan: ...!
Zhunan: Ehh... No, forget it. If I was genuinely good enough to make the squad, the location shouldn't affect my chances.
Zhunan: A true Rider can fly confidently whatever the conditions... Like you and Elder Allpa.
Coyllur: #Zhunan! They're redoing the— Huh? Chasca and Traveler? You're already here...
Coyllur: Guess they already told you then, huh? Come on, let's go train together!
Zhunan: Um... I'm gonna sit this one out.
Coyllur: What? Why? But you've always looked up to Elder Allpa...
Coyllur: She went wingless after her injury, and spent years drifting... but even she came back and made it in the end. If she can do it, why can't you?
Zhunan: I mean... I don't have that kind of perseverance. And besides, the last thing I wanna do is fail in front of her yet again...
Coyllur: *sigh* Come on, you know you don't need to worry about that... Alright, well... how about we just treat this as you being my mentor? Then will you train with me?
Zhunan: Um... I mean...
Coyllur: Enough umming and ahhing! Let's just get up in the air and figure it out as we go!
Zhunan: Wait... Hold on! Slow down! I can't keep up!
Paimon: ...Well that's one way to do it...
Traveler: Yeah... Zhunan unwittingly chose the hard way.
Chasca: Heh, they've been best friends since they were kids. If anyone knows how to get Zhunan out of a rut, it's Coyllur.
Chasca: You helped Coyllur deal with her internal conflict, and now, she's done the same for someone else... You know, people often talk about how one conflict leads to another, and so on.
Chasca: But sometimes in life, things spiral in a good direction instead.

## Talk 11

Cusco: *sigh* I'm sorry, I didn't mean to keep you so long... I don't get to talk about my daughters much, and once I got going, I lost track of time.
Cusco: I should be getting back to work now, so... Ah, Chasca. Help me talk some sense into her, won't you?

## Talk 12

Mutota: I didn't realize Chasca was out delivering the news... Looks like Allpa's finally learning how to delegate.

## Talk 13

Coyllur (???): ...♪
Coyllur (???): *sob*... *sob*...
Paimon: Oh no, why's she crying? Should we go check on her? Y'know, just in case she's... thinking of doing something stupid...
Chasca: I'd leave her be.
Chasca: The warriors of the Flower-Feather Clan are a proud bunch, who never show their vulnerability in public... Even if they've gone wingless.
Paimon: Oh, you're that fan favorite from the Stadium of the Sacred Flame! Ch... Ch...
Traveler: Chasca.
Chasca: I'm flattered that you remember my name. Your reputations precede you too, Travelers.
Paimon: So what are you doing here? Paimon figured you'd all be off fighting in the Night Warden Wars by now.
Chasca: I'll be heading there shortly. But there are some things I want to get taken care of before I go.
Paimon: Oh! ...Chasca?
Chasca: #Good to see you again, Traveler and Paimon.
Chasca: Before we carry on — let's get a little further away before Coyllur notices us.
Paimon: So that girl on the bridge — Coyllur, you said? Should she really be on her own right now? With the mental state she's in, it just seems risky...
Chasca: Don't worry, that's exactly why I'm here. Elder Allpa sent me to keep an eye on her. If she does attempt the unthinkable, I'll swoop in and catch her.
Chasca: I doubt it'll come to that, though. She's a fighter — a warrior, in fact. One who aimed for the sky. However despondent she might feel now, I'm confident she'll get through it.
Traveler: What do you mean, "aimed for the sky"?
Chasca: Well, in the Flower-Feather Clan there's an elite flying squad made up of qucusaur riders.
Chasca: But it's an extremely selective squad. To become a rider, you need to undergo a trial where you not only demonstrate mastery of the relevant skills, but also win the approval of the qucusaurs. Very few candidates make it through the process.
Chasca: Coyllur has spent years training for her most recent attempt, but unfortunately she didn't pass... So it's not hard to see why she's so upset.
Traveler: And when you mentioned "going wingless," what does that mean?
Chasca: Sometimes, after multiple failed attempts to pass the flying test and win the qucusaurs' approval, people get so disheartened that they give up on their dream to soar the skies.
Chasca: They resolve to quit trying for good. We call those people the "Wingless."
Paimon: *gasp* Do they get expelled from the tribe!?
Chasca: What? No, of course not. They're still prized warriors.
Chasca: We have a saying: "Just as the qucusaur treasures every feather on its body, so the tribe treasures each one of its children."
Chasca: This hits even harder in the wake of the war... All of our young warriors carry the future of our tribe on their shoulders.
Chasca: Besides, every qucusaur falls from its nest before it learns to fly. It's practically a rite of passage. Likewise, for the Wingless, we always hold out hope that one day when they're ready, they'll rekindle their dreams and keep trying.
Chasca: Until then, all we can do is quietly watch over them from a distance... just like I'm doing now.
Paimon: Aw, okay... Paimon hopes she'll get back on her feet soon!
Chasca: ...Well, from the sound of her whistling, her confidence has been seriously shaken. No qucusaur is gonna respond to a call that sounds like that.
Traveler: Whistling?
Chasca: Yeah, people from my tribe call to their saurian companions by whistling or blowing a horn. So it sounds like Coyllur was trying to summon a qucusaur to practice her flying.
Chasca: But the qucusaurs are an even prouder bunch than our warriors... They would never respond to a lackluster whistle like that.
Chasca: First she failed the trial, and now she's struggling to even summon a qucusaur. That's only gonna hurt her confidence further... And getting trapped in that vicious circle is the kind of thing that'll make people go wingless.
Paimon: Surely, there must be something we can do to help?
Chasca: That's very kind of you. Coyllur's flying skills are up to par, but mentally, she's stuck in a rut. If she wants to return to the sky, she has to overcome that for herself.
Chasca: I'm going to lay low nearby, just in case she takes a turn for the worse. Let me give you a tour around the tribe once this is all over.
Coyllur: ...♪
Paimon: Coyllur still isn't giving up! Even though Chasca said that she has to do this by herself, Paimon can't help feeling like maybe we can nudge her in the right direction...
Paimon: Hmm... What if we could get a qucusaur to fly up to her? That might give her the confidence boost she needs.
Traveler: (Actually, that sounds like a plan...)
Traveler: Call?

## Talk 15

Cusco: #Hmm... A golden-haired outlander, and a white flying object... You must be Traveler and Paimon?
Cusco: I heard Chasca was with you, but I suppose she's run away again, has she...
Paimon: Um... sorry, who are you?
Cusco: Who am I? Tsk, only her father!
Cusco: She's supposed to go for a checkup every three months to see how her Abyss condition is doing. We both agreed on it... But she's already missed three checkups this year! That's three out of four!
Traveler: Abyss condition?
Cusco: *sigh* Yes, she got exposed to Abyssal energy as a young child... Then her birth parents abandoned her. It's lucky those wild qucusaurs found her when they did, or she wouldn't have made it. They took her under their wing and raised her as one of their own.
Cusco: Eventually, some riders out on patrol spotted her, and brought her back to the tribe... But she was practically feral at that point!
Cusco: The moment you took your eyes off her, she'd be getting herself into a fight. Or she'd run away to be with the saurians. She seemed to prefer them to her own kind... She might as well have been a saurian in human form!
Paimon: ...That must be the aloof period she mentioned, right?
Traveler: Sounds like there was more going on than just being aloof...
Cusco: We later discovered that her exposure to the Abyss had planted seeds of conflict in her heart. So, we started trying to bring it under control...
Cusco: But ultimately, she's the only one who can control it. Anyway, she's much more human these days.
Paimon: Yeah, uh... Don't worry about her, she seems pretty stable to Paimon. Uh, she's probably only avoiding the checkups because she thinks it'll stop you guys from worrying about her.
Cusco: ...Yes, I'm well aware of that. She knows she needs to be careful. If her condition ever took a turn for the worse, she wouldn't be brushing it aside like this.
Traveler: Then what's there to worry about?
Cusco: It's just, every checkup she's been to, they find new cuts and bruises. Nothing to do with the Abyss, of course, oh no — that's all fine. The problem with her is, she's her own worst enemy!
Cusco: She's been living dangerously again, I'm sure of it! That's why she's avoiding the checkups, she wants to hide it from us!
Paimon: Ah... Yeah... Paimon can see her doing that....
Cusco: *sigh* It's not just Chasca, either. Chuychu's out there every day on the front lines too, following her big sister around... They're asking for trouble, both of them.
Cusco: Next time you see them, please tell them to be careful for me. Even if they don't want to hear it.
Cusco: *sigh* ...In the past, she always had Chuychu to keep an eye on her. Now Chuychu's gone, and I just... I don't want to lose another daughter.
Cusco: Chasca's been increasingly reckless since Chuychu passed. It's like she's trying to make up for it somehow...
Cusco: Next time you see her, please tell her to be careful for me. Even if she doesn't want to hear it.
Cusco: If she doesn't want to do these checkups anymore, that's fine. I just want her to stop putting herself in harm's way.
Chasca: ...
Chasca: ...
Black Screen Text: Cusco rambles on about Chasca and Chuychu.
You patiently listen until the bitter end...

## Talk 16

Coyllur: Chasca! I summoned a qucusaur! They do still respond to me after all!
Coyllur: ...Although unfortunately, someone else summoned it away again before I had a chance to go for a flight...
Chasca: Oh really? That is unfortunate... But if you can do it once, you can do it again. Keep at it, and you'll pass the trial eventually.
Coyllur: You're right! You know, I almost thought about giving up, but I'm glad I didn't.
Paimon: Hey, Chasca! How's Coyllur doing?
Coyllur: Huh? Who are you? And how do you know my name...?
Chasca: #Ahem, these are, uh... my friends. Traveler and Paimon.
Chasca: You came up in conversation the other day, because... I was telling them about up-and-coming warriors in our tribe.
Coyllur: #Oh, Traveler, huh? So that's you? ...Uh, what do you mean up-and-coming? *sigh* I'm closer to being wingless than I am to passing the trial...
Coyllur: Anyway... We haven't met before, have we? You look so familiar somehow...
Chasca: #Hmm... Maybe you saw him in the stadium? Or anywhere, really. He's been all over Natlan lately, so it's not surprising that you've seen him around.
Coyllur: ...If you say so...
Traveler: ...Yeah, that must be it.
Allpa: Coyllur! Chasca!
Allpa: Here you are. I've been looking everywhere for you two.
Coyllur: Oh, Elder Allpa! What's the matter?
Allpa: I thought I should tell you myself... We're going to redo the flying trials.

Coyllur: Wait, Elder Allpa! ...Lemme help. The sooner everyone gets the news, the better.
Allpa: Very well... In that case, Chasca, could I leave you to entertain our guests?
Chasca: Sure thing.
Allpa: Okay, let's meet by the obsidian totem pole later. Coyllur, let's get going.
Coyllur: Okay!
Black Screen Text: Allpa and Coyllur fly away, riding a qucusaur....
Chasca: ...Alright, they're out of earshot. I'm just gonna come out and ask:
Chasca: ...That qucusaur who responded to Coyllur's call — that was your doing, wasn't it?
Traveler: ...!
Chasca: I grew up with these creatures. I could tell something was off the second I saw it.

Chasca: ...And judging by the look on your face, that was a welcome intervention, huh?
Chasca: It's alright, if you'd rather your hidden talents remain hidden, I respect that. I won't press you for answers, and I'll keep my speculations to myself.
Chasca: You're the kind of person I'd still trust even if you had superpowers. I know you'd use them for good.
Traveler: Technically, I deceived Coyllur... Does that count as "for good"?
Chasca: I think the ends justify the means in this case. She just lacked confidence, and you helped her resolve her internal conflict.
Chasca: If you hadn't intervened, I likely would have gotten my "mom" to help out instead... Although, having said that, there's a small chance she might've recognized her and seen through the whole thing... that would've done more harm than good...
Traveler: Well, luckily no harm was done in the end.
Chasca: Yeah. Anyway, if you're free now, how about I give you that tour I promised?
Traveler: We never got to check the place out properly.

### Additional Talk 1

Mutota: ...Are you sure you don't want to reconsider, Pixica?
Pixica: I appreciate it, Boss. But honestly, I'm pretty happy with my life nowadays...
Chasca: Pixica, they're redoing the flying trials... Huh? Mutota?
Mutota: Ah, did Allpa send you? I was just telling Pixica the news, actually.
Mutota: The way things are in the tribe these days... I mean, you don't need me to tell you. This here is no future for a seasoned warrior like you.
Pixica: Come on, Boss, do you have any idea how long it's been? I've been Wingless for years now. I'm not cut out for that anymore.
Pixica: Of course I'll do my part if we ever need to defend the tribe, but there's really no point in me trying out for the flying squad now.
Pixica: I've already made my peace with it. Not everyone has what it takes to return to the sky after going Wingless... Elder Allpa's perseverance is something else.
Pixica: And like... it's okay if I'm not destined for greatness. I might not have the qucusaurs' approval, but with my hot air balloons, I can still reach the skies...
Pixica: Handling these balloons every day, seeing how the customers react, the looks on their faces... That's enough for me.
Chasca: Finding something you love doing can be just as hard as passing the flying trial. It's worth holding onto.
Mutota: *sigh* Fair enough... It's your choice, I won't force you.
Pixica: Oh, by the way, you should try taking a balloon ride if you've got the time! Once you've been up there for yourself, you'll see why I love it so much!
Traveler: I'm a little busy at the moment.
Pixica: No problem! If you ever wanna give it a try, you know where to find me!
Traveler: But next time, for sure.

### Additional Talk 2

Huascar: A retrial? What's the point? I pretty much treat life like it's a game, haha... no qucusaur's ever going to approve of that, no matter how many times I try.
Chasca: Huascar... I can assure you, qucusaurs wouldn't judge you for something like that.
Huascar: Well, they must be judging me for something. Maybe I lack fighting spirit, or just don't have the talent... Not everyone's a natural like you.
Huascar: Don't waste your time on me. You'll have better luck with the ones who still have their heads in the clouds.
Huascar: In the meantime... Hehe, I think I'm gonna treat myself to a few more games of "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"!
Paimon: Yeesh. There's Wingless, then there's being a total lost cause...
Chasca: He used to be a fierce warrior, actually. But fighting spirit alone won't win you the qucusaurs' approval.
Paimon: Are all qucusaurs so strict? The ones in Floating Target Balloons and Eyes on the Feathered Prize seem pretty chilled out.
Chasca: It's one thing to hang out and have fun, but quite another to take to the skies with a human life on your back.
Chasca: Giving a ride to someone who's unqualified endangers not only the Rider, but also the qucusaur themselves. If the Rider makes a mistake, they both suffer the consequences.
Chasca: So we have a mutual understanding with the qucusaurs: if someone isn't up to standard, we have to reject them... even if it means breaking their hearts.

### Additional Talk 3

Zhunan: *sigh*...
Chasca: Hey, Zhunan. Gazing out at Ochkanatlan again, huh?
Zhunan: ...Chasca? What are you doing here, is something up?
Chasca: The flying squad is hosting retrials again soon. Wanna give it another try?
Zhunan: Heh, maybe you're forgetting the definition of "Wingless." I've failed so many times already that I've decided to call it quits for good. I'm done.
Zhunan: Elder Allpa always goes out of her way to come and tell me when a new trial is coming up, and it's nice of her to think of me... but nothing's gonna change. I'm not going to suddenly pass just because they're holding another trial.
Chasca: They're making some big changes to the arena this time, so the flying experience should be smoother than before. Coyllur's gonna try again.
Zhunan: ...!
Zhunan: Ehh... No, forget it. If I was genuinely good enough to make the squad, the location shouldn't affect my chances.
Zhunan: A true Rider can fly confidently whatever the conditions... Like you and Elder Allpa.
Coyllur: #Zhunan! They're redoing the— Huh? Chasca and Traveler? You're already here...
Coyllur: Guess they already told you then, huh? Come on, let's go train together!
Zhunan: Um... I'm gonna sit this one out.
Coyllur: What? Why? But you've always looked up to Elder Allpa...
Coyllur: She went wingless after her injury, and spent years drifting... but even she came back and made it in the end. If she can do it, why can't you?
Zhunan: I mean... I don't have that kind of perseverance. And besides, the last thing I wanna do is fail in front of her yet again...
Coyllur: *sigh* Come on, you know you don't need to worry about that... Alright, well... how about we just treat this as you being my mentor? Then will you train with me?
Zhunan: Um... I mean...
Coyllur: Enough umming and ahhing! Let's just get up in the air and figure it out as we go!
Zhunan: Wait... Hold on! Slow down! I can't keep up!
Paimon: ...Well that's one way to do it...
Traveler: Yeah... Zhunan unwittingly chose the hard way.
Chasca: Heh, they've been best friends since they were kids. If anyone knows how to get Zhunan out of a rut, it's Coyllur.
Chasca: You helped Coyllur deal with her internal conflict, and now, she's done the same for someone else... You know, people often talk about how one conflict leads to another, and so on.
Chasca: But sometimes in life, things spiral in a good direction instead.

Huascar: Tsk... Next time! I'll definitely hit the jackpot next time!
