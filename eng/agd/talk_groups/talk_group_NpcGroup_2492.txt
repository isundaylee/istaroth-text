## Talk

Jin: This is the batch from yesterday, and this one is from the day before. This one goes out, and this one...
Jin: Whoa! Um, greetings. Can I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Jin: I'm checking the tea inventory.
Jin: Uncle Luo and Uncle Lu came over a few days ago and asked me to check the tea inventory. Said something about giving high-quality aged tea to the merchants.
Jin: Good aged tea... That's going to take a long time to find. Maybe Uncle Luo will criticize my choices even after I do...

## Talk

Traveler: How are things in the warehouse?
Jin: Same old. The tea leaves that meet our standards are sent to the warehouse, where they're first categorized by type. Leaves are then divided into top, medium, and bottom quality by type, and each quality is further divided into tiers A, B, and C. They are then labeled accordingly, and their locations on the shelf and the time at which they were placed in the warehouse are recorded...
Jin: When the merchants come, we take the leaves out of the warehouse, occasionally picking some to make aged teabricks...
Jin: I know the warehouse rules like the back of my hand, and I'm passable at identifying good and bad tea. But Uncle Luo always worries when I'm working on my own. When there's a large batch to be warehoused or shipped, he always comes down to watch the process.
Jin: I wish he'd just trust me for once, you know?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jin: Sure. I have to go back to checking inventory, anyway. Wait, is this batch from yesterday or the day before...?

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds complicated...
Jin: It's not that bad, but there's simply too much tea in the warehouse, and they all require different preservation methods. Some can't be exposed to humidity, some must be kept away from bugs, some can't be placed under the light, and some can't come into contact with other tea leaves to prevent their flavors from mingling with others.
Jin: To guarantee that every type is preserved in the appropriate environment, the warehouse is divided into many areas, and some even overlap one another...
Jin: Even if I know where to look for something, it takes a lot of effort to retrieve said item.

## Talk

Traveler: That seems like a lot of information to remember.
Jin: Uncle Luo's getting on in years, so I have to remember more of this stuff. Can't make him do it every single time, you know?
Jin: But I'm not the brightest spark, and I forget one thing when I'm trying to remember something else. Worse, I make more mistakes at work when I'm trying to memorize more information...
Jin: Ugh, and now I'm getting sleepy again...
