Traveler: Do you do overseas delivery?
Tundama: Theoretically speaking, it shouldn't be a problem.
Tundama: It'll be a bit difficult for me to leave Natlan personally, though. I'll have to submit multiple rounds of applications to the Wayob, and even then, it's anyone's guess whether or not my leave permit will be granted...
Tundama: Haha, jokes aside.
Tundama: If letters need to be sent abroad, we'll usually take them to the border, before handing them over to our colleagues from the other nations.
Tundama: Anyway, just leave it to me! I promise you that I'll get it delivered!
