Boileau: If we counted all the cases that occurred as "theater" as well... Most of the stories here don't have happy endings.

## Talk

Traveler: A "case" did occur, after all.
Boileau: Precisely. And where there's a case, there will be victims. It really is very sad.
Boileau: Even if the culprit was sent to serve time, I'm not sure the tale could be said to have a "happy ending."
Boileau: I've spent a lot of time at the theater on account of my love for tragic stories, and I've always found myself quite accepting of trials or performances that have tragic endings.
Boileau: Over time, it's become less and less clear to me â€” am I sad on account of real compatriots of mine? Or on account of the story?
Boileau: *sigh* This should not be.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Boileau: Tragedy can be beautiful too.

## Talk

Traveler: Do not treat cases like child's play.
Boileau: Yes, you are right.
Boileau: They say Fontaine is the Nation of Justice. But I don't think such a reputation can be based solely on our Archon.
Boileau: Fontainians must have their own justice in their hearts.
