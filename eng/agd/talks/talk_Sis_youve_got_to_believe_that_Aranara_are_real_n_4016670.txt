Armin: Sis, you've got to believe that Aranara are real now!
Arina: No. The Aranara we saw, was only what the Dendro Archon willed us to see.
Arina: Sweet dreams are wonderful, but don't confuse them with reality. It's like dreaming about getting a perfect score on an exam. You still need to hit the books after you wake.
Armin: Sis, you're being scary again...
Arina: I only speak the truth, and I'll say it again. The teacher has already said it many times. Aranara do not exist.
Armin: But... what if... What if there's things even the teacher doesn't know...
Arina: Well... I'm not saying it's wrong to doubt your teacher, but I'm still not changing my mind about the Aranara.
Arina: If you want to believe in them, Armin, that's fine! After all, you're still young.
