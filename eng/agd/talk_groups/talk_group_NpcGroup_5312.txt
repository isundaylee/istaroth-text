Traveler: A habit you picked up at work?
Sedile: Yeah. I'm Sedile, an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom. My usual work involves site inspection and information collection — all to ensure the safety of Fontaine's citizens.
Sedile: So, well... Heh. When I see people I haven't seen before, I get a little nervous. Sorry about that.

Sedile: If I was one of my colleagues on the job, I wouldn't just be hanging around willy-nilly.

Traveler: See you later...
Sedile: ...Alright. I hope you have a good time in the village — but don't do anything bad! I'm on vacation, and I... really don't wanna do any overtime...
