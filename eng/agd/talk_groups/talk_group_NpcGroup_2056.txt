## Talk 0

Jiayi: Ah, it's been a long time since I was last at Qingce Village. Little Liu, Daddy misses you so much...
Traveler: Is everything alright?
Jiayi: Oh, it's you, traveler. Thanks for your concern. Nothing's wrong. I just... miss my daughter.
Jiayi: I told her that once this shift ended, I'd take leave to spend some time with her for a few days at Qingce Village.
Jiayi: But who knew that such a huge thing would suddenly happen in Liyue Harbor. Not only was every soldier on leave recalled, but everyone at their post has also had their leave canceled.
Jiayi: Now we have to man our stations all day. Forget taking leave, I need to find someone who can take over my post even if I want to get a sip of water.
Jiayi: I'd prepared my gifts, too — a huge bag of toys... But what shall I do with it now?
Jiayi: That's right! Traveler, could I ask you to bring these toys to my daughter, Little Liu? She stays at Qingce Village. If you ask Granny Ruoxin, you're sure to find her.

Traveler: I've got other matters to attend to.
Jiayi: Alright. Qingce Village is such a long way off, anyway. I should think of another solution rather than trouble you...

## Talk 3

Jiayi: It's just like they say — no matter how hard you work, there's always more to do...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Jiayi: *sigh* Now that the crisis has passed, things in the city have been gradually returning to normal.
Jiayi: I thought that we might be able to take it a little easier once it was all over.
Jiayi: Little did I know that on top of our usual guard duty and other day-to-day work, they'd have us helping out in other departments from time to time, too...
Jiayi: All these little things add up to mean that we're actually busier than ever.
Jiayi: I was called to help collect and organize some incoming paperwork, and then I had to patrol the city and settle an escort request from a merchant caravan...
Jiayi: *sigh* And on top of all that... Just a few days ago, we received a report that there have been intermittent earthquakes near Nantianmen. We've sent someone to investigate, but they found everything to be completely normal.
Jiayi: That doesn't mean we can afford to lower our guard though — this is an earthquake we're talking about. So, we are still sending people to check on the area every so often.
Jiayi: Unfortunately, however, we're very short-handed at the moment... Traveler, if you have the time, would you mind heading over to Nantianmen and taking a look for me?
Traveler: Sure.
Jiayi: Thank you very much. *sigh* I must be off, duty calls...
Traveler: What am I supposed to be looking for?
Jiayi: Good question... if I had to guess, I'd say probably... monsters, or something.
Jiayi: As for the earthquakes... No one we've sent so far has encountered anything of the sort. So, maybe the person who initially reported it was just getting confused.
Jiayi: Well, I shall leave the matter of Nantianmen to you. Ugh, I'm already running late for my next assignment...

## Talk 4

Jiayi: Ah, traveler! It's you.
Jiayi: You have to see this picture of my daughter, she looks so adorable...

Traveler: Who are you?
Jiayi: "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail." We are the Millelith — Protectors of Liyue.
Jiayi: I'm a soldier, proud to be serving with the Millelith in defense of this great city of Liyue Harbor.
Jiayi: ...I say that. But I'd still rather be working closer to Qingce Village.
Jiayi: That's where my beloved daughter is. I think about her constantly...

Traveler: Tell me about your daughter.
Jiayi: Her name's Little Liu. My wife sadly passed away in childbirth, so it's the grandparents who look after her now.
Jiayi: She's still very young. I haven't a clue how to explain this to her... So I just lie, and say that her mother has always been working in Liyue Harbor...
Jiayi: *sigh* I haven't seen her in a good long while since coming to Liyue on my own for work. The last time I held her in my arms, she was nowhere close to the weight of this polearm...
Jiayi: Is she eating her dinner?
Jiayi: Is she in good health?
Jiayi: Is she making lots of nice friends?
Jiayi: *sigh* Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: See you.
Jiayi: Bye, Traveler.
Jiayi: Do me a favor if you ever pass through Qingce Village, would you? Ask for Little Liu and tell her that her daddy's doing just fine, and that he'll come to visit as soon as he can... and that's a promise...
