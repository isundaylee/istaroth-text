Traveler: About fighting the Abyss...
Wayna: Ah, well... I suppose it's not going too badly.
Wayna: If war with the Abyss was seen as just another type of extreme sport, then there'd be nothing about it that we Scions of the Canopy couldn't handle.
Wayna: Just like jumping off a cliff â€” some would jump straight back, others land safely, while others might fly off to even farther places.
Wayna: Every outcome has a value of its own, and thus, deserves to be remembered.
