Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>How do you like it here?</color>
Amber: I like it a lot!
Amber: I'm not too fussy about where I stay. After all, as an Outrider, I have to be able to adapt to all kinds of surroundings.
Amber: If I had to, I could even sleep on a tree branch.
Traveler: That's some impressive survival skills!
Amber: Yâ€”You really think so...?
Amber: Anyway, don't worry, this place is great!
Traveler: I hope you're more comfortable here than on a tree branch.
Amber: Hahaha, of course I am!
