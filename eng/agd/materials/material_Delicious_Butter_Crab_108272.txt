# Delicious Butter Crab

A grilled crab dish. The butter-infused crab legs have a rich aroma that washes over the tastes buds so seductively that before you know it, you've eaten it all, and are left sipping at the dregs of butter in the crab's shell, hoping to recapture a fragment of the dish's beauty.
