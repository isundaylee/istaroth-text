Traveler: About the portrait...
Sevigne: Oh, that... I was quite surprised that Mr. Bossuet didn't take it back to Petrichor.
Sevigne: After all, if it gets left here, who knows when someone will spill ink or some even harder to clean fluid on it...
Sevigne: I do have a few suspects in mind, but I expect that in the end Chisseray will be chosen to go to the Fortress of Meropide.
Sevigne: Goodness me, what am I doing! It's best not to say what you're really thinking in this kind of workplace.
