# Tales From the Court


## Talk 1

Isadora: Huh. Where'd it go? What bad luck...
Isadora: Ugh. I won't be able to write another copy either...
Traveler: Did you lose something?
Isadora: Well, I do hope that it was *only* lost — I do consider myself an optimist, after all.
Traveler: Is that what you call optimism?
Isadora: Well... It might be when the thing you're looking for is the office semiannual expense ledger.
Isadora: This needed to go to Ms. Keiser sometime soon... But I suddenly discovered that the ledger was missing five pages.
Isadora: These five pages are from five separate months and contain a great number of expenses.
Isadora: It was only in the final review that I noticed they were gone.
Isadora: If I had not accidentally misplaced them and instead never done them at all... then how did this final amount for our official expenses come about?
Isadora: Ugh, I daren't think about it. If I really did forget to write them, Ms. Cadme will almost certainly force me to dig up the ledgers from the last decade and make me check them again.
Traveler: That sounds pretty serious...
Isadora: That's because it is! If the documents were not written or were lost, that means quite a few offices will have funding issues next month.
Isadora: What rotten luck... I only remember pulling an all-nighter writing the ledger and bringing it to the Palais today.
Isadora: When I reached this spot, I was startled by a large flock of seagulls, and my hands loosened for a moment.
Isadora: *sigh* I might really have lost the documents during that time...
Traveler: I'll help you search.
Isadora: You'd be willing to help? Wonderful! Come, let's follow this road first, then.
Isadora: The data involved is not top secret or anything, so don't worry about accidentally seeing something when picking the sheets up.
Isadora: Ah, yes, I also met Officer Muirne at that time! She even chased the seagulls away for me.
Isadora: We can ask her if she saw the ledger.
Traveler: Let's search together.
Traveler: Is losing things a good thing?

## Talk 2

Muirne: Ms. Isadora, is there something I can help you with?
Isadora: Officer Muirne, I have a question for you. Do you remember the stack of accounts I brought to the office this morning?
Muirne: I remember that. You were attacked by a flock of Violetgold Angler Gulls as well, right?
Isadora: Yes, that's right! Once those annoying gulls flew away, I hurried over to my office.
Isadora: Do you recall if I left any sheets on the ground when I ran off?
Muirne: Um... I can't remember. I was also busy with other work at the time...
Muirne: But if you need them urgently, we can "reenact" your path to the office.
Isadora: Eh? Could you, really? I... don't want to ask too much of you.
Muirne: We're just looking for things — a much easier task than work at the Palais Mermonia, that's for sure.
Muirne: I do recall that you had tied the documents you were carrying together into stacks. Is that correct?
Isadora: That's right. We need to be quite precise with our reports for cost review, after all. You've got a good eye, huh?
Isadora: Everything has to be listed, from large tasks like getting artisans to maintain the outer walls of the Palais, to small ones like changing a lock on a desk.
Isadora: That's how every month's expenses come up to a thick bundle that needs rope to tie together.
Muirne: In short, there's no way that a single sheet might have just flown off by itself — even though you had lost documents, you would have lost them stack by stack.
Muirne: It hasn't been long since you got to the office, so let's set off now.

## Talk 3

Isadora: Ah, these are the documents I need! Oh, thank the Archon, they're all here!
Traveler: Why were you doing accounts at the cafe?
Isadora: W—Well, I need lots of coffee to make sure I'm counting it all right.
Isadora: This is the expenses of all the offices within the Palais, mind you — counting it up's supposed to be five people's work.
Isadora: But apart from me, everyone in the office is often being borrowed by some other office, sent out on work, or is busy with some visitation...
Isadora: So when it came time to count expenses, it was just me doing it — I haven't slept in days!
Isadora: Not only did the expenses need counting up, but even the settling of the bills got left to me. My vision's practically swimming over here...
Muirne: Regardless, it's good that we found those accounts. If you'll allow me, Ms. Isadora, I'll accompany you back to the Palais.
Isadora: Thank you, Officer Muirne. *sigh* I swear, you and the Traveler are the only two good souls I've met these last three months.
Isadora: Everyone else is either yelling at me or pushing me to work.
Isadora: Ugh, no, no, I need to stop complaining. I need to go back, or Ms. Keiser's going to yell at me again...
