Traveler: Still want to travel the world?
Atsuko: Haha, you remember that? Thanks for the concern.
Atsuko: I'm still serious about that dream. I'm sure you understand me as only a fellow traveler could.
Atsuko: Now that Inazuma's policies have changed so much, going out to travel is no longer such an arduous task... So if a suitable opportunity comes along, I'll continue my journey.
Atsuko: But for now, I'll continue to stay with my parents.
