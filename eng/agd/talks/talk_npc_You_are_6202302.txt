Traveler: You are...?
Linlang: I am Linlang, the owner of Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: I'm very sorry, but the shop is not open yet. If you want to browse the shop, please find me at Xigu Antiques later.
Traveler: Tell me about Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: A fellow antique collector, are you?
Linlang: In that case, I do hope you will come to the store tonight.
Linlang: Right now, though, I am taking my post-breakfast walk. Apologies.
