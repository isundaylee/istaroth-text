Traveler: Made any discoveries?
Sayid: I was reading up on some of Mondstadt's historical myths previously. Fortunately, the library has a wealth of resources for reference.
Sayid: Of all the myths and legends in Mondstadt, the one I'm most fascinated by has to be The Legend of Vennessa.
Sayid: The spirit of freedom prized by Mondstadt must have been modeled after her courage in standing up to injustice and oppressive rulers. Even as an outsider, I am deeply moved.
Sayid: My focus has shifted to the songs of Mondstadt of late, so I'm done with this book now. Just remember to return it to the library once you've finished reading it...

## Talk 1

Sayid: Hello, my friend. You want to talk?

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Sayid: Stormterror's story... Or should I say, Dvalin's, is a topic with great research value.
Sayid: I never expected to encounter such a cataclysmic event on my trip to Mondstadt. For me, it's quite fortunate.
Sayid: Anyway, I will record everything I have seen and heard. I should like for my compatriots in Sumeru to learn of these historical events...

Sayid: Who are you?
Sayid: Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sayid, a visiting scholar from Sumeru.
Sayid: Mondstadt is a pleasant place. I have been here for some time now, and I am reluctant to leave... It has definitely brought out my more, ahem, leisurely side...
Sayid: In all seriousness though, a leisurely lifestyle just means doing whatever makes you happy, doesn't it? A fitting ethos for the City of Freedom...
Sayid: And it seems that I've become a total convert without anyone having to preach it from the rooftops... Hah. The remarkable wisdom of the gods.
Sayid: Anemo Archon Barbatos, my respect to you.
Traveler: Tell me about Sumeru.
Sayid: It's my homeland, though I haven't been back in a long while.
Sayid: Sumeru is known all over the world as a center of learning. As a traveler, I'm sure you must have heard of the Sumeru Akademiya?
Sayid: Ms. Lisa of the Knights of Favonius studied there. My teacher mentioned her once — allegedly, Lisa was the best student they'd seen in two hundred years...
Sayid: I am exceptionally curious as to the real reason that she wound up working here as a librarian...

## Talk 6

Sayid: ...Oh, my apologies. Did my musings disturb you?

### Talk 6 related talk 0

Traveler: What are you looking at?
Sayid: I'm currently reading the works of some bards.
Sayid: They weave their ideas, thoughts, and truths into romantic poetry, not at all like the unwieldy tomes of Sumeru...
Sayid: Perhaps this romanticism is an expression of great wisdom.
Sayid: Yes, this is excellent. Excellent material, indeed.
