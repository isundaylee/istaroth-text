# Talk Dialog

Sethos: You do know you were invited to the Akademiya party, right? You're really not gonna show your face?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Heh, I don't remember doing anything worth getting invited. It's just another noisy room of people... Not my scene.
Sethos: Look, I'm no scholar, but even I've heard about your work in historical criticism and modern political research.
Sethos: You provided the clues and inspiration for their big paper. That basically makes you their hero. Your contribution is half the reason they even have something to celebrate.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You'd think someone from the "Temple of Silence" would know when to stop talking...
Sethos: Okay, okay, I can take a hint. I'm just letting you know, they're gonna drag you there one way or another.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...You told them where I was?
Sethos: Hah, believe it or not, I do know when to keep my mouth shut. But, since I know you pretty well, they did ask me to come find you.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: For the love of... Fine. Show me the way.
