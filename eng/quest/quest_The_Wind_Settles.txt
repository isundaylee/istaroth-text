# The Wind Settles


## Talk 1

Sasano: These people from the Tenryou Commission have been here for days now.
Kaede: I guess they're here to pick up Lady Hiiragi... but why would it be taking so long?
Sasano: I heard that the Kanjou Commission suddenly said they don't want Lady Hiiragi to leave.
Sasano: To be honest, I'd be hesitant if I were her. A crowd this size comes to Ritou? Who knows what they could be planning.
Kaede: Shh! Stay quiet. Someone might hear you.
Sasano: Oh, right, sorry. Ugh, how did things get to this point...

## Talk 2

Kaede: I hope this is all resolved soon.
Sasano: I know, right? What the heck is the Kanjou Commission doing...

## Talk 3

Yasuaki: How much longer does your Master plan to hold them off...
Hideo: I have no idea. We're stuck in limbo here.
Hideo: Master's been very on edge these past few days. He gets irate over the smallest things and is suspicious of everything... He's been yelling at me a lot...
Hideo: I understand that he's anxious, but I mean... what can we do? I've told him before — never cross the Yashiro Commissioner.
Yasuaki: Yeah, good advice... With him, you just know that whatever he's doing, a lot of preparation has gone into it.
Yasuaki: If Lady Hiiragi is really taken away, then what will the Tenryou Commission do? And what will the Yashiro Commission do...
Hideo: Maybe we should tell Master to discuss things with Lady Hiiragi.

## Talk 4

Yasuaki: What's your Master thinking?
Hideo: Ugh, with his temper, it's hard to say...

## Talk 5

Hatanaka: Hello, how may I help?
Traveler: What are you doing?
Hatanaka: We arrived here two days ago to escort Lady Hiiragi to Inazuma City.
Hatanaka: Sir Kujou Kamaji gave us very strict orders, so we have to obey. But every time we attempt to receive the bride, the Hiiragi Clan always finds an excuse to delay things.
Hatanaka: Since we haven't fulfilled our duties yet... we decided to stay in Ritou until Lady Hiiragi is ready to come with us.
Traveler: Everyone is scared.
Hatanaka: We apologize, it was not our intention to stay here so long.
Hatanaka: We promise our presence here will not impact ordinary people's lives. We can only hope that the leaders of the Hiiragi Clan will start to cooperate soon.
Hatanaka: If this stalemate continues, who knows... Sir Kujou might give us orders to be less accommodating...
Traveler: People suspect something is wrong.
Traveler: Why is there such a strong Tenryou Commission presence here?

## Talk 6

Hatanaka: Whatever happens, please don't worry. We know where to draw the line.

## Talk 7

Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, Traveler!
Hiiragi Chisato: I assume you've heard about everything that's been going on out there? What on earth is happening?
Paimon: Don't worry, we can explain everything. So, what happened was—
Traveler: Hold on, someone might be eavesdropping.
Black Screen Text: You make sure that no one is eavesdropping before explaining the whole situation to Hiiragi Chisato.
Hiiragi Chisato: After the Tenryou Commission arrived, they suddenly became alarmed. They keep having secretive discussions and won't allow me to have any direct contact with the Tenryou Commission.
Hiiragi Chisato: I never would have thought that... this was Sir Kamisato's plan... Now it all makes sense.
Traveler: Since we last met...
Hiiragi Chisato: ...I'm sorry, I haven't.
Hiiragi Chisato: "Maybe there's no right or wrong decision... maybe everything would be easier if I simply didn't have a choice"...
Hiiragi Chisato: I used to tell myself things like this to avoid having to think about it. But once I saw the notices appearing out of nowhere on the streets, signaling that the wedding was confirmed...
Hiiragi Chisato: I didn't feel reassured at all. Instead, I felt a great sense of regret.
Hiiragi Chisato: I keep thinking back to what Sir Kamisato said. This is supposed to be my bright and beautiful future... but what if it's not?
Traveler: This is exactly what he is worried about.
Hiiragi Chisato: I can happily accept that if someone was trying to take advantage of my marriage, I should absolutely refuse to go through with it...
Hiiragi Chisato: But that's not the answer I'm looking for. And also... now that things have escalated to this point, it will be tricky to resolve...
Matsuura: Ah, Lady Hiiragi, here you are. You scared me for a second. I thought you'd gone missing...
Matsuura: You... Wait, you're the ones who were with the Yashiro Commissioner that day!
Matsuura: What do you think you're doing here? Are you trying to convince Lady Hiiragi to leave!?
Hiiragi Chisato: Calm down. They're my friends. They're just here to visit me.
Matsuura: Friends? Are you sure? Just friends?
Matsuura: Lady Hiiragi, I told you already, these are exceptional circumstances. You need to be more vigilant in everything you do.
Matsuura: You are extremely important to us and to the entire Kanjou Commission...
Matsuura: Who's to say... they don't have a hidden agenda?
Paimon: If you wanna accuse us of trying to abduct her, just come out and say it!
Traveler: You're acting far less dignified than when we last met.
Hiiragi Chisato: Don't be rude. You've been very highly strung lately, seeing everything as a threat.
Matsuura: I... Ugh...
Traveler: You won't even follow Lady Hiiragi's orders now?
Hiiragi Chisato: #Listen to me. I know all the ins and outs of everything that's happened so far. {F#Her}{M#His} arrival might well be your very last chance to fix this.
Hiiragi Chisato: The present state of affairs in Ritou shows me that the situation has escalated well past the point where you could hope to control it. If this deadlock continues any longer, we will have nothing to gain and much to lose.
Hiiragi Chisato: This is not an order. All I need you to do is give me an explanation and take responsibility for the situation.
Matsuura: ...
Matsuura: Understood, my lady. I shall discuss with the others right away.
Paimon: Good job, Chisato! You handled that well!
Hiiragi Chisato: I was so nervous. But I thought, things are now so critical that I should at least give it a try... and it worked remarkably well.
Traveler: That's what I call a voice of authority.
Hiiragi Chisato: Yes, well, let's wait and see what happens. I hope they provide a satisfactory response.
Black Screen Text: A while later, Matsuura comes back with his tail between his legs.
Matsuura: We had a serious discussion and reflected on our mistakes.
Matsuura: In all honesty... no one can handle the weight of the situation here. Everyone is besides themselves with worry. It'll drive us mad if it continues any longer.
Matsuura: Ah! I'm so sorry, my actions were radical and duplicitous, I was selfish and ignored the greater good, and then I left the situation to fester...
Matsuura: Would you... would you please give us a second chance? For my lady's sake, please, give the Kanjou Commission another chance...
Traveler: It's no use talking to me.
Matsuura: I suppose you're right...
Matsuura: The only person who can change the Tenryou Commission's mind will be the Yashiro Commissioner.
Matsuura: We'll head off to the Kamisato Estate shortly, and beseech him to help us with the utmost sincerity.
Matsuura: Lady Hiiragi, might I ask you to join us? You are the most important person... Without you, we have no other way...
Traveler: You'll have to talk to Kamisato Ayato.
Traveler: You can't rush into important things.
Traveler: ...have you made your mind up?
Traveler: Let me check it out.

## Talk 8

Matsuura: Yashiro Commissioner, I'm sure you've heard the news... The Tenryou Commission has now occupied Ritou, refusing to leave until we hand Lady Hiiragi over to them.
Matsuura: I realize I've greatly offended you with my atrocious actions, and I realize also that this must sound like the very height of absurdity, but please... have mercy, good sir...
Kamisato Ayato: I'm sorry, Mr. Matsuura, I'm exceptionally busy, and have but a moment to spare before my next engagement. I fear this leaves no time for small talk.
Kamisato Ayato: So please, if you would be so kind, get straight to the point.
Matsuura: Ugh...
Matsuura: I know our apology means nothing to you, but we really have nothing else left to offer by this point. I'm terribly sorry... Everyone in the entire Kanjou Commission now realizes the gravity of this situation.
Matsuura: Lady Hiiragi is indispensable to us. We promise to always support her.
Matsuura: So, would it be at all possible for you to talk to Sir Kujou once more, on our behalf?
Kamisato Ayato: You make it sound so easy. The Tri-Commission will be ridiculed by the public if we choose to withdraw the notices now and eat our words. What do you plan to do about this?
Kamisato Ayato: To lose face for the Tri-Commission is to bring shame to Her Excellency. Are you and your associates ready to face the thunderous wrath of the Almighty Shogun?
Matsuura: We... We'll take full responsibility. We'll publish a new notice and hold a conference to explain the situation. We will make sure that the public knows this was all a huge misunderstanding.
Matsuura: We'll do everything we can to minimize the impact, everything we can...
Kamisato Ayato: ...Master Matsuura, you should have known it would come to this. Whatever were you thinking?
Kamisato Ayato: But the Tri-Commission must always put the interests of Inazuma first, regardless of what Sir Kujou and I may feel at this present moment.
Kamisato Ayato: If the situation in Ritou is left to fester any further, things may get out of control. But Lady Hiiragi and the inhabitants of Ritou are innocent.
Kamisato Ayato: If we fail to contain the situation promptly, the rumor mill will wreak havoc on the Tri-Commission's reputation.
Kamisato Ayato: Try keeping a pet bird, you'll see what I mean. Songbirds who know how to hold a tune can be very pleasant to listen to, but they can also become irritating if they don't know when to stop.
Kamisato Ayato: And as for the ones with excessively long tongues, well they're so insufferable that they can't be kept as pets at all... But it doesn't take a moment to cut out their tongues and silence them for good.
Matsuura: ...Y—Yes... I understand!
Kamisato Ayato: I've listened to your concerns, and I'll talk to Sir Kujou for you. But I can't guarantee that he will change his mind.
Matsuura: I understand. Thank you for your help, Yashiro Commissioner!
Kamisato Ayato: Alright, you ought to return now. I'm sure you have a sizable mess to deal with back in the Kanjou Commission?
Matsuura: Okay, then please excuse me... Thank you once again, Commissioner!
Kamisato Ayato: Ah yes, Lady Hiiragi, I have something to tell you. Would you mind?
Hiiragi Chisato: Oh? Why, of course...
Hiiragi Chisato: Sir Kamisato, you became a completely different person just now. It felt so intense.
Kamisato Ayato: Unruly servants like him need to be severely reprimanded. As a commissioner, the Almighty Shogun trusts me to do her will. I did as I should.
Kamisato Ayato: But now I'd like to take off my commissioner hat and share a personal story with you.
Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, please. I'd love to hear it.
Kamisato Ayato: You must've heard that the Kamisato Clan once went through an extremely difficult period.
Kamisato Ayato: My father worked incredibly hard to compensate for the grave errors made by the Kamisato Clan long ago and restore our reputation. The work took a toll on his health, and ultimately led to his untimely demise.
Kamisato Ayato: My mother loved him dearly. She passed soon after.
Kamisato Ayato: This sudden turn of events dealt a heavy blow to the Yashiro Commission. Behind the scenes, things became very unstable.
Kamisato Ayato: Everyone thought that the Kamisato Clan had lost power. That made my sister and me nothing but burdens hindering the ambitions of others.
Kamisato Ayato: It may sound preposterous now, but I assure you that is the truth of what the Yashiro Commission has been through.
Paimon: Huh, pretty similar to how the Kanjou Commission is now...
Kamisato Ayato: Back then, I had no choice but to accept the position I was in. While I desperately looked around for powerful supporters, I endured smear campaigns and attempts to exploit me.
Kamisato Ayato: I had no other choice. I had to honor my parents' dying wishes, and I also had a young sister to take care of.
Kamisato Ayato: I didn't mind what became of me, but my family... No one can ever be allowed to trample over my precious family.
Kamisato Ayato: Fortunately, I persisted, and the Kamisato Clan was able to survive this storm.
Hiiragi Chisato: ...I think I now know where my sense of loss and confusion was coming from.
Hiiragi Chisato: Shinnojou once told me that he saw what was in me, in a way that no one else did... That's why he couldn't bear to see me live the rest of my life depending on someone else...
Hiiragi Chisato: I thought the reason I felt unsettled was because of uncertainty over getting married. But the fact is, it's because I felt too young and inexperienced to handle the situation facing me.
Kamisato Ayato: The reason why Sir Kujou was able to face the prospect of marriage so confidently is because he's prepared for anything.
Hiiragi Chisato: ...That's it. The situation I'm facing now is the same one he faced back then.
Hiiragi Chisato: When his clan was in crisis, he bravely drew his blade and challenged the Almighty Shogun. And now...
Hiiragi Chisato: It is time for me to make a stand, and become my own person.
Kamisato Ayato: Well said. I'm sure once you have grown and gained confidence, your father will be able to let go and allow you to decide how you want to live the rest of your life.
Kamisato Ayato: It might not sound exciting, but this kind of personal growth is a necessary step in the pursuit of true happiness.
Hiiragi Chisato: ...And I'm sure I can get there.
Hiiragi Chisato: I will use this as an opportunity to take over the responsibilities of the Hiiragi Clan. I'll think about marriage again after everything is more settled.
Hiiragi Chisato: This puts less pressure on Kamaji, and means I can support and protect myself without having to worry about becoming a burden or dependent on someone else.
Kamisato Ayato: My best wishes to both of you were and remain heartfelt. When the time comes for the wedding to go ahead, I will come to congratulate you once more.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you, Sir Kamisato. I am grateful for everything you have shared with me.
Hiiragi Chisato: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot to deal with back home.
Kamisato Ayato: Take care, Lady Hiiragi. I'm confident that on your return, you will find your Kanjou Commission associates most receptive to your instruction.
Hiiragi Chisato: Yes, in fact my recent experience suggests the same. Thank you once again.
Paimon: She really has the air of a leader now.
Traveler: She has a lot in common with Kamaji.
Paimon: Hats off to you too, sir! Everyone thought there was no way out until you pulled that super smart strategy out of nowhere!
Kamisato Ayato: In fact, counter checking is a perfectly common maneuver in the game of chess.
Kamisato Ayato: Our rival this time was easy to deal with. He was smart, but short-sighted, and sloppy in his execution. This outcome is entirely within my expectation.
Paimon: Even so... Paimon could never come up with a plan that cunning in a whole lifetime!
Paimon: Anyway, it's kind of a relief to see that Chisato has decided to set the Hiiragi Clan straight.
Kamisato Ayato: I agree. Stability in Inazuma benefits me, as well. I wasn't about to pass up an opportunity to make less trouble for myself.
Traveler: Speaking about your stance...
Kamisato Ayato: Hahaha, well, the fact is that I am first and foremost the Yashiro Commissioner.
Kamisato Ayato: Perhaps for Master Matsuura, power is his life's pursuit. But for me, nothing matters more than the stability of Inazuma.
Kamisato Ayato: A stable nation is the prerequisite for a stable Yashiro Commission. Only then can the Kamisato Clan and the other Yashiro Commission clans have a peaceful existence.
Kamisato Ayato: But human desire will always be a factor in the equation. This is not the first situation of its kind, nor will it be the last.
Kamisato Ayato: All I have tried to do is make sure the three parties to the Tri-Commission serve to restrain each other. Stasis is not the only form of stability. A balance of power leaving no room for maneuver achieves the same end.
Traveler: Balance of power...
Kamisato Ayato: Another positive outcome is that everyone recognizes how important Lady Hiiragi is now. I think I did her a sizable favor in that regard.
Kamisato Ayato: Dealing with the Hiiragi Clan will be much easier for her than navigating a new and unfamiliar one.
Paimon: Whew, there were so many things at play over this one wedding...
Paimon: ...Wait a second, you weren't trying to stop the wedding from the very beginning, were you!?
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm? I thought straight away it was bad timing. Nevertheless, everything I said to Hiiragi Chisato was entirely sincere.
Kamisato Ayato: If you choose to give up your stance on something once, you'll be having to compromise for the rest of your life.
Kamisato Ayato: I didn't want to see her suffer because she didn't realize what she was getting into.
Kamisato Ayato: Now, she has the chance to become her own person. Let's see who she becomes.
Paimon: Okay then, guess we'll have to wait and see...
Traveler: See you next time.
Kamisato Ayato: Alright, farewell and profuse thanks to you both. I shall have to host you at the Kamisato Estate when my sister is next available.
Thoma: Looks like everything's resolved.
Thoma: Masterfully done, everything was perfect. Well, except for one minor detail... I somehow ended up with a glass of very peculiar-tasting milk.
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm? Didn't you like it? I distinctly remember you saying you are quite partial to exotic flavors.
Thoma: Oh, my lord...
Kamisato Ayato: The Traveler had one of those as well.
Thoma: #I'm sure {F#she's}{M#he's} made a great impression on you.
Kamisato Ayato: #The Traveler did indeed play a critical role in this case. I'm sure both families would have been more guarded against me had {F#she}{M#he} and {F#her}{M#his} companion not been present.
Kamisato Ayato: It wouldn't have been so easy to get to the heart of the matter.
Thoma: There you go again, my lord. Placing the focus on other people while discreetly performing your job to perfection.
Kamisato Ayato: Naturally. Ah yes, now that we're both free, let's finish off that game of chess we started a few days ago.
Traveler: Mutual restraint...
Traveler: You weren't in this just to help Chisato, were you?
Traveler: They really are a good match for each other.
