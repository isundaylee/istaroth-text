Traveler: What is this place?
Enteka: This is Puspa Caf√©, and I'm the acting manager here.
Enteka: If you're a first-time customer, why don't you tell me what your preferences are? Then I can recommend a coffee that will suit your tastes.
Enteka: Do you like your coffee sweet, or do you prefer it more on the bitter side? Stronger or milder?
Enteka: Whatever your preferences, no matter how offbeat, I can make something to your liking.

## Talk

Traveler: About that cat...
Enteka: Ah, you must have spotted Gata.
Enteka: Gata's not even a year old yet so she's still a very curious kitty. Whenever I read people's fortunes from the coffee grounds, she'll jump up to watch.
Enteka: If you'd like, you can give her head a good pat. She'll get happy and start purring, and you'll get to enjoy the softest feeling in the world.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Enteka: Take care, hope to see you again.

Traveler: What have you got here?

## Talk

Traveler: Yay, woohoo!
Enteka: Haha, looks like you are a cat lover, too.
Enteka: Here's a tip for you, my friend! Gata prefers Fowl to Fish.
Enteka: If Gata eats the Fowl you feed her, then she must be willing to be your friend!
