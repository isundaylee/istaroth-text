Paimon: What is this place?
Traveler: A new dream?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I can't believe it... He's brought us to the borderland...
Paimon: "Borderland"?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: To put it simply, it's a dream within a dream... A space hidden deep within the collective Inazuman subconscious. A dream that can exist even without a host.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This must be how that monster managed to survive the extinction of his kind... he hid here.
Paimon: Mizuki, that eye...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: He's trying to turn this place into a nightmare so he'll be more at home... And he's creating copies of himself...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This place is connected to the dreams of every human in the nation. From here, he can place a copy of himself in every dream.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If he succeeds, then he'll have effectively revived his kind already...
Paimon: Then we know what we need to do: We gotta take this guy down! ...Do we think a sword will do the job?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Maybe — if we can get close enough to reach his core... But he's brought the nightmares of all of his victims here, and that gives him an immense amount of power.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Dealing with this many in one go is going to take a different approach. We need a power to rival his nightmares... the power of sweet dreams.
Paimon: Sweet dreams? Where are we gonna find those?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Lost minds — there should be some around here, and some of them will have come from sweet dreams originally... Come on, follow me!
