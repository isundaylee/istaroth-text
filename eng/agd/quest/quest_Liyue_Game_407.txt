Cricket Referee: Hey, Traveler! Wanna try catching crickets? It's a popular game in Liyue, you won't see this in Mondstadt!
The toughest crickets make the loudest sounds. There are some exceptions though.

## Talk 5

Cricket Referee: Oh, this isn't bad. You caught one at least. Although I'm not sure whether this cricket is tough or not.
