# Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)


## Talk 1

Klee: Here it is, here it is! See? This canyon wasn't here before!
Kaeya: Just before the canyon appeared, I heard a faint sound, like something mechanical turning.
Klee: Ker-chunk, ker-chunk, ker-chunk!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Could it have been the Central Hub? Mm, that would mean this canyon appeared after it started spinning...
Ferdinand: Hey, you... Oh, new guys, huh?
Paimon: Oh, hey... Paimon didn't realize anyone else besides Idyia lived here!
Ferdinand: You actually saw her? Hmph, she's barely shown her face since everything started falling apart here.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excuse me for asking, but... who are you?
Ferdinand: Oh right, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Ferdinand. Me and my brothers look after this whole zone.
Ferdinand: Well, we used to. Until this whole domain was... like, flipped upside-down, or whatever. The method we were using to make the carts and tracks stopped working after that...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Idyia is working on repairing the domain. We were just with her before coming here.
Ferdinand: Really...? Huh. I assumed that she'd be curled up in a fetal position somewhere, hoping all her problems will magically disappear on their own... Good for her.
Ferdinand: Anyway, I checked all the stations around the whole circuit...they've all conked out.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Conked out how? Would you mind elaborating a little for us?
Ferdinand: Uh... But aren't you just travelers who stumbled upon this place by accident?
Klee: Nuh-uh! I'm Mage Klee, Idyia's helper!
Ferdinand: ...A Mage? You?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Allow me to explain...
Black Screen Text: You introduce yourselves to Ferdinand and explain what's happened...
Ferdinand: Okay, I gotcha... Well, right now, the more helpers we got, the better, I guess...
Ferdinand: Anyway, our first priority is to get the carts here up and running again.
Kaeya: Oh? And why is that?
Ferdinand: The roads here twist and turn so much that the best way to get around is by riding the rail tracks instead...
Ferdinand: Lemme show you... This is what we use to make them. Did Idyia bring you up to speed on these things?
Traveler: It is a Streaming Projector, right?
Ferdinand: Yep. Basically, we need something that we can put inside that'll make a cart for us.
Klee: Umm... like what? Can it be anything as long as it looks like a cart?
Ferdinand: Yeah, you could put it that way. But one other thing is that it has to be compatible with the tracks.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So something like... a sedan chair, maybe? Hmm, but I'm not sure we have all the materials required to build one of those...
Paimon: #How about you, {NICKNAME}? Any ideas?
Traveler: ...Maybe just a basic wooden cart?
Paimon: Hmm, that would solve the issue of materials.
Ferdinand: Wood's no good. A rickety wooden cart would be too dangerous.
Kaeya: Really? ....Hey, everyone, come and see what Klee made!
Klee: Tada! Look, I made a cart!
Paimon: Wow! Amazing work, Klee!
Ferdinand: Whoa... It fits the track like a glove, too!
Ferdinand: Plus... it's a heck of a lot cuter than the ones Idyia made!
Traveler: Well done, Klee!
Klee: Hee-hee, I just wanted to give it a try. Then suddenly, boom! There it was!
Paimon: ...Paimon's gotta ask — what exactly did you make your cart from, Klee?
Klee: I used Jumpy Dumpty!
Paimon: Aha! Thought so...
Ferdinand: Hmm? Is there a problem, or something? If not, then let's get ready to leave.
Paimon: It's just... this cart is made from, um...
Traveler: Don't worry!
Ferdinand: It's a bomb or something, isn't it? Yeah, I gathered from your conversation that Jumpy Dumpty is a little more volatile than the cute name suggests.
Ferdinand: It's okay, though, 'cause the end product only takes on the general look of the source material. Uh, so to be more specific, while different materials have different properties, most of them aren't transferred to—
Paimon: It's okay! No need to delve into the theoretical stuff!
Paimon: Paimon just wanted to make sure we aren't about to end up like the, uh, "flying fish" of Starfell Lake...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...Huh...
Klee: Can we ride the cart now?
Ferdinand: In a moment. We need a Hydro Eidolon to power it up first.
Hydro Eidolon: Gurgle!
Ferdinand: Okay, she's ready to roll. Hop in!
Traveler: We just need to drive safely!
Traveler: Who's a clever mage!
Traveler: How about a castle with legs?
Paimon: What kind of a suggestion is that? That would be way too complicated to make!
Ferdinand: Yeah... Sorry, I don't think we'd have the right materials for that.

## Talk 2

Ferdinand: The track is damaged up ahead. We need to make some repairs before we can go any further...
Ferdinand: Yep, looks like it's all reverted to a preprint state here.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Do you know why that happened?
Ferdinand: Everything in this domain starts as a preprint and only takes shape after being illuminated by the Streaming Projector.
Ferdinand: But the Hydro Eidolon that forms the tracks here has been trapped in the print...
Kaeya: So someone needs to go into the preprint and rescue the Hydro Eidolon. Right?
Paimon: But the projector here's sealed off by a giant bubble.
Ferdinand: That's the Hydro Eidolon's way of protecting the device from damage... If the Streaming Projector broke, then we'd be seriously stuck.
Paimon: Aha! So for step one, we need Water Droplet to help!
Hydro Eidolon: Gurgle...
Paimon: Aww, it seems to really like that name!
Hydro Eidolon: Gurgle!
Ferdinand: Um... Any volunteers for step two...?
Paimon: Leave that to us. We know what to do!

## Talk 3

Klee: Oh, there's another spinny thing here... It's so big!
Klee: But uh, not as big as the one we saw in the middle of this place. That one was HUGE!
Klee: I bet it's something super important... I remember what Kaeya said earlier!
Paimon: Very good, Klee! You're using what you saw earlier to make observations, like a real adventurer.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm, it appears to be a system that rotates to switch tracks.
Ferdinand: That's right. Originally, all you had to do was flip this switch, and the junction would rotate.
Ferdinand: Hmph, but it seems Jeroney still hasn't fixed it yet. He sure talks big but when it comes to actually getting things done...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Is this "Jeroney" you mentioned one of your brothers?
Ferdinand: Yeah, when I talked to him about repairing the tracks, I suggested we start with the station, but he said we should start at the junction...
Ferdinand: Really, it made no difference which one we started with, but he just had to turn it into a huge argument... He always treats me like I'm a fool and disagrees with anything I say.
Ferdinand: Hmph, let's see what he has to say now that I've already fixed the tracks.
Kaeya: If you ask me, you're clearly a sharp person, Ferdinand.
Ferdinand: Yes! Finally, someone who can recognize that rather than just shrugging off my ideas! Come on, let's make our way to the junction and see what he's up to. I bet he's still fretting over what to do.

## Talk 4

Jeroney: *sigh* Everything will get better once we get the switcher working again.
Ferdinand: Hmph, still stuck here just as I expected. Well, did you make any progress?
Jeroney: Didn't I already tell you? Just have the Hydro Eidolons fix the junction and then make a new cart. After that, we can use the junction to...
Jeroney: Wait a minute, how did you get here? It took a lot of effort for me to climb all the way up here.
Ferdinand: The answer is standing right in front of you.
Jeroney: Hah, yeah sure. Those travelers must have helped you.
Jeroney: You never get anything done on your own. You always get someone else's help, and then try to take the credit for yourself.
Ferdinand: You're one to talk. What have you managed to accomplish, huh? You were here just moping around all day!
Paimon: Whoa... They started arguing the moment they saw each other. But aren't they supposed to be brothers?
Jeroney: Hah, me? His brother? Hardly!
Ferdinand: *sigh* Alright, Jeroney... That's enough.
Jeroney: Ugh, fine. I'd rather be focusing my efforts on fixing the track switch rather than arguing anyway.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You should calm down too, Ferdinand. Let's all focus on the situation at hand, any personal problems can be settled later.
Ferdinand: ...Fine.
Jeroney: I'm sorry you had to see that... My name's Jeroney. I'm one of the people responsible for taking care of this area.
Jeroney: I assume you're the ones who helped repair the tracks... Thank you very much, it means a lot.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No need to thank us. We're just trying to help Idyia restore the domain.
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation to Jeroney...
Jeroney: I see. Now that you and Ferdinand brought the cart up here, we'll need the Hydro Eidolons to fix the area below.
Paimon: Them again, huh? Seems the Hydro Eidolons are really important around this place.
Jeroney: Yes, of course. Not only do they keep the junction turning, they operate practically everything else in the domain, too.
Jeroney: Alright, seems most of the tracks and junctions have been repaired now.
Ferdinand: Yep. So maybe it's time you give credit where credit is due, hmm?
Jeroney: What, you think you deserve the credit!? If anything, we should be thanking these travelers.
Ferdinand: Ugh, you... Well, either way, you're not the one getting any credit!
Ferdinand: You're always quick to criticize my ideas and push your own, but you never actually get anything done.
Jeroney: And what about you? Don't forget that it was Haddo and I who took care of the mess that one time you impulsively tried one of your brilliant ideas!
Jeroney: Ah, speaking of Haddo... Wasn't he with you?
Ferdinand: I left early this morning, I assumed he'd be with you.
Jeroney: Seriously? Couldn't you have at least looked to see where he was before you left!?
Ferdinand: Hey c'mon... You didn't see him either, so what's your excuse!?
Klee: *whimper*...
Kaeya: Klee?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Klee: I don't get it...
Klee: Nobody did anything bad, why are they arguing?
Ferdinand: I, uh... I just don't like his smug attitude, that's all.
Jeroney: Who are you calling smug? If anything, you're the one who's making such a big fuss right now!
Kaeya: Alright, I think we've heard enough from you two.
Kaeya: If you insist on bickering, then I'd suggest you go somewhere else, otherwise, I'll just cool you two off myself.
Jeroney: ...
Ferdinand: ...
Kaeya: Now, come with me. I'd like to have a word with you.
Paimon: Whew...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't be upset Klee... There are many complicated situations in this world which don't always have a logical explanation.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: As a passing traveler here, it's not my place to comment on their disputes...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But in my experience, family issues can be the toughest to resolve.
Paimon: Seems you don't like dealing with this kind of thing either, Kokomi.
Traveler: Who would?
Klee: But... it's still not right.
Klee: I don't know how to explain my feelings...
Jeroney: I'm sorry, we've calmed down. We shouldn't argue in front of a child like that.
Ferdinand: We're sorry, Klee.
Klee: It's okay...
Kaeya: Back to the topic at hand, weren't you about to go look for your brother, Haddo?
Jeroney: Ah, right. Our best guess is that he's somewhere around Torrential Twister.
Jeroney: We would have to use the junction to send the cart to another area.
Ferdinand: Sorry to trouble you again, but would you help us find him?
Traveler: As long as you promise not to argue.
Jeroney: Oh, all right...
Traveler: Understandable.
Traveler: You don't like seeing people argue?

## Talk 5

Haddo: Ah, I guessed you had repaired the tracks and stations as soon as I saw a cart come zipping along. *sickly cough*
Haddo: Now that the tracks, station, and carts are all repaired, we're about ready to reopen Torrential Twister. It'll be good to see my design back in action again.
Ferdinand: *sigh* You're in no condition to be out running around like this, Haddo.
Haddo: Yeah, but these are unusual circumstances... *cough*
Ferdinand: That's true, but you should stop to think things through.
Jeroney: Exactly! If there's anything that needs to be done, you can just let Ferdinand and I take care of it.
Haddo: Haha, you and Ferdinand? Together? It would be a miracle for you two to do anything together without fighting.
Ferdinand: Hey! That's between Jeroney and me. No need to add fuel to the fire, okay?
Haddo: I'm not trying to make trouble, I'm just saying... *cough*
Klee: Hey, Ferdinand...
Ferdinand: Oh, uh... Don't worry, we're not arguing, Klee. We're just, uh... discussing some things.
Klee: Are you and Jeroney worried about Haddo?
Jeroney: ...
Klee: Why don't you just talk to him about it?
Klee: Kaeya's also worried about me sometimes, but he doesn't ever criticize me.
Kaeya: You're right, but our relationship is much better than these guys.
Ferdinand: Uh, well... our situation is a little different.
Klee: Really? How so?
Ferdinand: We've been through this kind of thing before... if we didn't warn Haddo, then he wouldn't take it seriously and something would eventually happen.
Ferdinand: As his brothers, we have to help him...
Klee: But it doesn't look like you're helping...
Ferdinand: ...
Klee: Maybe Klee doesn't understand everything...
Klee: But my Mommy told me that you help someone to make THEM feel happy, not to make yourself happy.
Klee: Haddo sure doesn't look very happy. Why don't you ask him what he needs?
Jeroney: ...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Klee's right, you know. You three need to open up and talk things through, you are brothers, after all.
Ferdinand: ...
Ferdinand: I, uh... Ahem, I've always cared a lot about you, Haddo.
Ferdinand: Just like when we were back in the desert... You suddenly passed out, and Jeroney and I started arguing. Eventually, all three of us ended up in this domain.
Ferdinand: I'm just worried that something similar could happen again. If you were to pass out and with nobody around to help you...
Haddo: I know, but this domain is nowhere near as dangerous as the desert.
Haddo: I was thinking that if I could handle these problems myself, then you two wouldn't have to argue about anything.
Haddo: If it weren't for my poor health and lack of energy all the time, then I wouldn't have always been such a burden on you two.
Jeroney: No need to feel guilty, Haddo. This was our choice. The three of us love adventuring, no one is a burden on anyone.
Jeroney: Isn't that why we came up with the idea for this area? I would do the thinking, Ferdinand would use his muscle, and you would...
Haddo: "Draw the blueprints and build tracks. It'll be a safe way to see all kinds of amazing scenery." Yes, that was the plan.
Paimon: Hehe. See? Doesn't it feel better to just get along?
Ferdinand: Hey what are ya tryin' to say!? You make it sound like I've only been trying to talk myself up.
Klee: The Choo-Choo Cart is great, Ferdinand!
Ferdinand: Really?
Jeroney: You know, Klee... Having the cart zip along the tracks was my idea.
Klee: Yeah, what an amazing idea. You're so smart!
Haddo: Hey Klee, do you want to ride even more fun carts?
Klee: Yay, let's ride more!
Paimon: Looks like all three of them are trying to win Klee's approval now.
Traveler: And Klee is loving it.
Kaeya: Klee hasn't realized it yet, but her innocent, childlike nature is very powerful. It can inspire and even help heal others.
Haddo: Hey everyone, please come with me. We need to get the Hydro Eidolon in the cart to help us.

## Talk 6

Ferdinand: Haddo and I have double-checked everything, it's all operating safely. You can go for a ride now!
Jeroney: Hold on a sec... Before we say goodbye, I have something I'd like to give you all.
Jeroney: It's a rock climbing rope. We used it on our adventures to climb mountains and traverse many places.
Paimon: Huh? But doesn't it mean a lot to you? Are you sure you want to give it to us?
Jeroney: Yes, of course. Please take it.
Jeroney: Thanks to Klee and everyone else's help, we realized that there is a special bond that keeps us together. Even though it's invisible, it's even more important than rope, and we can always hold on to it in tough situations.
Klee: Huh? I helped?
Haddo: Yes, Klee. You were a big help.
Klee: Even bigger than that huge thing in the middle of this place?
Ferdinand: Yes, much bigger.
Klee: Wow, that's huge! I'm so happy!
Haddo: By the way, have you ever seen anything like the Choo-Choo Cart in the outside world?
Klee: Nope! Today was the first time I rode anything like it.
Haddo: Is that so? *cough* I guess I'm not surprised. Seems you won't find a Streaming Projector anywhere else.
Haddo: Be sure to come back and ride the Choo-Choo Carts again while you still have the chance.
Klee: Yep! I will!

## Talk 7

Klee: Missing text (4216695402)

## Talk 8

Klee: That's so much fun! Klee can fly across the sky like a real mage now!
Paimon: Uh... Guess that... sort of makes sense?
Paimon: Wait — but if being able to fly makes you a mage, what does that make Kaeya? Since he's here too...
Klee: Nothing, Kaeya's just the Master Thief. Don't you remember, Paimon?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Oh right... Guess it slipped Paimon's mind.
Kaeya: Sorry to bother our young Mage, but there's something the Master Thief would like to report. Do you still remember our mission?
Klee: Uh-oh!
Klee: I was having so much fun that I almost forgot...
Kaeya: We're supposed to be helping Idyia look for the missing components. But don't worry, I've already got one.
Klee: You mean you snatched it when we weren't looking?
Kaeya: Haha, I didn't have to go that far.
Kaeya: In fact, the component we were searching for was actually that orange rope. If anything, you could say it came right into our hands at the right time. Let's head back and give it to Idyia.
Klee: Aww, do we really have to go...?
Klee: Okay... Even though I want to keep playing, I know Idyia is really important!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's our wise mage... Don't worry, tonight you'll be able to see stars in the water and watch fish dance in the sky.
Paimon: Uh, seems Kokomi's out of it after that ride... Her face is completely blank, and her lip was trembling while she was speaking. Maybe we should have a rest for a while.
Traveler: You shouldn't push yourself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah? I thought I was keeping my composure pretty well...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, my mind is always spinning, I'm used to this! We should head back to Idyia.
Klee: How about we hold hands, Miss General? Klee will give you energy!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: (Huh, after holding Klee's hand, the stars in the sky and the fish in the water have all disappeared. I must have been seeing things from riding in the cart... Whew.)
Paimon: Hmm? What are you smiling about, Kokomi?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Huh? Oh, ah... Ahem, nothing... nothing at all.
Traveler: We're in no rush.

## Talk 9

Idyia: Welcome back! Well? Any good news? Ah! Don't tell me! You've taken care of all the problems and now I don't have to do anything!?
Traveler: You won't be disappointed.
Klee: Yeah, we even rode the Choo-Choo Cart! Do you wanna come ride too?
Klee: Uh, but maybe you'll have to wait till tomorrow. I'm a little tired now...
Kaeya: Seems she had a little too much fun and now she's about to crash. Haha, I think it's time for a rest.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Good idea, I think we could all use some down time. Thanks for giving me some energy, Klee.
Kaeya: Then we'll see you later.
Traveler: Bye, Klee.
Klee: #Bye, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight! Bye, everyone!
Idyia: Well, it sounds like our young mage enjoyed herself. I'm happy that she had a good time.
Idyia: So, back to the missing component. Did you bring it?
Paimon: You bet! Kaeya said that the missing component was this orange climbing rope.
Idyia: Ah, it just occurred to me that you probably ran into the three brothers while you were in the canyon.
Idyia: If I remember correctly, the two eldest brothers were taking their sickly younger brother on adventures, when they ran into a sandstorm and ended up here.
Idyia: They were all arguing with one other when they first arrived, but it wasn't long before they broke down and were huddled together in tears.
Idyia: *sigh* They sure must have a lot of energy to keep up their bickering and adventuring every day. I'm a little worried about them, yet quite envious of all that energy...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You almost sound as if you're reminiscing about old friends, Idyia.
Idyia: Yes, I've known them for quite some time, after all... But I seldom go to that area.
Idyia: #You can hold on to the rope for now, {NICKNAME}. I have no use for it until we have the other components.
Idyia: By the way, Eula and Collei have also returned, but I'm afraid they weren't able to make much headway.
Idyia: They mentioned that they would like to head to the jungle north of here once you have all rested up.
Traveler: Understood.
Idyia: Now that I've told you everything, I'll go rest... Uh, I mean, I'll go and check on the situation in the remaining two areas.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Do you need me to accompany you?
Idyia: Oh! No, it's alright. You've already accomplished a lot today, you should rest up.
Traveler: Yep, we took care of everything.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ferdinand: Be sure to come back and visit Torrential Twister again... I hope you enjoyed it!

### Additional Talk 2

Jeroney: Thanks again. I have a feeling we'll get along much better now that we've learned to open up to each other.
Jeroney: I suppose some things are simpler than they appear... The real problem all along was actually us.

### Additional Talk 3

Haddo: Hey, imagine if we could build our tracks all over the world. Traveling would be so much easier! *cough*
