# Suspicious Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns

A traditional snack from Liyue. A large bundle of fried-up Jueyun Chili has been piled up in the middle, and their heat is all but unbearable. Just one small bite feels like someone's trying to burn your throat. A few more bites, and who knows, you might actually end up breathing fire like Guoba!
