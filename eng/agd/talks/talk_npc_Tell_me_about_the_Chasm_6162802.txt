Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Mining in the Chasm is prohibited now. The Qixing came and sealed the whole place off.
Shizhuang the Strong: Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
Shizhuang the Strong: Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. Until one day, they dug up... something very strange...
Shizhuang the Strong: In an effort to contain it, the Qixing insisted on sealing the place off, despite it going against their immediate interests...
Shizhuang the Strong: Now that did surprise me. It's not like those big business types to look past the Mora signs in their eyes.
Traveler: Something very strange?
Shizhuang the Strong: ...I didn't see it with my own eyes. But I'm told the ones who did have been in a coma ever since.
Shizhuang the Strong: Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
Shizhuang the Strong: If even the Qixing's response is to literally put a lid on it, then I certainly don't plan to look into it any further myself.
Shizhuang the Strong: It will serve me better to concentrate on my next step now the mine's closed. I can't go letting my curiosity get the better of me.
Shizhuang the Strong: I feel sorry for the boys though. Now the mine's gone, they're lost souls. They've got nothing to do with themselves, and it's really crushed them.
