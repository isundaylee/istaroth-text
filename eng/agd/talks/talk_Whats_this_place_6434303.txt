Traveler: What's this place?
Isami: This is Pardis Dhyai, a research site for Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta. You can meet researchers studying topics like plants, Shroom-Kin, and even insects here.
Isami: They're mostly researchers and students of the Akademiya, and some are close collaborators with Pardis Dhyai.
Isami: For example, a Forest Watcher of Gandharva Ville used to spend all his time here while he was studying. Even if he has left the Akademiya now, he still comes here often to conduct research.
Isami: His research findings are very precious, so Pardis Dhyai is willing to assist the Forest Rangers in their work too. Call it a mutually beneficial cooperation.
