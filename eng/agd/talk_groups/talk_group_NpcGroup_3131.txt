Traveler: What do you sell here?
Kiyoko: Well, feel free to have a look. This way, please.

Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself, if you would...
Kiyoko: I'm a merchant who came to Watatsumi Island specifically to do business. I provide high-quality, low-cost goods.
Kiyoko: You've seen how things are around here. The village is small, the villagers lead rather limited existences, and they still need to receive those soldiers...
Kiyoko: *cough* It's not that I'm looking down on this place. In fact, it's precisely because it's lacking development that it needs our help, right?
Kiyoko: So that's why I decided to stay here for good and provide goods at an affordable asking, such that the inhabitants of this island will never lack daily necessities.

## Talk

Traveler: See you, then.
Kiyoko: See you! Come back next time if you need anything.

Traveler: Is importing goods convenient?
Kiyoko: Well... This is a rather distant location, and it isn't under the jurisdiction of the Shogunate either, which makes importing goods quite tricky. In fact, I really don't know how these people got by before I came here...
Kiyoko: *cough* Well, I've got my ways in any case. All my goods are delivered from the wharf via legal means.
Kiyoko: The only big hassle is the questioning I get from the soldiers there every single time.
Kiyoko: I mean, couldn't they give me a pass on account of all the help that I've given them? You know, like an exemption certificate or something...
