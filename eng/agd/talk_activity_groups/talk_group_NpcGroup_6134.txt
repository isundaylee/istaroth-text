## Talk

Orqo: ...Let's go somewhere a bit further away!

## Talk

Traveler: So? How's your hidden power?
Orqo: Mmm... It's still hidden. Sometimes I can't help but think it's just keeping really, really calm. Still, it doesn't matter. I've got a long list of places I haven't been to yet!
Orqo: So there should be plenty more opportunities to awaken it, right? I've also heard some other incantations and versions recently, so I can give 'em all a try.

## Talk

Traveler: Don't worry your family too much.
Orqo: I know, I know! Next time I'll explain things to Dad before I leave... Hmm, here, take this! I've heard that it'll bring good luck on your next trip. C'mon, take it!

## Talk

Traveler: About the story of Qoyllor...
Orqo: Well, I now know that was a story passed down by the Masters of the Night-Wind. And it wasn't because he was punished by the sun that Dad can't see...
Orqo: Though, if Mom didn't go back to the stars, where did she go?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Orqo: See you!
