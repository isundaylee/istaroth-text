# Delicious Honey Char Siu

A type of roasted meat from Liyue. Richly red in color, aromatic, and intensely flavorful. Why, one might even faint from gluttony if one stares at it for too long. Between mouthfuls of delicious meat and rich sauce, one bowl of rice might seem too measly a match for this taste experience!
