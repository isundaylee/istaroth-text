# Windrise, Windfall


## Talk 1

Elzer: This storm really is annoying...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Elzer: Hmm? Oh, it's you, Traveler. Master Diluc mentioned you. Said you were an experienced and skilled adventurer...
Elzer: Ahem... I'm going off topic. So, did you come to the Dawn Winery to pick some wine?
Elzer: Sorry, but this is a bad time. Due to the storms, the three roads leading out of the winery have all been rendered impassable.
Elzer: The Knights of Favonius were able to clear the obstacles blown in by the wind quickly, but the nearby monsters have all gathered on the road for some reason.
Elzer: People can go around the area, but it is impassable to cargo-carrying carts. We can't move any of our wine out, and the ingredients we ordered can't come in. It is most frustrating...
Elzer: But I've heard of your exploits, and I know of your skills, so perhaps...
Elzer: If you would, could you get those three roads reopened?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Just leave it to me.
Elzer: Wonderful. Thank you for your willingness to assist. I have marked the three merchant routes on your map. Please help us out.

## Talk 3

Traveler: There are other things I must attend to...
Elzer: Is that so... Then I must find some other way to resolve this problem.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Elzer: If our winery's business remains closed for any longer, how will I face Master Diluc...
Elzer: Traveler, if you meet Master Diluc, could you tell him about this?
Elzer: It just won't do, the way he just leaves the winery to its own devices all the time.

### Additional Talk 2

Elzer: Have you cleared the merchant roads out?
Traveler: They're spick and span.
Elzer: That's great. Our winery's business can gradually resume now.
Elzer: Honestly, I should have reported this matter to Master Diluc...
Elzer: But he's upped and disappeared. I've searched high and low for him all over the winery, but no one knows where he's gone.
Elzer: Adelinde said something like "Master Diluc has gone to attend to a personal matter," but refused to say anything more. She didn't even look worried.
Elzer: *sigh* Forget it. Once he's back, I will have a good talk with him...
