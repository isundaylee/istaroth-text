Traveler: How many kinds of fireworks are there here?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: If you're asking about fireworks, it's a long story from a long time ago...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Transportation wasn't very convenient back then, so people on different islands found it hard to communicate with each other.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: One day, people suddenly discovered the various uses of fire. Apart from keeping warm, the smoke fire creates can also be seen from far away...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Much later on... people invented fireworks, hahaha.
