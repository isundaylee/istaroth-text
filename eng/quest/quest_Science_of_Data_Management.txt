# Science of Data Management


## Talk 1

Chalmet: That should do it... I hope these materials will actually be useful.
Traveler: Are you still organizing files?
Chalmet: Oho! Pleasure to see you, Honorary Senior Researcher.
Chalmet: That's correct! I am continuing to organize the documents and files according to Mr. Raimondo's instructions... Wait, haven't I said this before?
Paimon: But this place is huge! It's way too much work for one person. Why didn't he assign anyone to help you?
Chalmet: The Research Institute has many pressing matters to deal with. It's normal that there's no one available to help me.
Traveler: And you're a Director too...
Chalmet: You mean my title as Fontaine Research Institute Materials Retrieval Project Director? *sigh* Please don't mock me so...
Chalmet: In what way am I actually a Director? From the very beginning, I have been no more than an ordinary staffer responsible for organizing files.
Chalmet: After Mr. Raimondo assigned me here to organize the files, I was suddenly informed of my new title.
Chalmet: Someone said this was Mr. Choiseul's idea. Apparently he thinks that since our work is so onerous, giving us such titles will make providing additional compensation easier...
Chalmet: Ah! Don't tell anyone else, how could I... how could I just say it out loud like that...
Traveler: I'm the silent type, relax.
Paimon: That sounds not bad at all! And after all, it's only fair that those who do all the work should receive a bit more compensation.
Paimon: But why use such a roundabout method? Can't they just give everyone more Mora?
Traveler: This seems par for the course here at the Research Institute.
Chalmet: *sigh* I can never understand just what the two of them are thinking...
Chalmet: But I have to keep working, no matter what! There's too much to do.
Chalmet: Honorary Senior Researcher, if you are willing, could you please give me a hand?
Traveler: It is my duty.
Chalmet: In that case, please help me clear out some of the filth around here.
Chalmet: Be sure to do your best <color=#00E1FFFF>not to touch the nearby books and files</color> while you're cleaning. It would be absolutely awful if they were damaged by the cleaning...
Chalmet: I'll leave that to you then! As for me, I'll keep organizing the files here. *sigh* I never noticed there were so many files in the Institute before...
Traveler: Don't forget to make the "honorary" in my title even more honorable!
Chalmet: Hahaha, not a problem! I will testify to your kindness and contributions.
Traveler: As long as you actually receive the extra Mora.

## Talk 2

Chalmet: *sigh* I never noticed there were so many files in the Institute before...

## Talk 3

Chalmet: Phew... Thanks for your help. Were it not for you, who knows how long it would have taken me...
Chalmet: No wonder you're the Honorary Senior Researcher. No matter what you do, you do it well.
Traveler: I've always been a bit out of the ordinary.
Chalmet: I must thank you again for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher. Please, take these.
Traveler: I've got some experience in the cleaning department.
Chalmet: Huh? Then you truly are multitalented, and eminently worthy of your title!

## Talk 4

Chalmet: Phew... Thanks for your help. Were it not for you, who knows how long it would have taken me...
Chalmet: Though, if you had been a bit gentler with the cleaning, that would have been even better...
Traveler: Sorry about that...
Chalmet: Don't misunderstand! I'm not blaming you, you really did do me a huge favor.
Chalmet: These are for you. Thank you for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher.
Traveler: I'll go a bit easier next time...
