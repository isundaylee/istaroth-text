Traveler: About the Tatarigami...
Moriguchi: *sigh* As a resident of Watatsumi Island, it pains me to say this, but it was our comrades who undertook that action.
Moriguchi: Wars really do cause people who fight in them to stop being themselves.
Moriguchi: As a soldier, I can understand what they did. But as a husband and a father, such deeds are unforgivable, even if they were perpetrated by my comrades.
Moriguchi: Her Excellency the Divine Priestess has imposed strict military orders to prevent any such things from happening again.
Moriguchi: Regardless, this is a lesson to both sides of this conflict.
