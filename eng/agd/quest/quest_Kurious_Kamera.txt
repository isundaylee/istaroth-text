# Kurious Kamera

Ji Tong: How very strange... What is the matter with this Kamera?
Traveler: What's wrong with your Kamera?
Ji Tong: I think it's broken... Well, maybe not broken, but it's certainly not working like it's supposed to.
Ji Tong: I ordered a batch from Fontaine a while back.
Ji Tong: The person who sold it to me said that this particular kind of Kamera features the very latest technology from Fontaine.
Ji Tong: Supposedly, it can print photos in a special hue and add in some special effects, or something. So I bought one to try it out.
Ji Tong: But try as I might, I can't get it to print out photos properly. I don't know whether I'm using it wrong, or if it's just faulty.
Ji Tong: Maybe there's some trick to it that I'm not getting...
Ji Tong: So, how about you? Much of a Kamera Konnoisseur yourself?
Traveler: I dabble.
Ji Tong: I'll take that as a yes! So, could I get you to help?
Ji Tong: I'm guessing you're a traveler? You must have a lot of experiences under your belt.
Ji Tong: What I'd like you to do is use this Kamera to take a picture of something with a strong color.
Ji Tong: Once you've taken a snap, if you could please bring me the photo. I want to see if I can isolate the source of the issue...
Ji Tong: And if I can't, I'll take the photos to the seller and see what he has to say. With the photos as hard evidence, he won't be able to dismiss the issue.
Traveler: I'll do it.
Ji Tong: Great. Thanks!
Traveler: What do you mean by strong color?
Ji Tong: Oh, you know... Really bright colors, like red Jueyun Chilis, blue Mist Flower...
Ji Tong: Once you've taken a good shot, bring me the photo.
Traveler: Never heard of a "Kamera" in my life.
Ji Tong: Oh, I see... Well, never mind, it's simple enough to use... Would you mind giving me a hand anyway?
