# The Phaethons' Syrtos


## Talk 1

Clymene: Hmm? How strange. I have not seen someone in your garb for a many long years...
Clymene: From your mannerisms, you are not from Byakuyakoku either.
Clymene: Are you some guest from afar who fell into this place?
Traveler: That's more or less correct...
Clymene: To think that there were ways to access Byakuyakoku from the outside world... Shocking news indeed.
Clymene: I was born here, and I have never seen anyone from the outside world.
Clymene: Someone once told me that he wanted to catch a glimpse of the world outside. I took his words for a jest...
Clymene: *sigh*
Clymene: Traveler. In truth, I have a humble request for you.
Clymene: There are seven royal tombs scattered throughout Byakuyakoku, in which the remains of our "Sunchi{RUBY#[S]Phaethons}ldren" have been interred.
Paimon: The Sunchildren...
Clymene: Indeed. Here, we worship the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Clymene: After a certain number of years, an infant will be chosen as the Sunchild, gaining control over the nation.
Clymene: We had... a total of seven Sunchildren.
Clymene: O rare Traveler from another land, please, kindly pay respects at their tombs.
Paimon: Um, why would you need us outsiders to do that?
Paimon: Isn't it usually up to their family and friends to pay respects to them?
Clymene: Indeed, that would normally be the case.
Clymene: Unfortunately, I fear that no one in this nation would want to do so.
Clymene: In fact, it is likely that these royal tombs have not been visited in a long time.
Paimon: But why's that?
Paimon: Do the people of this nation dislike the Sunchildren?
Clymene: "Dislike" is perhaps too kind a word. "Detest" might be more fitting.
Clymene: As I said earlier, the Sunchildren were born into their role.
Clymene: But how could mere children rule a nation? The ones who truly controlled everything were powerful people behind the scenes.
Clymene: The Sunchildren were mere puppets, their every move manipulated by these people.
Clymene: And yet there was no end to the greed of those powerful people. They grew fat off the toil of the people, compelling the Sunchildren to perform heinous deeds.
Clymene: And so, the peoples' ire rose, and many of those sins were laid at the feet of the Sunchildren.
Paimon: That's awful...
Paimon: The Sunchildren were innocent!
Clymene: Innocent? Oh no, they were not.
Clymene: As far as the people of Byakuyakoku were concerned, their ignorance was the greatest sin of all.
Clymene: A sin, even committed in ignorance, can hurt others. Can a person who commits such transgressions truly be called innocent?
Clymene: It would be difficult, no? The damage is already done, and it cannot be undone.
Traveler: But if that's what you think...
Clymene: Well, you can consider this... my personal sentimentality speaking.
Clymene: My name is Clymene. I was a female official in charge of taking care of the Sunchildren's daily lives within the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Clymene: Though I knew that they did wrong, and though I was aware that they were being manipulated...
Clymene: They were still children that I watched grow up. I pitied them, and I grieved for them...
Clymene: In the end, I could not hate them...
Clymene: Though my work involved being around them every day, I was under heavy surveillance.
Clymene: I was not permitted to say a single word when I was around those children.
Clymene: But when no one was around, when they were helpless and afraid, they would say so, so many things to me...
Clymene: ...And I could not offer them a single word in reply.
Clymene: If I had possessed but a little self-sacrificial courage to say something, anything to them...
Clymene: Perhaps everything might have gone differently...
Clymene: So please, I beg you. I cannot face them as I am, so this is the only way I can honor them.
Clymene: Please, good Traveler, lend me your aid just this once.
Clymene: A single Sango Pearl is all I ask, to be laid before their tombs.
Clymene: This way, you'll be able to light the Soul Lamps at the stone shrine here and open the way to the Soul Guide's Locus and bring their spirits peace...
Traveler: Alright.
Clymene: Thank you. This task is in your hands, then.
Traveler: Why do you still want us to pay our respects to them?

## Talk 2

Clymene: There were seven Sunchildren in all. Traveler, please take my place and pay respects before their tombs.

## Talk 3

Clymene: Ah, the seven Soul Lamps are lit...
Clymene: It seems that you have completed your task. I will always remember how you have aided me.
Clymene: Now come, allow me to open it for you... The path to the Soul Guide's Locus.
Clymene: Traveler from a foreign land, I know that I have caused you much trouble... But please, bear witness as they are laid to rest.
Clymene: Follow this path. I will meet you on its far side.

## Talk 4

Clymene: Ah, Traveler, you have arrived.
Clymene: This is the Soul Guide's Locus, and this is where my final thoughts remain.
Clymene: When the Sunchildren reached a certain age, they would follow a ceremony and enter the Dainichi Mikoshi on their birth date.
Traveler: They would enter it?
Clymene: Yes, and that process was known as the Rite of Solar Return.
Clymene: The Sunchildren were birthed from the Dainichi Mikoshi, and they would again return to the seat of the sun before the mortal world could taint them.
Clymene: ...The temperature of the Dainichi Mikoshi was such that its light could warm all of Byakuyakoku.
Clymene: Of the Sunchildren, naught but shreds of the souls that once were returned at last to the Locus.
Clymene: But I still believe that, perhaps...
Traveler: Perhaps...?
Clymene: If I was the one who opened the Locus, I might be able to use my memories to supplement what remains of their souls.
Clymene: Allow me to try.
Clymene: Piramumon... Orupeusu... I am here. Will you not return?
Clymene: ...
Traveler: How did it go?
Clymene: *sigh* Of the seven Sunchildren, Piramumon and Orupeusu were raised by mine own hand. If even they will not return...
Clymene: It seems that my memories alone are insufficient...
Clymene: If only there was something I could use as a medium... If I had the Divine Bridle, perhaps, the badge of the Sunchild's office, it might just work.
Clymene: But alas! It was lost to us long ago.
Clymene: *sigh* This nation, Byakuyakoku, still hates those children.
Clymene: Perhaps my desire to free their souls is but a forlorn hope.
Clymene: ...But still, Traveler, if you would consider this my final request — could you help to find the Divine Bridle?
Clymene: I know that the chances of finding it are quite slim, and indeed, it is rude of me to ask yet more of you.
Clymene: But...
Traveler: I understand.
Clymene: I... Thank you...
Clymene: Still, the bridle has been lost for many long years. You need not rush.
Clymene: If you should hear of it, please, tell me.
Traveler: I'll do my best.
Traveler: Doesn't that mean...

## Talk 5

Clymene: Traveler... Have you... found the bridle?
Clymene: Could you... let me have a look at it?

## Talk 6

Clymene: Ahhh... This is the Divine Bridle. The genuine article indeed!
Clymene: I never thought that the day would come when I might lay eyes on it once more. Traveler, tell me — whence did you get this?
Traveler: From Aberaku...
Clymene: From Aberaku no Mikoto himself?
Clymene: How strange. I remember clearly that he was a great figure from the days when our nation had just been founded.
Clymene: But it was said that he planned to usurp the seat of the Sunchild, and was branded with the crime of treason.
Clymene: But since you say that you obtained it from his hands, perhaps there are hidden things at work that I do not understand.
Clymene: So, fate has decreed the bridle should resurface here... Ah, I can recall the faces of those children already...
Clymene: This way, I might finally atone for my failings...
Clymene: Traveler, place the bridle within the pool at the Locus. With it, we can surely revivify their souls.
Clymene: Yes, that they may be made whole, and that they may walk the path to the next life hale!

## Talk 7

Paimon: One, two, three... Looks like we've finished paying respects at all seven tombs!
Paimon: Let's go back to the stone shrine and tell the spirit there about this.

## Talk 8

Clymene: Ah, Piramumon. You did so love books, saying that there must be a world outside our knowledge, though I did not believe you then...
Clymene: I always smiled and shook my head at your wild pronouncements. Alas, alas! I should have believed you!
Clymene: You said that one day you would escape the Dainichi Mikoshi and venture into paths beyond...
Clymene: Go now, Piramumon. Let no one shackle you again. Go, be free!
Clymene: And you, Orupeusu, Orupeusu. What would I give to hear you sing again?
Clymene: There was no one who could hear your clear, pure voice, and did not wish to sing along in their hearts.
Clymene: The night before the Rite of Solar Return, you suddenly wished to hear my voice. No matter what, you desired to hear me sing.
Clymene: You told me that no matter how terribly I sang, you would not laugh.
Clymene: You knew, didn't you? You knew that this Solar Return would be your last.
Clymene: And yet I... To the end, I...
Traveler: Clymene?
Clymene: ...I apologize, Traveler. That was unsightly of me.
Clymene: The female official who serves the Sunchildren is meant to maintain her purity... She shall never marry.
Clymene: Thus, I had no children of my own all my life.
Clymene: These children, whom I served and watched grow older... At some point, they became closer to me than blood.
Clymene: Thank you, Traveler. Thank you for finding the bridle.
Clymene: It has passed through the hands of every Sunchild, and the memories it has inherited are enough to fill the gaps in their souls.
Clymene: ...Even though these memories are double-sided.
Traveler: Double-sided?
Clymene: Of course. In this case, the memories are two-fold. On one hand, you have your own memories, and on the other, you have others' memories of you.
Clymene: Thus the gaps are being filled by both the Sunchildren's own memories, imprinted upon the bridle...
Clymene: As well as the memories of them as the children who were blamed by Byakuyakoku, of those who became children of sin.
Clymene: My own memories are insufficient, and so I had to supplement them with those of the people of our nation.
Clymene: And it is thanks to these transgressions that have been laid upon them that they have now been remembered by Byakuyakoku, and can now leave their afterimages behind.
Clymene: Thank you, Traveler. My greatest wish now lies fulfilled.
Clymene: I can finally... be at ease.
Clymene: Yes, I... can finally be with those children again...
Traveler: Memories have sides?

## Talk 9

Clymene: Please, Traveler, place the Divine Bridle within the waters of the Soul Guide's Locus...
