Traveler: Who are you?
Greg: The name's Greg! I work at the Dawn Winery — Master Diluc was in a good mood today and he gave me a bottle from his private stock!
Greg: Good wine should be enjoyed in the company of good people! How's about you come with me to the winery and we crack this open together?
Greg: Hmm... I must say I seem to have forgotten my way, the Dawn Winery is... northwest from here, right?
Traveler: No.
Greg: Tut-tut... You're clearly sober if your sense of direction is intact.
Greg: Get outta my face, you non-drunkard!
Traveler: Yes.
Greg: Hehehe, well, well, well... Off we go then!
Greg: It looks like someone's had a bit too much to drink! Here — let me hold you up...
Greg: Come on, don't worry about it! There's still a long way to go, let me hold you up.
Traveler: You've been staring at my coin pouch this whole time.
Greg: Ai-ya, my friend! Listen to the hurtful words you are saying! I couldn't possibly steal from you...
Greg: ...Wait, how did you even notice?
Greg: If you're not drunk, then quit pretending to be! You're wasting my time!
Greg: Go on, move along. I've got no further interest in you.
