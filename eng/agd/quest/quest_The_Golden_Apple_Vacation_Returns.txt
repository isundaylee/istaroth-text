# The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!


## Talk 1

Paimon: You said the cap had traces of Hydro on it? Then let's follow the traces of elemental energy!

## Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: We're close. Watch out.

## Talk 3

Paimon: It's the Fatui!

## Talk 4

Xinyan: Okay, I'll start by catching ten crabs and twenty fish! Hmm... will that be enough for all of us? Maybe I should prepare something else?

## Talk 5

Venti: Look where we are... Yup, I can sense that you're about to tell me something very interesting.
Black Screen Text: You tell Venti about the Spark Knight giving an island to Fischl, and Fischl's plans to head there...
Venti: Klee gave a special gift from her mother to an adventurer friend? She's such a kindhearted child.
Venti: As I'm sure you've already guessed, that letter is most definitely written by Alice.
Paimon: Yeah, thought so...
Venti: Speaking of, guess which two people I ran into on my way to the tavern today?
Paimon: Hmm... Master Jean? Or... Lisa?
Venti: A mother and daughter, both with long elf ears and the most amazingly adorable personalities.
Paimon: Alice and Klee!?
Venti: Ding-ding-ding! Correct answer!
Venti: The unaging mage was taking her teeny-tiny knight on a vacation, and I happened to run into them. As a friendly greeting, the mysterious woman gave me a gift...
Venti: #She also said that if I meet any fun friends, I should share this gift with them. So now, it's yours to keep, Traveler.
Paimon: Ahh! It's a bomb!
Venti: Minus the fuse — so don't worry, it's not going to explode. Come on, take it. This way, we can talk to each other just like this even when we're apart.
Traveler: Wow, that sounds impressive.
Venti: It's called a "Dodocommunication Device," and it allows people to stay in touch over vast distances. However, you can't just use it anytime you want, and there's also a limit on the number of times you can use it. That's why it's currently only available to a certain select few.
Venti: I heard that the inspiration for this comes from another world... Alice is always full of surprises.
Venti: She and Klee asked me to tell you: "Please take this with you when you depart for the island— no wait, the promised land with your friends, and have fun!"
Venti: Don't worry about how to get there. The organizers of this vacation have made arrangements. Turn right after you exit the city gates, and you'll see something that will make you very happy.
Paimon: Sounds like the two of you are in cahoots over this...
Venti: Haha, of course not. Is that really the sort of person you think I am?
Venti: #Traveler, you're my friend. And as your friend, I just want to give you something that will make you happy. How can you think this of me?
Traveler: Alright, I'll go.
Paimon: Fair enough... the Tone-Deaf Bard does like to joke around, but he's still one of our best friends. Besides, a vacation sounds great, hehe...
Paimon: Actually, Kazuha and Xinyan seemed pretty interested in coming on this trip, too. Let's ask them if they wanna join us!
Xinyan: You're back. Poor Kazuha's still out for the count... seems like he can't handle alcohol so well.
Paimon: Xinyan, do you wanna come to the islands with us?
Kaedehara Kazuha: *snore*... adventure... can't...
Xinyan: Huh? He doesn't wanna go anymore? He seemed really interested just a moment ago.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Can't... miss... the adventure...
Xinyan: Hahahaha, Kazuha might act mature, but deep down he's just another youngster eager for new experiences. That must be why he didn't think anything of the "fruit juice" earlier.
Venti: Well, all the more reason for you to join the island trip! You know, a lot of people have praised the beautiful scenery there — even bards.
Xinyan: #Okay! Sounds like a plan! Traveler, how do we get there?
Paimon: Someone's got it covered, apparently. There'll be a few others joining us on this trip, and we're meeting at the city gate tomorrow morning. We'll wait for you.
Traveler: Kazuha, wake up! We're going wandering!
Kaedehara Kazuha: #...Hm? Traveler?
Paimon: Oh yeah, they don't know Fischl yet, do they! Okay, so here's the deal, there's a princess from a faraway land and her retinue, who're also coming on this trip...
Xinyan: ...?
Xinyan: Uh, Paimon, don't get me wrong, I'm just askin' to make sure... but from the way you're plugging this trip so hard... did the Iridescence Tour folks put you up to this?
Xinyan: After all, canceling the Iridescence Tour after people already made the trip... That's kinda the same thing as tricking people into going traveling, ain't it?
Paimon: Ahhh! Why won't anyone believe Paimon!
Venti: Hahaha, don't worry about that for now. You'll all have the chance to get acquainted with each other tomorrow morning.
Venti: Whether you're a princess, a retainer, a talking raven, a samurai or a musician... You're all VIP guests of the island on your summer vacation, and that's what counts, right?
Xinyan: I'm sure lookin' forward to it!
Traveler: Are you coming too, Venti?
Venti: I'll have to pass. I have some work to take care of.
Paimon: You serious? The Tone-Deaf Bard actually has plans to do some work?
Venti: I promised a young lady with cat ears and a cat tail that I'd sing in her tavern to boost business and beat the competition. Ah yes, the competition being this place, which has Six-Fingered José.
Paimon: Aren't you allergic to cats?
Venti: Yup! I can always sing on their roof.
Venti: She told me that as long as their sales surpass their competitor, there's a whole month's worth of wine in it for me. What a fine employment opportunity, virtually tailor-made for me!
Venti: So have fun, and don't worry about me. Haha, I feel like this summer is going to be a very interesting one.

## Talk 6

Fischl: Today is the day of one's reckoning with fate, as foretold by the night sky! Humiliations suffered in the past, the shame we have carried all these years, one bids you adieu! For today, it is time for... retribution!
Oz: Mein Fräulein, if I may be so bold, that final phrase did not sound like one of your own.
Fischl: Of course it wasn't. I just overheard it from someone in the city... Ahem! I mean, thy Prinzessin is merely drawing on the wisest and courageous sayings she has heard in the land, to signify the importance of this day...
Mona: Hmm, let me see... Huh? It really is someone else's catchphrase...
Paimon: Wow, you're here early!
Mona: Hi!
Mona: Who've you brought with you...?
Paimon: Oh! Ahem! Allow Paimon to introduce to you a fabled wandering swordsman of Inazuma, and an enchanting musical talent of Liyue.
Xinyan: Hey! I'm Xinyan, from Liyue. I like rock 'n' roll, sunny days, and good times.
Xinyan: You must be the princess Paimon told us about? You sure do look the part! I hear you're from a faraway land — it's an honor to be in the company of dignitaries!
Xinyan: And this lady over here... My family tells me that only the wisest scholars wear pointed hats like this one. Guessing that applies to you, too?
Mona (Mona and Fischl): (Oh, I like her. She can stay!)
Fischl: Xinyan, your gaze pierces the dark veil of night to arrive at the truth beyond. I am in need of one such as yourself. Very well, you shall be one's musician laureate.
Mona: She's trying to say, thanks, you say all the right things! Um, and the same goes for me too. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Mona, an astrologist.
Xinyan: Oh, well it's nice to meet you too!
Paimon: Mona is amazing, she can find out everything about you by divination!
Kaedehara Kazuha: A princess, an astrologist, and an articulate raven-retainer... In the company of giants, my humble self hardly deserves mention.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I am Kaedehara Kazuha from Inazuma. It is an honor to meet you all.
Fischl: What ho, Kazuha, divulge thy epithets and thy vocation.
Oz: Oh, mein Fräulein would like to know where you work, and what your field of expertise is.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Um... I'm afraid I'm just another wanderer...
Paimon: This guy is an expert in the sword arts. He parries blades that none have ever parried before, and strikes like lightning! Mere mortals could not hope to comprehend!
Fischl: (What? Is he really that powerful!?)
Mona: Let me take a look... huh!? Oh, oh my...
Mona: Hi, Kazuha, I'm absolutely delighted to meet a great swordmaster like you. Could we ask you to be our guard while we're on the island?
Fischl: One hereby declares you Captain of the Royal Guard of the Immernachtreich.
Oz: For even Lady Megistus to praise your skills, you are surely one of rare talent.
Traveler: Lady Megistus is absolutely right!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Okay, Lady M—Meg...
Xinyan: Lady M—Megi... what?
Mona: Just call me Mona! Stop calling me that weird name.
Paimon: By the way, Lady Megistus, we found out how to get to the promised land.
Paimon: A legendary great mage gave us a big hint. Come on, everyone follow Paimon!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Look, everyone! Here's our vehicle.
Mona: ...
Mona: Somehow, I suddenly don't feel like going anymore.
Xinyan: What a... unique little thing. Looks kinda like Guoba, doesn't it?
Traveler: ?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Guoba... is he the magical creature at Wanmin Restaurant? Now that you mention it... it does look quite similar.
Paimon: Uh... to be honest, even Paimon isn't so sure this can take us to the island after all...
Fischl: ...Hm.
Fischl: I see... I see. Only by meeting the lowliest of ends can we arrive at the Immernachtreich born anew.
Fischl: Haha, behold, the doorway cloven by Thundering Retribution... by such means as I once descended into this realm to bring retribution do I now venture into the next. Come, Oz! Lead the way!
Oz: I will enter first. Mein Fräulein need not worry.
Paimon: ...He's in... and now he's gone!
Fischl: Why... this truly is the path of retribution that leads to the promised land!
Mona: Maybe I should just do a quick reading for safety...
Paimon: Lady Megistus, it's fine! This is Alice's creation, it's totally safe! Spare yourself the trouble, just come with us.
Mona: Oh right! I completely forgot...*sigh* Alright.
Black Screen Text: Everyone exchanges glances before, one by one, stepping nervously but excitedly into the "Dodofortress"...
Black Screen Text: The journey is an eventful one... and maybe a little crowded...?
Paimon: It's so dark in here. Um, can someone turn on a light? Hey! Quit pushing!
Mona: Come on now, let's all try and stay... Ow! Fischl! You're treading on my hair!
Fischl: I thought it was a snake!
Xinyan: Ahh! We're flying!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, be careful!

## Talk 8

Xinyan: Whew, we finally landed! What was that all about...
Kaedehara Kazuha: What a beautiful place. The wind is soft and the ocean is calm... And a pleasant scent blows on the breeze.
Paimon: Yup! Paimon's feeling way better already now that we can see the ocean!
Fischl: ...
Oz: An ocean of life, and a land filled with flora... Mein Fräulein, we have finally arrived at the promised land, whence we shall revive the Immernachtreich.
Fischl: ...O faithful retainers, this is the blessed paradise that one has been searching for. Here is where we shall witness the culmination of all things!
Fischl: I, who command the darkness, shall lead you to yonder gate of dreams.
Mona: ...
Fischl: ...shall lead you... to yonder gate of dreams!
Mona: ...
Mona: Your Archmage Megistus thanks you for your kindness, Your Highness. In this moment, I offer my blessings to the Immernachtreich.
Xinyan: Mona... wh—what are you, uh...
Mona: Don't ask, just follow my lead!
Xinyan: Oh... oh right! Praise be to the Prinzessin, who has led us here to this sacred place!
Kaedehara Kazuha: My sincere gratitude to you for inviting me to join you on this trip, Your Highness.
Fischl: Your happiness gladdens one's heart. Ah... how it delights me to bring us all together here at this most monumentally fateful of moments.
Fischl: Now, as I take my first step on this pilgrimage, I shall perceive this ocean of life with my own earthly vessel. After all, this is where my soul belongs.
Fischl: On the contrary, Lady Megistus, blessed as you are with the great power of Hydro, one yet finds too many impurities in thy soul... Mm-mm.
Oz: Mein Fräulein means Lady Megistus is perhaps not the most talented swimmer.
Mona: ...Fischl, that's enough!
Mona: I'm happy enough to join in with the play-acting without complaining, but how dare you ridicule my genius? Think you can swim better than me? Hah, I'll bring you to your knees, young lady!
Oz: Oh my! Mein Fräulein, steel yourself, mein Fräulein!
Paimon: Oh yeah! Swimming race, swimming race! Whoever comes in last is a rotten egg!
Fischl: Challenge accepted! Heed my words, lowly Lady Megistus, you shall pay for your foolishness for as long as you live!
Mona: Ridiculous. I've never lost a single swimming race in my life. Bring it on! First one to run to the beach wins!
Xinyan: Are they serious? Running? I thought they were gonna swim.
Traveler: Never mind, looks like they're enjoying this.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #I take it you have no present plans, Traveler? I want to start by surveying the area first. Want to come along?
Traveler: Oh Kazuha, it's good we can count on you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I saw an island in the northwest, far in the distance. It looked very distinctive. I'd like to take a look.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Xinyan, are you coming?
Xinyan: Seems like everyone's got things to do... I'll stay here and hold down the fort for now. Mona and Fischl have gone swimming, and someone's gotta set up camp.
Xinyan: Don't worry, I got this! You're gonna take a look around, right? Well, make sure you lemme know if there are any good views!
Paimon: Thanks! Will do!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, what's that huge weird thing over there!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It appears to be some sort of machine and an army cap with traces of Hydro next to it. It seems that we are not the first to set foot on this island.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Also, there are footprints here. Fresh ones, likely no more than a few days old.
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't notice them at all...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Hmm?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Traveler, Paimon, stay alert.
Paimon: Why? Did you see something?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Someone was here... and they're still nearby. Judging from the scent... they are visitors here, like us.
Paimon: #There's other people here? Oh, Paimon's scared now...Come on, Traveler, we need to track 'em down!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Why are there Fatui on this island! Isn't there a single place in this world without Mint, Sweet Flowers, and Fatui?
Traveler: They get everywhere, like weeds...
Paimon: Interesting observation.
Strange Soldier: *sob* Cappy-cap's gone... where's cappy-cap...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Are you looking for something?
Strange Soldier: A cap... I c—can't... can't lose it...
Strange Soldier: Ah! I don't know anything... Gimme back cappy-cap... *sob*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Is this the cap you're looking for?
Strange Soldier: My brother's cappy-cap! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Black Screen Text: You return the cap to the Fatuus.
Paimon: Uh, this guy is not the sharpest sword in the sheath...
Strange Soldier: Don't bully me! Or I'll punch you in the... Aah! Monster, monster! *sob*
Persikov (???): Stop right there! What are you doing here?
Paimon: Another Fatuus! We could ask you the same question! What are YOU doing here, hmm!?
Strange Soldier: Protect... cappy-cap... or brother will get mad at me...
Persikov: Forget the cap! It's your brother we're looking for!
Kaedehara Kazuha: What happened to him?
Persikov: ...Nothing. He has a fever... he's just a little delirious, that's all.
Persikov: I don't have to tell you anything. Go bother someone else.
Paimon: This island belongs to our friend! You better watch what you say, mister.
Persikov: What? I thought this island was uninhabited. That's why we came here to... Ahem, never mind.
Traveler: What's that machine for?
Persikov: ...Tsk, fine. I'll tell you, but then you need to leave me alone.
Persikov: It's a new kind of energy generator that I invented. We were simply looking for a deserted island to test it out on. There, satisfied?
Traveler: Like we told you, this island is ours.
Traveler: Do not impede our vacationing.
Paimon: Yeah, and if you don't do as you're told, we'll... Oh, we'll take his cap!
Strange Soldier: Ah! Please don't... *sob*
Persikov: Hey, stop crying! ...Alright, I promise, we'll stay within this area. Okay!?
Paimon: Uh, by the way, why is there smoke coming out of your machine?
Persikov: Because the cursed thing is broken! As much as I hate to say it, our tests did not go to plan. We were getting ready to leave anyway.
Paimon: Oh, well just see yourselves out whenever you're ready. Bye.
Persikov: Come on! Let's go!
Strange Soldier: O—Okay...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe we have to deal with the Fatui during our vacation...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Why would the Fatui appear in such an isolated corner of the world... Whatever their reasons, it's likely more complicated than we might think.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Even though we're on vacation, we should stay vigilant, Traveler.
Traveler: I agree.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Also, in the interests of keeping the ladies in good spirits, I have a suggestion.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Let's keep this between us for now. Let them enjoy their vacation while Traveler and I deal with any potential threats. What do you think?
Traveler: Makes sense. I'm in.
Paimon: You're so considerate, Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Paimon, you flatter me. I simply don't think it's worth ruining anyone's vacation over a trivial matter like this.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The scenery is beautiful... I hope all of us can enjoy ourselves here.

## Talk 11

Paimon: We're back!
Mona: #Just in time! So Traveler, Paimon, who do you think the real swimming champion is? Me or Fischl?
Fischl: Haha! Utter my supreme name, and see how Lady Megistus the presumptuous is reduced to bitter tears!
Traveler: Uh, I'll go with whoever Paimon says is the winner.
Paimon: Oh no you don't! Don't put this on Paimon!
Oz: Oh wise Paimon, surely you can discern who the true winner is.
Fischl: Lady Paimon, the time to show your loyalty is nigh.
Xinyan: Wait, wait wait wait! Shouldn't Paimon get some food in her first? Poor thing looks starvin' after such a long trek out!
Paimon: Ohh! Thank you, Xinyan!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, we did walk quite a long way.
Xinyan: Right? While you were off doing your own things, I caught us some seafood and picked us a few fruits. They taste real good barbecued!
Mona: Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little peckish myself...
Fischl: Ahem! I, too...
Xinyan: Well there's plenty to go around, so dig in! I can't say I've got the culinary skills of my chef friend, but I promise you'll at least eat your fill!
Paimon: Ooh! Time to eat!
Oz: Inviting Lady Xinyan here was an astute decision indeed.
Paimon: Paimon's done talking, you guys carry on if you wanna go hungry!
Mona: Ah, I love that barbecue smell... This tastes amazing.
Fischl: Mmm! Impressive!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since Xinyan made dinner for us, allow me to take charge of breakfast tomorrow.
Traveler: Great! Looking forward to it already!
Paimon: Paimon too!
Paimon: #Oh, Traveler, you forgot about something!
Paimon: Uh, let's talk over there.

## Talk 12

Kaedehara Kazuha: It was a great pleasure to enjoy a delicious meal to the gentle whisper of the sea breeze. Thank you for making dinner for everyone, Xinyan.
Xinyan: No problem. I'm just glad y'all enjoyed it. I was real worried that I hadn't made enough for everyone... or that I'd made too much.
Xinyan: By the way, how was your walk today? Find any high-up spots with a good view?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. The bard's description of an "emerald isle" describes this place perfectly.
Xinyan: Oh? So what about the rest of the story, is that true as well?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's hard to say. But I do believe it.
Xinyan: Well then, let's hope we wake up tomorrow morning to the sight of the Dodo-King or a Dodoco! That'd be fun.
Xinyan: ...Of course, I don't mind if that doesn't happen. It's amazing just to be here on the island from the story, and to get to make some friends from Mondstadt.

## Talk 13

Fischl: The mortal temptations stopped the truth in its tracks, denying the verdict of my victory the chance to be announced in my presence.
Mona: Wow, I'm surprised you have the nerve to bring that up again.
Mona: #You and Oz are like two peas in a pod, trying desperately to convince Traveler and Paimon that you were the victor. I hardly see how that's fair.
Mona: Besides, only the loser would want to get—
Fischl: Say that again?
Oz: Mein Fräulein, she means to say that you are the loser.
Fischl: Silence, Oz!
Fischl: Ahem... Lady Megistus, let us put aside the sacred matter of our trial for now. Once I have reclaimed my throne in the Immernachtreich, we shall settle this for good in the Garten Sanssouci!
Mona: Oh, that's fine by me, I'll beat you no matter how many times you ask for a rematch... wait, but what is that place, exactly?

## Talk 14

Venti: Achoo!
Venti: Ugh... Guess I shouldn't get too close to the cats after all... I'll just stay on the roof.

## Talk 15

Xinyan: Kazuha, Kazuha! ...Ugh, he just won't wake up! Looks like we're staying in the tavern tonight.
Kaedehara Kazuha: zzz... zzz...

## Talk 16

Paimon: That whole thing with the Fatui is bothering you, too, right? Well, remember the bomb thing that Venti gave us? We can contact him using that.
Paimon: Wait, no, not a bomb. Venti said it's called a "Dodocommunication Device"!
Paimon: Yeah, let's ask Venti if he knows anything. He always seems clued-in on everything, so if there's any intel floating around, he'll definitely know about it!
Dodocommunication Device: Dodo! Dodo! Dodoco!
Venti: Achoo! Ugh...
Venti: #Heya! Miss me already, Traveler?
Traveler: Hi Venti, it's me.
Venti: Haha, I know that. You're the only person who can contact me on this thing.
Paimon: How come you're sneezing?
Venti: I'm at The Cat's Tail... so many cats... They gave me some allergy medicine, but it's not working... Achoo! Okay, go on then, what are you calling about?
Traveler: Paimon, tell him.
Paimon: Could you be any lazier!
Paimon: Alright, well Venti, there's some strange things going on on this island... We ran into the Fatui!
Venti: The Fatui... yeah, they're everywhere, aren't they?
Venti: Ahaha, the Cryo Archon's minions are a capable crew. I'd be more surprised if they hadn't shown up yet.
Paimon: But they're ruining our vacation!
Traveler: Exactly.
Venti: Really? But... you sound fine, they can't have caused you too much trouble, surely? Or if they did, I'm sure you have everything under control by now.
Paimon: Yeah, but something just doesn't feel right, that's why we came to you... Don't you have any information for us?
Venti: I haven't heard anything new about the Fatui. But don't worry. I may be a lowly tone-deaf bard, but you may contact me whenever you need me.
Venti: I mean, I can't promise I'll be of much help, but at least you'll have someone to talk to, right? Sometimes, just talking things through is enough to calm a worried mind.
Paimon: Ugh! Honestly...
Venti: Adventuring is what you do best. It's only natural to encounter a few surprises when you head somewhere new, but just remember, not all unexpected encounters are dangerous.
Venti: The same wind graces the seaside as that which wafts over pastures green. Wherever you see clouds, it was the wind that carried them there. Don't worry, my friends, the wind will always be with you.
Traveler: Alright.
Venti: Okay then, I have to go now — my performance in the Cat's Tail is starting any second!
Paimon: Okay, bye!
Paimon: So he means we don't need to worry too much about the Fatui, right?
Traveler: Yeah, I think so.
Paimon: Well, if that's what the Tone-Deaf Bard says... then fingers crossed we'll have a peaceful and relaxing vacation where nothing weird happens at all.
Paimon: When you go off on a long trip with your friends, the important thing is to have fun!
Traveler: I thought as much.
