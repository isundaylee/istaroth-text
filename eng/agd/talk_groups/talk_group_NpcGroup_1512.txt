Katheryne: About Mona's background and her quandary...
Katheryne: I see. I understand the situation.
Katheryne: There is a *magic laboratory* in Mondstadt that has been sealed by some unknown person.
Katheryne: Although we have a few specialists who could break the seal, they all have their own labs, and aren't that interested in the matter.
Katheryne: I believe that if the astrologist you mentioned can break the seal, the owner of that house wouldn't mind if she stayed there.
Traveler: I think she can do it.
Katheryne: Alright. Then, allow me to tell you where the house is.
Traveler: I'll take her to go have a look.

Katheryne: Any new Commissions?
Katheryne: Greetings, Adventurer. The tales of your deeds are now known to all in Mondstadt.
Katheryne: Continue in this fashion and you are destined to become one of the great Adventurers of our age.
Traveler: Got anything for me to do?
Katheryne: If you wish to become a great Adventurer, there comes a time when you must move beyond the places you know.
Katheryne: Now you have amassed such a wealth of adventuring experience, perhaps it is time for you to explore somewhere new.
Katheryne: Take this letter and deliver it to Liyue Katheryne.
Traveler: ...There's a Katheryne in Liyue too?
Katheryne: Yes. I'm sure you will have no trouble finding her.
Katheryne: Anyway, once Liyue Katheryne has this letter, she will be your point of contact there for all your adventuring needs.
Katheryne: Of course, whenever you are back in Mondstadt I will still be delighted to be of service.
Katheryne: I would ask that you refrain from opening the letter en route. If anything were to fall out, it could cause complications.
Katheryne: Adventurer! The time has come for you to take the next step towards the stars and the abyss. Ad astra abyssosque!
Traveler: Should I call you "Mondstadt Katheryne" in the future, then?
Katheryne: If it helps advance your adventuring career, call me whatever you like.
Traveler: But Mondstadt is all I know...
Katheryne: That is because your adventures this far have all been limited to the Mondstadt area.
Katheryne: But all that is about to change. Soon, you will be able to venture into the world beyond.
