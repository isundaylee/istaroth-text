# Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking


## Talk 1

Paimon: Eh... Is this the insignia left behind by the Fatui guy?
Paimon: Uh... There's no sign of anyone. What are we supposed to tell Katya?
Paimon: Well, Paimon guesses there's not much we can do. Let's head back.

## Talk 2

Katarina: Ah, you came! Sit and make yourself at home.
Katarina: I'm sorry that I sent you away in a hurry last time. I didn't even tell you what I wanted you to help me with.
Traveler: It's fine. You can say it now.
Katarina: Relax, I won't make you do anything evil.
Traveler: Well then, go ahead.
Katarina: Well, I have been separated from my Kolya — Nikolay, a member of my team.
Katarina: Could you help me look for him?
Katarina: If he's still alive, bring him back to me. If he's dead... please let me know.
Katarina: I'm sorry to lay this on you... But please consider my request.
Paimon: So, this is what you want us to do? Paimon thought you were up to something bad like, say, asking us to sabotage the Millelith's work...
Katarina: The Millelith... why? It does no good to make them our enemy.
Traveler: What do you mean?
Katarina: That's my line!
Katarina: Hang on, I got it... Did our people on the surface get into an altercation with the people of Liyue? That would certainly explain why our supplies have been cut off.
Katarina: Darn it! What on earth happened up there...
Traveler: It's a long story...
Katarina: Hmph... Let's leave this topic for another day. War is war — there are no eternal allies nor perpetual enemies. That's the reality that we, the Fatui, live in.
Katarina: But I — at least for now — care about nothing but Kolya.
Katarina: When we retreated, he was separated from the squad... I came back for him later and got lost myself, too. *sigh* What a shame...
Katarina: As for where he was before he went missing, I can mark it out on the map for you.
Katarina: At the time, he tried to lure the enemies chasing us away from the rest of the team... He's an excellent soldier, and I know for sure that he wouldn't die there.
Katarina: I can only hope that he has left us some clues...
Traveler: The Fatui started it...
Traveler: You certainly won't let us interfere with the Fatui's plans.
Paimon: That's right! If any good we do disrupts your evil plan, don't you try to stop us!
Katarina: Why are you talking about "good" or "evil"... and why would I stop you?
Katarina: *sigh* You're starting to get on my nerves. Would you just let me finish?
Traveler: No worries. We haven't yet said yes.
Paimon: Yep, you're a Fatuus! We won't even lift a finger to help if you're up to something evil!
Katarina: Pfft... you do have a point.

## Talk 3

Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "... Oh no! Katya's balalaika is broken. I somehow damaged it during the fracas. Gotta get it repaired before she chews me out..."
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...Did our ancestors fight the calamity like this five hundred years ago? The Captain once said we knew not a hundredth of the grueling battles that our ancestors went through..."
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: (Many pages in the middle are tainted by some black substance. When you clean it off, the writing in ink is also rendered entirely illegible.)
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...I can't stay here any longer. They could easily track me down through the black mud..."
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...Next, I'm gonna go the opposite direction and lure them further away from the rest of the squad..."
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...There's a hole near the ruined bastion on the southeast side. Maybe I can take that route..."
Shred of Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...Wish me luck. If not us, then who?"

## Talk 4

Katarina: You're back. I have some Fire-Water to spare.
Katarina: Haha, I'm not inviting you to drink. It can also be used to clean your wounds if you're injured.
Katarina: How is it? Did you find anything?
Traveler: We found this.

## Talk 5

Katarina: You're back. Did you find anything?
Katarina: It's alright if you found nothing. Go get some rest.
Katarina: Don't you worry about me... I'm not anxious. After all, I kinda wanna stay here for my retirement. Maybe I'll ask you to deal with my pension application!
Paimon: Wow, you sure are getting some good rest!
Katarina: Hmph, if you keep coming back here without bringing me any news... Who knows, you might just find me resting till I rest in peace.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Katarina: I need to get some rest now. My old injuries still hurt. My apologies.
Katarina: Please come back another day if you have more questions. I'll also have a favor to ask.

### Additional Talk 2

Katarina: These are... insignias, action logs, and... note?
Katarina: Please tell me where Kolya is. Is he still alive?
Traveler: We didn't find him, but he's probably still alive.
Katarina: Kolya would never desert and abandon me. I'm sure of it, I just know it. He wouldn't run away in the face of a battle.
Katarina: Where did you find these?
Traveler: A cave in the southeast. Let me mark it out for you.
Paimon: It's a creepy place with many monsters inside it.
Katarina: Th—Thank you... I'm sorry...
Katarina: I... I hope Kolya sold his life dearly. I'd rather that's what happened.
Katarina: Kolya, please don't bring shame to the Tsaritsa. Don't bring shame on me.
Traveler: ...
Katarina: Ahem, I—I'm fine... Just got a bit sentimental there. It just occurred to me that I haven't properly thanked you two!
Katarina: Oh right, here's some Fire-Water... *sigh* But you don't drink, do you?
Katarina: I have some Mora...and some other materials that I collected. They are of no use to me now, so please take them.
Traveler: What's your plan next?
Katarina: What's my plan next? Thank you for asking, but I don't need you to assist me in my "evil-doing" anymore.
Katarina: Well, I'll go looking for Kolya, perhaps.
Katarina: He wrote me a letter before I was redeployed, which I have with me. For me, it's the only evidence left that proves his existence, and I'll carry it with me, forever.
Katarina: If he's still alive... As a Fatuus loyal to the Tsaritsa, I'll hunt this traitor down and kill him, wherever he goes or hides.
Katarina: If he is no longer in this world... As his older sister, I will embrace the inevitable fate of every Fatuus and will be proud of him.
Katarina: When we say "if not us, then who"... Well, this is what that means.
Traveler: What if you're up to something evil and I must stop you?
Katarina: ...There's always a moment when you're left with no choice. And we all have things that we must do, right?
Katarina: You're too serious. I mean, I get it. Kids who haven't grown old enough to hold their liquor tend to get drowned in all sorts of strange worries.
Katarina: I mean, we'll see, won't we? Let's see what I'll do when I need to face the final, inevitable choice.
Katarina: But for now, what I need is to take a nap... Wanna rest too?
Paimon: There's only a straw mat here. That doesn't make a comfy bed! You're just trying to get rid of us!
Katarina: Well, I don't see how that's my problem! Ah, I pity you...
Katarina: But anyway, thank you for your help.
Traveler: Do you always have to do it the Fatui way?
Katarina: Yes. Is that so strange?
Katarina: But anyway... Ideas, perspectives... What terribly boring avenues of inquiry! Pfft... Don't you go thinking that there are only ideas underneath my mask. I am certainly not bulletproof beneath it!
Traveler: Do you need my help?
Traveler: He might've escaped through a secret tunnel.

### Additional Talk 3

Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...I made it into this secret chamber. The mechanical monster is still lurking outside like a ferocious predator, just waiting for me to go out..."
Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...My left leg is badly wounded and it hurts like hell. I bandaged it up haphazardly, but it's swollen — could be a sign of infection..."
Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...The grotto has another exit, but I don't know where it leads. The structure of the exit looks tenuous. Without something to support it, it might collapse if exposed to violent force..."
Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...I've been spotted! Someone's coming. It's a... swordsman... clad in black?"
Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...He, no, it... Seems as though even metal bars are no obstacle for it. And just from looking upon it, I know this in my heart..."
Corporal Nikolay's Diary: "...I'm sorry, Katya."
