## Talk 5

Nonno: Haha, you found me again!
Nonno: Y'know, I'll miss you, but... I came this time to say goodbye. The golden man says we've gotta go.
Nonno: But don't worry about me! Where I'm going, there's tons of people to play with! I wish you could come too, but the golden man says that it's not time yet...
Nonno: It's totally fine, though! Totally! I'll just wait for you there... and if I can't wait, I'll turn into little bits of light and look for you in your dreams!
Traveler: Have a good trip, now.
Nonno: Yeah, I will! It was fun playing with you. Thanks a bunch!
Nonno: I won't be alone anymore, this is great...
