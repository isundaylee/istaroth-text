Traveler: Hello.
Ashk: Hello. Hardly anyone comes around here. Are you here to stargaze?
Ashk: The untouchable sky conceals the truth about the world... At least, that's what we Rtawahists believe.
Ashk: But the mortal sight is limited. Who can guarantee that they can see all the celestial signs clearly?
Ashk: How about you, what do you think?

Traveler: The stars determine your destiny...
Ashk: Ah, are you talking about the research on constellations?
Ashk: Unfortunately, I don't have a Vision, so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
Ashk: But I feel the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
Ashk: Because if it was decided, then it could be changed, right?
Ashk: If destiny could be changed, maybe Greater Lord Rukkhadevata wouldn't have met her end.

Ashk: But I feel that the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
Ashk: Because if such things can be "decided," then they can also be "changed," right?
Ashk: If destiny could be rewritten just like that, I doubt that the Dendro Archon would have had to expend so much energy quelling the ancient calamity back then.

Traveler: Things might not be as they seem...
Ashk: You're right. People can be easily distracted or deceived.
Ashk: If I were a matra, I might tell you that ignorance is also a blessing.
Ashk: But people's ignorance will not affect the existence of truth. Sometimes blindness...
Ashk: Oh, I may have said too much. Just ignore my words and let it go with the wind.
