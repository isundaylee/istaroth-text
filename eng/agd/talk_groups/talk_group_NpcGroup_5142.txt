Traveler: Hello there.
Yves: Hello, hello. Ah, apologies for making you see me complaining like this.
Yves: As you can see, I'm a diver — and apart from working for my boss, I also do a few jobs on the side.
Yves: If you need anything salvaged, you can come to me — we can discuss the payment afterward.
Yves: I'll do my best to help you... so long as my diving equipment remains functional, and I can finish the work assigned to me by my boss.

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you, then.
Yves: No worries. Just come to me if you've got things that need salvaging.

Traveler: It sounds like you're the one who needs help, really.
Yves: To be honest, I think I've accepted that my work simply cannot be finished.
Yves: After all, that Goldman — that is, my boss — is one of those... "calculative" people.
Yves: That's how I often find myself here, busy dealing with divesuits that could possibly stop working, or something like that...
Yves: Not to mention the stuff deep underwater, and those waterweeds and detritus that seem to think my job is far too easy...
Yves: ...Oh, I've started complaining again, haven't I? Sorry about that. Anyway, thanks for your concern.
