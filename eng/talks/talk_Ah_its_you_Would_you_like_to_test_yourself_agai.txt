No-Frills Instant Kill: Ah, it's you. Would you like to test yourself against me again?
Traveler: Let's go for it!
No-Frills Instant Kill: Good. Here I go, then.
Traveler: Oh, so you enjoy beetle battles too?
No-Frills Instant Kill: I wouldn't say that I "enjoy" it. I simply think that there is something to learn from many activities, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a go.
No-Frills Instant Kill: We often get a lot of non-combat-related requests mixed in with our high-difficulty commissions.
No-Frills Instant Kill: Solving mechanical puzzles, following clues to search for specific objects...
No-Frills Instant Kill: You never know when you might even encounter a commission that requires you to command other creatures to fulfill a certain objective.
No-Frills Instant Kill: I'm sure that you, of all people, would have experience with that?
Traveler: I shan't bother you for now.
No-Frills Instant Kill: Alright, you do you.
