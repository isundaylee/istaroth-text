# Urgent Repairs


## Talk 1

Traveler: Certainly!
Farrah: I appreciate it! Those monsters seem to want anything and everything they can get their hands on.

## Talk 2

Farrah: No, please! Don't hurt me! No— ah? Traveler, where did all the hilichurls go?
Farrah: Great! Thank you so much! Are they really all gone?
Farrah: Phew... I owe you. That said, after all that fuss I won't be able to catch up to the caravan now.
Farrah: What's more my cart is broken. I need to get it fixed and head to the city before the fruit goes bad.
Farrah: Once this much fruit goes bad— You can't even imagine the smell. I'll never manage to wash it out.
Farrah: I'm going to have to take stock again... I can already smell some of the fruit going bad.
Farrah: Can you please help me by taking a look around for some materials to fix my cart with? A *Sturdy Plank* should be enough to do it.

## Talk 3

Farrah: There should be plenty of *Sturdy Planks* in the forest. Please hurry, if we wait too much longer all the fruit will be lost.

## Talk 4

Farrah: This is plenty. I'll get this cart fixed up as soon as I've washed my hands...
Farrah: Huh? They're— they're back...! Traveler! They're baaaack!!!

## Talk 5

Farrah: Thank you so much, Traveler.
Farrah: Although, they seem pretty persistent. I can't stay here any longer, it's just too dangerous.
Farrah: They've bashed up the cart yet again. There's no point me trying to fix it up perfectly... I guess I'll just have to make do by wrapping a rope— Oh for heaven's sake, where is my rope!?
Farrah: I cannot believe this! Those monsters must've run off with it. Traveler... how's about you see if you can't find me a nice bit of *rope* around here...?

## Talk 6

Farrah: There has to be some rope nearby. Please, if you could just take a look for me.

## Talk 7

Farrah: Perfect. That'll see me as far the city, at least.
Farrah: Thanks for your help, Traveler. May we meet again.
Farrah: Ugh, how am I going to get rid of this awful smell...

## Talk 8

Traveler: Leave it to me.
Farrah: Great! I'll wait for you here. Ugh, I wish I could find the fruits that have gone bad already...

## Talk 9

Traveler: I'm leaving this one to you.
Farrah: Wait! Please... Smell that? Now imagine that, but a thousand times worse — that'll be my cart if I don't shift all this fruit before long! Please help me.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: Certainly not!
Farrah: Hey, wait! Wh—What if they come back, then what am I supposed to do!? An artillery of apples won't do much good!
Farrah: Come on, without your help I'll be done for!
