Baron Bigfoot: Hey, it's you guys. Thanks for what you did before.
Traveler: Why?
Baron Bigfoot: You showed me what I was lacking. I still have a lot of training ahead of me.
Baron Bigfoot: I seem to have been too focused on a single element when it comes to my Fungi. Although your Fungi are also centered around a particular one that's stronger than the rest, your composition is a lot more balanced than mine.
Baron Bigfoot: In other words, the talent that you guys possess is much more balanced and stable than mine. I still have a lot to learn.
Paimon: You're being too modest! You and Gusto-Frosto are great too!
Traveler: You're welcome, see ya!
Baron Bigfoot: See you around. I hope to chat again soon!
