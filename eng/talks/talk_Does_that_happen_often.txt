Traveler: Does that happen often?
Sorimana: Shouldn't happen often, in theory... It's true that some Saurians aren't particularly friendly, but they normally wouldn't attack us unless provoked.
Sorimana: But there have been quite a few rumors about Saurians ramming into people near the places where I usually drop off supplies.
Sorimana: Speaking of which, I work for the Courier's Longhouse, and it's my job to leave regular drops of food and other supplies at the places where our Couriers tend to stop off.
Sorimana: Some are for humans, whereas others have been specifically designed for their Saurian companions.
