Nameless Stone Statue: O golden-haired outlander, valiant hero... Do you truly exist, or are you another shade in my dreams?
Nameless Stone Statue: No, that isn't important. Come, friend, join my dream. A sweet dream can drive away the anxieties that consume us. Come, slave, fetch us some wine, that we may partake in hearty enjoyment.
Traveler: You are...
Nameless Stone Statue: I am Quintus Venusianus, once an honored musician.
Nameless Stone Statue: But a name is a transient glory, bereft of meaning. It is sweeter than a song, but is as ethereal as the clouds.
Nameless Stone Statue: Noble, lowly, all names drift within Phobos. Take me, for example. I, the scion of freed slaves, gained everything in the song, and lost it all there too.
Nameless Stone Statue: Our empire is long gone, its hope, long fallen. Just like this once-great thriving harbor, my name was ruined in antiquity amidst ill omen, tossed as if into a sea of glass.
Nameless Stone Statue: Life is brief. Distant yearnings prove unwise. Only the dream of the present is worth longing for. All other labors only heap dreams upon dreams.
Traveler: Could you tell me about this place?
Nameless Stone Statue: This was once Portus Anticus, outlander, the interstice of reality and dreamscape. The glorious Fortuna once docked here, displaying the supreme authority of the empire to all.
Nameless Stone Statue: As you can see, the mast has long snapped, and the divine statues are nowhere to be found. Our living pursuits were in vain, and no sheen of golden cosmetics could console the wailing dead.
Nameless Stone Statue: Yet all this matters not. The ocean wind has stolen our final days, so why not continue wandering in dreams? Why not order slaves to bring forth the fine wine, the perfumes, and roses that wither all too soon?
Traveler: You don't seem very upset about all this.
Nameless Stone Statue: And why should I be? The pale-white god of death knocks on the hovel hatch of the indigent and the pearl gates of the opulent alike. All goes as Phobos wills.
Nameless Stone Statue: Enjoy the days fate has allotted you. Scorn not sweet love, and demur not joyous dance.
Nameless Stone Statue: Since the frosted gloom has not encroached upon your shining golden hair, then I say unto you â€” embrace gentle slumber at the appointed hour.
Traveler: Farewell.
Nameless Stone Statue: Fare ye well also, friend! May you, too, witness a dream of equal beauty!
Nameless Stone Statue: Farewell.
