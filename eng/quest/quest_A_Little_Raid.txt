# A Little Raid


## Talk 1

Soraya: These Treasure Hoarders are running more and more rampant...
Traveler: You were looking for me?
Soraya: Ah, yes. I have a matter to entrust to you. This Bao'er you mentioned previously... After thorough investigation, I have ascertained that she is a Treasure Hoarder.
Soraya: As for the reason why she acted alone... Perhaps she wanted to take all the treasure for herself, or perhaps she was always meant to be a vanguard for the main group of Treasure Hoarders.
Soraya: Judging by how she was able to fool even such an experienced adventurer as yourself, she seems adept at subterfuge as well.
Soraya: If we leave her be, then we also leave the surrounding Treasure Hoarders to run amok. This will put the cultural relics nearby at risk.
Soraya: Therefore, I'd like you to stop them. Even if we cannot rein them in entirely, rescuing some relics from their clutches will serve.
Traveler: Understood.
Soraya: I'll leave it to you, then.
Traveler: How do you know where they are?
Soraya: If I'm not mistaken, this group of Treasure Hoarders has been following me.
Soraya: These greedy scoundrels haven't simply been content to have me lead them to some treasure.
Soraya: As long as it's someplace I've been, they will start digging into the ground, thinking to uncover a little something.
Soraya: I know where they'll show up, it just takes a bit of thought. But I'm just a scholar. Such matters of logic are simple for me...
Soraya: But combat is something that I'll have to leave to experienced adventurers like you.
Soraya: So please, take those relics back from the Treasure Hoarders!
Traveler: I'll clean them up.
Soraya: Please wait a moment. While I did say you should stop them, I don't mean for you to have a showdown with Bao'er right away.
Soraya: The Treasure Hoarders have a very loose organization, and it's hard to get ahold of their trail. Now that you've gotten tangled up with them, we have the chance of a lifetime.
Soraya: I believe that there's a bigger scheme behind their presence here in the Guili Plains. If you stay near Bao'er, you might be able to uncover those plans.
Soraya: So don't reveal yourself just yet. I trust in your ability to find a hidden point to strike, and to... well, end things quickly.
Soraya: Remember, get the relics and get out.

## Talk 3

Soraya: How did it go?
Traveler: These are the relics.
Soraya: Hmm. It's as I thought. They've been tailing me, and digging all along the path my studies have taken me down.
Soraya: Though they have no technique to speak of, they do have the advantage of numbers, and with those numbers, they've been able to dig up a few things eventually.
Soraya: Thank you so much. If not for you, who knows what might have happened to those cultural relics?
