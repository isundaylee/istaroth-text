# Where Is the Unseen Razor?


## Talk 1

Lan: *sigh* Still nothing...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lan: Oh, it's you two again. Clearly there aren't enough guild quests to keep you occupied.
Lan: If you are interested, I have another Commission you could take?
Lan: A group of Hilichurl Shooters has congregated in the middle of Guili Plains and are threatening passers-by.
Lan: They may only be hilichurls, but there are a lot of them and they have the higher ground. The average adventurer would be helpless against them.
Lan: I need you to dispose of them, quickly and efficiently. Afterwards, there will be ample compensation waiting for you.
Lan: Also — if you come across anything to do with a sword, anything at all, please bring it back to me.
Traveler: I'll take it.
Lan: I can't tell whether your eagerness to take this on is born out of youthful naivety or boundless courage...
Lan: But if I'm sure about one thing, it's that you truly have an Adventurer's spirit.
Lan: That's all I have to say. It's time for you to get ready.
Traveler: What does the sword mean to these hilichurls?
Lan: Nothing, the two are unrelated. All I need you to do is keep an eye out for it — if you find something, bring it back. If not, it's no problem.
Lan: The objective of this Commission is to defeat the hilichurls. Defeat them, and you will get your reward.

## Talk 2

Lan: Have you defeated the Hilichurl Shooters yet?
Traveler: Not yet.
Lan: Is that because you're preparing meticulously, or because you're dragging your heels?
Lan: ...Or is it a little from column A, a little from column B?

## Talk 3

Lan: Have you defeated the Hilichurl Shooters yet?
Traveler: Yes.
Lan: Good job. I hope they didn't give you too much trouble? No, I didn't think they would... just asking to be polite.
Lan: Still nothing on the sword? *sigh* Surprise, surprise... a futile search once again...
Lan: Thank you, anyway. Here is your compensation.
Traveler: Why are you preoccupied with this sword?
Lan: ...I suppose there's no harm in telling you. Its name is Unseen Razor. My older brother was its proud owner.
Lan: But inexplicably, it was not found on his person when he passed away.
Lan: He always had that sword with him. Always. So for something to happen that separated him from it... It's bothered me ever since.
Lan: Unfortunately, I've never found a single solid lead on where the sword might be, or what he encountered before he died.
Lan: That's it, really. There's nothing more to say. Except have a nice day.
