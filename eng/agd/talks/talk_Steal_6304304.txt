Traveler: Steal?
Nishiguchi: Huh? Did I say that word? Hahah...
Nishiguchi: Uh, what are you doing? Wait, please! Put your sword away. Iâ€”I will tell you everything I know!
Nishiguchi: I'll be honest. I was indeed a thief once. But just when I was about to quit my job, all of my savings were stolen!
Nishiguchi: This is probably what I deserve... But if someone could help me retrieve my money, I'll be a good person and atone for the rest of my life.
Nishiguchi: Ah, should I ask Bantan Sango Detective Agency for help?
