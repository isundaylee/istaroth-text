Farid: Sometimes, places with a lot of people can be safer than you think.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you on patrol?
Farid: Yeah. It's my job to patrol around.
Farid: There's no danger around here. You can travel as you wish.
Farid: But that isn't necessarily true. A few days ago, there were two groups of researchers here who started a group fight. I was almost pulled into it.
Farid: Even in Sumeru City, you can still be in danger when faced with researchers who seem mild-mannered. It is a must to always be on the alert.

Traveler: See you.
Farid: Goodbye.
