# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2021

## Talk 0

Kaveh: Twenty years ago, the Akademiya had just received Sachin's estate. To celebrate the huge investment, the Akademiya Extravaganza that year was grander than usual.
Kaveh: I was very young then, and I remember seeing posters for the Interdarshan Championship all over the city. I couldn't help but mention it to my father. I even told him that I really liked the look of the diadem — it was so unique.
Kaveh: So he said, "Why don't I win it, so I can let you play with it for a few days?"
Kaveh: That made me very happy, and I nodded enthusiastically. But to my surprise, he didn't win, and when he got back home, he seemed extremely depressed.
Kaveh: Later, he left home, saying that he wanted to do some investigating in the desert... The quicksand got him not long after that...
Kaveh: ...For many years, I couldn't face up to it at all. If I'd just kept my mouth shut, maybe none of it would have ever happened.
Traveler: Your father may have seen Sachin that year.
Traveler: (Don't mention the results of the investigation.)
Paimon: Wait... So the person we came across in our investigation, who went into the desert twenty years ago... it was...
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: ...Haha... Is that why Sachin thought I looked familiar? I can't believe it...
Kaveh: ...My father was always too kind for his own good. Sachin's research would have saddened him greatly — he must have gone into the desert when he heard about it to find those who were still suffering... It all makes sense now.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: I've tried telling myself so many times over the years that maybe his sudden depression wasn't because he didn't win the competition, maybe something else was going on that I wasn't aware of... But in the end, it all started with me mentioning the competition to him.
Paimon: Aw, Kaveh...
Kaveh: Don't worry. I... I destroyed the diadem. There will never be another tragedy like this again. Never again...
Kaveh: Sorry... My mind was still on the Championship. Look at me, rambling away.
Paimon: You look really upset... Are you sure you're okay?
Kaveh: I'm fine. What's past is past — we need to look towards the future.

## Talk 1

Kaveh: Where were you while the rest of us were eating together?
Alhaitham: I don't recall being obligated to report my whereabouts to you.
Kaveh: Did you go find another hidey-hole to read in? You need to change your ways, you know. You can't survive on books alone.
Alhaitham: Surviving on meals paid for by you would be harder still.
Kaveh: You...!
Kaveh: Hmph, whatever, it doesn't take a genius to guess what you've been up to... You were investigating Sachin, weren't you? It was obvious from your notes. However, I don't believe his research alone would've been enough to pique your interest.
Kaveh: His way of doing things is disturbing, while you... Well, to be fair, your philosophy disgusts me too, but you and Sachin are nothing alike. I don't imagine your views intersect at all. Egoism and nihilism are not the same thing.
Alhaitham: My personal interest aside, Sachin's legacy is not entirely meaningless — he conducted experiments on a great scale, and left his findings behind.
Alhaitham: Also, thanks for the compliment. But I'm actually just passing through — I didn't come here for the conversation. Well, not this one at least.
Kaveh: What do you mean? What topic of conversation could be more sacred among scholars than the exploration of differing philosophies?
Alhaitham: Well, based on what I've learned, Sachin and his "disturbing way of doing things" — as you put it — is very likely to have met your father twenty years ago.
Kaveh: ...What did you say?
Kaveh: ...Wait, so... No, surely that doesn't mean...
Kaveh: Hah. So that's why he thought I looked familiar. My father must've gone into the desert due to his influence...
Alhaitham: I'm afraid so.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: Good thing I shattered that diadem. From now on... nothing like that will ever have to happen again.
Alhaitham: The boundaries of knowledge are ever-expanding. Someone else will inevitably pick up the same line of research one day, and Vahumana regards it as a reasonable research direction.
Kaveh: Oh, not this again... Even if you're right, and people are bound to fall into the same intellectual traps, things won't necessarily go the same way again next time.
Kaveh: You have to admit that the actions of one individual don't always predict the behavior of the group, and vice-versa. Take Sachin, for instance. He's quite an anomaly.
Alhaitham: And so is the one who stopped him — you. Conflicts of this nature are indeed exceptional, but it will occur again in the future.
Alhaitham: You said it yourself — the actions of one individual cannot predict the behavior of a whole group. You know that not everyone would have chosen as you did.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: ...Even so, I stand by my views. You can forget about trying to convince me.
Alhaitham: That's fine. We've been arguing over this for years, and I don't hold any hope of you understanding. The issue we're debating has long since moved on from who's right and who's wrong.
Kaveh: ...Thanks for letting me know all this.
Alhaitham: What?
Kaveh: I said, thanks for letting me know. Hey! Stop acting like you didn't hear me! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!?
Alhaitham: They say that earnest thanks should be given thrice, so... One more time, please.

## Talk 2

Dori: Well, how did it go? I assume that Lord Sangemah Bay's assistance helped you discover something, yes?
Paimon: You mean...
Dori: Sachin was not a good person, and there's definitely something wrong with that Diadem of Knowledge!
Traveler: Indeed.
Dori: Then in that case, shouldn't you be doing something about it?
Dori: For instance, telling the Akademiya that they should give up the Diadem—
Paimon: We already told the Akademiya, but...
Dori: But what?
Paimon: Kaveh smashed the diadem.
Dori: Whaaaaat!?
Paimon: Calm down, Dori! Why are you getting so worked up?
Dori: ...
Dori: My diadem... My beautiful diadem...
Dori: Ah, this was supposed to be the perfect plan! I feed you the information, you discover the issue with the diadem, and then I just wait until the Akademiya sells it off at a low price...
Dori: And now it was all for nothing! Grr, curse that Kaveh! The interest rate on the Mora he owes me is about to get much higher!
Paimon: Ohhh, so that's why you told us about this. Yeah, Paimon did think you were being unusually generous...
Dori: My diadem! Ugh, I'm furious! That's it, no extension on his payment this month, no matter what reason he gives!
Traveler: We also discovered that.

## Talk 3

Nizam: Hello, I am the Vizier. Do you need any help?
Nizam: If you wished to see the Interdarshan Championship, then unfortunately, the portion taking part in Sumeru City has concluded.
Nizam: ...Hold on, on closer inspection you seem to be that guest commentator.
Nizam: My apologies. I thank you for the contributions you made to the Akademiya Extravaganza. It's all thanks to your help that the first round concluded so smoothly.
Nizam: But I might have been overindulgent in my praise. I heard the Interdarshan Championship has also encountered similar difficulties before... This time, both the contestants and viewers have been spared any harm. How fortunate.

### Talk 3 related talk 0

Traveler: Vizier? What about your name?
Nizam: My name is Nizam, and Vizier is my title. I'm responsible for administrative matters in the Grand Bazaar and Treasures Street on behalf of the Akademiya.
Nizam: ...At least, that's what the official document says.
Nizam: In reality, I mostly deal with trivial matters. Anything the Mahamata don't want to deal with gets passed on to me...
Nizam: Said something about electing a new Grand Conservator, and things having gotten busier... Just another excuse.

### Talk 3 related talk 1

Traveler: Nothing.
Nizam: Good to hear that.

## Talk 4

Feresht: Greetings. You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
Feresht: Have you heard? The Akademiya is hosting some kind of celebration along with a competition. Supposedly, the champion's prize is an extremely rare treasure.
Feresht: I think it was called... the diadem of... something. Ah. It doesn't matter. The first trick to being an expert appraiser of treasures is to avoid getting intimidated by a treasure's name!
Feresht: In terms of appraising antique collections, I'm only slightly less refined than my father. If you want to know how much a certain treasure is worth, just bring it to me and I'll let you know after a glance.

### Talk 4 related talk 0

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

### Talk 4 related talk 1

Traveler: And you are...
Feresht: You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
Feresht: When it comes to appraising treasure and collecting antiques, my sole objective is to surpass Father. Then there will be no one better than me.
Feresht: As for the business side of things, I have two more formidable opponents to defeat...

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: Good luck.
Feresht: Thanks!

## Talk 5

Rukh Shah: It's not often that the Akademiya hosts an event like this. We need to increase the number of patrols inside the city for this special occasion.
Rukh Shah: This isn't even especially for the competition. In fact, it is the increase in tourists that require us to take additional care.
Rukh Shah: There are no shortage of devious people who are willing to take advantage of these festivities to mask their own nefarious deeds.

### Talk 5 related talk 0

Traveler: And you are...
Rukh Shah: I'm the Parchamdar for the Corps of Thirty, in charge of the Eremites in Sumeru City.

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: See you.
Rukh Shah: See you.

## Talk 6

Yavanani: ...Should you deny that the Championship rates Darshans based on their scores, please recall that we all entered our respective Darshans via our test scores.
Yavanani: To overlook the scores is to overlook the very basis for all assessments made by the Darshans.
Khaldun: In turn, you should remember before you overemphasize the scores, that they are only representative of how each contestant performs for specific tasks exclusive to the competition.
Khaldun: Moreover, we also need to consider other probabilistic factors such as weather, geography, morale and so on.
Yavanani: Oh? And we didn't need to consider this when we were testing into our Darshans?
Khaldun: A sophistic comparison! My test scores can represent my capabilities, but it does not showcase the totality of what a Darshan represents.
Khaldun: A foolish opinion as usual. No offense intended.
Yavanani: Disagree though you may, scores determine the rankings and results speak for everything.

## Talk 7

Homayun: Even if we find a calm place to think, we will inevitably be interrupted by noisy students.
Homayun: To be honest, I was never interested in these celebratory events or competitions when I was in the Akademiya.
Homayun: Winning the Championship doesn't really help add any credit to your research, and any renown gained from it only amounts to some short-lived attention.
Homayun: ...Realistically speaking, there are few people as practical as I am.

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Homayun: Rainforest life is among the foremost concerns of the Amurta.
Homayun: Although the taint caused by the Withering has been greatly alleviated, no one can say for sure that no new problems will arise.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is mainly responsible for documenting their findings, true. But I reckon he'd be able to discern any anomalies in those writings with his keen eyes...

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Homayun: The Withering has always been one of the tough issues that Amurta wanted to conquer.
Homayun: It is true that while vision holders and forest rangers are working together to control the zones, the Withering won't impact Sumeru people's daily lives all too much.
Homayun: But beyond dealing with the symptoms, we researchers want to cure the cause.
Homayun: To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
Homayun: The Scribe is only responsible for documenting their findings, but he'd be able to discern any anomalies with his keen eyes...

### Talk 7 related talk 2

Traveler: About Rifaet...
Homayun: Oh? He's a very knowledgeable young researcher. He's not very articulate, but he's familiar with all kinds of literature. Have you heard of him?

### Talk 7 related talk 3

Traveler: See you.
Homayun: Okay, goodbye.

## Talk 8

Farghani: Star... star course deviations...
Farghani: Ah, if I continue my studies down this path, I might just be able to see why there is a separation between my theories and the calculations.
Farghani: The Interdarshan Championships have done a lot of good this time. If Rtawahist hadn't selected Miss Layla as the representative, I would have never consulted her research.
Farghani: I can only say that Miss Layla keeps too low a profile. Such incredible research needs to be seen by more people.

### Talk 8 related talk 0

Traveler: What are you calculating?
Farghani: Before I answer your question, let me ask you one: What do you think Teyvat is like?
Farghani: You don't have to respond, just think.
Farghani: I have a revolutionary idea... If Teyvat was round, that would explain a lot of things.
Farghani: Why are there currents in oceans? Why would the sun and moon alternate rising? Why would there be changes in temperature?
Farghani: All that could be explained with the round-earth theory!

### Talk 8 related talk 1

Traveler: See you.
Farghani: Where did it go wrong...?

## Talk 9

Shatir: A pity that knowledge so great is constrained by matters of Mora...
Shatir: And when there are wealthy sponsors, the wealth is not fed into valuable research but rather burned on frivolous competitions...
Shatir: You mean the sponsor? Hm... I haven't heard much about them, but they should be a good person.
Shatir: Even merchants who think of nothing but profit should not be judged with prejudice so long as they are willing to place emphasis on the development and preservation of knowledge.
Shatir: ...Because, when it comes down to it, almost anything is better than someone who wastes money.

### Talk 9 related talk 0

Traveler: Budget?
Shatir: Yeah, the budgets.
Shatir: Sadly, even great things like knowledge can be thwarted by money.
Shatir: The Akademiya has been spending more and more budgets on classified research over the past years.
Shatir: Instead of maintaining a financial black hole, they should fund more practical disciplines like archaeology.
Shatir: With a lack of self-reflection on history, we would get a short end in real life sooner or later.
Shatir: Next time I apply for funding, I must get Vikram to join me!

### Talk 9 related talk 1

Traveler: See you.
Shatir: Goodbye.

## Talk 10

Makhfi: I didn't expect Tighnari, who rarely shows himself in the city, to participate in the Interdarshan Championship.
Makhfi: I don't know much about Tighnari. He doesn't strike me as someone who is fame-hungry... Perhaps too many people were recommending him, and he didn't want to disappoint them.
Makhfi: Speaking of which, I think he's planning to hold a new lecture next month.
Makhfi: I must note down the time of his lecture before I forget... I can't miss it!

### Talk 10 related talk 0

Traveler: What happened?
Makhfi: Sorry you had to hear me complain.
Makhfi: I was just lamenting that researchers have to deal with so many things on top of their own research.
Makhfi: Such as official Akademiya assignments, delegated tasks from mentors, getting along with peers, and sometimes, even inquiry from the matra.
Makhfi: *sigh* If only these things could just resolve themselves, like a tree shedding its leaves...
Makhfi: Now, I understand more or less why Tighnari left the Akademiya.

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: See you.
Makhfi: The simple life is gone forever...

## Talk 11

Arina: I want a break... Why can't the Akademiya give us some time off during the Extravaganza?
Armin: Don't you enjoy watching the competition?
Arina: No, I do but... If you think about it, we can only watch the competitions if we have a break, right?
Armin: Yeah, that makes sense... Though, watching all my senior classmates represent their Darshans has inadvertently inspired a new drive in me to study!
Armin: I've made up my mind. In the future, I'm going to enter the Interdarshan Championship too!
Arina: Huh... It's a bit early to be thinking about this, isn't it? Didn't our instructors say that seeking knowledge should be a steady and serious endeavor?
Arina: Maybe before considering partaking in a competition that happens once in a blue moon, maybe you should consider which Darshan you want to join first?

## Talk 12

Ashk: It's said that you can see pretty far if you stand high, but the higher you go, the harder it is to see what's right beneath you...
Ashk: Ah, sorry. I was talking to myself.
Ashk: If you're looking to join the Akademiya Extravaganza, then you probably got lost to wander this far. You're way past the boundaries of the festivities.

### Talk 12 related talk 0

Traveler: Hello.
Ashk: Hello. Hardly anyone comes around here. Are you here to stargaze?
Ashk: The untouchable sky conceals the truth about the world... At least, that's what we Rtawahists believe.
Ashk: But the mortal sight is limited. Who can guarantee that they can see all the celestial signs clearly?
Ashk: How about you, what do you think?

### Talk 12 related talk 1

Traveler: Let me give it more thought...
Ashk: Yeah.

## Talk 13

Hunayn: Huh? I didn't think someone would want to chat with me even now. Aren't you joining in on the Akademiya Extravaganza?
Hunayn: Hmm... What fun events are there... Truth be told, I'm not one for such occasions, so I can't say.
Hunayn: However, I don't dislike these celebratory events. The more students join in such galas, the quieter things are over here.

### Talk 13 related talk 0

Traveler: Who are you...
Hunayn: I came to borrow some books. I've been applying for additional permits to borrow more books.
Hunayn: I've read almost everything on general knowledge that I can borrow from here. Hope my mentor can give me access to other books soon.

### Talk 13 related talk 1

Traveler: Sorry to bother you...
Hunayn: No worries.

## Talk 14

Shohre: Hello, what do you need?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do, huh?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, that's a good thing. The fewer people who come to talk to me about work, the better — that means our academic environment is a healthy one.
Shohre: Honestly, I expected a great deal of problems to follow the Akademiya's celebration. I was even ready to head back to the office and prepare for overtime.
Shohre: But there really haven't been that many people seeking me out. Even the General Mahamatra is on break... Hm. I'm just going to keep resting here.

### Talk 14 related talk 0

Traveler: Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, the fewer people who want my help the better, for it means that we have a good academic atmosphere here.
Shohre: To be surrounded by books... That sounds rather nice to me. I'd say there's no simpler life than one whereby your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two while looking at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I'm too impatient to read. I can apply for access to the general summary in the Akasha if I really want to know about something.

### Talk 14 related talk 1

Traveler: Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do, huh?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, that's a good thing. The fewer people who come to talk to me about work, the better — that means our academic environment is a healthy one.
Shohre: A life surrounded by books... That does sound rather nice. I'd say that there's no simpler form of life than one where your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two when I look at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I know myself — I'm far too impatient to read.

### Talk 14 related talk 2

Traveler: Sorry to bother you... I think I should go.
Shohre: Oh, see you.

## Talk 15

Erfan: What a blunder... I won't get to watch the competitions during the day if I'm working nights!
Erfan: That said... ah, I can't just dip work and go see the competition during the day, haha.
Erfan: Keeping that in mind gives me some balance. Maybe my classmates might fill me in on what's happening in the competition over some drinks at night.
Erfan: With the gala comes more tourists, and with more tourists comes an increase to my pay. I might even hear some new drunken jokes! Seems like I'm being well compensated for my time!

### Talk 15 related talk 0

Traveler: Who are you...
Erfan: I am the one who walks under the veil of night, a listener of drunkards' most honest confessions...
Erfan: Hahaha, just kiddin'! I'm just a bartender working night shifts here.
Erfan: Many come here to drink at night. Some of them might get quite drunk. So Lambad had me take some of Qishan's shifts.
Erfan: An Akademiya student during the day and a bartender at night. I'd say I've managed to keep a good work-study balance.

### Talk 15 related talk 1

Traveler: Is there anything fun about this place?
Erfan: Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
Erfan: This is a tavern, after all. The last thing we lack is funny drunkards.
Erfan: Like last time, a student who had just come of age drank too much at his birthday party and, as a result, tried to have a duel with a chair.
Erfan: ...Well, the chair definitely turned out to be the stronger duelist.
Erfan: A Liyue student who came with him captured the hilarious moment and sent the pictures to The Steambird overnight.
Erfan: Guess what, one of the pictures earned the Second Prize for journalistic photography. I heard it was only second to the work of The Steambird's top reporter.
Erfan: If I were the drunken student, I'd blackmail... send a letter to ask for royalties.

### Talk 15 related talk 2

Traveler: See you.
Erfan: Goodbye... Hahaha...

## Talk 16

Farhad: Though work is as boring as ever and Zubayr Theater has no new showings, there seems to be no shortage of prospects as of late!
Farhad: Say, friend, are you going to watch the Interdarshan Championship? I hear Miss Nilou's going to be commentating!
Farhad: I wasn't much of a student growing up. Felt like I had an allergy to learning. However, after listening to how Miss Nilou breaks things down, the knowledge seems a lot easier for me to grasp.
Farhad: If you missed Miss Nilou's commentary, it's your loss.

### Talk 16 related talk 0

Traveler: What public performance?
Farhad: It's the new play that Mr. Zubayr's working on.
Farhad: Unsurprisingly, Miss Nilou will definitely be featured in it.
Farhad: Plays at Zubayr Theater never disappoint. Every time a new production is out, researchers all rush over and grab tickets, no matter what research they have.
Farhad: You should definitely check them out.

### Talk 16 related talk 1

Traveler: See you.
Farhad: Bye!

## Talk 17

Traveler: (Maybe we should come back later...)

## Talk 18

Daya: How about it? Care for a game of "Project Connectivity"?
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Daya: Alright. In that case, if you'll look over this way...
Traveler: I've got some other things to do.
Daya: Ah, is that so... It's alright. Our booth will be open for the entire duration of the Gala.
Daya: Whenever you feel like having a go, you can just come to me.

## Talk 19

Daya: I do hope everyone will enjoy the game...

## Talk 20

Farbal: *sigh* Everyone's just too sensitive about academic issues. It's just a toy. Come on...

## Talk 21

Farbal: I wish the older students would stop coming over to ask. This really, truly is just a toy.
Farbal: Ah? Oh... It's you, Traveler. Would you like to play a round or two of "Gathering of Stars"?
Traveler: I'd like to give this a try.
Farbal: Sure. The astrolabe is over here.
Traveler: I've got other things to do right now, sorry.
Farbal: Well, I'll be here at the booth throughout the Gala. If you're of a mind to play, just hit me up.

## Talk 22

Paz: Was my tone too serious? Ugh, that's not good...
Paz: Traveler? Are you here to give "Mimetic Replication" a try?
Traveler: I'll give this one a go, why not?
Paz: Alright. In that case, please step over here.
Traveler: I've got some other things to do.
Paz: That's fine. My booth will be open throughout the Gala, so you can come over and try the game out any time.

## Talk 23

Paz: Might this degree of simplification and generalization be too facile, I wonder...

## Talk 24

Bahador: How did this fall to me? Couldn't we have assigned this task to a more experienced senior student?

## Talk 25

Daneh: Hmm. I do hope everyone will be able to experience the joys of archaeology through this activity...

## Talk 26

Daneh: I do hope everyone will be able to experience the joys of archaeology...

## Talk 27

Bahar: Well then, would you like to give "In Truth's Steps" a go?
Traveler: Yes.
Bahar: Good, good. In that case, lend me your ears.
Traveler: I've got something else to do at the moment.
Bahar: That's alright. I'll be here, and you can come back whenever you'd like to have a go.

## Talk 28

Bahar: Yes.

## Talk 29

Bahar: No. The mire could not be traversed by human strength.

## Talk 30

Bahar: Yes. Enough to ensure that the Forest Rangers' clothes would not get wet.

Bahar: How did Beydim leave the mire and pass the message on?
Traveler: By being agile.
Bahar: Beydim was a...?
Traveler: Forest Ranger.
Bahar: Why was Beydim wet all over?
Traveler: Beydim liked the rain.
Traveler: Beydim did not bring any waterproof gear.
Traveler: Beydim fell into a puddle.
Traveler: Beydim had a Hydro Vision.
Traveler: Treasure Hoarder.
Traveler: Vision-Holder.
Traveler: Dusk Bird.
Traveler: By being a good flyer.
Traveler: By using elemental energy.
Traveler: By using a special device.

Traveler: Give me a moment to think about it some more...
Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment...

Bahar: Not bad! I think you're on the right track. One of your answers was correct.
Traveler: Give me a moment to think about it some more...

Bahar: Very good! You've solved two questions, but one remains out of your reach for the moment.
Traveler: Give me a moment to think about it some more...
Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment...

### Talk 48 related talk 3

Bahar: Well done. You got all the answers correct.
Traveler: So, about the next story...
Traveler: So, about the full truth behind this tale...
Bahar: The full truth is this: Beydim was a messenger Dusk Bird used by the Forest Ranger Asti.
Bahar: After sighting the wild beast, Asti chose to send Beydim out to inform the other Forest Rangers due to the storm impeding travel.
Bahar: Beydim flew through that storm, and thus got all wet.
Traveler: So, about the next story...
Traveler: So, about the full truth behind this tale...
Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment...
Bahar: Congratulations! I definitely think you've got the hang of this.
Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment...

## Talk 49

Bahar: Are... these stories still too complex?

## Talk 50

Bahar: Did everyone take a leave permit?
Traveler: Some chose a different prize.
Bahar: Why was one leave permit slip left in the box?
Traveler: The person who took that slip took the box too.
Bahar: And the current status of the leave permits is...
Traveler: All the leave permits are with those who should have them.
Traveler: Some of the leave permits were damaged.
Traveler: Some of the leave permits have not been collected.
Traveler: This was someone else's leave permit.
Traveler: This leave permit was rendered invalid.
Traveler: Some later had their leave privileges canceled.
Traveler: Everyone took a leave permit.
