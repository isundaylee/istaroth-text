Traveler: How do you like it here?
Yaoyao: Hehe, oh, this is much livelier than my place, but it also isn't quite the bustling hive of activity the wharf is.
Traveler: ...So you like it?
Yaoyao: Of course. Oh c'mon, you don't have to worry about me.
Yaoyao: You see, Master has taught me that "when in an abode, do as the adepti do"... Um, wait, I think it's "the guest should go along with their host"...
Yaoyao: But whatever the case, I love it here!
Yaoyao: I just hope I'm not imposing...
Yaoyao: I—If you don't mind, I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Yaoyao: And... you know, accompany you for a while.
Traveler: ...So it's not lively enough?
Yaoyao: No, no, that's not what I mean.
Yaoyao: This place is just like an adeptus's abode — I feel welcomed and comfortable here.
Yaoyao: It's an honor to be invited over to play.
