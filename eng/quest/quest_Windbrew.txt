# Windbrew


## Talk 1

Margaret: It seems that we must come up with a new special blend after all...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Margaret: Oh, it's you. Actually, I was just considering pushing out a new special beverage based on the Windblume Festival.
Margaret: Everyone's going to be having fun in the city during this time, and I'm sure that they wouldn't mind having some food and drink to go along with that.
Margaret: However, they'll get drunk very quickly if all they drink is alcohol, and they'll be liable to get pulled aside by the Knights until they've sobered up...
Margaret: Also, it'll ruin the mood if the reek of alcohol is too strong.
Traveler: Huh. Is that so?
Margaret: Well, I've heard that some people really enjoy that sort of hazy, drunken atmosphere. But falling over drunk by the roadside during a festival just isn't a good look.
Margaret: As such, I've decided to create a refreshing, non-alcoholic drink that's milk-based and filled with the flavor of the "wind."
Margaret: To emphasize the flavor of the "wind," I think that we could also use two special additions — Dandelions and Windwheel Asters.
Margaret: But we'll be here all day if I'm the only one going around collecting them. So, Traveler, could you help me collect some accessorizing ingredients?
Traveler: I'll go get those Dandelions.
Margaret: Thanks so much. I've heard that the Dandelions of Starsnatch Cliff are of rather fine quality, so do help me get some.
Margaret: I'll go collect some Windwheel Asters as well, and we'll meet back here once we're done collecting our respective ingredients.
Margaret: We'll make the drink right on the spot, and get a few people to try it out while we're at it...
Traveler: I'll get you those Windwheel Asters.
Margaret: I'm counting on you, then — the Windwheel Asters of Windrise are of rather fine quality, so please try collecting some there.
Margaret: I'll go collect some Dandelions Seeds for my part, and we'll meet back here once we're done collecting our respective ingredients.
Margaret: We'll make the drink right on the spot, and get a few people to try it out while we're at it...

## Talk 2

Margaret: ...
Margaret: It tastes a little astringent. The flavors don't seem to have melded together too well. Perhaps something went awry during the blending process...
Margaret: Hmm... Give it another go, perhaps. If you have any questions, I'll be right here.

## Talk 3

Margaret: Have you found the ingredients?

## Talk 4

Margaret: ...
Margaret: There's a slight sweetness to the piercing foretaste, and there's also a cooling texture, like that of the flowing breeze...
Margaret: A most fitting drink for the Windblume Festival. I see I made the right choice in bringing you on board.
Margaret: Next, I think this drink needs some taste testers. Traveler, could I trouble you to go out again to look for some?
Traveler: I'll see this done.
Margaret: I'll be relying on you, then. I believe there'll be tons of people near the Anemo Archon statue. You can probably find some testers there.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Got it! Let's begin!
Traveler: Let it sit.

## Talk 6

Margaret: Ah, you're done with the blending process?
Traveler: And we're done.

## Talk 7

Margaret: These are some very fine Dandelions. I wonder what flavors we'll achieve if we use these in our blend...

## Talk 8

Nimrod: *sigh* Festivals just aren't complete without a little swig of drink...
Traveler: Hey there, The Cat's Tail's come up with a new beverage...
Nimrod: Oh, you want me to test it, do you? Hahaha! No problem, none at all! I'm an old hand when it comes to wine.
Nimrod: Let me try it... Eh? This... doesn't have any taste of alcohol at all. It's more like some sort of dairy product.
Nimrod: Don't get me wrong, it tastes good, but I don't think a non-alcoholic drink really fits this festival.
Nimrod: I mean, there are lots of people who're looking forward to getting reasonably drunk this Windblume Festival. I don't think this sort of drink would receive a particularly warm welcome.

## Talk 9

Aramis: Hello. Can I help you?
Traveler: Hey there, The Cat's Tail's come up with a new beverage...
Aramis: My apologies, but I'm on duty at the moment. I can't drink.
Traveler: This drink's non-alcoholic.
Aramis: Oh? Well... then... I guess it'll be fine. I'm feeling a little thirsty, in any case, so I'll give it a go...
Aramis: Oh! This is pretty good. It's refreshing, too. Really perks you right up.
Aramis: This is a new product from The Cat's Tail, is it? I'll go have another taste later when I can spare the time.

## Talk 10

Nora: Do you wanna play with me?
Traveler: Hey there, The Cat's Tail's come up with a new beverage...
Nora: The Cat's Tail... Aunty Grace says that kids shouldn't drink wine.
Traveler: Oh, this one's got no wine in it.
Nora: Really? I'll give it a try...
Nora: It's really nice! It's sweet, and it's cool! Is this a new drink from The Cat's Tail?
Nora: I'll tell Timmie and Lily, too! I'm sure they'd like some!

## Talk 11

Margaret: How did it go? Were you able to find some taste testers?
Traveler: Oh, I found some, alright.
Margaret: Getting reasonably drunk during the festival, huh... No wonder the crowd at the Angel's Share has grown...
Margaret: Still, I think this is fine. Other than those who'd like to get reasonably drunk, the children and the city guards should get to enjoy their own fair share of festive cheer as well.
Margaret: I'll continue tweaking this special blend. Thanks for your help, by the way — and here's a little something as thanks.
Margaret: Ah, yes — and Happy Windblume Festival.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Margaret: These are some very fine Windwheel Asters. I wonder what flavors we'll achieve if we use these in our blend...

### Additional Talk 2

Margaret: Alright, looks like we've got all the ingredients we need. Let's start blending our beverage.
Traveler: I wonder how it'll taste...
Margaret: Oh, are you interested in trying it out, too?
Margaret: Well... the blending process itself isn't particularly complicated. You just need to follow the steps I've come up with and it should be a ringing success.
Margaret: So, want to try making it yourself, Traveler?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Margaret: Great. Now, just let me explain the process of making this beverage. Make sure you remember it.
Margaret: First, place a *Sweet Flower* inside before pouring the base alcohol we're using for this cocktail... and then, of course, we'll drizzle some *Milk* in to lay the foundations for the clear, sweet texture we're going for this time around.
Margaret: We'll need to add the *Windwheel Aster* in at this point to add flavor.
Margaret: Don't rush to mix it all together. Let it *sit* for a moment and let the floral fragrance emerge.
Margaret: Then scatter the *Dandelion Seeds* in to make the drink look like it's been adorned with stars. Then, place some *ice cubes* in, and that's a wrap!
Margaret: And that's how it works. You can't get the steps mixed up if you want to make something delicious.
Margaret: If you've memorized the steps, give it a go. If you've forgotten, feel free to ask me again.

### Additional Talk 3

Margaret: Forgotten the steps? No worries. I'll go over the process again.
Margaret: First, place the *Sweet Flower* in before drizzling some *Milk* in to lay the foundations for the clear, sweet texture we're going for.
Margaret: We'll need to add the *Windwheel Aster* in at this point to add flavor.
Margaret: Don't rush to mix it all together. Let it *sit* for a moment and let the floral fragrance emerge.
Margaret: Then scatter the *Dandelion Seeds* in and place some *ice cubes* atop them, and that'll just about wrap it up. If you've gotten all that, you can try it yourself.

### Additional Talk 4

Nimrod: *sigh* I should just go get myself some Dandelion Wine...

### Additional Talk 5

Aramis: Well, maybe a little non-alcoholic beverage from time to time won't hurt...

### Additional Talk 6

Nora: Timmie and Lily are gonna love this! I'm gonna tell them right away!

### Additional Talk 7

Margaret: What should I call such a refreshing drink? The Relaxairy? Hmm...
