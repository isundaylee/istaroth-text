Nimrod: Hi, is there something you wanted my help with?
Nimrod: If it's not urgent, please pardon me for not keeping you company.
Nimrod: I did have to slip out, after all. I want to get my wife something special.
Nimrod: ...And some wine while I'm at it. Ah, how can you be a Mondstadter if you don't get to drink, especially on a holiday?
Nimrod: As for what kind of gift I should get her... well, I suppose I'll figure it out on the way to buy some wine.
