Traveler: Sunsettia?
Bolai: Tsk, look, I know they're not much to look at, but these here Sunsettias hold a profound and mysterious secret...
Bolai: ...If you were to try one, then you would know: they're much sweeter than most other Sunsettias.
Bolai: In fact, you can take these ones. Then you'll see I'm telling the truth...

Traveler: Regarding that ring...
Bolai: Have you considered it? Well then, are you willing to sell it to me?

Traveler: Could you help us look at this antique?
Bolai: Antiques and curios? I'm not too familiar with them, but I'll have a look.
Bolai: This ring... Huh, it's set with a jade gem, and one of good quality, too. Just the gem alone would be worth a sum.
Bolai: There's an inscription on it, too... "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world , and all who live do so in agony..." Where did you find this ring?
Traveler: In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
Bolai: Cuijue Slope, huh... Tsk tsk, what a shame. Jueyun Karst is so nearby, too...
Bolai: If this ring came from a ruin in Jueyun Karst, it would surely fetch a great price.
Bolai: Unfortunately, without any storied origin, this one's price falls a great deal. But it's of good quality. I'm sure someone would want it nonetheless.
Bolai: How about this? I'll offer you *180,000 Mora* for this ring, with a few add-ons to boot. Would you sell it to me?

Traveler: I'll take all your Cor Lapis.
Bolai: All of it? Though my business may not seem so big, I should warn that I can get what you need, both legitimately and... not so legitimately. Best you give me an actual number.
Bolai: All of it would be far more than you actually want.
Traveler: It's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Bolai: Fei— Feiyun Commerce Guild!? Well, why didn't you say so?
Bolai: If it's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild, then sign on the dotted line, and I'll start getting things in order right away!
Traveler: Feiyun Commerce Guild only ever does legal business.
Bolai: What are you saying? Of course my business is all above board. Feiyun Commerce Guild, you say... Hmm.

Traveler: ...These are all just everyday items, no?
Bolai: *low voice* You got that right! I sell everyday items. What else would I be selling?
Bolai: Haven't you heard the saying, "silence is golden"? Well, if silence is golden, quietness has to be silver at least?
Bolai: *whispering* So when you're doing business, you've got to talk in whispers so the Mora keeps rolling in!
Bolai: *whispering* But you youngsters wouldn't understand, you're easily led astray by wacky ideas...

### Talk 5 related talk 4

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Bolai: Ah, to think that the rumors of his passing would turn out to be true...
Bolai: Traveler. I hear that you came here from Mondstadt... In that case, I suppose you can feel the difference between our two nations now, yes?
Bolai: In Liyue, even bit players such as myself have received Rex Lapis' grace in some fashion or another.
Bolai: It was my honor to have been able to provide the Silk Flowers for his Rite of Parting.
Bolai: I am no Qixing, and I don't possess a Vision, so that was the only way I could've been of help there...
Bolai: *sigh* Let's not speak of it. I still have a business to run, and I can't run it with this frown on my face all the time, now can I?
