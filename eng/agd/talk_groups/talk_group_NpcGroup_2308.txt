## Talk 1

Little Liu: Hehe, I won! Even adults will lose when it comes to cards!

## Talk 2

Little Liu: Ugh... This one doesn't count! I'll win next time for sure!

## Talk 3

Traveler: You can go on adventures without a Vision.
Little Liu: You mean be one of those martial arts heroes? Hmph, no thank you!
Little Liu: After the old folks in the village discovered I had an interest in adventuring, they kept bringing me all these martial arts novels...
Little Liu: But when I read them, I was disappointed to find that the main characters are all ugly stinking men! Sorry, not my kind of story!
Little Liu: You haven't read any before? Here, knock yourself out, they're certainly no use to me!

Traveler: No.
Little Liu: Aw, that sucks! Nobody remembers the adventurers who don't have Visions.
Little Liu: Wanna know why? 'Cause when you get a Vision you get to use elemental power, and you can use that to fight evil and become a legend!
Little Liu: That's just scratching the surface; Visions give you loads of advantages. Even the books themselves say, the famous adventurers you read about in books are all Vision bearers.
Little Liu: In short, if you ain't got a Vision, you can forget your dreams of becoming a big hero.

### Talk 4 related talk 3

Traveler: Why are you obsessed with Visions?
Little Liu: 'Cause I want one for myself!
Little Liu: With a Vision you can get money and status. If I had enough money, mom and dad could come back to the village 'cause they wouldn't need to work in Liyue Harbor anymore.
Little Liu: I told my friends about Visions, and now they all want one too.

Traveler: I can control the elements though.
Little Liu: Impossible! You're a liar; I've read lots of books about this and I have never come across anyone who doesn't need a Vision to use elemental power.
Little Liu: Don't think I'm gonna fall for your lies just 'cause I'm a kid!
