Traveler: Diving certificate?
Vasco: Listen to me, don't underestimate the sea! I almost lost my life on the last voyage!
Vasco: I was so stoked back then, surveying the sea all day with a scope, trying not to miss anything.
Vasco: Finally, I spotted an uncharted island one day and coaxed the captain into making shore.
Vasco: It was when we got close that we realized it was the backside of a sea monster!
Vasco: We were chased by the awakened monster and had to follow the captain's order to start jettisoning.
Vasco: That included my luggage, all the food aboard, and... the cook.
