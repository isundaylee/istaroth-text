# The Riddle of Sea and Sky


## Talk 1

Viramdra: Help! *coughing*
Mualani: That way? He's been pulled away by the current!

## Talk 2

Karya: I'm so happy Viramdra was able to help the team.

## Talk 3

Mualani: Only those who can trust each other with their lives can reach the mysterious island. Since you two are willing to trust me, then naturally, I'm willing to trust you.
Traveler: Just leave it to us!
Paimon: Alrighty...
Paimon: Please be careful!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Please be careful!

## Talk 5

Viramdra: You're better acquainted with her than I, so you should tell her to carefully reconsider her decision.
Karya: Viramdra is quite knowledgeable about Natlan's geography, so his ideas might also be worth considering. Perhaps you can give it some thought...

## Talk 6

Viramdra: I can't believe there was an error with my theory...
Karya: Is there anything I can help with? I must thank you all for saving Viramdra earlier.

## Talk 7

Mualani: We found him!

## Talk 8

Mualani: We've found them all! Let's get everyone back together!

## Talk 9

Mualani: Not here either... The current is too fast!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Why did this have to happen now... Can we still make it into the whirlpool?
Mualani: No need to hesitate. I'll get in the water and rescue him, just tell me which way he went, Karya!

## Talk 11

Mualani: Missing text (3106122098)

## Talk 12

Viramdra: Now, how to control the Phlogiston Nodes... Let me reflect on the information I read.

## Talk 13

Viramdra: *coughing* *spluttering*
Mualani: Whew... Karya came and found us just in time.
Paimon: Oh, there they are!
Karya: Viramdra... thank goodness you're alright. Thank you so much, Miss Guide.
Mualani: Ugh, didn't I tell you to wait for me?
Viramdra: *cough* Judging by the changes in the water's surface, the path to the mysterious island wouldn't be around for long! I didn't want to miss this opportunity!
Viramdra: It's just... I didn't expect my calculations to be wrong. It seems you were right...
Paimon: Right, who knows if we can make it back in time now... Huh? The whirlpools have disappeared!
Mualani: Seems we missed our chance...
Viramdra: Why would you give up on such an opportunity to come rescue me?
Mualani: How can you say that? It's already bad enough that you had to be left behind. Do you think I'd let anyone in my group drown?
Viramdra: ...
Karya: I'm really sorry...
Mualani: Don't feel guilty, Karya. I think if I reactivate the nodes, that will cause the whirlpools to reappear.
Mualani: The only problem is that we still don't know exactly when we'll be able to do that...
Mualani: It's already getting late now, and we've been on the move for the whole day. As your guide, I suggest we make camp first and have a good meal. We can talk about the other stuff tomorrow.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon is feeling a little hungry...
Traveler: It's a miracle she hasn't mentioned food for so long...
Paimon: Hey, Paimon's stomach can be very sensible. It won't interrupt while everyone's busy solving puzzles.
Mualani: We have plenty of tasty things to eat, let's just find a suitable spot to make camp. Hmm... I like that place right over there.
Black Screen Text: Mualani guides everyone to the best place to make camp.
Paimon: #Is this the spot? Let Paimon and Traveler help set up the tent!
Mualani: Go ahead! I'll take care of the fire. And here's a little camping tip, it's best to set the tent upwind from the campfire!
