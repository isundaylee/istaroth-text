Traveler: How are you finding this place?
Yelan: Not bad. The courtyard furnishings are very nice, and the scenery in the distance is really one of a kind.
Yelan: So yeah, I think I'm gonna enjoy my time off here.
Traveler: Where do you normally live?
Yelan: In my own home, of course.
Yelan: My home's located some way outside of the city, in a very quiet and peaceful area.
Yelan: Hehe... judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing you've fallen for the rumors about me being very wealthy and having high demands for my standards of living?
Yelan: Seeing isn't always believing, and if you can't trust your eyes, you certainly can't trust rumors.
Traveler: Being away from the hustle and bustle has its benefits...
Yelan: Bingo. I think you got it. Seems like you're learning.
Yelan: If you live far enough out in the sticks, you have plenty of legitimate reasons to ditch work. The mountain path was blocked, or you ran into some Treasure Hoarders en route...
Yelan: Not to mention that if you live in a packed and bustling city, it's much easier for people to trace your steps. This creates all kinds of issues, and gets in the way of my ability to track my targets.
Traveler: Interesting, I hadn't considered that.
Yelan: That said, since I'm free to come and go as I please here, it would be a terrible waste for me to not use it as a backup base.
Yelan: You wouldn't mind that, would you?
Traveler: Perhaps it helps with your work...
Traveler: Where do you usually spend your down time?

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yelan: I would be delighted.
Yelan: We should make some tea, too. Sipping tea, chatting, and just enjoying the time off, it's a great way to recharge.
Yelan: Hey, you're friendly with "Rain Calmer," aren't you? I hear she's a tea drinker, too. Why don't you treat me to some choice tea from her personal collection?
Traveler: Don't be mean to Tubby.
Yelan: Heh, I'm just pulling your leg. She let me try some of her tea already, and we had a lovely chat.
Yelan: The key to making sure a conversation goes well is choosing the right topic.
Yelan: For chatting with you... let's go with tracking techniques, ambush essentials, expanding your network of contacts, and setting up lookouts.
Traveler: So specialized...
Yelan: Hehe. Well, if you were just looking to shoot the breeze with me, I can get on board with that, too.
Yelan: You know me — role-playing's one of my biggest strengths.
Yelan: ...Seriously, though, I think the topics I mentioned are the ones really worth sharing with you.
Yelan: The things I've learned come from a mix of secret techniques taught by the Millelith Scouts, real-life cases of competition in the business world, and the experience of various overseas organizations.
Yelan: For someone like you, this knowledge is going to come in handy sooner or later.
Yelan: Once you've mastered it, you'll be able to avoid being pushed around by those in the know.
Yelan: Anyway, just remember to come to me if you ever want to improve in these areas. I'll teach you everything I know.
Traveler: So formal...
Traveler: You should go earn her trust yourself.

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Yelan: Isn't this your time off? You should do something that isn't too mentally taxing.
Yelan: Oh, I have some dice in my pocket. Why don't we have a little fun?
Yelan: I'll roll the dice, and the score decides who confesses.
Traveler: Score?
Yelan: If I roll a one, three, or five, you have to confess. You have to tell me... a secret that no one else can ever be allowed to know.
Yelan: If it's two, four, or six, then I'll be the one who has to reveal an important secret to you. What do you say?
Traveler: Sounds a little risky...
Yelan: In other words, you still have some reservations towards me.
Yelan: But the good news is, you passed the test. The fact that you'll keep some cards close to your chest even in front of a major ally actually makes me more confident in you.
Yelan: Maybe you'll make a successful intelligence agent yourself one day. I'm excited to go up against you.
Traveler: Let's go for it!
Yelan: Oh? So you really want to play, despite there being a fifty-fifty chance of losing?
Yelan: Or is it that you're willing to take a gamble for the sake of finding out my secrets?
Yelan: Interesting. I was going to pull a little trick, but now even I'm looking forward to this.
Yelan: Hehe... Then let round one begin.
Traveler: "Confess"?

Traveler: Morning, Yelan.
Yelan: Morning... this is early for me, but you seem pretty peppy.
Yelan: You don't seem to have much going on right now, though, so I think I'll go ahead and snooze a while longer.

Traveler: Good night, Yelan.
Yelan: #Good night to you too, Traveler.
Yelan: I'll keep working for a little while longer. My mind's at peak efficiency at this hour, so it's the perfect time to go through the clues and piece everything together...

## Talk 6

Yelan: This house is similar to a place in Southwest Minlin that I lived in for a while.
Yelan: Minlin... now that was a smooth operation. Thinking back on it puts me in a good mood.
Yelan: I should go back and give that place a spring-clean sometime. Never know when it might prove useful again...

## Talk 7

Yelan: This food street is great. It really captures that urban feel of Chihu Rock.
Yelan: You've got to have a proper breakfast to get yourself in the right mood for work.
Yelan: Also — if you keep an ear open when you're at one of these roadside eateries, you can usually pick up a few useful snippets of information...
