# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Alhaitham: Sure, if you're mentally prepared.
Alhaitham: But before you say anything â€” I'm not very interested in small talk. If you need something, just get to the point.
Alhaitham: As for whether I'll help, it'll depend on the situation.
Traveler: Is that mentality because of work?
Alhaitham: You could say it's the product of life experience.
Alhaitham: If you want to live at a more leisurely pace, you can try copying a page or two from my book.
Traveler: Is that something you learned through interacting with others?
Alhaitham: Is it? I don't think I'd gain experience this valuable from standard social interactions.
Alhaitham: But now, you've learned something by interacting with me. Congratulations.
