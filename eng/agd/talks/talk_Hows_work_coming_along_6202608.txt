Traveler: How's work coming along?
Jiangzhou: My father's been getting on in years lately, so I asked for a transfer. Now that I'm in a more leisurely department, I finally have time to spend with my family after work.
Jiangzhou: Now that I have some room to breathe, I can't even recall how I managed to take on so many tasks... Many of them weren't even my responsibilities, but I just couldn't help putting my nose in there.
Jiangzhou: Hahaha. I was so strong back then, eh?
