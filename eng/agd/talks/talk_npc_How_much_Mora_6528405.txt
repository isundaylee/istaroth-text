Traveler: How much Mora?
Lasselin: Mora? Thâ€”That's okay too.
Lasselin: But if you're using Mora, you'll need to buy more good wine. After all... the information I possess is very valuable. I could sell it for a small fortune.
Lasselin: However, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with the helmsman. I'll be in trouble if I handle Mora.
