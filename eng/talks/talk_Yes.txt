Dongdong: Wow, cool! You must have been to sooo many cool places and seen sooo many cool things!
Dongdong: My dad's a sailor with The Crux! They travel all around the world and go on adventures every day. He's a real hero!
Dongdong: He doesn't come home much, but he always sends me letters about the coolest, most exciting things that happen on his journeys. Hee-hee!
Dongdong: When I'm older, I'm gonna join The Crux Fleet too! Then I'll be able to see all that stuff for myself! How cool will that be!?
