Traveler: Why's that?
Sahar: In Sumeru, spices are a must-buy, and Jut's is the best spice store you can find around.
Sahar: Not only is the quality high, but the prices are very reasonable. He even sells the rare Padisarah!
Sahar: He also gives customers small gifts on occasion, so you definitely don't want to miss his store when you come to the Grand Bazaar.
