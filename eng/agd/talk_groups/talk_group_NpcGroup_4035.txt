Farzaneh: Hi there, can I help you with something? Please make it quick if you can. Standing too long in one place makes me dizzy...

## Talk

Traveler: Do you need me to take you to the hospital?
Farzaneh: Oh, it's not like that. I'm just not quite used to life on land yet.
Farzaneh: I run an armed commercial shipping company. I used to serve as a lieutenant captain in Beidou's Crux Fleet, and made quite a bit of money doing so.
Farzaneh: I haven't ventured back out to sea since starting my own commercial shipping company.
Farzaneh: But I'm struggling to get used to being back on land, maybe because I spent so long at sea. I have to walk back and forth to avoid getting dizzy...

Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Farzaneh: Then I'll get back to my walk.
