Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Cyrus: This is a day to remember those heroes who fought for their freedom. It is said that they once used Windblume as their code word...
Cyrus: As to which flower the Windblume really is? Ah, there are as many views as there are people.
Cyrus: To commemorate the courage and sacrifice of those heroes, we go out to search for clues regarding the Windblume each time the festival rolls back around.
Cyrus: Over many years of searching, I have come to believe more and more that the Windblume is the Windwheel Aster!
Traveler: The Windwheel Aster?
Cyrus: Yes! Don't you think so, too?
Cyrus: Compared to the dandelion, the Windwheel Asters that turn with the wind are the true symbol of Mondstadt's freedom and the soul of the Windblume Festival!
Cyrus: It's just that we lack concrete evidence with which to convince other people...
