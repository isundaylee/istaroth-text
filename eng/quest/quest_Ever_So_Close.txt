# Ever So Close


## Talk 1

Alhaitham: You two made it. And from the looks on your faces, you were successful.
Paimon: Whoa, there's so many people from the Akademiya here! Why would you pick this place as our meet-up spot?
Alhaitham: Well, Wikala Funduq is under the Akademiya's control, so naturally, the Akademiya has people working here. I came to Port Ormos under the pretense of conducting official business.
Paimon: You're a pretty daring guy...
Alhaitham: Relax, no one here is interested in anything we say, and the matra won't come here. Okay now, tell me how your encounter with Dori went.
Black Screen Text: You bring Alhaitham up to date and give him the Canned Knowledge you purchased...
Paimon: Okay, we did what you asked. So, can you tell us about the Knowledge Capsule that the Akademiya lost now?
Alhaitham: Before that, I have to ask — why are you two so intent on tracking it down? You don't have to answer, of course.
Traveler: It's not a secret or anything.
Paimon: #Yeah, {M#he}{F#she} just wants to meet the God of Wisdom and ask her about something important. We've been in Sumeru for a while now, but we still haven't found a way.
Paimon: When we heard that the Akademiya had lost something that might be related to the gods, we came here in case it turned out to be our lucky break.
Alhaitham: In that case, you're on the right track.
Alhaitham: A short while ago, the Akademiya lost a Knowledge Capsule in the desert. It's supposedly a Divine Knowledge Capsule — use it, and you'll gain the wisdom of the gods.
Paimon: #Wow, there's really such a thing as that!? Hey, if we find it, do you think we could learn how to meet the Dendro Archon? Ooh, or how to find your {M#sister}{F#brother}?
Alhaitham: I highly doubt it has any mystical properties, but it does indeed exist, and it's right here in Port Ormos.
Paimon: So... where exactly?
Alhaitham: That's what we need to find out next.
Traveler: Your goal is to find it, too?
Alhaitham: I won't deny that. I am investigating because I'm curious as to what the Divine Knowledge Capsule truly is.
Alhaitham: As you know, the Eremites in Port Ormos also have their eyes on it. It is an extremely precious item. The knowledge contained within may bring great power or wealth to whoever has it in their possession.
Alhaitham: Several brigades have been vying for ownership of it as of late, but there is still no victor.
Alhaitham: My personal finances and connections cannot compete with those of the Eremites. After attempting various methods, I finally managed to reach a tentative agreement with several brigades.
Alhaitham: I agreed to forego ownership of the Divine Knowledge Capsule in exchange for the opportunity to study it. After all, there's no harm in understanding what it is.
Alhaitham: However, there are those who are less amenable to negotiation, such as those from Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Alhaitham: They adamantly believe that the Divine Knowledge Capsule contains King Deshret's power, and that he will return to this world when they obtain it. They refuse to let anyone from the Akademiya tarnish their deity's soul.
Paimon: So you kept hounding them because they refused to cooperate with you?
Alhaitham: Yes. Ayn Al-Ahmar isn't exactly wealthy, but its members are determined to get that capsule by any means necessary. To that end, they've resorted to many methods more foul than fair in order to amass sufficient funds.
Alhaitham: So, I've been sabotaging their business to force them into negotiating with me.
Alhaitham: The Divine Knowledge Capsule should be up for a secret auction within the next few days. Each brigade will place their own bid, and the prize will be covertly given to the winner.
Alhaitham: To ensure the capsule's security and to evade the matra's notice, the winning brigade will not publicly disclose their victory.
Alhaitham: Unless I know whose hands the Divine Knowledge Capsule ends up in, my agreements with them will fall through.
Alhaitham: Dori is the most reliable source of information, but that avenue was previously closed to me. With you on board now, the situation is different.
Paimon: In other words, you wanted us to befriend Dori so you could find out where the Divine Knowledge Capsule is?
Alhaitham: Yes, you can say that, but this arrangement harms none of us.
Alhaitham: The day after tomorrow, go back to Dori and try to purchase information on the Divine Knowledge Capsule's whereabouts. If she has no information, wait two days and approach her again.
Alhaitham: If I get the opportunity to study the Divine Knowledge Capsule, I will relay my findings to you. Will that suffice as compensation?
Traveler: That's exactly what I want.
Alhaitham: Okay. Then we'll meet up in two days.
Paimon: Alhaitham, before you go! We actually bought a Knowledge Capsule for ourselves, but we're not sure how to use it.
Alhaitham: You two want to try using a Knowledge Capsule? Sure, I can teach you.
Alhaitham: Doing so right under the Akademiya's nose is a bit problematic, though. What do you say we head to the outskirts of town.
Traveler: Thank you.
Traveler: We want to meet with the Dendro Archon.

## Talk 2

Alhaitham: Alright, this place works. Show me the capsule you purchased.
Paimon: Here.
Alhaitham: Hm, Swordfighting Techniques VIII... A combat-class Knowledge Capsule. This class is something of a rare find these days, since most have been taken by the Eremites to augment their battle capabilities.
Paimon: Really? Aw yeah, what a great buy!
Alhaitham: If you want to determine the efficacy of this capsule, I can evaluate your combat ability. However, effects will likely be minimal if you already possess a high amount of strength.
Alhaitham: We can conduct a controlled experiment where you fight two battles: one before using this Knowledge Capsule, and one after.
Alhaitham: While you fight, we can use an Akasha Terminal to monitor your various physical parameters.
Alhaitham: There may be variances in your physical strength between the two tests, as well as a disparity in your opponents' abilities... But don't worry, I'll run statistical analyses afterward to mitigate any confounding effects.
Paimon: Wow... Alhaitham, you must've been one of those guys at the Akademiya who got top grades on everything!
Paimon: Paimon's curious about something, though. You definitely weren't one of those students who needed Canned Knowledge to graduate from the Akademiya, right? So why are you risking getting caught by the matra for this capsule?
Traveler: I'm also curious about this.
Alhaitham: When you are unable to understand a researcher's actions, most cases can be attributed to curiosity. This is but one theory.
Paimon: Hmm... Sounds like you're trying to avoid the question.
Alhaitham: Alright, let's begin the test. Just fight as you normally do.

## Talk 3

Alhaitham: Alright, I'll link your Akasha Terminal to record data.
Alhaitham: The next step is to use this Knowledge Capsule.
Alhaitham: Hold it in your hand. I'll help you establish a connection with it so you can activate its power.

## Talk 4

Alhaitham: Now, I'll start recording data again.
Paimon: Alhaitham, how's it going?
Alhaitham: #Well, the Knowledge Capsule you purchased did improve {M#his}{F#her} combat capability. During the second fight, {M#his}{F#her} overall fighting performance increased by 0.073%.
Paimon: Wait... how much?
Traveler: 0.073%.
Paimon: Aaarrrgh! Dori's such a jerk! She totally scammed us! One million Mora? This thing isn't worth a tenth of that amount!
Alhaitham: #Of course, this could be because {M#he}{F#she} is so powerful that the capsule's contents were unable to produce a substantial increase.
Alhaitham: At the very least, this test allowed me to gain more insight into you two. Our deal seems increasingly worth my investment.
Alhaitham: I'm heading back to the Wikala Funduq. I await your response in two days' time. This is Mora for when you ask Dori for information. Pay her as much as she requests.
Traveler: That's basically zero.

## Talk 5

Dori: Here, over here! Welcome back, my loyal patrons. What can I do for you this time?
Dori: You name it! Canned Knowledge, supplies, or anything else you need, I'll find a way to get it... Where there's a waterfall of Mora, there's a way.
Paimon: Can you really get us anything we want? Anything at all?
Dori: Aha! So it appears that Canned Knowledge alone is no longer sufficient for your opulent appetite? Then please, oblige me, tell me what you have in mind!
Traveler: I'd like to buy info on the whereabouts of the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Dori: Oh, hehehe! I knew customers with pockets as deep as yours would undoubtedly crave something more profound than ordinary Canned Knowledge.
Dori: But you know, that kind of information isn't going to be cheap.
Dori: After all, I had to work really hard to weasel my way into the auction site. Not to mention that if anyone found out that I was the leaker, I would be in big, big trouble.
Paimon: But how can we be sure your information is accurate? Paimon's curious how you just happen to have this kind of info the moment we need it.
Dori: Hehehe... Because to me, anything of value is what I consider to be my supply. Therefore, I must always be aware of what's hot on the market in order to secure more sales.
Dori: As for the information's authenticity, well, you've no need to worry about that. I used a Kamera to take a picture of the transaction. That way, no one can dispute it.
Traveler: Name your price.
Dori: It's always a pleasure doing business with such sterling patrons.
Dori: Ahem, now that you've paid in full, here's the scoop: The Divine Knowledge Capsule was purchased yesterday by a certain Mizri, the leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Ayn Al-Ahmar? You mean the Eremites who worship King Deshret?
Dori: Ah, so you're already familiar with them.
Dori: The group has done everything in their power to obtain the Divine Knowledge Capsule. After all, they believe it contains the power of King Deshret.
Dori: That Divine Knowledge Capsule is unlike any other Canned Knowledge I've seen before. It was glowing bright red.
Dori: The capsule is clearly visible in the picture I took. You can look for yourself.
Paimon: Thanks for the info, Dori.
Dori: Please, it's my pleasure. It's all thanks to discerning customers such as yourselves that my efforts yesterday were not in vain. Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you ever need anything else in the future — Mora for Dori opens doors!
Traveler: I'll buy the information.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Alhaitham! We got the info you wanted!
Alhaitham: Really? Alright, let's hear it.
Traveler: It's in the hands of Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Dori even gave us evidence to verify the intel. Have a look!
Alhaitham: Huh, look at that... clear as day. It must have taken some guts just to infiltrate the scene of the Eremites' transaction. But then to get close enough to take a picture like this... Bold move, Dori. Very bold move.
Alhaitham: Alright, the person in this picture is indeed Mizri, the leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar, and the glowing red capsule he's holding appears to be the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Alhaitham: In which case, if we play our cards right, when we confront them next week, we should be able to force them to show their hand.
Paimon: At first, Paimon didn't get why you were provoking these Ayn Al-Ahmar guys, but now it sorta makes sense. Everything's playing right into your hands.
Paimon: After we defeat them, we can finally have a serious talk with their boss and get him to lend us the Divine Knowledge Capsule!
Alhaitham: Thank you for your time and efforts. Take a few days off while I make some preparations. Let's meet up again on the afternoon of the arranged date, three o'clock sharp.
Traveler: We'll be there.
Alhaitham: See you then.
Black Screen Text: A few days later, on the day of the meeting with Ayn Al-Ahmar...
Paimon: Alhaitham sure is taking his time. Where could he be? Oh, there he is!
Alhaitham: Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's head to the pier in front of Pharos Lighthouse.
Paimon: Yep, let's go!
Traveler: The very group that we're about to face.

## Talk 7

Tariq: Alhaitham... I knew you were crazy, but I didn't know you were crazy enough to actually show up.
Alhaitham: It was I who demanded that these negotiations take place. I was more worried that you might go back on your promise, but to your credit, it appears that you're sticking to your word.
Alhaitham: This is turning into quite an occasion. I also brought some backup — I assume you don't mind.
Tariq: Backup? Aren't you the brat from the restaurant the other day? You've come to support this lunatic because he helped you out? Hmph, fine, your funeral.
Tariq: I'm not going to mince my words: once we're done with you, you'll be nothing more than fish food. Get 'em, boys!
Paimon: Uh oh, here they come! Uh, good luck you two!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh!? What in Teyvat just happened? It's like that big guy suddenly lost his mind...
Alhaitham: It looks like he used the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Paimon: You mean, the Divine Knowledge Capsule did that to him?
Traveler: Speaking of which, Haypasia did mention...
Paimon: Oh yeah, you mean how some researchers go insane after getting knowledge from Irminsul?
Alhaitham: I've heard of numerous incidents of researchers in Satyavada Life going insane. The state that man is now in suggests that this is a similar situation.
Alhaitham: This Divine Knowledge Capsule does appear to be linked to the gods, but beyond that, it doesn't seem anything like the rumors suggest. Possessing it doesn't grant you divine wisdom or power.
Alhaitham: Did you hear what he said? "World... forget me..." What could that possibly mean?
Traveler: (That's exactly what I heard before at Irminsul...)
Paimon: If the matra took him away, then that means the Akademiya got the Divine Knowledge Capsule back, too. What a shame, we were so close...
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't expect the Divine Knowledge Capsule would be so dangerous. Imagine if we'd tried to open it... Who knows what would've happened to us...
Alhaitham: As things stand, there is no reason for me to remain in Port Ormos. I believe our collaboration has also reached its end.
Paimon: Oh, we were so busy trying to find the Divine Knowledge Capsule that Paimon forgot to ask you something! Since you're a member of the Akademiya, do you have any idea how we can go about meeting Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Alhaitham: Truthfully, I don't. Lesser Lord Kusanali appears to exist outside of Sumeru's entire administration. Most of the time, you wouldn't know she exists at all.
Alhaitham: Moreover, since the Akademiya possesses the Akasha, a symbol of our deity's wisdom, scholars have no reason to desire to make contact with the deity herself anyway...
Paimon: *sigh* Everything about Lesser Lord Kusanali is such a mystery.
Alhaitham: I'm heading back to the Akademiya. How about you two?
Paimon: Aah, it's almost the day of the Sabzeruz Festival! Maybe we should head back, too. We've been rushed off our feet over the past few days, so maybe a little rest and relaxation will do us good.
Traveler: You have a point.
Paimon: Then we'll part ways here, Alhaitham. Until we meet again!
Alhaitham: Hmm... Now, do I deal with this thing first, or should I produce the report that the higher-ups require?
Traveler: Let's return to Sumeru City.

## Talk 9

Traveler: (I feel like I just had an epiphany...)
Traveler: (As if I saw countless sword-wielding figures fighting one moment, and then in the next, they disappeared into the recesses of my memory.)
Paimon: Hey, how are you feeling?
Traveler: I felt something for a moment.
Paimon: You mean that it worked?
Alhaitham: Alright, time for round two. Fight with the same composure as before.
Traveler: Whatever was inside the Knowledge Capsule became a part of my memory.

## Additional Conversations

Dori: Hee-hee-hee, Mora, Mora, shiny Mora... Hee-hee-hee...
Dori: ...Oh! Uh, please come back any time you need something!

Dori: Remember to bring a token of our friendship the next time we meet, okay? I like to think it's built on a firm foundation of solid, shining Mora...

Alhaitham: (Alhaitham lifts his chin and looks into the distance, seemingly waiting for you to provide battle data.)

### Additional Talk 4
