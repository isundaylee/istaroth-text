Traveler: Training?
Kagawa: That's right. I believe that people need to go out and train more while they're young. Only by absorbing the essence of both the sun and moon can one really train one's body and soul.
Kagawa: You see, the blooming of flowers mark the changing of the seasons, and the flow of this waterfall marks the flow of time.
Kagawa: We all live in nature, and we should appreciate its beauty rather than bury our heads in work all the time...
Kagawa: Wait, uh, I mean, you can only work at your best after you've trained yourself, am I right?
