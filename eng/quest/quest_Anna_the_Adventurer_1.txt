# Anna the Adventurer!


## Talk 1

Anna: Alright. Let's work hard today, too!
Traveler: Haha, you're all fired up.
Anna: Of course! Being an adventurer is really interesting!
Anna: Well... I still am a bit unfamiliar with what to do while undertaking commissions, though.
Anna: Traveler, would you mind coming with me again? I still have things I'd like to ask you.
Anna: Then let's set out. Today's commission is...
Anna: Huh... So we're escorting... another transport balloon.
Traveler: Want me to come along?
Anna: Would you? Hehe, sure! There's still so much I could learn from you.

## Talk 2

Bennett: Fischl. You ran off too quickly! That was really risky...
Fischl: Hah! Mine thundering retribution spares not any evildoers...
Anna: Oh, it's Fischl and Bennett! Hello there!
Bennett: Oh, it's you, Anna. And the Traveler, too! Are you on a commission?
Fischl: Ah, you have arrived, O you who art blessed by the Prinzessin! Surely were you led here by the weft of fate.
Oz: Mein Fräulein wishes to say that she is pleased to have met you by chance.
Traveler: I'm accompanying Anna on her commission.
Anna: That's right. The Traveler and I were just escorting this transport balloon.
Anna: But all of a sudden, a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders came charging at us...
Bennett: Uh, I'm terribly sorry about that. That was my fault.
Bennett: Fischl and I accepted a commission to investigate the whereabouts of a certain band of Treasure Hoarders.
Bennett: Oz managed to catch their trail, and we were about to capture them... And then I tripped over a branch and fell over.
Bennett: The noise startled those Treasure Hoarders, who turned and fled. We had no choice but to keep chasing them...
Fischl: There was never any reason to fret. The violet light of conviction was ever fated to sever the destinies of those foul rogues.
Oz: But Mein Fräulein, was it not the Traveler who ultimately apprehended them?
Fischl: O—Oz!
Bennett: W—Well, anyway, thanks for your help this time. It really was fortunate that you were there to bar their path.
Bennett: Looks like my luck's pretty good today, huh!
Traveler: Glad I could help.
Bennett: Hehe. Well then, guess we'll haul these Treasure Hoarders back to the Guild. Be careful now — and don't forget to watch your step!

## Talk 3

Anna: Bennett's as reliable as ever, I see.
Anna: And Fischl... Her words are as impressive as ever!
Traveler: What's your impression of Bennett so far?
Anna: My impression of him?
Anna: When I first joined the Guild, he answered a lot of my questions and gave me lots of assistance.
Anna: But I've heard that he has especially bad luck.
Anna: That's just not fair. He's such a nice person...
Anna: Well, guess we've finished this commission either way. Thank you, Traveler. I'm going to report back to the Guild now.
Anna: Still, why did I get transport balloon escort a few days in a row? Doesn't the Guild have any other commissions?
Traveler: How's Fischl been?
Anna: Fischl? Well, um...
Anna: Sh—She's really awesome as well! Her archery is great, and she's cleared lots of commissions.
Anna: I don't really understand the things that she says...
Anna: But she's still a very experienced adventurer. W—Wait, no, she's an investigator!

## Talk 4

Anthony: Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
Traveler: Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
Anthony: ...
Anthony: I respect my sister's wishes.
Anthony: Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams.
Anthony: As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
Anthony: That's all I have to say.
