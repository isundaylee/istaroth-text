## Talk

Nadia: These fireworks are lovely. If I could watch them together with him, just once... Hmm, should I mention that in my next letter...
Nadia: ...
Nadia: Oh, um, good evening. This is the Northland Bank.

## Talk

Nadia: Oh, pardon me. My mind was elsewhere just now...
Nadia: I just miss wintertime back in my hometown.

## Talk

Nadia: What are you doing?
Nadia: I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that could arrive at any minute, a boat carrying the thoughts of my loved ones...
Nadia: I'm Nadia from Snezhnaya. I was transferred here because of my work.
Nadia: Sometimes you have no choice but to leave your homeland behind. I do miss my family dearly, so I can only write to them and hope for their replies.
Nadia: So I come here and wait for the boats from Snezhnaya whenever I have a free moment. I guess it's also a way for me to show how much I miss them.

## Talk

Nadia: You miss wintertime?
Nadia: Winter in Snezhnaya is quite different.
Nadia: It's common in some places for blizzards to last an entire month. It can be deadly if you don't properly prepare your food reserves and don't take precautions against the cold.
Nadia: So as you cuddle up next to the warm stove with snow laden winds beating against the window, the danger that is right in front of your eyes and yet distant in the sky will make you think, "Ah, I'm alive, and I'm happy."
Nadia: If you ever come to Snezhnaya, you'll understand what I mean.

## Talk

Nadia: Goodbye.
Nadia: Goodbye, I hope you will also reunite with those who are missing you!

Nadia: ...
Nadia: Oh, good evening. This is the Northland Bank.

## Talk

Nadia: What are you thinking about?
Nadia: I was just going back and forth in my mind a bit about what I should write in this letter.
Nadia: Usually I write to my family back home, but recently I've gained a penpal.
Nadia: Tell me about your penpal.
Nadia: He's also a guard here at the Northland Bank, but he's on duty during the day, while I'm on duty at night. To tell you the truth, I don't even know his name.
Nadia: One time, I accidentally left the letter I had written to my brother at our post.
Nadia: And then perhaps the other guard mistook it as a letter that I left for him. He even wrote me a reply.
Nadia: I could read between the lines and tell that he was probably very lonely, so I thought it would be good to go along with it to help him in this way.
Nadia: But eventually, writing to him also became a part of my life. I've even started looking forward to receiving his letters, hehe.

## Talk

Nadia: Goodbye.
Nadia: Take care now.
