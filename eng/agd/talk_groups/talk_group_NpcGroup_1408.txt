Anna: Another escort mission? I've lost count of how many of these I've done...
Anna: Isn't there some commission that will really let me show off what I can do?
Anthony: Everything in good time, Anna. Don't be so hasty.

## Talk

Traveler: How've you been lately?
Anna: Ah, Traveler! It's you!
Anna: I've been taking my progress as an adventurer quite... slowly.
Anna: I've completed some escort missions, more escort missions... Have I mentioned the other escort missions?
Anthony: And she's very good at them, too.
Anthony: As I see it, she is already an expert at these commissions.
Anna: Brother! I've done this escort so many times already! I'm looking for something more exciting!
Anthony: Come on, Anna. Everything in good time.
Anna: Ugh...

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been feeling, Anna?
Anna: Me? I'm feeling great! In fact, I feel almost indefatigable!
Anthony: Something that's shown through in your appetite.
Anna: Brother! I... I'm only eating a bit more than I used to, come on!
Anna: Don't you pin this on me, by the way. This is your fault for making the food so delicious!
Anthony: And what would you like to have for dinner tonight?
Anna: Sweet Madame, Pancakes... and Chicken-Mushroom Skewer! And, and... Let me think...

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Anna: Alright, see you.
Anthony: See you. Um, and also...
Anthony: Thank you, Traveler.

## Talk

Anthony: Not bad for today...
Anthony: What are you doing!? You frightened me!
Anthony: What are YOU doing?
Anthony: I... I'm not doing anything.
Anthony: Oh, well. You've caught me already, haven't you...
Anthony: It's just an ordinary water fountain, but somehow people treat it like a wishing well...
Anthony: Throwing their money away for nothing... But I could use that money!
Anthony: I am in desperate need of money... Please don't tell anyone.
Traveler: Why do you need the money?
Anthony: Because of Anna, my sister. You may have met her during the day.
Anthony: She's suffering from a rare disease, so she often comes here to make wishes.
Anthony: Why does it have to be her... She's such a kind and gentle kid... Why must it be her and not me...
Anthony: These coins somewhat make up for the medicine she needs, but I also work hard at my job, of course...
Anthony: If the archons are watching... I'm sure they will forgive my actions...
Anthony: Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
Anthony: Stop fooling around and scaring people. It's not good for the heart...

## Talk

Anthony: Thanks to that master physician, Anna's finally turned the corner...

## Talk

Traveler: Is Anna doing well?
Anthony: Thanks to that doctor, Anna's been getting better.
Anthony: She hasn't made a full recovery yet, but that doctor also gave me a recuperative prescription for her.
Anthony: As long as she keeps taking her medicine, she will eventually get well.

## Talk

Traveler: So, what are your plans going forward?
Anthony: Me? Well, since Anna's illness has been taking a turn for the better, I can probably take some more relaxed work as compared to before.
Anthony: I was really busy then, and didn't have time to spend with Anna at all. I have to change that.
Anthony: Unless you mean my picking Mora at midnight â€” in which case, well, every little bit was a gain. But I won't do that anymore. I only did it then on account of my younger sister's illness, anyway.

## Talk

Traveler: It's been tough on you.
Anthony: Hahaha, this is nothing. I would do anything for Anna.
Anthony: To be honest, I have to thank you again. If not for you, I wouldn't have been able to gather those strange ingredients for that prescription.
Anthony: Once Anna fully recovers, I should invite you over to taste some of her cooking...

## Talk

Traveler: I'll look forward to it.
Anthony: See you!
