Traveler: Let's hear about the symphony and "Phobos"...
Monsieur Os: Where should I even begin... The "Symphony" is human memory and persona woven into a melody through musical notation, creating a song in which human souls can dwell and have their wishes fulfilled.
Monsieur Os: In that way, to master the "Symphony" is to master "fate"... This is the secret that the Great Golden Bee Sybilla, the prophet who survived the previous cycle, imparted.
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos, who created the "Symphony," poured these melodies into the insoluble Ichor, in hopes that all might control their own fates through playing that music.
Monsieur Os: He overestimated us, I fear, for his deeds terrified us... The people could not bear the burden of fate, and they begged their god and superiors for guidance.
Monsieur Os: At the request of the people, the Sebastos wrote all melodies into the grandest of melodies. This new Symphony would bring us all the greatest of happiness — and its name was "Phobos."
Monsieur Os: Had the Sebastos's plan worked, the Symphony would have woven a melody of utmost gentleness for us all — an eternity that would last a thousand years and beyond. But something went wrong...
Monsieur Os: Besides the Sebastos himself, only said superiors, the Harmosts, could have changed Phobos's melody.
Monsieur Os: And Boethius... was once an excellent Harmost.
