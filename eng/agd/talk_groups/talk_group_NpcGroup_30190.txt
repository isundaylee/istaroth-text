Akira: I'm Akira, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Feedback Ambassador. So, can you give us some feedback?
Traveler: It's pretty good.
Akira: Got it. Thank you for your feedback.
Akira: Hmm? You have other questions? But I don't really have anything else to say.
Akira: Uh... The boss said my only job was to say two things: "Can you give us some feedback?" and "Thank you for your feedback."
Akira: And if the guests ask when they will receive a response to their feedback, I'm supposed to say: "We'll get back to you as soon as possible."
Akira: He said that's what people do in other events he's been to. I'm sure he's basing this on a wealth of experience.
Akira: But then Shinobu told me that's too insincere, so she gave me this notebook.
Akira: Look here, I've made a note of your feedback, and I'll show it to Shinobu when she gets back.
Traveler: It's alright, nothing special.
Traveler: It's not that great.
