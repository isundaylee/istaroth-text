# Talk Dialog

Yaoyao: I'm so happy! And all the grandmas and grandpas in Qingce Village had a great time, too.
Traveler: Why Qingce Village?
Yaoyao: You mean... what am I doing here? Well, just now, I did a performance for everyone!
Yaoyao: Although I can't play an instrument anywhere near as well as Master, I can still sing.
Yaoyao: Even Granny Ruoxin said I did a great job. She also gave me some candies, hee-hee!
Traveler: About your Master...
Yaoyao: Master's told me a lot of stories about the adepti!
Yaoyao: There was Skybracer with the giant deer horns, and Sea Gazer who loved to collect treasure...
Yaoyao: Sometimes, Master talks and talks for a long time, until her voice starts to sound sad. But then she always breaks into a smile again, and tells me all of the things each of them loved best about Liyue...
Yaoyao: I love everything about Liyue!
Yaoyao: Some of the adepti are gone now, but it's okay, because I'm gonna help take care of everyone in their stead!
Traveler: About Dvorak...
Yaoyao: I'm happy that Mr. Dvorak found the fairy lady from his story. And I'm also happy that it turned out it was Master all along.
Yaoyao: Also, I helped out this time too, didn't I? So that means I was... paying "ho-ma-ge" to my master?
Yaoyao: Oh, oh, also, Mr. Dvorak got one of his friends to bring me a toy from Fontaine! I like it a lot!
Yaoyao: At first... I didn't know whether I was supposed to accept it or not... But then Master said it was okay, so I did!
Traveler: See you.
Yaoyao: See you! Make sure you take good care of Paimon!
Yaoyao: Oh, and please come play with me if you ever have the time!
