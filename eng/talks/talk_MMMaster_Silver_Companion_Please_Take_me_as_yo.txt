# Talk Dialog

Hardy Two-Blades: M—M—Master Silver Companion! Please! Take me as your apprentice!
Traveler: Calm down!
Paimon: Err... Yeah! Calm yourself! Did you hit your head or something this morning? What are you talking about?
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm being serious!
Hardy Two-Blades: I was shocked when I heard that you guys defeated Lady Haniyyah. I went to visit Miss Haniyyah and learned about your story...
Hardy Two-Blades: I had no idea how out of line I was before! I'll change and make up for it! Please! Master Silver Companion, show me the proper path!
Paimon: #Hold on! Why are you coming to Paimon with this!? {NICKNAME} makes most of the decisions here!
Hardy Two-Blades: I know, but the two of you have worked in harmony, and I'm sure you guys share the same ideas as well.
Hardy Two-Blades: However, Master Golden Comet is mysterious and rarely ever speaks. I highly doubt someone as dull as me will be able to understand Master Golden Comet's teachings.
Hardy Two-Blades: On the other hand, Master Silver Companion's words are straightforward and easy to understand! That's why I'd like to become your apprentice!
Paimon: #What do we do, {NICKNAME}? We've never met anyone like this before. He went from being a big meanie to this... Paimon isn't sure what to do with him.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's better to leave him alone with his thoughts for a while instead of trying to mentor him. Once he realizes what he's done wrong, he'll become a more reliable person!
Traveler: Then there is only one solution...
Paimon: Yeah, let's get as far away as we can from this weirdo!
Traveler: Run!
Traveler: Paimon, run!
Paimon: I'm not sure what happened... but this isn't something we've dealt with before... Let's get out of here!
