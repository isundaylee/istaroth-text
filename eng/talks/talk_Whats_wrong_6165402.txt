Tsarevich: What's wrong?
Tsarevich: There are monsters in the gorge, so the Knights of Favonius wouldn't let me through. Too dangerous, they say.
Tsarevich: I've been waiting and waiting, and still no sign that they'll let us through any time soon. I would have expected a little more efficiency from the illustrious Knights of Favonius.
Tsarevich: You're an adventurer, huh? Well go on then, get in there and take out a few monsters for me, pronto!
