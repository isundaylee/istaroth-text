Kurash: Oh, looks like you're a tourist here?

## Talk

Traveler: And you are?
Kurash: I'm Kurash, I'm not from here, either.
Kurash: I gained quite a few skills while living in the desert, and I planned to join the Eremites.
Kurash: But just thinking about running around for my employers gives me a headache... It's better to just find a village and live a life that's fulfilling and leisurely.
Kurash: Look, even Granny Jehiet chose to retire here!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Kurash: See you, I hope you'll get to relax here for some time too.

Traveler: Granny Jehiet...
Kurash: Speaking of her, I was shocked when I met her for the first time!
Kurash: Appearances do change over time, but I'm certain Granny Jehiet is "The Lioness" in the legend!
Kurash: I didn't expect her to be living here... and even adopt a little boy.
Kurash: It's so unbelievable, I mean, she is "The Lioness" after all...
