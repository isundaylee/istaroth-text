# Delicious Wakatakeni

A light-colored vegetarian dish. The new life born in the embrace of the ocean and the crisp freshness that sprouted in the mountains have blended into this broth. The light and gentle flavors give one a foretaste of the wonder of the four seasons, and of the revivification of all life.
