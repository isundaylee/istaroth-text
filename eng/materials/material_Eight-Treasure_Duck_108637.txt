# Eight-Treasure Duck

A dish that needs true skill to make. Eight kinds of meat and vegetables, known as the eight treasures, are stuffed into a deboned duck. This is then molded into the shape of a gourd, to represent good fortune and auspiciousness. Exquisite ingredients, superb cutting skills, and phenomenal timing are all needed, that the finished dish might be worthy of its place as the final course at any banquet.
