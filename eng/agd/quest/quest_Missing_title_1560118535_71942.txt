Traveler: You seem quite tired.
Zhuyu: I'm alright. Picking herbs in the mountains can be quite exhausting. Fortunately, my wife has prepared some berries for me.
Zhuyu: This sweet taste really has the ability to relieve exhaustion.
Zhuyu: Still, I can't finish them all. Since you've still got a long road ahead of you, why don't you take some? Don't be shy now.
