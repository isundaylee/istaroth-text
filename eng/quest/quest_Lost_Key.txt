# Lost Key


## Talk 1

Wyatt: Traveler! You couldn't have picked a better time.
Wyatt: Last night, I was on my way to the city to deliver these goods, when suddenly, some shining orbs caught my eye.
Wyatt: I—I'd had too much to drink, and... I just felt drawn to them, you know? I went to check it out and it turned out to be a huge group of slimes. They even bumped into me really hard!
Wyatt: I panicked and ran, but lost my way. It took me forever to find my cart again. Then, this morning, I found out my <color=#00E1FFFF>key</color> was gone...
Wyatt: Could you help me look for it? It's got to be around here somewhere... I feel like it's right under my nose.
Traveler: Okay.
Wyatt: Great! It's such a huge area, I just wouldn't know where to start looking.
Traveler: I have some pressing business to attend to.
Wyatt: This is such a huge area. I just don't know where to start looking. Please, you're the only one that can help me!

## Talk 2

Wyatt: Found the key yet?
Traveler: I found this key — is it yours?
Wyatt: Yes! That's the one. I can't afford to let that happen again... I really must rein in my drinking.
Wyatt: Oh — and take these. Thanks for your help.
