Traveler: Do many outlanders come to take a dip?
Mataoho: Hmm, I'd say a lot? Most tourists enjoy their time here, and since they're already here, might as well enjoy a dip in the hot springs.
Mataoho: I remember a gentleman who came here from Inazuma. He would have spent every hour of every day in the hot springs if he could... It always took me a lot of effort to drag him out of the pool.
Mataoho: He even wrote me a letter after going back home. He said he'd opened a hot spring hotel in Inazuma, and even invited me to come.
Mataoho: Unfortunately, I can't just leave Natlan willy-nilly... Otherwise, I'd have loved to check out what he's done.
