# The Cat's Trail


## Talk 1

Neko: You time your arrival well. I was just fretting about something.
Traveler: What's the matter?
Neko: Do you recall that child, Konbumaru?
Neko: That little rascal went off to play nearby and has not returned. I am most worried.
Neko: Please, help to search for Konbumaru and bring him back.
Traveler: Consider it done.
Neko: Wonderful. Remember, you need to find Konbumaru and bring him back.

Neko: Ah, why will this child not listen to instruction...
Neko: Either way, please find Konbumaru and bring him back here.

Neko: I am counting on you to bring Konbumaru back to this shrine.

Neko: How does your task go? Have you found Konbumaru?
Traveler: Sure did.

Neko: No, there's no need to give chase.
Neko: It is me that that child is still angry at... I will teach them a lesson personally later.

Neko: Right. This is for you as thanks for your help.
Neko: *sigh* Why can't this child be as teachable as Meshi...
Traveler: Well, I never...
