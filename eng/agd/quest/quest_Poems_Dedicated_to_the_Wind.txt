### Additional Talk 1

Venti: ...Kaeya is a wily character, but a free wine is always the most delicious.
Traveler: You can always refuse.
Venti: Ah, it's fine. I mean, the church's choral hymns aren't exactly my strong suit, what with all the finicky formalities and so on... but as long as there is love for music in the air, I'm sure I'll be able to help.
Traveler: It sounds like it'll actually take a lot of work...
Venti: Hey, if I'm happy, and Sister Grace is happy, and the audience is happy... that's a great thing, isn't it?
Traveler: You're not just doing it for the wine?

### Additional Talk 2

Venti: Got it! With this melody, it'll be much more expressive...

### Additional Talk 3

Venti: Okay everyone, write your ideas down once you've got something, and then we'll open it up for a group discussion!
Barbara: I think the song should express the joy of being together with family.
Diona: Should I write about Fish Head Soup, or Liyue Grilled Fish...

### Additional Talk 4

Grace: Thank you both so much! Having some expert guidance will definitely be a great help.

### Additional Talk 5

Melker: Hmm, what should I sing about...
Artur: Home of the Windborne... What do you think of that?
Grace: Surely the song should at least mention Lord Barbatos...?
