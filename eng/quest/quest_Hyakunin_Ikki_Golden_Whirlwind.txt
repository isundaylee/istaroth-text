# Hyakunin Ikki: Golden Whirlwind


## Talk 1

Kayabuki Ikkei: Hello there, blond-haired outlander...
Traveler: We meet again.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Um, your blond hair looks familiar... Are you...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Ah yes! You are the eye-catching Golden Whirlwind from the Hyakunin Ikki last time...
Traveler: G—Golden Whirlwind...?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Previously, I was watching the excellent performances of the participants in a corner of the tournament venue, seeking to be inspired by the most thrilling fighting scenes. And there you were, taking out opponents like a golden whirlwind sweeping away weeds and grass...
Traveler: Ugh, please, spare me the flattery.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Anyway, some people have organized another Hyakunin Ikki recently.
Traveler: What is this Hyakunin Ikki?
Kayabuki Ikkei: It's a free-for-all tournament whereby people engage in a hearty fight to celebrate, or simply to eliminate bad luck. It's a festival where both martial artists and monsters put their grievances aside and forget their identities, just to enjoy the sheer excitement of fighting.
Kayabuki Ikkei: They say that those who stand out from the crowd will be awarded various treasures.
Kayabuki Ikkei: The identities of the organizers and sponsors are still shrouded in mystery though.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Whatever the case, this is not a topic to be discussed out in the open. Follow me...
Traveler: I see...
Traveler: ...Go on, don't stop.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Ahem... "Spectators with the keen eyes of a swordmaster must have noticed it — the blond-haired outsider was unleashing Kouranka Daitatsumaki, a technique that was deemed forbidden even amongst ancient martial arts...!"
Traveler: ?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Having been inspired by your marvelous fight, I wrote this story.
Traveler: Do you have a commission for me?

## Talk 2

Kayabuki Ikkei: Here we are.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Once we enter this suspicious-looking gate, we'll be in the tournament venue for this iteration of Hyakunin Ikki.
Traveler: Oh, that's pretty exciting.
Kayabuki Ikkei: The rules probably have not changed much. Monsters, adventurers, and warriors from across the world, who share a common yearning for fight, will quench their thirst on this stage through passionate battle.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Just like last time, feel free to bring your friends and companions! After all, the "Hyakunin" in "Hyakunin Ikki" means the more, the merrier!
Kayabuki Ikkei: I'm looking forward to your performance.
Traveler: Are you not going to participate this time either?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Oh, of course I will — as a spectator, cheering you on!
Kayabuki Ikkei: After all, what I aspire to do is write the most thrilling action novels, not become a gallant warrior like you.
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...And my gut tells me that your star will shine brightest in this arena.
Traveler: I will do my best.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Yes, I'm sure you'll show me the most dazzling blade-dance again this time.
Traveler: Wait to be impressed.
Traveler: That's quite troublesome.
