# Scattersleet Dance

When a character causes opponents to Superconduct, there is a 50% chance to trigger a falling icicle that deals 500% of the triggering character's ATK as DMG and decreases the opponent's Physical RES by 25% for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 5s and this CD is shared between all party members.
