# Talk Dialog

Bernhard: You two! We've got a problem!
Bernhard: An unidentified man came quietly into the store, leaving a package and a letter.
Bernhard: The man said in his letter that he had heard about our charity sale, and remembered his financial hardships as a child. He was very touched.
Bernhard: He wanted every child to grow up happy, so he donated some Fairbrew Jelly and other goods for sale.
Paimon: This is the first time this has happened to us! Paimon's a little moved...
Traveler: But... why would he hide his identity?
Paimon: Maybe this guy has a low profile! Perhaps, doing good deeds without leaving a name also gives a special sense of accomplishment?
Bernhard: Maybe we should be more prudent...
Bernhard: I have heard that Treasure Hoarders have mixed counterfeit goods with ordinary goods for unsuspecting merchants to sell.
Bernhard: This way, they can successfully throw away the hot potato, and make Mora on the side.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe it! Those horrible Treasure Hoarders, how can they even cheat innocent shop owners and customers!
Paimon: #Paimon's suddenly a little nervous... Traveler, what do you think we should do with the package...
