Traveler: What's wrong?
Yingzhu: Huh, so you weren't paying attention last time, then?
Yingzhu: Basically, Sumeru Akademiya commissioned the Adventurers' Guild to investigate on their behalf, and we found an Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: Judging by the scholars' response, it seemed to be an object of major significance for their research.
Yingzhu: Unfortunately, there was an incident while we were transporting the Irminsul Fruit, and it blew up. That's the long and short of it.
Yingzhu: Hosseini hasn't stopped moaning and groaning about it ever since. It's giving me a real headache...
