# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Yae Miko: Hmm... no.
Yae Miko: Hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? Ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face... I think it might be my favorite.
Traveler: So you were just joking...
Yae Miko: No, actually I wasn't.
Yae Miko: Or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what I wanted to do.
Yae Miko: Observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
Yae Miko: In principle, I should remain an outside observer. But you are far too much fun for that. I can't help but tease you from time to time.
Traveler: Oh, so it's my fault that you feel the need to tease me!?
Yae Miko: But of course.
Yae Miko: If you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
Yae Miko: As an observer, I get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
Yae Miko: Your story is one that has captivated me. I really do have high hopes for you... Please do your best to live up to them, child.
Traveler: My story? You mean my life story? Umm...
Yae Miko: Don't you worry. You still have a long journey ahead of you... Your story has only just begun.
Yae Miko: Besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
Yae Miko: Whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, I'll correct you. And if you're ever stuck in a rut, I'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
Yae Miko: That should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
Traveler: I'm not sure I can meet your expectations.
