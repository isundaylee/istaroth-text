# Lantern Rite, Big Business?


## Talk 1

Jianqiu: Thank you for your service. Here's some Mora, please check the amount.
Mr. Zhu: Sure thing. This Mora will be plenty. Now, will you two travelers be continuing further on your journey, or will you return to the city?
Mr. Zhu: I've heard that the Mingxiao Lantern will be particularly impressive this year.
Huachu: We...
Jianqiu: We'll be sure to go see it if we get the chance. Thanks for letting us know, Mr. Zhu.
Huachu: Excuse me, Mr. Zhu. Would you be willing to sell us one of your Xiao Lanterns?
Huachu: Even if we don't get the opportunity to see the Mingxiao Lantern in the city, it would still be nice to release a Xiao Lantern, right?
Jianqiu: Yes, it is the Lantern Rite after all.
Mr. Zhu: Sure, no problem at all! I just happen to have a few new Xiao Lanterns that were just made today.
Mr. Zhu: Here, you may have this lantern free of charge. It is the Lantern Rite after all, you may keep your Mora.
Jianqiu: Thank you, Mr. Zhu. Do you know of a suitable place to release the lantern nearby?
Mr. Zhu: A place to release a Xiao Lantern, huh? Let me think, it should somewhere higher up... Ah yes, I remember that there should be some suitable places if you follow this road further up the mountain.
Mr. Zhu: However, there's been word of monsters appearing on the mountain, so you two should be careful.

## Talk 2

Mr. Zhu: There must be a way...
Traveler: A way to do what?
Mr. Zhu: Oh, it's you, Traveler. You know how it's the time of the Lantern Rite, right? Well, I was trying to think of a way to help give my business a bit of a boost during all the festivities.
Mr. Zhu: Good location, nice scenery, and food... we've got plenty of that, too.
Mr. Zhu: I can see it now...They'll release the Mingxiao Lantern in the city, and here we've got tasty food, plenty to drink, and an incredible view — it's going to be spectacular!
Mr. Zhu: This'll be my main selling point to attract more customers. What do you think?
Traveler: Will you really be able to see the Mingxiao Lantern from here?
Mr. Zhu: Uh, of course you can see it from here... The lantern's so big that you'll certainly be able to see part of it, at least.
Mr. Zhu: Anyway, we'll get to that when the time comes. First, I need to get the inn squared away for more guests.
Mr. Zhu: Traveler, could I trouble you to collect some Xiao Lantern-making materials? I would like to hang some around the inn.
Traveler: I might as well assemble the lanterns while I'm at it...
Mr. Zhu: All I need are the materials. Constructing the lanterns can be quite time-consuming.
Mr. Zhu: So once you've collected the materials, just give them to Dummy and he'll take care of the rest. I'll be attending to other matters in the meantime.
Mr. Zhu: Of course, I won't be letting you leave empty-handed. I'll be sure you're rewarded after some guests come and business picks up.
Traveler: And if there's no guests...
Mr. Zhu: Uh, well... Even if no guests show up, I'll still have something prepared for you. Don't worry about that.
Mr. Zhu: I'm sure more guests will start to arrive once the inn is put in good order.
Mr. Zhu: *cough* Just pass those materials to Dummy. I'll finalize your payment tomorrow based on the situation.
Traveler: Only the materials?
Traveler: There's no way you'll be able to see the Mingxiao Lantern from here...

## Talk 3

Mr. Zhu: Please hurry with the Delicious Jewelry Soup. It's hard enough to get guests as it is, we mustn't disappoint them.

## Talk 4

Mr. Zhu: We really won't be able to see the Mingxiao Lantern from here?

## Talk 5

Dummy: We'll need to make more Xiao Lanterns...

## Talk 6

Mr. Zhu: I need to go attract some guests. I'll give you your rewards a little later.
Mr. Zhu: Hmm... Minghua Bank... Minghua Bank.

## Talk 7

Dummy: Thanks — I was just beginning to worry that we'd run out of materials.
Dummy: Just give me a moment to make a few more Xiao Lanterns and we can hang them all up together.
Dummy: ...And that should just about do it. Here, take these Xiao Lanterns and hang them beside the doors to the inn.
Dummy: I still need to make a few more lanterns in case we need them later.

## Talk 8

Dummy: Hmm, I think I'll still need to make a few more Xiao Lanterns...
Traveler: About materials for the Xiao Lanterns...
Dummy: Oh right, you can just give the materials to me. I'll take it from here.

## Talk 9

Mr. Zhu: Very strange indeed... Still no guests.

## Talk 10

Zhenxiang: I appreciate your kind offer, but I'm afraid that I cannot abandon my post while I'm on duty.

## Talk 11

Mr. Zhu: Right this way, please. Everything's already been prepared, so please have a seat.
Traveler: Mr. Zhu, who are these two...
Mr. Zhu: Ah yes, I was just out attracting guests when I ran into these two.
Jianqiu: That's right, this lady is from Minghua Bank, and I'm one of the bank employees.
Jianqiu: The lady and I were just setting off on a distant journey at the start of the Lantern Rite. I'm afraid she feels a little homesick...
Jianqiu: So we decided to find a spot to watch the Xiao Lanterns, which is when we happened to meet Mr. Zhu.
Mr. Zhu: Yes, and it just so happens that we've just prepared new Xiao Lanterns for the inn. Hmm... was it Minghua Bank you said? Does that mean—
Mr. Zhu: Ahem, I shan't pry.
Mr. Zhu: You two must be exhausted from your journey. Please have a rest while we prepare some food for you.
Mr. Zhu: Traveler, could you lend us a hand again? We'll need to quickly prepare some food for our two guests.
Mr. Zhu: Please prepare a serving of Delicious Jewelry Soup. I'll be sure to compensate you accordingly once things are all settled.

## Talk 12

Mr. Zhu: Strange, very strange indeed. I wonder what the matter is...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Mr. Zhu: Hardly any guests came at all yesterday... How could that be? There should be loads of travelers for the festival...
Traveler: Maybe it's because hardly anyone ever passes through here...
Mr. Zhu: No, that can't be it... There must be something wrong with the way I'm trying to attract guests.
Mr. Zhu: Perhaps it'd be better if I attracted guests more directly...
Mr. Zhu: Traveler, could you please go around and attract some guests for me?
Mr. Zhu: You can mention that we have good food, nice rooms, and an excellent view for the Lantern Rite festival.
Mr. Zhu: I'll keep thinking if there are any other ways we can attract some guests...
Traveler: I doubt there'd be many people traveling outside during the Lantern Rite...

## Talk 13

Zhenxiang: Hello. Please wait while we perform a routine inspection.
Traveler: Would you like to stay at Mr. Zhu's inn?
Zhenxiang: Oh? Yes, I have in fact heard about Mr. Zhu's inn.
Zhenxiang: But I'm on duty now. I appreciate your kind offer, but I'm afraid I cannot just abandon my post.

## Talk 14

Uncle Liu: Hmm? What is it, youngster?
Traveler: Would you like to stay at Mr. Zhu's inn?
Uncle Liu: Oh, Mr. Zhu... Yes, I know the place.
Uncle Liu: But I'm afraid that his inn is simply too far from here. These old legs couldn't handle such a journey, sorry.

## Talk 15

Uncle Liu: Sorry, the inn is simply too far from here. These old legs couldn't handle such a journey.

## Talk 16

## Talk 18

Huachu: I'm sorry, it's just that I...
Jianqiu: Don't say that. Let's just enjoy watching the Xiao Lanterns while we still may...

## Talk 19

Jianqiu: This would actually be a very suitable place to release the Xiao Lantern. Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: You're welcome.
Jianqiu: I just hope... that her wish will come true.
Huachu: ...
Jianqiu: Thank you, Traveler. We should be on our way now.

## Talk 20

Mr. Zhu: So, is the food ready?
Traveler: It certainly is.
Mr. Zhu: Okay, great. These are all the dishes we needed. Thank you.
Mr. Zhu: Sorry to keep you waiting, hehe. Here's your food, please enjoy.
Jianqiu: #Thank you, Mr. Zhu. Also, this Traveler has gone to great lengths to help with everything. We'd be delighted if he could join us.
Traveler: Thanks.
Jianqiu: Hehe, judging from your appearance, you must also be a traveler on some distant journey. The festival makes for a fitting time for people to come together, share a meal, and enjoy a lively time with one another.
Huachu: Yes. In fact, would you also care to join us, Mr. Zhu?
Mr. Zhu: Oh, uh... Yes, I—I'd be delighted.

## Talk 21

Dummy: We still need to make a few Xiao Lanterns, but we're missing *two Lantern Fibers* and *two Wick Materials*. The boss says that he'll think of something, though...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Jianqiu: Traveler, I'm sorry to trouble you, but... Would you be willing to escort us up the mountain to release the Xiao Lantern?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Jianqiu: My apologies. I'm afraid we cannot return to the city at this time because of... certain matters.
Jianqiu: As such, we'll require your protection on the mountain. We can leave whenever you're ready.
Jianqiu: After we release the Xiao Lantern, we'll continue on our way.
Traveler: Why don't you return to the city?

### Additional Talk 2

Mr. Zhu: Ah, you're back. *sigh* It's been difficult to attract guests during the festival...
Mr. Zhu: Huh, what about the two guests that were here earlier? Have they left already?
Traveler: Yes, they've continued on their journey.
Mr. Zhu: Oh, I see... Leaving on a journey during the Lantern Rite mustn't be easy for them.
Mr. Zhu: Huh, now that you mention it... Regardless of whether they were heading towards or away from Liyue, don't you find it a little strange that they continued their journey without stopping for the night?
Mr. Zhu: When I met them earlier, it was clear from their expressions that they didn't know which way to go.
Mr. Zhu: They even jumped when I called after them, and there was something a bit off about their attire as well...
Mr. Zhu: Oh, forget about it... Here's the compensation I'd promised you earlier.
Mr. Zhu: Thanks for all your help. I'll get back to matters at the inn now.
