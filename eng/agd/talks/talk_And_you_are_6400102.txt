Traveler: And you are...
Nayab: If we're talking careers, I'm a matra of the Akademiya. You don't have to be nervous. It's not my working hours now.
Nayab: Under the strict supervision of the General Mahamatra, the spreading of banned knowledge and academic corruption in the Akademiya has decreased significantly. Thanks to Lord Cyno, us subordinates' vacations have also become more frequent.
Nayab: Many students often have meals together in this caf√©, but most of their conversations are just regular chats.
Nayab: Although the matra are in charge of many things, they are not responsible for collecting students' evaluations and opinions about their mentors.
Nayab: So right now, I am just an ordinary person of Sumeru who is enjoying coffee while studying card strategies.
