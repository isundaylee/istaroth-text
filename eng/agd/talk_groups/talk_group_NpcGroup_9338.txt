Ei: It's not often that I have the chance to take a rest before the battle is truly over.
Ei: I keep asking myself, "Can I really afford to take a rest yet?" And if there are still monsters that have not yet been vanquished, the answer is no â€” I cannot stop now.
Ei: ...You'd like to join me in a moment of meditation? Oh, alright. Close your eyes. Now, join me in turning your gaze inward, to the deepest part of your being...

Ei: I know you are a formidable warrior. But we must not underestimate the monsters in this domain. They seem to come in endless waves.
Ei: Nor should you be afraid. I am here to answer your call, and I will stay by your side until every mystery here has been uncovered.
Ei: With this blade, I shall slay any foe that comes our way.

Ei: Will you join me in a game of karuta? It is a fine way to spend leisure time. It will help us both relax, while keeping me sharp and focused.
Ei: The only thing is... It is customary for the winner to be awarded with confectionery, but I do not know whether it can be brought in here...
Ei: Hmm, in that case... We can celebrate the victor at the Sacred Sakura some other time. Now, are you ready to be humbled?
