# Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal

Specialized refinement material for "Ultimate Overlord's Mega Magic Sword."
Can gather many wishes (including super cool cardboard ones) and put them together, forming an ultimate super-duper mysterious power.
Though you can buy a toy version in Damoville Purveyor that looks similar (okay, basically exactly the same), in reality, there is (probably) a qualitative difference between the two, so definitely don't mix them up!
