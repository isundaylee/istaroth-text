# Iron Ingot Meets Ziwei


## Talk 1

Iron Ingot: The Mysterious Adeptus of the Highest Heaven Soaring Across the Skies. It's so beautiful...
Traveler: Are you star gazing?
Iron Ingot: Yes... and no. It's the Lantern Rite, after all. It only seems fitting to look upon such an elegant sight during these festive times.
Iron Ingot: I've even been learning how to write poetry, too. The other guys tell me that girls these days are really into that sort of thing.
Iron Ingot: Hah, I'm sure Ziwei will...
Traveler: Learning poetry?
Iron Ingot: Uh — ahem, well, I've heard a lot of constellation names from Ziwei. *sigh* They all sound so beautiful...
Iron Ingot: So you see, I have to thank her somehow!
Iron Ingot: I was thinking that I should write a poem on a Xiao Lantern and find a place to release it together with Ziwei... We'll eat snacks and sing songs...
Iron Ingot: If this doesn't get the job done, nothing will!
Traveler: Get the job... done?
Iron Ingot: Ahem, I mean... This will do the job of helping us enjoy the festival more... Yeah, that's it!
Iron Ingot: Anyway, I want to find a quiet, scenic spot away from other pedestrians.
Iron Ingot: I started asking around and I've found two potential spots so far. Here, have a look.
Iron Ingot: The other guys told me that they've released Xiao Lanterns at these spots before...
Iron Ingot: But I still need to come up with a poem... and I'm afraid running around to check the spots will just douse my creativity.
Iron Ingot: Could you help me go check out those two spots?
Traveler: Sure.
Iron Ingot: Thanks for your help, I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Ziwei?

## Talk 2

Iron Ingot: "Ziwei stumbles across an iron ingot" ...No, no, that won't do. That's laying it on a bit thick...
Iron Ingot: Oh, when did you get here? Did you check those two spots?
Traveler: We sure did.
Iron Ingot: That didn't take you long. Now let me have a look...
Iron Ingot: Alright, let me have a look here... Hmm, the surrounding scenery at this spot is very unique, whereas the other spot is centered in a more picturesque landscape. It reminds me of the line, "Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no..." Uh, I forget what's after that...
Iron Ingot: Anyway, never mind... Still, these spots look bright and impressive.
Iron Ingot: I've got it! I know which one to pick... But, there's still something I'd like to ask of you, Traveler.
Iron Ingot: My friends told me that when you go to see someone, it's best to bring something to eat. What do you think I should prepare when I go to see Ziwei?
Traveler: Grilled Tiger Fish.
Iron Ingot: Grilled Tiger Fish, hmm... Don't you think that'd be a little too oily? Maybe something a little more light and refined, like Almond Tofu...
Iron Ingot: Yeah, Almond Tofu! That would be perfect!
Iron Ingot: Traveler, could you please help me prepare a serving of Almond Tofu? In the meantime, I'll keep working on my poem here. Now how should this next line go...
Iron Ingot: "And countless sparks fly"... Oh, that's a good line!
Traveler: Almond Tofu.

## Talk 3

Iron Ingot: Oh, when did you get back? Did you prepare the Almond Tofu?
Traveler: Yep, it's ready.
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Iron Ingot: Ah, okay. Don't worry, I can keep working on my poem in the meantime...

## Talk 4

Iron Ingot: Huh? Is it me... Or does this tofu smell funny?
Iron Ingot: I could never give this to Ziwei. Maybe you could help get another one?

## Talk 5

Iron Ingot: Well, I guess this will do for now. Let's go find Ziwei!

## Talk 6

Iron Ingot: This looks great! Everything's ready, all we need to do now is find Ziwei!

## Talk 7

Ziwei: From this angle... The constellation looks just like a dog. Now, I must think of a suitable name...
Ziwei: Oh, it's you, Iron Ingot. What are you doing here?
Iron Ingot: Umm, well you see... Uh, I—I was just strolling outside the city, and I happened to come across a very scenic spot...
Ziwei: A nice spot? You mean for star gazing?
Iron Ingot: Y—Yes, that's it! A nice spot for star gazing. It'd also be a great place to release Xiao Lanterns... See? I've already prepared one for us.
Iron Ingot: And look, I've even written a p—poem on it...
Ziwei: "Sparks fly where shovel and meteorite meet."
Ziwei: Yes... Well, even though I don't really know what your wish is, the poem is quite interesting.
Ziwei: But you shouldn't let others see your wish before releasing the Xiao Lantern, otherwise it will never come true.
Ziwei: And so, what exactly do you need from me?
Iron Ingot: Well, I...
Traveler: He found a very suitable spot for releasing a Xiao Lantern.
Ziwei: Releasing a Xiao Lantern? Oh, I'm sorry... I was actually hoping to go somewhere away from all the lanterns.
Ziwei: The Xiao Lanterns are so bright that they obstruct my view of the stars. I think I'll be going as far as I can away from the festivities.
Ziwei: Thanks for the kind offer, but I should get going. Happy Lantern Rite.
Iron Ingot: O—Oh...
Traveler: And there she goes...
Iron Ingot: I... I'm fine. Clearly, I must have made my poem too abstract. Ziwei didn't get it at all.
Iron Ingot: Don't worry, I won't let it get to me. She'll finally understand my meaning one day.
Iron Ingot: Thanks for your help anyway, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Iron Ingot: Oh, I guess I should at least release this Xiao Lantern now...
Traveler: Keep your chin up.
Traveler: So if you'd like to release a lantern tonight, you can go together with him.
