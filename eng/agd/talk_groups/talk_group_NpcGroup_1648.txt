Traveler: So, about the racket in the library...
Wyratt: I see... I guess we'll just have to use "that method."
Wyratt: Miss Lisa mentioned in the past that there will be consequences for breaking the library rules...

Paimon: Making dog-ears on pages, stuffing roses into books, putting them onto shelves the wrong way... These are definitely violations of the library rules.
Paimon: Well, let's go pass Lisa's message on to those people in the library who aren't reading the way they should.
