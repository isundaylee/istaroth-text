Traveler: About the Tri-Commission...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Hmm, actually, as an outsider, what do you think of the way the Tri-Commission is running at the moment?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: ...You know what, never mind. I don't think even they know what's going on themselves, let alone you.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Kanjou Commission's been buried in mountains of old accounts that need settling ever since their dealings with the outlanders were exposed. I've got no clue whether they'll make it out of this one or not.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Tenryou Commission doesn't bear mentioning. The Kujou Clan's situation is very worrying. Who knows what Her Excellency's final judgment will be...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Yashiro Commission on the other hand seems to have come out of these twists and turns even better than before, the whole business with one of their retainers defecting during the Vision Hunt Decree notwithstanding.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: *sigh* Whatever the case, I just hope they can fix this mess. I doubt Her Excellency will have much mercy otherwise.
