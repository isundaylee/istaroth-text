Traveler: All in good health, thanks to you.
Harjo: Oho, such confidence! Then do you think you're in shape to take on one of Fontaine's meka?
Harjo: I used to hear tales about mechanical warriors from those in Natlan who had traveled to Fontaine. They sounded so fantastical that I didn't know what to believe.
Harjo: But excitement always overcame doubt. I had a feeling I'd make my way here one day to test my skills against them.
Harjo: And now, that day has come!
Harjo: I heard the strongest Gardemeks can be found in a place called the Fortress of Meropide. You've gotta find a way to get there and check them out, let me tell you.

Traveler: Please don't do anything illegal.
Harjo: Ahaha, of course not! But why would you suddenly say something like that?
Harjo: ...Huh? What's that? It's a place of exile for criminals? But that would make it... a prison!
Harjo: No wonder the Gestionnaire who told me about it looked so serious.
Harjo: Don't worry about me. I may seem casual and carefree, but in matters of honor, I am always serious.
Harjo: Even when it comes to disputes, there's always a line to be drawn between honor and disgrace. Starting a conflict for the wrong reasons is certain to backfire.
