# Missing title (3182059055)


## Talk 1

Gendou Ringo: You want a fortune slip?
Paimon: Geez, she's so cold.
Traveler: Yes, I'd like one...
Gendou Ringo: Got it. Here's how it goes. First, shake this... thing over here.
Traveler: Isn't it called a Fortune Slip Box?
Gendou Ringo: Yes. A Bamboo Slip will drop out from it. Give it to me, and I'll give you a matching strip of paper.
Traveler: I'm pretty sure they say it's a Fortune Slip...
Gendou Ringo: Whatever.
Paimon: Paimon's got a question! If... What do we do if we get one that means bad luck?
Gendou Ringo: It's fate. You got a problem with that? Huh?
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Isn't there that shelf-like thing outside we can use to...
Gendou Ringo: Tsk.
Paimon: Did she seriously just say "tsk"?
Gendou Ringo: Let me see... Oh right, so it's like this. "Tie the inauspicious slip onto the Fortune Slip Hanger to change ill fortune to good"...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, right! If you get a slip with ill fortune, just tie it to that shelf, that'll do.
Gendou Ringo: Huh, what a bunch of... No, sorry. We at the Grand Narukami Shrine are most gentle indeed. Even if you should draw a slip with bad luck, you shall have a chance to turn it around.
Paimon: Something about this doesn't seem right...
Paimon: #Let's go draw a slip, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let Paimon see, let Paimon see.
Paimon: Wow! It says very auspicious. Yeah!
Paimon: Looks like today's Paimon's lucky day!
Traveler: Yours?
Paimon: That's right! Your fortune is Paimon's fortune! And vice versa, Paimon's fortune is also your fortune.
Paimon: When Paimon eats good food, that's good fortune. So, for the sake of your fortune, please give Paimon some good food.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Let Paimon see, let Paimon see.
Paimon: Yeah, not bad.
Paimon: Being with Paimon will certainly bring you good fortune!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Let Paimon see, let Paimon see.
Paimon: Eh, it's inauspicious!
Paimon: Paimon remembers this scenario! It said... to "tie the inauspicious slip onto the Fortune Slip Hanger."
Paimon: "And then treat Paimon to some good food. That will help change the bad luck into good!"
Traveler: Is that so?
Paimon: Of course! Are you questioning the wisdom of the ancients?
Paimon: The wisdom of the ancients is incredible! Anyway, let's find the Fortune Slip Hanger first!

## Talk 5

Gendou Ringo: Give me that bamboo slip.
Traveler: R—Right.
Paimon: This shrine really seems to lack the whole divine affection thing, huh...
Gendou Ringo: Here.
Paimon: Let's see how our luck's going...
Gendou Ringo: Ah, yes. You can only draw one fortune slip each day. Please remember that.
Gendou Ringo: It's too tiring otherwise... Wait, no. If not, you won't be able to use the Fortune Slip Hanger to... No, that's not right either. What was I supposed to say?
Gendou Ringo: "Fortune slips are the manifestation of our archon's will. It is our place as mortals to respect it and do all we can."
Gendou Ringo: See? Elegantly put. So please remember, you can only draw one fortune slip each day.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Eh? What's this? Looks like someone's notes. Let Paimon see...
Paimon: "... Shuumatsu... Fatui... plot against..."
Paimon: What is this? It's a mess, and it's all covered in stains. Paimon can't really read it.
Traveler: Could be a clue to some treasure.
Paimon: That makes sense! Let Paimon have another look.
Paimon: "... when deciphering the slip, the secret code... "
Traveler: Deciphering the slip?
Paimon: Let Paimon see! "...The first half is 'In the middle of a hazy night'... "
Paimon: It cuts off here, and Paimon can't tell what the second half is.
Paimon: But since it used a secret code, there must be some kind of secret to be found, right?
Paimon: Either way, this seems important. Next time we decipher our fortune slip, let's try to match the secret codes, shall we?
Traveler: Secret code?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ms. Gendou's attitude is the same as ever, huh... Anyway, let's check the slip's contents.
Paimon: Huh? This is...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it. This must refer to some bad guy who needs defeating!
Paimon: Yeah, that's gotta be it. So, Ms. Gendou, you're a secret agent who's using this method to communicate and wipe out those who try to harm Inazuma, right?
Gendou Ringo: You talk too much.
Paimon: Welp! S-sorry! Please don't sic the "Shuumatsu" on us!
Gendou Ringo: Leave now.
Paimon: We're leaving right now! Let's go to the place shown in the picture and see if we can find our target!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh? Where did Ms. Gendou go?
Traveler: Well, this is slightly distressing...
Paimon: Right? What if she doesn't return? How will Paimon know today's fortune?
Paimon: Huh? There's a slip here. Let Paimon have a look...
Traveler: We shouldn't...
Paimon: It doesn't matter! It could be a clue!
Paimon: Huh? This is...
Paimon: Seems like we're to go to... this place and receive further instructions...?
Paimon: Let's go find out!

## Talk 9

Paimon: This is the place, right?
Paimon: There's nothing special here...
Gendou Ringo: You showed up indeed, just as I expected.

## Talk 10

Gendou Ringo: Who are you, exactly, and what are your intentions?
Paimon: That's our line! What were you doing, Ms. Gendou, attacking us like that?
Gendou Ringo: How rude. Answer my question.
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}.
Gendou Ringo: Oh, I know your names, alright. Now, tell me. Where did you hear the secret code from?
Traveler: P—Paimon told me...
Paimon: Wait, what are you saying!? Just tell Ms. Gendou what happened already! Can't you see the super scary look in her eyes?
Gendou Ringo: I see. So you chanced upon those notes. In that case, Momoka must be...
Traveler: Who's Momoka?
Gendou Ringo: She was the one who penned those notes, and she was a colleague of mine. Unfortunately, she will no longer be able to continue serving Inazuma. A true shame...
Gendou Ringo: I'm sure you must have many questions. I suppose it couldn't hurt to answer them.
Gendou Ringo: Momoka and I are both ninja of the Shuumatsuban. Our task is to rid Inazuma of external threats, and these "strips of paper" are one of the ways in which we communicate our missions.
Gendou Ringo: As a result, we have also endured a lot of resentment and peril. For example, from those dangerous people who have infiltrated our nation...
Traveler: Mondstadters.
Paimon: What do you mean Mondstadters!
Gendou Ringo: We use secret codes to identify our comrades.
Gendou Ringo: However, each person's secret code is unique. It seems that Momoka deliberately left her secret code behind in a bid to inform us of the situation.
Gendou Ringo: ...She was attempting to lure the enemy who would want to use that secret code out.
Traveler: So...
Paimon: So you found out immediately, didn't you, Ms. Gendou?
Gendou Ringo: Of course. That's why I had to ascertain the situation. But it truly was strange. I couldn't work it out.
Gendou Ringo: If you really were Snezhnayan spies, then why would you go and complete the missions as ordered without reporting the matter back to the Fatui?
Gendou Ringo: ...As such, I believe your story about the abandoned camp.
Gendou Ringo: From your actions, I can see that while you only matched the secret code up out of curiosity at first, you are friends and not foes of Inazuma.
Paimon: Well, that's our name cleared — but Paimon's still a little peeved that you've just taken us for free labor this whole time, Ms. Gendou!
Traveler: ...Was that person really you though?
Gendou Ringo: Hmph, I see you've noticed. Yes, the Gendou who gave you missions afterwards is an impostor.
Paimon: What?
Gendou Ringo: As I was tailing you, I was set upon by some Fatui spies.
Gendou Ringo: I do know a thing or two about ninja arts myself, so I faked my death to fool them.
Gendou Ringo: Afterward, they simply had one of their own people disguise themselves as me and replace me.
Traveler: No wonder she felt so off.
Paimon: Eh? So does that mean that the kind-hearted Ms. Gendou was a fake?
Gendou Ringo: "Kind-hearted"? Hmph, I suppose she's been quite popular, huh?
Gendou Ringo: Well, either way, they must've assumed that you were a formal member of the Shuumatsuban, and tried to use you to infiltrate our organization.
Gendou Ringo: This proved to be a good opportunity for me. While that impostor was out, I used methods of my own to bring you here.
Gendou Ringo: Listen well. I shall now give you a choice.
Gendou Ringo: Work for us as an external member. They do not yet know that I live, so the advantage is ours at present.
Traveler: What if I refuse?
Gendou Ringo: You could certainly try.
Paimon: #Whatever the case might be, {NICKNAME}, the Fatui are our enemies too! Why don't we work together?
Gendou Ringo: A wise choice. The supplies in this safe house are yours to use as you please.
Gendou Ringo: Well then. I will be in touch in the event that something new comes up.
Gendou Ringo: May our cooperation be fruitful. Farewell.
Traveler: A reasonable suggestion.
Traveler: Alright.
Traveler: No wonder she called the Fortune Slip by its proper name.
Traveler: Fatui.
Gendou Ringo: That's right.
Traveler: Please listen to me. This is how it happened...
Paimon: We found an abandoned camp on a hill...
