# Missing title (764352559)

Paimon: Strange... The golden patterns flew right over, just as before, but the Inscription hasn't appeared beneath this pillar... Why's that?
Titu: That indicates that not only has the Inscription been squeezed out, but it's also become fragmented... This is bad. We need to find any scattered bits, and fast.
Paimon: So, where do we find them?
Titu: ...I don't know either.
Paimon: Huh...
Titu: They should still be held down by some power despite being scattered, so my guess is that they're nearby. Maybe we just need to look around...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr, rawr!
Paimon: Hmm? You wanna go over? We're doing something important right now — we'll play with you later, alright?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Mrrraa... Rawr! Rawr!
Traveler: Do you mean that the Inscription is over there?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: Oh wow! I've heard that even now, there are still Saurians who can sense an Inscription's power, but I always thought it was hearsay — could it be true?
Titu: #I suppose you really are no ordinary Tepetlisaurus, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Paimon: So you can do that too, huh? ...Hmph! You've got some way to go before you can be as good a guide as Paimon.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hmm?
Traveler: Paimon's jealous.
Paimon: Says who? Paimon's way more broad-minded than she looks! That was just her way of praising him!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err... Err?
Paimon: *sigh* The little guy didn't catch that at all. Bah, if only he was a little smarter...
Traveler: I'm sure he'll understand someday...
Titu: Precisely. Those in the tribe responsible for Saurian care always say that it takes time to truly establish a rapport with them.
Titu: The secret to success is as follows — exercise patience, and constantly communicate. Whether humans wish to understand Saurians, or Saurians humans, they both need... lots and lots of time.
Paimon: #True... Just like Paimon didn't get what {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} was trying to tell us just now either.
Paimon: #Sorry, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrraa, Rawr!
Paimon: You're quick to reply though, Paimon'll give you that!
Paimon: Alright, we'll follow you and see if we can find any golden patterns.
Traveler: See, Paimon's praising you!
Paimon: Well, that's true, but don't let it go to your head now...
