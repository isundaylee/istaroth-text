What have you done!?
Calm down
Don't you have an easy way to figure this out?
You were only designated as Number 36?
What a shame
From what I can see, your talents merit a smaller number
Putting aside the validity of the data
It is meaningless to judge individuals based solely on their Jnana Energy
What you said to Ilyas
Has now become a memory shared by all members of the Hive...
I see it now
You've channeled and amplified their selfish desires!
You're trying to destroy my Hive from the inside out!
Human minds are not infinitely pliable
And your Hive has stretched many of them to their limit
Once your authority as Overmind starts to wane
It won't be long before your subjects snap back
"Is it worth living here like a machine, being a tool for the rest of my life?"
As soon as one person begins to have these thoughts
Selfishness, doubt, and fear will propagate thanks to the web of consciousness that you built
At this stage, your so-called Hive has already fallen
It's not over yet!
I am the Overmind!
There has to be a way...
It's too late
Once the desires of the Hive accumulate...
Beyond a certain threshold, they will kill their king
I wouldn't have suffered such a disgraceful defeat
If I was the Overmind...
My number shouldn't be so far down in the list!
Siraj is a liar!
This isn't what we agreed to...
I should be the one in your position!
