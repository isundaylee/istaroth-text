Echoing Conch: "Diluc, you're a man who knows his own mind. So, help me decide — is it seabird-hunting time or seashell-collecting time?"
Echoing Conch: "...What is that supposed to mean?"
Echoing Conch: "Come now, Diluc, be nice! Do you really want to stay here and do nothing at all? We might as well find a way to pass the time. I simply thought collecting seashells might be fun. It was last time — although, we were much younger then."
Echoing Conch: "I didn't know you still remembered anything from back then... Huh."
