# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello.
Linlang: Hello, I am Linlang, the owner of this store.
Linlang: Do you see anything you like?
Linlang: Please take as long as you need; there is plenty to see and no rush to choose.
Traveler: Anything you would recommend?
Linlang: Take a look at this piece of flint. It is a shard from the tip of the Geo Lord's polearm. Notice the ancient symbols written on there, with the masterful brushwork following the lines that naturally appear on the material's surface.
Linlang: Or this fossilized wood. It is a runner from a primordial tree, and legend says that this tree was so gigantic its root system spread throughout the entire world.
Linlang: You might also consider this bottle, which contains the venomous blood of an evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land. Due to exposure to the air, the blood has now dried and turned to dust...
Linlang: ...However, the venom is so strong that one pinch of it would suffice to take out all the strongest men in a village. Heh.
Linlang: Beyond these, there are many other rarities and oddities in store, too. Feel free to peruse them at your leisure.
Traveler: Sounds dubious to me...
Linlang: Well, the value of an antique is whatever you make of it.
Linlang: There is a saying: "An antique's credibility is born of its owner's credulity." It is one's belief in an item as a historical relic that imbues it with meaning.
Linlang: By contrast, when you believe that an antique is fake, your denial of the item's value does not change the item in any way.
Linlang: The fact is, the items themselves hold no value for my customers. It is the stories attached to the items that hold the real value.
Linlang: There's another saying, how does it go... "As long as you have a good story to tell, you'll always find a way forward..." The same principle applies to antiques.
