Traveler: Are you alright?
Dip Yeuk: How exhausting... but I'll grit my teeth and keep training!
Dip Yeuk: Just like Gaming says, one second on stage is the result of ten years of off-stage training.
Dip Yeuk: If I don't train hard, my punches will hit like wet noodles and I might trip over my own spear or stab myself with my sword in battle. It'll be too late for regrets then!
