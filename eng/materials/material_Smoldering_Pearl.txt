# Smoldering Pearl

A crystallization of a Pyro Hypostasis that constantly emits heat.
Even the burning flames shall one day grow cold, and even the ashen firewood can will itself back into a raging blaze. It must then be the will of the world that Pyro Hypostases should constantly cool down and heat up, much like the universe teems with endless life... until the fated darkness shall one day descend and bring it all to naught.
