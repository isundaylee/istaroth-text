# Flashing Maintenance Mek Bait

A unique type of Trap said to utilize technology developed by the Fontaine Research Institute. Equipped with a metal protective cage and hook bars, the device contains a light made from Marcotte extract.
When tossed in water, the light flashes at a certain frequency to attract nearby Maintenance Meks, which are often referred to as "Water Maintenance Fish" or "Iron Fish." Maintenance Meks have powerful bites, but they are only able to bite onto the specially made external bars which hook them firmly in place. The contraption is essentially a special kind of bait designed to catch valuable "Iron Fishes."

Suitable for catching Maintenance Meks.
