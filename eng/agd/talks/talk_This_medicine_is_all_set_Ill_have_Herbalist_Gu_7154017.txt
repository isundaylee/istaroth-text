Baizhu: This medicine is all set... I'll have Herbalist Gui deliver it in a bit.
Traveler: Baizhu, this gift envelope is for you.
Baizhu: That's very considerate, thank you. How have you been feeling the past few days?
Traveler: All good, thanks to your miraculous skills.
Baizhu: There was nothing miraculous about it — simple medical treatment, nothing more.
Baizhu: Your constitution is strong. You were covered in fetor, but your cardiovascular system remained unaffected.
Baizhu: The real miracle is the fact that you walked away from the array with no lasting damage... *cough* *cough*
Traveler: Are you okay? Please have some water.
Baizhu: *cough*... *cough*... Don't worry, it's just exhaustion — I stayed up all night writing prescriptions.
Baizhu (Changsheng): *sigh* Which is exactly why you need a break. Relax, or your body will pay the price.
Baizhu: Hehe, there's no need to worry. I know what I'm doing.
Baizhu: Come find me if you begin to feel unwell. I can provide you with some restorative medicine.
Baizhu: Never forget — even minor symptoms can be important warning signs.
Baizhu (Changsheng): How about taking your own advice? Staying up all night — you need some restorative medicine of your own.
Baizhu: It's alright, Changsheng. I know what I'm doing.
Traveler: Did you use Changsheng's secret art again?
Traveler: I'm feeling just fine!
Baizhu: That's good to hear. Standard medical texts offer little information on the treatment of fetor. I had to rely on ordinary methods.
Traveler: See you.
Baizhu: Take care! Now that the crisis is over, you should get some rest and enjoy the festivities.
