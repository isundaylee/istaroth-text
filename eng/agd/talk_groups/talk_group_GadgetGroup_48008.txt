Paimon: Excuse me, did you see an actor running away...
Paimon (Arnold): Of course! How ridiculous! How could he waste such a great opportunity?
Paimon (Arnold): If only it was me! I've always wanted to perform in a show, but I never got the chance...
Paimon: Wait, isn't this just perfect?
Traveler: They need to find someone to replace the guard who ran away.
Paimon (Arnold): Well... I've seen them rehearse, but I'm still not a real actor...
Paimon: But you are a real guard!
Paimon: The other guy suddenly disappeared just as he got to "I am the last line of defense!"
Traveler: And now no one is going to save the kingdom.
Paimon: We can't let that stand!
Paimon: As a guard, isn't it also your duty to protect the audience's wish to enjoy the play?
Paimon (Arnold): That's true... But...
Paimon: It's always been your dream to perform on a stage! People are waiting! There's no time to hesitate!
Paimon: #Let's bring him over, Traveler!
