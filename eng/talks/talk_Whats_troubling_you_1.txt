Traveler: What's troubling you?
Esteban: Well, judging cases is not under my purview, but having seen my fair share of trials, I can't help but think of how I should handle various dilemmas...

Esteban: Between infinite time and infinite Mora, which would I choose?
Esteban: ...Oh, sorry, I'm all over the place, aren't I? Heh, not that these issues have anything to do with me, either...
