Traveler: What are you doing here?
Fusilier: I... I don't want to go back to the Fontaine Research Institute. But you gotta have somewhere to stay, right?
Fusilier: I can't go beg for a place to stay in Lumidouce Harbor, and I don't want to stay at The Rusty Rudder. So... the Institute helped me get in touch with Chaussivert, who is letting me stay on his ship for a while.
Fusilier: It's only temporary. I'll be outta here as soon as I find somewhere proper to live.
