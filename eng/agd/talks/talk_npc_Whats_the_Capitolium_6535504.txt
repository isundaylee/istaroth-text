Traveler: What's the Capitolium?
Venier: Capitolium? Why, it's... it's... Wait. Where is it again?
Venier: Strange. Why did that word suddenly leave my lips? It's as if it was my hometown, where my family is.
Venier: *sigh* Alas, but I no longer have any family.
Venier: If this Capitolium is some dream world or the afterlife, may I reunite with them there!
