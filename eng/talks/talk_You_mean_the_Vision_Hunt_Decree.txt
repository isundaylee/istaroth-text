Traveler: You mean the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hasegawa: The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that doesn't really bother me anyway.
Hasegawa: After all, there aren't that many people with Visions. It's not affecting me much.
Hasegawa: As for how they'll go on after losing their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
