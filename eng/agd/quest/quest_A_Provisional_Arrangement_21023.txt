# A Provisional Arrangement


## Talk 1

Zhen Qiang: That should just about do it. What hard work.
Traveler: What's up with those stairs over there?
Zhen Qiang: The stairs? Oh, you want to go up to the inn?
Zhen Qiang: You've come at a bad time, there's two big holes on the way up. To prevent people from missing their step, the boss has had the whole stairway closed.
Zhen Qiang: The preparations for repairs have been made, but the stairs won't be fit for walking for a while.
Zhen Qiang: Don't worry. You can't use the stairs, but the elevator over there is just fine.
Zhen Qiang: It can move cargo, so carrying people isn't a problem. If you're in a rush, how about using that instead?
Zhen Qiang: Oh yeah, and while you're at it, help me give this to the boss. It's a gift from a guest.
Traveler: Got it.
Zhen Qiang: Well, off you go, then. Remember to watch your footing. This inn is pretty high up, so falling off halfway is no joke!
Traveler: Why aren't you going up yourself?
Zhen Qiang: I need to stay down here to receive goods. There's lot of goods to receive, and I daren't make any mistakes.
Zhen Qiang: Alright, off you get. Watch your footing, now. This inn is pretty high up, and falling off halfway is no joke!

## Talk 2

Huai'an: We've got to repair those stairs quickly...
Traveler: You the innkeeper?
Huai'an: I am. What can I do for you?
Paimon: Some guy downstairs asked us to give this package to you.
Huai'an: Oh, this must be a package that a guest sent to me. Why didn't Zhen Qiang bring it up himself?
Huai'an: Still had goods to pick up, did he? Ha, I bet he was just too lazy to go up and down the elevator...
Huai'an: I'm really sorry. You're a guest of ours, and the stairs just had to be broken at this time. I'm finding a way to fix it as we speak.
Huai'an: And to think that we made you take the trouble to bring this package up for me. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.
Huai'an: This was originally for Zhen Qiang, but since he made you deliver the package for him, then the pay is yours by right.
Huai'an: Well then, I must be going to get the preparations for repairs going. Feel free to have a look around the inn. If there's anything you need, you can look for me at any time.

## Talk 3

Zhen Qiang: Why hasn't the cargo arrived yet...
