Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't an old friend. Did you come all this way just to see me?
Ying'er: Oh, I kid. But really, you do look so lovely each time we meet.
Ying'er: I heard about the ceremony. I meant to ask if things went well, were we to meet, but your mood tells me they did.
Ying'er: The danger is past, blessings lie ahead. Of course, things may not turn out smoothly throughout the year, but the best is yet to be, wouldn't you say?
