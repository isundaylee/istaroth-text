Traveler: How're the fish selling?
Chen the Sharp: Only about 1,800 sold. I'm proud to say my tiger fish is the most authentic in all of Liyue.
Chen the Sharp: I mean, at least half the city's barbeque fish is sourced from here, so if mine's no good, then nobody's is. Haha.
Chen the Sharp: As for how I can sell this much? Well that comes down to my Guhua bladework — descaling, gutting — a few quick swipes and it's all over.
Chen the Sharp: Yup, I'm from the Guhua Clan. Ten years training in seclusion. First thing I ate when I got out was this fish...
Chen the Sharp: Some say it's a waste of my talents being here, but can't say I agree.
Chen the Sharp: Our founder taught that the noblest martial virtue is to pursue that which benefits other people. I figure that as long as I do a good job, surely using my skills to fillet fish is something I can be proud of?
