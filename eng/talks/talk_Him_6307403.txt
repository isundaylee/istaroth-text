Traveler: "Him"?
Tingting: Yeah, he was the first person I met in Inazuma who was willing to help me.
Tingting: Because he saw that I was a lone outlander, he offered a lot of help to me while I was stuck in Ritou.
Tingting: Honestly, he's very kind and warm. I've become quite fond of him...
Tingting: But my worldwide sojourn has not ended yet. I can't just settle in Inazuma.
Tingting: Love is precious, but liberty is more so still... I really need to choose carefully.
