Brest: Ready to experience the joy of the Crococannon?
Traveler: More than ready, it's bubbleball time!
Brest: Great, have fun!
Traveler: About your old job...
Brest: As I said before, I was a naval artillery engineer. Not to brag, but I was one of the top three engineers on the team!
Paimon: Top three! Wow, you're amazing!
Brest: Hehe, though at that time our team only had three engineers.
Paimon: Wait, wouldn't that make you the worst?
Brest: Thâ€”Though my skills were pretty average, I was really lucky! I never had a single accident at work, and I even managed to avoid that huge explosion.
Brest: And when I was feeling utterly lost, I suddenly came across Monsieur Chatillon's blueprints.
Brest: It gave me the chance to not only create and spread happiness for other people, but also to run into the best of partners! I have to say, I really am fortunate!
Traveler: You really are fortunate.
Brest: Hehe, that's right! Since I'm this lucky, I believe that as long as I try my best, good things are bound to happen! Building a water park will be a cinch!
Traveler: You can't rely only on luck...
Brest: That's true, opening a water park isn't that easy. Funding, brand awareness, and a ton more... you can't drop the ball on any of them.
Brest: But I've already taken all that into consideration! I have faith that as long as the Crococannon can target the entertainment equipment market and let loose, everything will get better!
Brest: Naturally, the first and most important step is to promote the Crococannon! So, please have fun playing with it!
Traveler: Hope it goes well.
Paimon: Don't give up, Ms. Brest! Paimon believes in you!
Traveler: True, we really are the best.
Paimon: Hey, the point is her good luck!
Traveler: About Chatillon...
Paimon: Yeah, have you ever met Mr. Chatillon? How is he?
Brest: Regrettably, I never got the chance to meet him. After all, he passed away long before I was born...
Paimon: So Mr. Chatillon is already...
Brest: But I'm positive he must've lived a very happy life! After all, the words in his design documents are filled with hope and strength.
Brest: "In the past, I used cannons to fight external enemies. Now, I use them to destroy my sorrows. Peace is hard-won, and only by picking ourselves up and being happy do we honor the sacrifice of those who died..."
Brest: I was so inspired by his words that I immediately resolved to carry on his will, and restarted the "Crococannon" project.
Paimon: If Mr. Chatillon knew, he'd definitely be really proud of you!
Brest: Hehe, then for Monsieur Chatillon, for picking ourselves up and being happy, please, continue to operate the Crococannon, and have fun to your heart's content!
Traveler: We'll be back later.
Brest: No problem, I'll be around here for some time, so come back whenever you'd like!
