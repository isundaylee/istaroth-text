## Talk 1

Hanayama Kaoru: Hello, you're here. Do you see a lot of flowers in bloom? Aren't they pretty?
Traveler: Very pretty indeed.
Hanayama Kaoru: Hehe...that's for sure. I'm taking good care of them...
Hanayama Kaoru: By the way, can you do me a favor again? Now that the flowers are blooming so well, I was going to pick some flowers and make them into dried flowers, and send them along with letters to those who have yet to return to Tatarasuna.
Hanayama Kaoru: But... I don't know if it's because I had too little sleep, I just went out to pick a few flowers and I'm already so tired...
Hanayama Kaoru: Could you please help me pick some Sweet Flowers around here? Just three will do.
Traveler: Okay.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'll leave it up to you, then. I'm gonna take a breather...
Hanayama Kaoru: I just want the lovely fragrance of Sweet Flowers, other dried flowers will be included in the letter.
Hanayama Kaoru: I do believe that those who read this letter, surrounded by as pleasant a scent as it is, might at least be put in a better mood.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm counting on you, then. I'll take a short break here... After you pick the flowers, please bring them to me.
Traveler: Sweet Flowers seem to be everywhere...
Traveler: How long have you been planting?
Hanayama Kaoru: It's not that long, it's just... I just sleep a little less.

## Talk 2

Hanayama Kaoru: Have you gathered the Sweet Flowers?

## Talk 3

Hanayama Kaoru: Thank you. These Sweet Flowers should be enough. I'll go make the dried flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: Oh yes, I have a small present for you.
Hanayama Kaoru: Here, please take this dried flower. Although it is a bit withered, but it's a very valuable flower.
Traveler: Thank you.
Hanayama Kaoru: This is the first flower that bloomed in this sea of flowers. You helped me find the flower seeds, so I would like to give you this flower.
Hanayama Kaoru: Although it isn't anything very valuable, but still... thank you very much!
Traveler: I'm sure everyone will return.
Hanayama Kaoru: That's right! And that's why I need to plant more flowers so that when everyone comes back, they can see more flowers.
Traveler: Is there anything special about it?
Hanayama Kaoru: Of course there's something special about it! If there weren't, I wouldn't be giving it to you.
