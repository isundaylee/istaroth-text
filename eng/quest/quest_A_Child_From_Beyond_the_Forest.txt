# A Child From Beyond the Forest


## Talk 1

Traveler: (Let's uncover the "bad guy" in Vimara Village.)
Paimon: Hello, Alphonso!
Alphonso: #It's you guys. Traveler, what can I do for you? If you're looking for Rana, she's gone already.
Traveler: I want to talk to you about something...
Traveler: The "bad guy" hiding in Vimara Village.
Paimon: #After all, Rana only felt relaxed enough to go on a journey after Traveler promised her to deal with the bad guy.
Alphonso: I see. I understand now. Even though I don't have a clue, feel free to ask.
Traveler: First, let's recap what happened.
Paimon: So, who was the first missing child in Vimara Village?
Traveler: Sudabeh.
Paimon: Paimon remembers now, it's Sudabeh! She heard that there were herbs that could improve Amadhiah's sight and then sneaked into the woods.
Alphonso: That's right. We were worried when it happened and organized a search party.
Paimon: Paimon remembers now! Rana did say you organized the search party, and brought curry along too...
Traveler: Who told Sudabeh about the herbs?
Alphonso: ...I did. Sudabeh is a good kid who cares about Amadhiah. I recall mentioning it to her one day, but I also said...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon knows! She said you told her not to wander the forest alone. But she really cares about Amadhiah.
Alphonso: Any other questions?
Paimon: So, who was the second that went missing?
Traveler: Kavus.
Alphonso: Kavus... He said he was going to see a "friend" in the forest for his missing sister.
Paimon: Yeah, he did mention that! Do you know who Kavus' friend is, Alphonso?
Alphonso: ...
Alphonso: How would I know? I didn't find Kavus or his friend in the woods. As you know, he came back suddenly not remembering anything, just like Sudabeh.
Alphonso: Any other questions? No more children went missing after that.
Traveler: You got this, Paimon.
Paimon: Eh? Okay. Ahem... Well, Iotham was supposed to go missing next, but we and Rana ran into him and brought him back.
Traveler: How did it happen exactly?
Paimon: According to him, he heard Alphonso say there were huge mushrooms in a cave, so he wanted to get some for Rana.
Paimon: Then the Fatui followed him. He got scared, ran, and ended up trapped in a Withering Zone...
Alphonso: What, he went into a Withering Zone? How come he never told me that? That's unacceptable...!
Alphonso: Wait, if he was in the Withering Zone, how did he make it back? I understand that you can master the elements without a Vision, but still...
Paimon: (Uh, should we tell Alphonso about Arana?)
Traveler: (That should be fine.)
Paimon: You'll probably find this hard to believe, Alphonso, but there are fairies called Aranara in the forest. Iotham and the gang are friends with them, so the Aranara helped him.
Alphonso: Aranara...?
Paimon: But going after the kids... the Fatui are so despicable!
Alphonso: ...
Paimon: Hmm, we still don't know who the bad guy hiding in Vimara Village is...
Traveler: I think someone's watching us over there, Paimon.
Paimon: Where? Don't tell Paimon it's the bad guy we're looking for!
Traveler: Go check it out.
Paimon: Just Paimon alone?
Traveler: Yell if you're in trouble and I'll be right there.
Paimon: #Fine. Can't have Traveler do everything, anyway. Paimon's got this!
Black Screen Text: Paimon leaves excitedly.
Alphonso: Why bother?
Traveler: She'll be happier if she doesn't know.
Alphonso: Let's talk elsewhere.
Traveler: Some things are better left untold.
Traveler: You're small and can fly. Perfect for scouting.
Traveler: (He ought to know.)
Traveler: Sudabeh.
Paimon: No, no, didn't we just get done with Sudabeh? Paimon remembers it was her brother... Kavus, right?
Traveler: Iotham.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think that's right... We saved Iotham when he got lost. The second should be Sudabeh's big brother Kavus, right?
Traveler: Changchang.
Paimon: Changchang is in Liyue! What's this got to do with Changchang!?
Paimon: #...Are you okay, Traveler? Paimon remembers, the second kid was Sudabeh's big brother named Kavus, right?
Traveler: Kavus.
Alphonso: That should be Sudabeh.
Traveler: Iotham.
Paimon: No, Iotham was the last one that went missing.
Alphonso: It's Sudabeh.
Traveler: Timmie.
Paimon: Timmie? No, this has nothing to do with Timmie! Isn't he in Mondstadt?
Alphonso: Who's Timmie? Sudabeh should be the first one that went missing, right?

## Talk 2

Alphonso: When did you start suspecting me? Is it because Sudabeh and Iotham both mentioned me?
Traveler: You know my name.
Traveler: But Rana never told you my name.
Alphonso: Or maybe I have great hearing and overheard your name when Rana introduced you to Amadhiah.
Traveler: She never told Amadhiah that, either.
Alphonso: How careless of me. But besides the Fatui, the Adventurers' Guild also has an extensive network, so why don't you think I'm an adventurer?
Traveler: You seem to know me very well.
Traveler: You know I could control the elements without a Vision.
Alphonso: You're quite famous for your exploits. I don't have to be a Fatuus to know that. The bottom line is, you don't have anything concrete to prove that I'm with them.
Traveler: True, but that's not important.
Alphonso: You're right. Only the court demands proof, whereas a keen hound needs merely a scent to track the prey.
Alphonso: Of course, a clever hound would avoid the scent it shouldn't sniff, as to not run into a dragon at the trail's end. But, from your track record, you're not one to quit.
Traveler: You warned Rana not to patrol the forest...
Traveler: Because you didn't want her to interfere with the Fatui.
Alphonso: There's truth to that, but more importantly, I didn't want her to get hurt. The other Fatui aren't like me. They felt nothing toward her or Vimara Village.
Traveler: Who are you really, "Alphonso"?
Alphonso: The name given to me at birth is buried in freezing snow. The name granted me by the House of the Hearth is Trofin Snezhevich.
Traveler: Trofin Snezhevich of the House of the Hearth...
Alphonso: Your reaction tells me you probably encountered my "brothers and sisters" before.
Alphonso: Oh, don't tell me who you ran into or their status. Should they have revealed their identities to you...
Alphonso: Assuming they are still alive, then they would have betrayed Her Majesty already. If they're dead... I'd rather not know about it.
Alphonso: House of the Hearth is a shelter founded by "The Knave." Children raised in the House aren't related, but our bonds are tighter than blood.
Alphonso: After coming of age, those with potential undergo training to become agents, then infiltrate different locations to await orders. Unfortunately, I was deemed as "having potential."
Traveler: What is your order?
Alphonso: Capture Aranara. It's an order from "The Doctor," so that he can study the connections between Aranara, dreams, and The Withering.
Alphonso: Weaponizing dreams and The Withering seems to be one of his projects. Of course, I and every Fatuus you defeated are his "source of study."
Alphonso: We can't see Aranara, but Kavus, Sudabeh, and Iotham have what it takes to befriend them.
Traveler: So you let the Fatui abduct them to lure the Aranara out.
Alphonso: Correct, and the Aranara did show up. But their power truly was amazing, able to free those kids right under the nose of heavy security...
Alphonso: The Doctor has eyes on something truly incredible this time...
Alphonso: #I've got a question for you too, Traveler. Why would the Aranara erase the abduction and rescue from Kavus and Sudabeh's memory? To avoid being exposed?
Traveler: Arana doesn't want the children to remember anything like that at all.
Traveler: Arana doesn't want them to be violent when they grow up.
Alphonso: I see. So that Aranara is named Arana? That sounds a lot like Rana, a very pretty name. Please thank her on my behalf when you get a chance.
Traveler: Why would you thank her?
Alphonso: Vimara Village feels like a real home to me. Rana and Iotham feel like blood relatives I should've had. Kavus and Sudabeh are my precious siblings.
Alphonso: I hope they will grow up happy, healthy, righteous, and kind.
Alphonso: So, even though Arana has made my "job" that much more difficult, I appreciate what she did very much.
Alphonso: Oh, I finally get it. Just like you distracted Paimon, the children ought not to know the dirty deeds.
Alphonso: "Youngster, you should enjoy childhood, do what you like, see what you want to see. But also remember the dark days..."
Alphonso: That's the House's teachings. Because facing the darker side of life is inevitable for grown-ups, you need to be prepared as a child, so you can protect yourself and those you love.
Alphonso: Maybe what you're doing also makes sense. If I hadn't grown up in the House of the Hearth and became a spy in Vimara Village... If only I were born in Vimara Village.
Traveler: All this talk is meaningless.
Alphonso: I know. I just feel sorry. I wish I'd always been "Alphonso," not "Trofin Snezhevich." I wish I really was Iotham's big brother.
Alphonso: I want to be a good person, but I belong to an organization. I want to be family to Rana and the kids, but I've already got a "family" I can't turn my back on.
Alphonso: Many of my fellows have powers rivaling the Lord Harbingers and are not subject to any city or state. That's something even a free, honorary knight like you probably couldn't comprehend...
Traveler: I do comprehend.
Traveler: But what you did is inexcusable.
Alphonso: Well, that's all I've got to say. So, what are you going to do with me now?
Traveler: Don't come near Vimara Village or let me see you again.
Alphonso: I see. Got it. You won't see me again. I'm not returning to the Fatui, either, since I blew my mission and brought shame to my "siblings."
Alphonso: Iotham will probably be waiting for "Alphonso" to come back forever...
Traveler: Go now. Paimon should be here any minute.
Alphonso: Goodbye. No, farewell.
Traveler: (Battle) I changed my mind.
Alphonso: #I've foreseen the ending for the wicked, but I won't go down without a fight. You might be Traveler and I might not have a chance, but I'll still fight, because...
Alphonso: I'm the evil amidst good, the poison amidst the herbs, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the mercury in a golden chalice... My name is Snezhevich. Do your worst!
Traveler: (Battle) Arana and I both agreed...
Traveler: That the wicked must be punished.
Alphonso: #I've foreseen the ending for the wicked, but I won't go down without a fight. You might be Traveler and I might not have a chance, but I'll still fight, because...
Alphonso: I'm the evil amidst good, the poison amidst the herbs, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the mercury in a golden chalice... My name is Snezhevich. Do your worst!
Traveler: I don't comprehend.
Traveler: Nor will I even attempt to.
Traveler: You seem to know a lot about the Fatui.
Alphonso: They are notorious, enough for most people to know that. The bottom line is, you don't have anything concrete to prove that I'm with them.

## Talk 3

Alphonso: What should I do about my mission?

## Talk 4

Traveler: (Let's leave quietly.)
