# Little Chef on a Hunt


## Talk 1

Xiangling (???): Shh! Keep it down, I'm hunting...
Xiangling (???): I've always heard about the wide range of ingredients you can find in Mondstadt, and it looks like it's true!
Traveler: Are you a hunter?
Xiangling (???): No — I'm a chef! A chef on a mission to find rare and exotic ingredients from all corners of the world!
Xiangling: My name's Xiangling, I'm from Liyue Harbor. And you?
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Paimon: Hello, my name's Paimon!
Xiangling: Paimon!
Paimon: Why are you looking at me like that?
Xiangling: What an exotic creature, is it edible?
Traveler: We're friends.
Xiangling: What a bummer. Can't eat it if it's your friend.
Xiangling: You seem like good friends. I have a good friend too, called Guoba.
Paimon: Isn't that the name of a Liyue snack?
Xiangling: Hee-hee... Both the snack and my friend have a special place in my heart.
Xiangling: Anyway — can you do some hunting for me?
Xiangling: There's lots of game around here that would be amazing to cook with.
Xiangling: I can't catch anything to save my life and I don't want to miss out!
Paimon: Sounds like a bit of an ordeal...
Xiangling: Don't be like that... C'mon, I'll whip you up a tasty snack later!
Paimon: Ooh, you had me at tasty snack! Don't worry, we're the bestest hunters ever!
Traveler: Whose side are you on!?
Xiangling: Hee-hee, don't worry about it, your friend has already given me a response.
Xiangling: I don't care how it's done, so long as you bring me back some raw meat.
Xiangling: Great, then I'll leave you to it!
Traveler: You could always ask me first...
Traveler: Dig in.
Paimon: No! For the last time, Paimon is NOT EMERGENCY FOOD!
Traveler: Are you an adventurer?

## Talk 2

Xiangling: These boars look healthy, and active too. I bet their meat is superb quality!
Xiangling: Ugh, just thinking about it is making me hungry...

## Talk 3

Xiangling: Wowee! This is great! Some of it I'll shallow fry, some of it I'll deep fry with mushrooms— ooh, and I wonder how well it goes with Slime Condensate...
Traveler: She's off in her own world...
Paimon: Paimon thinks she's forgotten about us...
Xiangling: Uh, sorry! I got all excited thinking about new recipes.
Xiangling: As promised, a tasty snack! Go on, try it! And tell me what you think.
Paimon: Are we your food testers now?
Paimon: Oh gosh, this is... delicious!
Paimon: Can you tell us how to make it?
Xiangling: Hee-hee, sure! The only thing is I haven't written down the recipe yet, hmm...
Xiangling: I got it! I'll make another one now so you can watch. I'm sure you'll pick it up straight away.
Paimon: This seems pretty hard to make, it'll take more than that to learn how to make it. And we don't have a frying pan or any condiments.
Xiangling: Come on, it's simple!
Xiangling: We can fry on a slab of stone and cook using some boar fat. Build a stove from rocks, use dry grass for kindling, twigs for firewood...
Xiangling: Sweet flowers will do for sugar. As for salt, I found a load of rock salt in a cave the other day, there's still plenty left.
Traveler: Seems like she's done this a million times before...
Xiangling: Hee-hee, I just can't help myself when there's a chance to try something new. But I can't exactly bring my whole kitchen with me every time I leave the house either.
Xiangling: Give me a second while I get everything ready.
Allan: Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Allan: This is the boars' natural habitat, you can't hunt them here! You'll send them all running.
Allan: We hunters know better than to kill the chicken to get at the egg.
Xiangling: Oh! I get it.
Xiangling: The freshest, best-quality meat comes from free-range boars that grow up in the environment nature intended for them! If they all ran off...
Xiangling: ...It would be a major blow to gastronomy— no, to all mankind!
Traveler: That's, uh, one way of understanding it.
Xiangling: I'm sorry. I got excited and didn't think of the impact we'd have.
Allan: *sigh* You should apologize to Draff.
Allan: As our leader, he always stresses the importance of respecting the rules of the hunt. I'm afraid he is very upset right now.
Traveler: What are we going to do?
Xiangling: I made a mistake, and I should go and apologize.
Traveler: Let us come with you.
Xiangling: Hee-hee, thanks guys. I'll cook up some more tasty snacks for you once this is over.
Paimon: Okay. Don't worry, Paimon'll remember even if you forget.
Paimon: Draff ought to be in Springvale. Let's go!
Traveler: I think the hunter is right.
Traveler: That's not even close to what he meant...
Traveler: I'm tired just listening to it!
Traveler: I want to try Slime Condensate!
Paimon: #Yay! Traveler has finally come around to my food preferences.
