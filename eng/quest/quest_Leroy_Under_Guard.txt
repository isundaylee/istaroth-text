# Leroy: Under Guard


## Talk 1

Knock (Door): You hear nothing within the house. No one speaks, and you hear no footsteps either.
Knock (Door): It's a bit strange how silent Benoit's household is. Almost as if the place is empty.

## Talk 2

Molli: Oh, you two, you're back!
Paimon: #Paimon's name's Paimon, and he's Traveler. Just call us by our names from now on!
Traveler: Did you come to see Benoit?
Molli: That's right, but I didn't get a chance to speak to him... *sigh* Looks like I won't be able to finish my essay at this rate.
Paimon: Your essay? Oh, right! You were doing good deeds because you had homework.
Molli: Hey, that's not true! I really do like Mr. Benoit. He's really... smooth! Yes, that's right, smooth.
Paimon: Pfft, what kind of descriptor is that? You mean he's personable and a good communicator, don't you?
Molli: Anyway, please, Ms. Paimon, could you help me, please? If you don't, my essay's toast!
Molli: My tutor said that my essay about helping him to feed his cat was "Unpotentius and filled with genuine emotion from margin to margin," and she wanted me to write another.
Paimon: What? "Unpotentius"? Don't you mean "Unpretentious"? Anyway, Paimon gets it. So that's why you needed to come back.
Molli: Well, it is my homework, sure, but I really do like Mr. Leroy. He wanted me to say hi to my parents for him, and so I did.
Molli: They were really upset when they heard his name though, and they didn't want me to come. I don't really know why...
Paimon: Well, if it's just for homework, it's easy, isn't it? You can just talk about how you fed the cat again!
Molli: But that would only be one line! That's too little, no way.
Traveler: We'll go with you.
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. You can feed the cat, and we'll clean the entrance and the rear of the house.
Paimon: And when we're done, we'll knock on the door and talk to Benoit. That'll give you enough content to write about, right?
Molli: That's right, we can do that! You're so smart, Ms. Paimon. Let me go feed the cat right now!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Will this place do? C'mon, tell Paimon what's on your mind.

## Talk 4

Traveler: There's something off about that couple.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too. One of them talks a whole bunch, and the other barely says a word.
Traveler: The timing of their appearance was too convenient to be a coincidence.
Paimon: You mean to say that they showed up just as Benoit was thinking about hiring some hourly help, right?
Paimon: Euphrasie said that he was still hiring half a year ago, but in that time...
Traveler: This couple became his children.
Paimon: You're right. Everything's just too deliberate... There's definitely something going on with this couple!

## Talk 5

Traveler: There's something fishy about their relationship with Benoit.
Paimon: When we first met them a few days back, things still seemed fine, but there's something... awkward about the way they spoke today.
Traveler: He's being coerced by his son-in-law.
Paimon: Are you talking about how that son-in-law guy gave him a look and made him go inside after he'd only said one or two things?
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon kinda gets where that confused feeling was coming from.
Traveler: Benoit's daughter is coercing him.
Paimon: Well, Paimon didn't quite think that far, but the way she spoke sure did give Paimon goosebumps...

## Talk 6

Molli: #Ms. Paimon, Mr. Traveler, I've fed the cat.
Paimon: Nice! Okay, let's go see Mr. Leroy.
Molli: I'm worried, though. Maybe he won't come out? When I've come by to see him lately, he hasn't even spoken to me.
Molli: Before you arrived, I went and knocked, but just as he came out, that scary son-in-law of his came and dragged him back inside.
Molli: He then gave me some sweets and told me to go back to my parents. Then he shut the door.
Paimon: Geez. Benoit's such a chill guy, so why are his family members such a chilly bunch?
Molli: Mr. Leroy's son-in-law said that Mr. Leroy was ill and couldn't see me, but I thought he looked fine, so why couldn't he speak to us?
Molli: Honestly, I'm more worried about Mr. Leroy than I am about my essay.
Molli: He must feel terrible if he's ill. Mama told me that sick people need our care and concern.
Molli: So, could you come with me to ask that son-in-law what sort of illness Mr. Leroy has?
Molli: Maybe he ate too much cake, or he slept without a blanket? I can ask my parents about what to do!
Traveler: Regardless, let's knock on the door first.
Molli: I know, I'm just... a bit scared of that scary son-in-law, because he's... well, scary. Could you help me speak to him?
Paimon: Don't be afraid, Molli. We've got this.
Traveler: Well, we made an agreement, didn't we?

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: Athos, the man you saw before, opens the door and walks out.
Athos: You again? What in the world do you want?
Paimon: Could we ask if Benoit's home? We heard he fell ill, so we're kinda worried about his health.
Athos: My father is home, but he's in no condition to be receiving guests.
Molli: Could we ask what he's come down with? I could ask my parents to help get him some medicine.
Athos: No need. We'll buy what medicines are needed ourselves — not that he has any lack of medicine, anyway.
Paimon: We're just concerned for his health. You don't have to be so cold...
Paimon: (Athos just doesn't want to let us see Benoit!)
Traveler: (This is past cold, he's downright frigid...)
Athos: You concern yourself too much with business that is not your own. Very well. Was there anything else? If not, I'll be heading back.
Traveler: Wait.
Athos: What is it?
Traveler: Is Benoit really ill?
Athos: Of course he is. Very seriously, in fact. Morticia and I will think of something, though. There's no need for you — or anyone else, for that matter — to worry.
Morticia: Athos, what's that disturbance outside?
Athos: Nothing, Morticia, just a few kids saying that they want to see Dad.
Morticia: ...
Morticia: You really do get along well with children, don't you, Dad?
Morticia: Well, since these kids want to see you, why don't you go say hello to them?
Benoit Leroy: ...I'd like to... Can I?
Morticia: Of course you can, Dad. You're in charge.
Black Screen Text: The door opens and Benoit slowly emerges.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, it's you again, little ones. You're back.
Molli: How are you feeling, Mr. Leroy?
Benoit Leroy: Me? *cough* Oh, I'm not doing quite so fine, but not to worry, I'm doing my best to rest up.
Benoit Leroy: My daughter and son-in-law are taking very good care of me, so all is well — just run along home, if you would.
Athos: Are you sure you're alright, Dad? If it's too much for you, you should go back inside.
Black Screen Text: Benoit sees Athos give him a meaningful glance before silently going back indoors.
Athos: Well? So you've seen him for yourselves, then. My father really is unwell. Does that satisfy you? If there's nothing else, I'm going back inside.
Paimon: We...
Black Screen Text: Athos ignores all of you.
Molli: Well, at least we got to say a few words to Mr. Leroy. *sigh* I do hope he gets better soon.
Molli: Looks like I caused trouble for other people, Ms. Paimon. That... wasn't what I wanted...
Paimon: Don't think that way! You weren't any trouble at all! In fact, Paimon thinks that Athos guy is the real problem here!
Paimon: Hmph. The entire time, he was just...
Traveler: You should go home first, Molli.
Paimon: #Eh? Traveler, you...
Molli: True, I should head back as well. My parents don't like it when I come here, you know? They'd get mad if they knew I came today...
Molli: I don't know if we'll get to see Mr. Leroy again. I really wanted to tell him that his snacks were super tasty.
Molli: Well, could you help me tell him that if you see him — after he gets better, I mean?
Traveler: No problem.
Paimon: And Paimon's, too!
Molli: #Alright. Thank you, Mr. Traveler!
Molli: I've gotta go home now. See you!
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler? Paimon noticed you had "I've got something to say" written all over your face as soon as she looked at you!
Traveler: Let's talk over there.
Paimon: Sure, let's go talk somewhere else.
Traveler: Best not to speak too loudly right here.
Traveler: You have my word.
Traveler: Paimon and I will be heading back as well.
Traveler: Why are you trying to prevent us from seeing Benoit?
Athos: And why must I allow completely unrelated people to see my father? Like I said earlier, he's in no condition to see guests.
Traveler: (He sure turned down the temperature quickly...)

## Talk 8

Molli: #Mr. Traveler, could you do the knocking?

## Talk 9

Traveler: The way this couple deals with outsiders doesn't sit right with me.
Paimon: Exactly. They were nice enough when we first met them, but they sure turned rotten quickly.
Traveler: They were only friendly to us when their father was around.
Paimon: Hmm... Let Paimon think. That's true. The first time we met, it was right after Benoit went inside that his son-in-law told us not to come around again.
Traveler: They're faking it.
Paimon: But why would they pretend to be friendly in front of their dad? There's gotta be a reason for it...

## Talk 10

Traveler: Well, that's all I've got for now.
Paimon: #Um, Traveler... Do you think Benoit's in some kinda danger?
Traveler: Indeed.
Paimon: Ohhh, Paimon's got a bad feeling about this. Should we report it to the Maison Gardiennage?
Traveler: We've got no evidence.
Paimon: Hmm, that's true, that's true. But in the end, we're here to help him, right?
Paimon: Molli asked us to tell Benoit that his snacks were super tasty, and we gave her our word.
Traveler: And our word is our sacred bond.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows you always keep your promises! Well, you've got a good brain, too, so what's our next move?
Traveler: Let's do some investigating.
Paimon: Yeah, let's get to the bottom of this case! Hmm... What should we investigate, specifically?
Traveler: The identity of the couple.
Paimon: #That's right! Look out, world — Ace Detectives Paimon and Traveler are going to expose the truth!
Traveler: The couple's goals.
Traveler: How Benoit feels about them.
Traveler: The situation is still pretty murky.
Traveler: We don't know how Benoit feels about all this.

## Talk 11

Molli: Nana, Nana, why is Mr. Leroy ignoring me? Do you know why?
