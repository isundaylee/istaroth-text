Traveler: We meet again.
Mutota: Oh, it's you guys. Welcome. I trust that you're in good health, or are you suffering any aftereffects from the Abyss?
Mutota: Thank you so much for helping us when we were short-handed. If it weren't for you, our tribe would never have recovered so soon.
Mutota: Despite the threat of the Abyss having abated, there will always be danger lurking somewhere in this world.
Mutota: But you can't just rush in headfirst at any cost just because you're tough, okay? That's the easiest way for a warrior to make a mistake.
