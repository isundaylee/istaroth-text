# Into the Sunlight


## Talk 1

Paimon: What is this place?
The Knave: Somewhere long forgotten by everyone. It used to be a grand building. Now, it's nothing more than a pile of rubble.
The Knave: No one comes here anymore, nor does anyone care about what once happened here. Although, this place does have something to do with the story I'm about to tell you.
The Knave: It was before I became a Harbinger, and before Lyney and the others joined the House of the Hearth. Due to certain events, I first killed Clervie, and then her mother... and this is where it all happened.
Paimon: You were the one that killed Clervie!?
Traveler: Why?
The Knave: Patience, now. Allow me to explain Clervie's side of the story first. I'll start from the beginning.
The Knave: Clervie was six years old when she was brought by her mother, Crucabena, to live in the House of the Hearth. From the outside, it seemed like a fairytale — a thriving family made up of kind adults and friendly children.
The Knave: Crucabena was The Knave at that time, and the House of the Hearth was under her control. She was Clervie's mother by blood, but she was also the "Mother" to all the children in the House.
The Knave: Clervie was happy here... for a time. But, she quickly realized that being part of this "family"... wasn't a fairytale at all. It was a kind of purgatory.
Paimon: Purgatory?
The Knave: Exactly. The House of the Hearth takes in war orphans from all over Teyvat, but as for how to raise them... That depends entirely on the person in charge.
The Knave: Crucabena came up with a novel idea. She would teach the children to fight, force them to duel each other, and then crown, as the "king" of the House, the child who proved themselves most worthy of inheriting her title.
The Knave: It's difficult to estimate the number of children who died or were maimed in the process. There's little I can say about the ones who died. The ones that emerged with permanent injuries, on the other hand... Well, they still served a purpose.
The Knave: They would be handed over to The Doctor to be experimented on, or sent away on dangerous missions... nothing more than tools to be used and then discarded.
Paimon: So those were the experiments Clervie was talking about... But what actually happened to her?
Paimon: You said that Clervie was Crucabena's daughter, so if Clervie tried to convince her to stop what she was doing, Crucabena probably would've listened... right?
The Knave: Despite being Clervie's mother, Crucabena cared little for her daughter. She forced Clervie to join the House of the Hearth only as a means to demonstrate her own impartiality as a "Mother" — to prove that she treated all her children equally.
The Knave: Clervie did try to convince her mother to change her ways, but it was to no avail. After her efforts failed, the only other option was to rise up and try to fight back. Unfortunately, the other children had already been thoroughly indoctrinated into the illusion of happiness Crucabena had created.
The Knave: Of course, there was one exception... someone Clervie's age who knew the truth about the House of the Hearth. Her name was Peruere.
Traveler: "Perrie"?
Paimon: Wait, the friend that Clervie mentioned?
The Knave: "Friend," huh... I suppose we can call her that for now.
The Knave: Clervie was a cheerful and passionate person with a tenacious spirit. Peruere, on the other hand, was rather cold-blooded.
The Knave: Her cold-blooded nature allowed her to see through Crucabena's facade. Yet, it was also this cold-bloodedness that prevented her from acting against it... at least at first. While Clervie longed for freedom, Peruere was convinced that, amid all the fighting and violence, she would make it until the end.
The Knave: Despite their differences, the two became fast friends — united by their knowledge of the truth. Clervie told Peruere that she hoped to create a real family where no one would be killed or sacrificed.
The Knave: There may have been a certain naivete to her ideas, but Clervie proved her determination many times over. She tried countless times to run away, ask for help, or expose the truth, but her efforts only earned her beating after beating. The only thing that kept her going was her strength of will.
The Knave: Even with her body wracked with pain, she would still stand on her tip-toes and open the window at night. She and Peruere would look out at the moon together, a fierce longing for freedom shining in her eyes... But, one day, that light... simply vanished.
Paimon: Oh no... What happened?
The Knave: Her hopelessness resulted from a culmination of things. Ten years had passed — ten years' worth of failure after failure. She and Peruere weren't children anymore, but finding any chance to escape still seemed as hopeless as ever.
The Knave: It was during this time that Peruere suggested a new plan... If escaping was out of the question, why not take down the very person sitting on top of this throne of lies — "Mother" herself.
The Knave: Clervie rejected that proposal. She claimed that, as a famous Harbinger, Crucabena possessed an unimaginable amount of power. Trying to kill her would have an incredibly low chance of success.
The Knave: Clervie never gave another reason, but Peruere could see it written all over her face. Clervie still thought of Crucabena as her mother. Killing her own flesh and blood was a line she couldn't bring herself to cross.
The Knave: If she couldn't escape and fight back... Then only one option remained.
Traveler: Death...
The Knave: Precisely. Death was the only way that she felt she could be free.
The Knave: It happened during a duel. When she arrived at the dueling ring that day, her partner turned out to be none other than Peruere, the very person that had stood by her side all those years. It was a fierce battle, but, ultimately, Clervie decided to let Peruere end her life.
The Knave: From that moment on, Peruere's journey was one written in flames. When the rain finally came and washed it all away, there she stood — the sole victor in "Mother's" endless game of slaughter, a trail of corpses strewn across her path to success.
The Knave: It was the very result she had predicted ten years prior. Even then, she believed she would make it until the end. She wasn't surprised by the fact that she emerged as "Mother's" undisputed heir. Rather, her success left her with an inexplicable sense of restlessness.
The Knave: She was unsettled, and there was only one thing that could quell that sensation... Perhaps you two would like to take a guess as to what it was?
Traveler: Killing the person at the very top?
Paimon: Crucabena, you mean? But, but...
The Knave: Correct. This is the place where Peruere killed her best friend. A mere year later, this is also the place where she fought tooth and nail to kill the "Mother" they shared.
The Knave: The moment she acted, any conception of what was right or wrong ceased to matter. It's one of the principles of the House — only those who survive get to write the rules.
The Knave: Peruere won the battle and became a Harbinger herself, after which Her Majesty the Tsaritsa bestowed upon her a new name... Arlecchino.
Paimon: So, the "Perrie" Clervie was talking about... It was you all along. You're Peruere! Arlecchino is just a name you got later!
Traveler: This was your story just as much as Clervie's...
The Knave: I left that name behind long ago. I must say, hearing it now... does bring back memories.
The Knave: After I defeated Crucabena, the moniker of "Mother" died with her. I chose to forgo the title she called herself and even chose to give up my own name. I rebuilt the House of the Hearth under a new identity... not only as Arlecchino, but as "Father."
The Knave: And that is where the story ends. Any more questions?
Traveler: The Clervie we met, though... Who is she exactly?
Paimon: Yeah, based on what you just told us, Clervie wasn't a little kid when she was killed. So the Clervie we met... Was she really a spirit at all?
The Knave: I suppose you could call her an illusion born of flame... Her existence is like ashes to a fire — something leftover in the wake of blaze and ruin.
The Knave: You see, a certain power runs through my veins. It's not unlike a curse. My flames leave behind shadows of anything they consume.
The Knave: Of course, the chances of those shadows morphing into a sentient entity are exceedingly slim. Clervie is a very special case.
The Knave: Clervie died when she was sixteen years old, but what emerged from the flames was her six-year-old self. Her appearance wasn't the only thing affected. Most of her memories were lost to the blaze as well.
The Knave: Memory is a mysterious thing indeed. Losing a portion of your memories will alter your sense of self. Lose ten years' worth, however, and it would be like living in the past, like returning to a version of yourself that never grew up.
Paimon: No wonder Paimon got such a weird feeling when we were talking to her...
The Knave: Perhaps I should put it this way... Clervie is someone trapped in time. It may seem like she exists with us in the present, but she truly lives in the confines of her own past.
Paimon: So, if all of that is true, then you must've known about Clervie for a long time!
The Knave: Indeed. She's a rather volatile and unstable entity. Sometimes, she would look after the children. She's even saved some of their lives.
The Knave: But, other times, she would hide from me and become obsessed with revealing the "truth" about the House to anyone who will listen.
The Knave: Shadows don't have the capacity to learn or grow. Any new information they encounter is quickly forgotten over time.
The Knave: Your attempts to expose Clervie to sunlight... They failed, yes? The reason is actually quite simple. In Clervie's mind, the House is impossible to escape, and it is this very perception that traps her there.
The Knave: But, no matter. All I have to do is kill her again and all will be resolved. I don't anticipate so much as a single speck of ash will be left behind this time.
Paimon: Wait!
Paimon: Paimon can understand why you might want her gone... But isn't there any other way?
Paimon: So what if she's trapped in her six-year-old self! She's still your friend! At least talk to her first!
The Knave: It's too late for that. She broke the rules, and now she must be punished. That goes for Filliol and Nanteuil as well. She's had quite the effect on them...
The Knave: I hope you understand, the difference between Crucabena and myself lies in our formulation of the rules, not our policy for enforcing them. Upholding the rules without question is a trait we both share, because that is how a household should be run.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Is this really what you want to do?
The Knave: Whatever could you mean?
Traveler: Don't you... want to say a proper goodbye at least?
The Knave: Whether as a "killer" or as a "Father," there are two things that must be avoided at all costs — anger and sorrow.
The Knave: Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.
The Knave: Well, it appears it's about time to proceed. Before we arrived, I told some of my well-behaved children to bring our troublemakers here by nightfall.
The Knave: I do believe I've kept my end of the deal. I gave your friends quite a bit more time. As for what happens now, we'll just have to wait and see.
Chapleau: Here they are, "Father."
Foltz: You gonna execute 'em? Seeing something like that would actually be a first for me.
Paimon: Lyney!
Traveler: Clervie...
Lyney: I'm sorry. I heard about how you helped buy us more time...
Lyney: But, I still failed. I couldn't find a way to fulfill her wish.
Clervie: Huh...
Clervie: Are you... Perrie?
The Knave: Indeed. It's been a while, Clervie.
Clervie: Perrie!
The Knave: Shh... Stay right there. I'm sorry to postpone our reunion, but first, I believe certain scores need settling.

## Talk 2

Lyney: "Father," let me explain...
The Knave: Out of my way.
Lyney: "Father"...
The Knave: You chose to conceal a threat to the House, and for that, you must be punished.
The Knave: Overall, however, I suppose your wrongdoing is hardly the most egregious of the bunch, so I'll deal with your punishments later. As for right now, the more pressing concerns are the traitors among us.
Filliol: By traitors... do you mean us?
Nanteuil: "Father," let me explain. We didn't mean to—
The Knave: Foltz, why don't you share what you heard.
Foltz: Yes, "Father."
Foltz: Secret midnight meeting number 3. Participants: Filliol, Nanteuil, Sotto, Tadie...
Foltz: Nanteuil clearly said, "If only 'Father' wasn't the one who took us in."
Foltz: Sotto added, "I'm sick of this life. I just want to live as a normal person."
Foltz: Filliol was the worst of them all. She called us crazies and said a bunch of mean things about "Father"...
Filliol: I did not!
Filliol: You're... You're lying! Foltz is trying to frame us!
Foltz: It's not like I'm the only one who heard those things. After that, you and Tadie and a bunch of other people started talking about Clervie. You were using all those things Clervie brought up as an excuse to question "Father."
Foltz: "We're birds locked in a cage. The only way out is to destroy it." That's what you said, wasn't it?
Filliol: You little... You just want me gone, don't you! What did I ever do to you, huh!?
Filliol: And you, Chapleau... Have you forgotten who stood by your sickbed, watched over you, and changed your dressings? C'mon, let's hear it, then — what's your reason for all this?
Chapleau: ...
Foltz: You're wrong, Filliol.
Foltz: We don't want you to die. You're our family.
Filliol: Liar. You wouldn't be doing this if that were the case. So, why? Why have you backed us into a corner?
Foltz: We all live in the House of the Hearth. You know the type of work we do, Filliol.
Foltz: A single betrayal can cost dozens of us our lives. It's not like it's never happened before. That kind of thing is hard to forget.
Foltz: That's why the House of the Hearth cannot tolerate any form of betrayal. Ever since we came to Poisson, you've had seven secret meetings. A lot of the things you talked about really crossed the line.
Filliol: You've been spying on us for half a month? Wait a second, now that I think about it... The move to Poisson was just a way to make it easier to spy on us, wasn't it? 'Cause we were all in one place! You've had this planned all along...
Chapleau: Filliol, Nanteuil, I'm sorry...
Chapleau: I owe you both my life. I owe Clervie too. If it weren't for all your help after I got poisoned, I wouldn't be standing here today.
Chapleau: If this were any other situation, I would do anything to repay that kindness, even if it cost me my life. But, rules are rules. I'm sorry, my hands are tied.
Filliol: Why... *sobbing*... Why...
Nanteuil: That's enough, Filliol. We made a mistake, and we should own up to it. We broke the rules — plain and simple, and now we have to face the consequences.
Nanteuil: I'm sorry, Chapleau, Foltz. I'm sorry, "Father."
Nanteuil: We... accept our punishment.
The Knave: Chapleau, according to the rules of the House of the Hearth, how should these traitors be punished?
Chapleau: All those who betray the House pay with their lives.
The Knave: And so it shall be.
Filliol: *sobbing*...
Lyney: "Father"! Please wait!
The Knave: Something you want to say, Lyney?
Lyney: ...Please reconsider, "Father." What Filliol and the others did... Does it really count as betrayal?
Lyney: We all come from broken families. From the very first day we joined the House of the Hearth, we wanted nothing more than to make it a real home.
Lyney: But the truth is... none of us know what a real home should look like.
Lyney: I'm not saying I have all the answers. All I know is this — killing Filliol and the others may uphold the rules, but doing so will only bring us further away from being a real family than we've ever been.
Lyney: So, please, "Father"... Please reconsider!
Lynette: I agree with Lyney.
Freminet: "Father," please...
Nanteuil: Lyney, you...
Chapleau: I also agree with Lyney.
The Knave: ...
The Knave: An order, once given, cannot be rescinded.
The Knave: However, given the extent of your determination, I suppose we shall have to go about this a different way... Draw your weapons, and face me.
Lyney: Our weapons...?
Lynette: "Father," are you referring to a duel?
The Knave: Precisely. The rules of the House will not be altered. Traitors must be punished.
The Knave: However, resolving disputes with a duel is also one of our rules, one that also applies to me. Demonstrate a sufficient showing of strength, and I shall offer a concession.
Freminet: Wait... Beat... "Father" in a duel...?
Foltz: Impossible. "Father" is way too strong, even for Lyney.
Paimon: #Did you hear that, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Lyney and the others have to duel The Knave! What should we do? Can they really win something like that?
Paimon: If they lose, those people from the House are really gonna be executed... Hey, are you listening?
Traveler: (Is executing them really what she wants?)
Traveler: Don't you... want to say a proper goodbye at least?
The Knave: Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.
Traveler: (Back then, she never actually answered my question.)
Traveler: (But that makes the answer pretty obvious, doesn't it?)
Paimon: Looking at that expression on her face, she seems really serious about this. Guess that means there's no chance she's throwing the duel on purpose, huh...
Traveler: (There's no way The Knave will lose on purpose. Although...)
Lyney: When guests are around, families are often on their best behavior... and any disputes are less likely to escalate...
The Knave: When the time comes, make the choice that you deem most appropriate in the situation, and lend your help to the House of the Hearth.
Paimon: #What's wrong, {NICKNAME}? Hey, where are you going—
Lyney: #{NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I'd like to see for myself what the Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers can do.
Paimon: You're asking to join the duel against The Knave!?
Traveler: If that's okay.
The Knave: I'll allow it. We do have a ready-made dueling ring at our disposal, after all.
The Knave: All I would advise is this — keep a firm grasp on your weapon, and give it your all. Any less, and you may just lose your life.

## Talk 3

The Knave: I believe we can end things here. It's not often that we get to enjoy the company of guests, after all. We wouldn't want things to get too out of hand.
Lyney: *coughing*
Lynette: Brother, are you alright?
Freminet: Lyney...
The Knave: Given that I am the victor of this duel... As agreed, the punishment stands.
Filliol: No...
Nanteuil: I never thought things would end like this...
The Knave: However, everyone involved in the duel demonstrated a remarkable level of strength and determination. In light of this, I'm prepared to change the method of execution.
The Knave: Heloir, the bottled flames I gave you for safekeeping... Do you still have them?
Heloir: Y—Yes! I wasn't sure what they were for, but I've kept them super safe! I didn't lose a single one!
The Knave: Wonderful. Then, in just a moment, I'll have you administer them.
Nanteuil: Bottled flames...?
The Knave: Indeed. They're the product of a secret experiment. Under certain special circumstances, flames can be extracted from my person and preserved.
The Knave: Once ingested, searing pain will spread across every inch of your body. No harm will come to you physically, but your memories will be burned away.
The Knave: If you can withstand the pain... When you awake, you'll have forgotten everything you know about the House of the Hearth, and will be expelled from the organization.
The Knave: In other words, administering this concoction will "kill" the version of you that grew up in the House, and give you a new identity.
Traveler: (So that means... The young man that I thought looked familiar, the one selling newspapers outside the Palais Mermonia... He must have been the same Horrer we saw on the list of executions. He wasn't killed at all...)
The Knave: Memory is a mysterious thing indeed. Losing a portion of your memories will alter your sense of self...
Traveler: (No, if my understanding of The Knave is right, she really thinks of that as "killing" him. The Horrer that lived in the House of the Hearth is dead. The one that remains is simply a normal person living out his life with his beloved.)
Traveler: (Even so, it's much better than actually ending their lives.)
Filliol: So, you're just... letting us go, "Father"?
The Knave: You misunderstand. Memories are extremely important. Once consumed by flame, the version of you standing before me will die, and our secrets will die with you. So, no, I don't intend to just "let you go," because the person who survives will be nothing but a stranger.
Filliol: Even so... Even so... *sobbing*... I won't have to live in fear anymore...
Filliol: I'm sorry, "Father." I'm sorry I let you down. But I... I really...
The Knave: Don't cry, Filliol.
The Knave: You haven't left the House yet, so there are still rules to be followed, yes? Remember what I taught you — anger makes you impulsive, sorrow causes you to waver. Don't let yourself be controlled by your emotions.
Filliol: Of course... I'll remember.
The Knave: Dry your tears and go pursue the life you really want.
Crowd: Yes, "Father"!
The Knave: Chapleau, Foltz, Heloir... Take them back to Poisson. And bring Lyney and the others as well.
The Knave: I prepared three extra vials of bottled flames. As for whether to take them, the choice is yours.
The Knave: Goodbye, children. The next time we meet, I will no longer be your "Father."
The Knave: Thank you for all you've done for the House. I hope you have bright futures ahead of you.
Filliol: "Father"...!
Chapleau: Let's go.
Foltz: Here, grab my arm, Lyney. I'll help you walk back.
Lyney: ...Thank you.
The Knave: Clervie.
Clervie: Can we talk now? I've been waiting for a super long time.
Clervie: You really are Perrie, aren't you? I haven't seen you in so long. How come you're all grown up?
Clervie: Wait, did I somehow travel to the future on accident? Or, am I dreaming? Huh, what a long dream—
The Knave: Neither... You died, Clervie. That's what happened.
Paimon: You could've at least sugarcoated it a little! Look! She's stunned speechless!
Traveler: (If this really is Clervie's younger self...)
Clervie: Oh... Okay then.
Paimon: Huh? That's it? You accepted it just like that?
Clervie: Yep. If that's what Perrie says happened, then I believe her. Perrie wouldn't lie to me.
Clervie: Plus, I don't really need to know why I'm like this. I'm more curious about what happens in the future. If you're a Harbinger now, Perrie, that means Mother is gone, isn't she?
Clervie: Can you tell me about it? I wanna know what happened to her... and to me.
The Knave: You never stopped trying to defy fate.
The Knave: At first, no one believed you. You could only vent your frustrations to the moon. In fact, you often sought comfort in the night sky. You wanted to see the aurora, so one night, we promised each other we would go to Snezhnaya to see it together.
The Knave: Later on, you tried to run away, but you were brought back each time. "Mother" spared your life, but it wasn't out of kindness. Instead, she decided to make an example of you by slowly torturing you over time. That way, the other children would know what happens to traitors.
The Knave: Still, you never gave up. "Mother" hoped that, through ruthless duel after ruthless duel, she would be able to crown an ultimate victor among the children she raised.
The Knave: But you called on everyone to unite, to fight to a draw in order to reduce casualties. Your efforts may have only delayed the inevitable, but still... you gave them hope.
The Knave: You tried everything you could think of, but every attempt ended in failure. Still, you never turned your sword on Crucabena, and you never turned it on me. On that gloomy day, you told me—
The Knave: "For the last sixteen years of my life, I've done everything I can to fight for freedom. But now, I realize that the only freedom I truly possess is the freedom to choose to die."
Clervie: I never imagined I would say something like that. I must've been feeling really worn down.
Clervie: But, somehow, I still think I understand. According to Mother's plan, only one of us was going to make it until the end... And I always hoped that person would be you.
Clervie: If I could do it all over again, I still don't think I would make a different choice. Even when I first met you, I knew you'd be able to do what I couldn't.
The Knave: Is that so? Even now, I'm not sure I truly understand what kind of freedom you were trying to pursue.
The Knave: But, as the head of the House of the Hearth and as the children's "Father," I've tried to give them the most basic of freedoms — the freedom to choose their own fate.
The Knave: It's something I discussed with the Iudex of Fontaine. The children who want to leave the House will have their memories wiped clean of all secrets pertaining to the organization. In return, they will be allowed to live a normal life in Fontaine without being prosecuted for their past.
The Knave: Of course, I won't simply hand freedom to them on a silver platter. They have to fight for it and prove themselves worthy of it. Only freedom that is earned has true value.
Clervie: That's more than enough. That's exactly the kind of life I was fighting for.
Clervie: Y'know, Perrie... I think you're a pretty amazing "king" and a really great "Father" too.
Clervie: I'm really happy that you're the one who took over the House. I guess I do have one regret, though. I still haven't seen the outside world!
The Knave: ...Well, it just so happens that our dear guests over here have been to many nations and traveled to countless places. Perhaps they would be willing to tell you what the outside world is like.
Clervie: Really?
Paimon: Of course! We've traveled all over the place! We've got so many stories, we could probably talk your ears off for three days straight!
Traveler: (Then I would say she's probably had enough lies.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Clervie...
Paimon: She left so soon... Paimon didn't even get to finish her story...
The Knave: I also have certain sentiments left unsaid.
The Knave: I wanted to tell her that the aurora I saw in Snezhnaya was just as beautiful as the ones in the pictures.
The Knave: But, a shadow's memories reset at dawn. Had we delayed any longer, we wouldn't have had the time to say goodbye.
The Knave: Whatever regrets may linger... let them be lost to the coming of a new day.
Lyney: "Father"... *cough*
Paimon: It's Lyney! Hey, Lyney—
Paimon: What is he doing back here? Let's go check it out!
Lyney: "Father"... The bottled flames have been administered. Filliol and the others have left the House.
The Knave: And you? What have you decided?
Lyney: *ahem*... Thank you for giving us that choice, "Father." But we never wanted to leave the House. It's the only home we've ever known.
Lyney: Lynette and Freminet feel the same way. They're recuperating back at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. But, I decided to come back and tell you where we stood.
The Knave: I'm sure you're well aware of the expectations I have for you. I want you to follow in my footsteps and become the next "king" of the House. Yet, you seem to have different ideas.
The Knave: I must admit, I'm rather surprised by your decision to stay. There's nothing wrong with choosing to live a quiet life. Leading this organization is a heavy responsibility, one not so easily carried by someone forced onto the throne.
Lyney: I just... never understood what you saw in me... what made you believe I was deserving of that throne.
The Knave: You're brave, talented... And, most importantly, you cherish your family.
The Knave: You would do anything to protect them — even if it costs you your life.
Lyney: ...
Chapleau: Speaking up back there was so brave of you, Lyney! It's all thanks to you that we were able to convince "Father" to back down.
Foltz: You're a hero, Lyney!
Lyney: (Hero... "Father" is the real hero.)
Lyney: (Had "Father" gone all out during the duel, there's no way I would've walked away with my life. She must have had it all planned from the beginning, from the very moment she suggested a duel...)
Lyney: I'm not deserving of that title. I'm not strong enough or smart enough...
The Knave: You're wrong.
The Knave: In my opinion, all you need to be deserving of the throne is conviction, and the necessary strength to act on it.
The Knave: We may have different ideas of what it means to be a family, but you can hardly be said to lack conviction. What you truly lack is strength. For someone of your talent, though, that's something that will come with time.
The Knave: Even without that strength, you still chose to face me in a duel even though the odds were stacked against you. That capacity to honor your convictions is what I truly see in you.
Lyney: "Father"...
The Knave: No one knows what the future holds, what tragedy or triumph may be in store. Being at the head of this organization requires the strength of will to face whatever comes. Caution will only hold you back.
The Knave: If reaching a certain standard were required to go after what you want, I would never have succeeded in killing my predecessor. Back then, there was still a considerable gap between our abilities.
The Knave: Strength may decide the ultimate victor, but those who let a lack of strength dictate their decisions or undermine their convictions will never be worthy of the throne.
Lyney: I understand, "Father." Thank you.
The Knave: Children must grow up to surpass their parents... Only then can a family continue to flourish.
The Knave: The road ahead is not an easy one, so I'll ask you one last time. Are you certain you want to stay?
Lyney: You've done so much for me, "Father," and that kindness must be repaid. Plus, with Project Stuzha at hand, there are many dangers ahead, and I, for one, don't intend to back down.
Lyney: ...Protecting my family at all costs — that's my conviction.
The Knave: Then you're welcome to stay. As for Project Stuzha, you need not be too concerned. If those cowardly businessmen and heartless dignitaries try to take us down, I'm prepared to teach them a lesson.
The Knave: Having members who longed for the light was our organization's last weakness. With those members no longer among our ranks, the House of the Hearth is like a spider hiding in the shadows — we need only wait for our prey to come to us.
The Knave: At present, our imperative is to use their plan to our advantage. In doing so, a crimson moon shall rise amid the frigid blizzards of winter. No demonstration of loyalty shall go unrewarded, and no sacrifice shall be in vain.
The Knave: As for the two of you, whether we meet again as friend or foe, I'll remember the camaraderie we shared in this moment.
The Knave: No matter how arduous the journey ahead, I hope we both reach our desired destination.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Talk about the land of Geo, nation of contracts.
Clervie: Ahh, that's where Mora comes from. I never knew that before.
Clervie: If I had some Mora, I would buy three new dresses. One for me, one for Perrie, and one for Mother.
Clervie: It's just too bad Perrie doesn't like wearing dresses. And Mother... Well, she probably wouldn't accept something like that, either. I guess I'd just have to keep them all for me, then! I could wear a different one every day!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Talk about land of Anemo, nation of freedom.
Clervie: Y'know, I used to dream of being a bard.
Clervie: Playing the lute while singing into the winds of freedom... Even if there was no one there to listen, I would've continued to sing no matter what.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Talk about the land of Electro, nation of eternity.
Clervie: Those youkai you mentioned... What do they look like?
Clervie: I once saw a drawing of this one guy with horns on his head and a super scary face. Are there any youkai like that?
Paimon: Oh, sounds like you're talking about an oni. Yep, we've met one, and let Paimon tell you... They're not nearly as scary as they look.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Talk about the land of Dendro, nation of wisdom.
Clervie: I was always too afraid to skip Mother's fighting lessons.
Clervie: But, at the Akademiya, I bet you could do all sorts of secret things in class — things that have nothing to do with studying!
Clervie: Hehe, I'm just kidding. Being able to study whatever you want without having to fear for your life... actually sounds pretty great.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Talk about the land of Hydro, nation of justice.
Black Screen Text: You tell Clervie all about the various nations you've visited. Eventually, the conversation returns to Fontaine — the nation she once called home.
Paimon: The situation was super dangerous! Lyney and Lynette were accused of committing a crime, and they were going to have to stand trial at the Opera Epiclese!
Clervie: Oh no! That must have been hard for all of you. What happened next?
Paimon: Don't worry. We were able to turn the situation around super quickly. All thanks to Detective Paimon, of course.
Clervie: How'd you do that? C'mon, tell me!
Paimon: *ahem* Okay, so it was like this... After the failed magic show, we rushed to the scene, and...
Traveler: (Clervie is listening really intently to Paimon's story about our time in Fontaine. She seems really happy, like all her troubles have been forgotten.)
Traveler: (Maybe this is the first time she's ever been able to truly relax... But, I'm not sure how long this moment can last...)
The Knave: Shadows don't have the capacity to learn or grow. Any new information they encounter is quickly forgotten over time.
Traveler: (As time passes, she'll probably forget everything we've told her, and go back to being that scared little girl who could only hide in the shadows...)
Traveler: (Huh, I was so busy thinking, I almost didn't notice... The sun has risen.)

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Lynette, Freminet, how are you feeling?
Lynette: Much better.
Paimon: Phew, what a relief!
Lynette: What about you? Are you feeling alright?
Traveler: There's no need to worry.
Freminet: I knew you'd come out unscathed... Us, on the other hand, well... We've been bedridden for two days. I couldn't even turn over.
Freminet: Oh, and I wanted to ask... Is Clervie... gone?
Freminet: Lyney and the other members have left Poisson and returned to the House of the Hearth. According to him, there haven't been any more sightings of a spirit roaming the House.
Traveler: We bid her farewell under a blanket of sunlight.
Lynette: I see...
Freminet: I'm glad...
Freminet: "Father" came to check up on us two days ago and told us about what happened with Crucabena and Clervie. Actually, I... I've met Crucabena before.
Paimon: Wait, what? You've met the former Knave?
Freminet: Crucabena died a year after Clervie. It was during the year between their deaths that I joined the House of the Hearth.
Freminet: Crucabena had an extremely cruel and radical way of doing things. While she was alive, the atmosphere in the House was suffocating.
Freminet: When I joined, though, the experiments she valued so much had already come to an end, and all the people involved — dead and injured alike — were gone. Crucabena never talked about the past with us newcomers.
Freminet: A couple months after I joined, "Father" killed Crucabena and burned all her files. With that, the names of all the people subjected to her experiments — Clervie included — were lost to the flames, along with the painful memories they represented.
Lynette: "Father" took in Lyney and me a couple months after that, but she never mentioned anything about Crucabena or Clervie.
Paimon: Hmm, it really seems like something she was planning to keep to herself.
Paimon: The last time you talked to her, did she mention why she kept it a secret for so long?
Lynette: She said she didn't want us to be affected by the darkness of the past. She was worried we'd develop a false sense of gratitude towards her if we knew about it.
Lynette: "The foundation of a family should be free of any corrupting influence. Whatever happened in the past, it has nothing to do with who we are now."
Lynette: ...That's what "Father" told us in the end.
Freminet: But, I still thanked her for everything. It was only after hearing about what Crucabena did that I finally realized how insignificant our lives could have been... The members of the House meant nothing to her. To say that she valued them in any way, even just as a tool, would probably be giving her too much credit.
Freminet: If "Father" hadn't taken over the House of the Hearth, I probably would've already...
Traveler: Don't think about that.
Lynette: "Father" rarely brings up the fact that she saved us. She doesn't believe that being indebted to her should be what ties us together.
Lynette: But, even if we didn't owe her anything, we would still choose to stay. Because this is our home.
Lynette: We may have arguments or times when we feel wronged. Some people may even choose to leave. But, as long as "Father" is here, we will always have a home.
Freminet: Whether the path before us is bathed in sunlight or shrouded in shadow, we'll follow "Father" wherever she chooses to go.
Freminet: So, I wanted to say thank you for helping us make it through this crisis. Without your help, we could've lost a lot more along the way.
Paimon: Oh, we didn't do anything, really.
Traveler: Just invite us back as guests and we'll call it even!
Freminet: Of course! You're welcome any time.
Paimon: Are... Filliol and Nanteuil okay?
Lynette: I actually saw them at a cafe this morning.
Lynette: They didn't recognize me. From what I could tell, they were drinking coffee and talking about one of the operas that started running recently.
Lynette: They seemed happy. If I had to take a guess, I would say they finally found the kind of life they always wished for.
Traveler: She saved you in the end.
Traveler: Her wish has been fulfilled.
Traveler: I'm right as rain!
