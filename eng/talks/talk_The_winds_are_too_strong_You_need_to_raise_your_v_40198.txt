Alfry: The winds are too strong! You need to raise your voice!
Traveler: I'd like to change party members.
Traveler: Under such weather, eh? Feels like living the life of a born adventurer.
Alfry: No problem! Alfry will assemble your colleagues immediately!
Traveler: Tell me about yourself.
Alfry: Now is not the time for self-introductions. Come in and take refuge!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Alfry: Don't get blown away by the winds!
