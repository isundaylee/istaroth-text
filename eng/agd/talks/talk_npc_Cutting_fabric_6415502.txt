Traveler: Cutting fabric?
Elham: Yeah, I have a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
Elham: Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
Elham: My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions, they all say they don't have any.
Elham: The dressmaking techniques I can learn from the Akasha are limited, and I can't get any constructive customer critiques. If things keep going this way, I'll never be able to improve my design skills!
Elham: I've recently been considering going to Fontaine for further training. I heard that there are some very good couture stores.
Elham: ...But I also heard that Fontaine produces mostly machine-made clothing and they hardly need craftsmen. What should I do...?
