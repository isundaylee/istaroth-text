# The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call


## Talk 1

Nahida: Prepare yourselves. I'm going to transport you into Irminsul.

## Talk 2

Aqaba: Come on, serious suggestions, please. I'm not trying to write a thriller here! It's supposed to be an essay, you understand? An essay. That means facts and logic.
Sawada: Well, if it's facts and logic you're after, you shot yourself in the foot with your choice of research topic, didn't you? "The Tatarasuna Mystery"... When so much remains unexplained, there's little to be objective about. Unless, of course, you restrict yourself to textual criticism.
Aqaba: Yeah, well... This is my teacher's area of research. I can't change that. But it's fascinating enough without having to sensationalize it, don't you think? The strange location, the missing details, a mysterious person...
Aqaba: I want to write my essay on something interesting, and I'm interested in getting to the bottom of all this. That's the only reason I came to you!
Sawada: Yes, you came to me, so all the more reason to take my advice! The fact is, it's the dramatization that will make people want to read it. There's no getting around that.
Aqaba: Uh... Okay, but...
Paimon: Did one of them just mention Tatarasuna? But that's all the way in Inazuma...
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or is it kinda unusual for someone in Sumeru to wanna write a paper about that? ...Huh, everyone here's just going about their business — maybe it really is just Paimon. Guess people here are free to research pretty much anything.
Traveler: Still, let's go listen in.
Paimon: Great! Let's go find out what this "Tatarasuna Mystery" is all about.

## Talk 3

Aqaba: Alright, I guess I'll go with my textual criticism and your editorial direction for the first draft. I have a feeling that the missing kabukimono will end up being the main focus of this paper.
Aqaba: #*sigh* If only we knew where to find that Traveler... From what they say about {F#her}{M#him}, this seems like the kind of thing {M#he}{F#she}'d know about.
Traveler: Looking for me?
Sawada: Oh, you're the Traveler, you say? Hmm...
Paimon: Hey, what's with that face? Don't believe us?
Traveler: If you don't believe me, I'll go.
Sawada: No, no! Of course I believe you. Actually, I first heard about your great exploits when I was still in Inazuma.
Sawada: This is my first time coming face-to-face with you and your mysterious silver-haired companion... I couldn't believe my luck, and out of force of habit, I started, uh, examining the evidence... Sorry.
Aqaba: Sawada, for the love of... Haha, sorry, we don't get out much, so our social skills are kinda lacking...
Aqaba: Traveler, I hear you've helped many people a great deal, and been to many places. Would you be able to tell us about Tatarasuna?
Paimon: Actually, we don't know much about that place either. In fact, we only came over here 'cause we heard YOU talking about it, and wanted to learn more.
Aqaba: Ah... I see.
Traveler: Sorry I can't help this time.
Aqaba: My teacher chose this area of research as a personal challenge. He said it's difficult to get into, because even Inazumans don't know much about Tatarasuna's past. But who'd have thought that—
Sawada: If you don't mind, I'd love to show you all my outline for the book I'm writing about Tatarasuna.
Aqaba: Hold on, Sawada. Don't you think that's a bit of a deep dive for a first read?
Sawada: Fair point. In that case, please ease yourselves in gently by taking a look at Aqaba's latest essay draft.
Aqaba: Let me give you some background. This all started with the discovery of some records in Tatarasuna. The writings mentioned someone by the name of "Mikoshi Nagamasa," who crafted a fine blade.
Aqaba: But in the end, he threw it into a fire to destroy it, and killed his servant, Katsuragi. Why? Well. No one knows.
Aqaba: Apart from the sword-maker, his servant, and the one who wrote this all down, the records also mention a "kabukimono." This seems to be an Inazuman word for an eccentric stranger — someone who dresses funny or acts in an unusual way.
Sawada: That's right. Aqaba's teacher has spent quite some time researching these events on the ground. This kabukimono lived in Tatarasuna for a while before disappearing without a trace, and shortly afterwards... as Aqaba mentioned, things got pretty ugly.
Paimon: So first the strange person goes missing, then a murder happens? Hmm, seems kinda fishy to Paimon!
Sawada: Yes, my thoughts exactly! So I helped out too. I asked everyone I could think of if they knew anything about what happened back then... and WOW, did I get LUCKY!
Paimon: Stop shouting!
Sawada: This part's important. I just wanted to make it stand out.
Sawada: It just so happens that a friend of mine works at the government records office. He looked into it for me, and I can now confirm that all the aforementioned individuals did, in fact, live in Inazuma over four hundred years ago.
Sawada: Even back then, Tatarasuna was already at the center of Inazuma's smelting industry. The man in charge was a government official named Niwa. Curiously enough, it seems like he went missing, too.
Traveler: (Could it be...!)
Paimon: Wait, so there are TWO missing people in this story now?
Sawada: That's right! What's more, "Niwa" is a name with a lot of history to it. Have you ever heard of the great swordsmith clans of Inazuma?
Paimon: Oh, the swordsmiths? Yeah, umm... like Isshin Art and so on?
Sawada: Wow, yes, you really know your stuff. That makes things easier. So basically, this Niwa was a distant relative of the Kaedehara Clan — the last practitioners of Isshin Art.
Sawada: Something then seems to have happened in the Kaedehara Clan leading to their downfall... I don't know the details, but taken in light of everything else going on around that time, it makes you wonder whether it's all connected somehow...
Paimon: ...The Kaedehara Clan...
Aqaba: ...Sawada, you left out the biggest detail of all!
Traveler: There's more!?
Sawada: Oh! Yes, of course, how could I forget! Brace your minds, ladies and gents, for they are about to be blown. Or maybe you won't believe your ears... I wouldn't blame you, of course, because in all my years as a writer, this is by far the most—
Aqaba: Get to the point, for Pete's sake!
Sawada: ...According to information acquired by Aqaba's teacher, the kabukimono was not a human... But a puppet.
Traveler: ...!
Paimon: A puppet?
Traveler: (The Shogun puppet that the Electro Archon made should be ruling Inazuma with her as we speak... It couldn't be her.)
Traveler: (The kabukimono has to be The Balladeer, but... what was he doing 400 years ago in Tatarasuna?)
Aqaba: Aha! Judging by the looks on your faces, you do know something after all?
Paimon: Uhh... Uhh...
Traveler: (Glare at Paimon and hope she keeps her mouth shut.)
Paimon: Ah, no! Paimon just meant... "Uhh, how creepy!" The way you described it makes it sound like a ghost story!
Sawada: I agree. It does, but considering that non-human races in Inazuma are by no means uncommon, spooky events are to be expected... And that's exactly what my book is about — please, take a look.
Aqaba: Oh, and please read my essay draft as well!
Aqaba: Sawada was encouraging me to follow his more creative approach, but I think essays should be grounded in facts. I don't think explaining everything away with mysterious forces will cut it...
Aqaba: Ooh, how about if I plug the holes in Sawada's narrative with political intrigue? Like, um, I could put a turf war between rival factions at the center of the whole series of events.
Paimon: Wait, you're allowed to just make stuff up? Pretty sure you've gone from "essay" to "guessay" there.
Traveler: Yeah, sounds more like a novel...
Sawada: Aqaba, look... Your teacher has researched this extensively. I've reached out to everyone I could think of... Whatever information we have now is all that there is to know. This is as much detail as you're ever going to get.
Sawada: Besides, if there really was a political power struggle going on at anything like the level you seem to be suggesting, what hope would we ever have of finding out the truth?
Aqaba: ...Ugh, good point. Okay, back to the drawing board, I guess... Gimme some time. I need to find a new angle on this.
Traveler: I'll leave you to it.
Paimon: We have some other stuff to do, so we'll have to say goodbye for now. Good luck with your essay!
Aqaba: Alright, thank you. If you find out any more info about all this, please do let me know! Thanks so much.
Paimon: Hey, so that thing they were talking about... It has to do with The Balladeer, doesn't it?
Traveler: Yes.
Paimon: Okay... Then, even if we did know something about it, we probably couldn't share it with them, huh?
Paimon: After all, we kicked his butt and got him locked up. Information about people like that is usually super confidential, isn't it?
Paimon: If you ask Paimon, Aqaba should just pick a different topic. There must be as many essay topics as there are trees in the forest. There's no point in—
Paimon: Aah!!!
Traveler: What's wrong!?
Paimon: Hey, did you see that? He literally just went by. Over there... it looked like, like...
Paimon: The Balladeer!? No it can't have been, he got locked up... Quick, let's catch up and see!
Traveler: (Has this guy ever even written an essay before?)
Traveler: If you're looking for the Traveler, that's me.

## Talk 4

Nahida: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, there you are.
Paimon: Nahida, bad news! We just saw The Balladeer, strolling around in public!
Paimon: Did he escape, or...? ...Aah! It's him!
The Balladeer: Hmph. Sure enough, you're here.
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing in the Sanctuary of Surasthana!? Aren't you supposed to be locked up!?
Nahida: I know you must have a lot of questions. Please, allow me to explain.
Nahida: It was my idea to set The Balladeer free. We made a deal, and he's gonna do some investigation in Irminsul for me.
Paimon: A deal!? You sure you trust this guy?
The Balladeer: What did you expect? Why do you think Sumeru would keep me around otherwise? ...Or maybe killing me is all you can think about?
The Balladeer: But if that's the case, why haven't you done it already?
Paimon: Don't flatter yourself. It was... Nahida said there's still some mysteries in you to figure out!
The Balladeer: Ah, so if it were up to you, you'd finish the job? Guess I had you all wrong. There I was thinking you were just getting cold feet.
Traveler: ...
Nahida: Ugh, well that escalated quickly. Not a good start... Could I ask you all to please calm down?
Paimon: But Paimon's worried about you, Nahida! Don't let him trick you!
The Balladeer: Haha, it's not every day you see people questioning the God of Wisdom's judgment. Just when you think you've seen it all.
Paimon: Don't you dare try to drive a wedge between us!
Nahida: As long as the terms are reasonable, I don't think there's a problem in making a deal. Even with The Balladeer.
The Balladeer: Well, I for one have no reason to doubt you, considering you even struck a deal with The Doctor.
Nahida: Yes, one in which I gained valuable information. You'll come to understand more about that in the fullness of time.
Nahida: The Balladeer's power was all but completely spent after your battle. He's no longer strong enough to be a strategic threat to us. That puts him in quite a precarious position.
Nahida: Plus, he's a former Harbinger with knowledge of many of the Fatui's sensitive secrets. Being stuck here in Sumeru could make him a sitting duck, depending on how the Fatui plan to respond.
Paimon: Wait a second... former? You mean, he's not a Harbinger anymore?
Nahida: I take no pleasure in saying this, but... it seems as if The Doctor had no intention of welcoming back a loser, so...
Traveler: ...So he tossed you out like trash.
The Balladeer: Sometimes it's you using them, other times it's them using you. Most human relationships are this way... certainly all the stable ones are. That's how it was between me and the Fatui, and also between each of the Harbingers.
The Balladeer: So as long as you have some value to offer, nobody will ever abandon you. But after recent events, even I have to admit that I'm not worth quite what I used to be...
Traveler: Really? What a crying shame.
The Balladeer: ...Hmph, well, if the Fatui are gonna re-evaluate my utility, I need to have a backup plan for myself.
Nahida: As we discussed, I don't like causing harm to living beings, and you said you need protection. So, why not join forces with us?
The Balladeer: I think these two have made their objection to that idea fairly clear, don't you? And they're your friends, so I guess you'll be siding with them.
Paimon: Yeah, obviously! Nahida, don't listen to him!
Nahida: Then let's put that discussion to the side for now. We still have time.
Nahida: Today can be a trial run. Where we go from here will depend on how well we manage to cooperate today.
The Balladeer: Alright. Then I'll do what we agreed.
Nahida: Good. Go now, and keep in touch.
Paimon: Nahida, are you... are you serious about this?
Nahida: Yes.
Nahida: #I have my reasons for this decision. In fact... I'm largely doing it for your benefit, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: ...For me?
Nahida: Yes. As I told you once before, there's information about your twin in Irminsul.
Paimon: Oh, yeah. Actually, that's the whole reason we came to see you today. So you have an update on that?
Nahida: Mm-hmm. You may remember me mentioning that the Fatui had not included your twin's details in the "Descender" category. This is an extremely important point.
Nahida: It's possible that the Fatui have other information that even I don't know about. And since The Balladeer used to be one of them, he'll be better acquainted with this information than I am.
Nahida: He was granted the power to connect with Irminsul when he almost became the god of a new era. Even though he no longer has the Gnosis, some traces of its power remain in him. He can still connect.
Nahida: The amount of information in Irminsul is vast beyond description. Sifting through all of it without knowing what to look for would take too long, even for me.
Nahida: So I asked The Balladeer to search in Irminsul for any information about the Descenders. He's more familiar with this kind of information, and should be able to find it more quickly.
Traveler: What if he lies to you?
Paimon: Exactly! Or what if... Paimon just doesn't trust him. He's treated us as enemies every time we've run into him.
Nahida: I understand, but sometimes, everything is dictated by which side you're on.
Nahida: #How things will go in the future depends on what information he brings back. And {NICKNAME}... I know what your heart desires most of all.
Nahida: Our minds have connected several times before. There is a corner of your heart reserved for an intense longing... A feeling of being all alone in the dark, searching for the one candle whose light still burns.
Nahida: As Sumeru's deity, it is my responsibility to be on guard against The Balladeer. But as someone who counts you as a friend, I want to do something for you.
Nahida: If this deal with The Balladeer can give you the answers you've been longing to find, then it's worth it.
Traveler: ...Thank you, Nahida.
Nahida: It's my pleasure, really. You're Sumeru's hero! You've more than earned it.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon's still worried about this idea... Is there anything we can do to help?
Nahida: I was going to contact you about that, but then you suddenly showed up of your own accord. Seems like we have a telepathic connection.
Nahida: In fact, I was going to ask you to supervise The Balladeer on my behalf while he carries out the task I assigned.
Nahida: Even though he only has a fraction of his full power left, that's still a fraction of a former Harbinger. If you could accompany him, it would put my mind at ease.
Nahida: Of course, I'll be there to help guide you through Irminsul from the outside.
Traveler: Got it.
Nahida: Great. Thank you.
Nahida: Prepare yourselves. I'm going to transport you into Irminsul.
Traveler: I'm glad to be able to help.

## Talk 5

The Balladeer: Look at that, hot on my heels. You know, you didn't have to cut your catch-up short just to keep me company. Oh, but I guess you panicked when you realized that I might enter Irminsul ahead of you.
Traveler: Nahida sent me to babysit you.
Paimon: Shut your beak, jailbird! No way a prisoner gets to be so smug!
The Balladeer: I understand that prisoners have to put up with harassment from the guards, but right now, I'm on temporary release, so maybe you should think about backing off a little.
Nahida: Sounds like a successful rendezvous.
Nahida: I need to be quite clear about something. In a few moments, you'll be entering into the innermost region of Irminsul. It is an environment like no other, and the most important place in all of Sumeru.
Nahida: Unlike anywhere else, Irminsul's inner region consists exclusively of torrents of information. You must put aside your differences and be extremely careful as you navigate your way through.
Nahida: I know there are many grievances between you on both sides, but it is essential that you remain calm after entry. This is as much for your own safety as anything else.
Traveler: ...Understood.
Paimon: ...Fine, let's call a truce, but only until this mission's over...
The Balladeer: Let's cut each other a little slack, shall we? We are gonna be traveling together, after all.
The Balladeer: Per my agreement with Lesser Lord Kusanali, I'll be at the front. It's my job to lead the way and get rid of any obstacles in our path. All you have to do is keep your pretty eyes open and try not to fall behind.
Paimon: Ha! You sure are confident, Paimon'll give you that. You make it sound like you're even more experienced at adventuring than us!
The Balladeer: If there are no further objections, I suggest we get going.
The Balladeer: Or did you need some time to mentally prepare yourselves?
Paimon: You...! Ugh! The snark on this guy! It's unbearable!
Traveler: There's no need for all the biting sarcasm.
The Balladeer: ...Hmph.
The Balladeer: We can start now.
Nahida: Irminsul access granted. Initiating connection procedure...
Paimon: Is this a small sapling?
Paimon: Argh, darn it! C'mon, let's catch up with him!
Traveler: Focus on doing your job.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Wow... So this is the inside of Irminsul...
Traveler: It's different than what I imagined...
Paimon: Ohh... Paimon's never seen anything like this. And it feels like a sacred place...
The Balladeer: Irminsul is closely intertwined with the entirety of Teyvat. Every bit of information flowing here means something.
The Balladeer: Pick your jaws up off the floor. It's time to go.
Paimon: Why is it that Paimon just wants to do the opposite of everything he says...
The Balladeer: ...
The Balladeer: Lesser Lord Kusanali, we will now proceed to the heart of Irminsul.
Nahida: Can you still sense where the heart of Irminsul is?
The Balladeer: Yes. Permission to begin searching for information there?
Nahida: Permission granted. Go ahead.
The Balladeer: Let's go. Stay close, don't go running off.
Paimon: Hey, so... say we did go running off in here, what would happen?
The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: Wh—What are you smirking at?
The Balladeer: I was just imagining the look on your travel companion's face if you went and got lost.
The Balladeer: Anything's possible in here — you can't rule anything out. So if you wanna stay safe, your best option is to stick close to me.

## Talk 7

The Balladeer: We're here.
Paimon: What a huge tree...
Traveler: (This is the center of Irminsul. All the information in the world is flowing through it...)
The Balladeer: Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Nahida: Good, you made it. Are you ready?
The Balladeer: Ready when you are.
Nahida: Then please begin. Preparing to access cognitive currents. Establishing waypoint...
Paimon: The Balladeer's actually doing what Nahida tells him... Guess he must want to stay alive.
Traveler: (He hasn't put up any resistance, and he seems good at working on the frontline... Maybe he had a similar role in the Fatui?)
Traveler: (First Aqaba and Sawada's stories, now this... What a strange individual.)
Nahida: The rest is up to you. If you discover anything at all, make sure to share it with us.
The Balladeer: Will do.
Paimon: Huh... For once, we're the ones with nothing to do...
Nahida: #({NICKNAME}, Paimon, would you like to talk?)
Traveler: (Nahida? ...Is this a telepathic conversation?)
Nahida: (Yes. I've also invited Paimon to join.)
Paimon: (Huh? ...What the... We can talk to each other inside our heads?)
Traveler: (I'm guessing that you don't want us to disturb The Balladeer.)
Nahida: (Hehe, that's part of it. Plus, we're all friends. There's nothing wrong with us talking like this once in a while.)
Paimon: (Paimon's never tried this before. This is great!)
Paimon: (So, Paimon's been wanting to ask you something. Don't you think The Balladeer's a bit of a walking contradiction? He's always talking back, but he seems to listen to what you say...)
Traveler: (Yes, and he seems to excel at doing odd jobs for others...)
Nahida: (As I've told you before, there are still some mysteries for him to resolve. Things that are clear as day to me, but that he has yet to understand.)
Nahida: (Perhaps today will be the day that he finds some answers.)
Traveler: (Is it about his past? The "betrayals"? And the other events in Inazuma?)
Nahida: (Well done. Smart and attentive as always.)
Traveler: (Actually, I caught a glimpse of a few things when I ran into Haypasia at Pardis Dhyai...)
Black Screen Text: You relate what you saw in The Balladeer's mind while in Pardis Dhyai...
Nahida: (So you made contact with that part of his mind... Well, it's true. Betrayal turned The Balladeer into the person he is today.)
Paimon: (Huh, Paimon thought nothing could get under that guy's skin. Turns out he can get hurt and angry just like anyone else.)
Nahida: (Everyone has a history, Paimon. Even if you're a puppet created by the Electro Archon.)
Paimon: (Speaking of puppets, we ran into two people at the Akademiya today talking about an essay. Turns out their topic was about the Tatarasuna incident... Nahida, do you know anything about that?)
Nahida: (If you mean the mysterious events, the kabukimono, and so on... Yes, I know about all of that.)
Paimon: (Really? Because from what they were saying, it sounded like lots of Tatarasuna's history is still unexplained, and most of the information we have now is just from people filling the gaps with their imagination. At least, that's what they thought...)
Black Screen Text: You tell Nahida about the story Aqaba and Sawada are writing...
Nahida: (...Oh? How interesting. Those two managed to deduce quite a lot through guesswork alone.)
Paimon: (So the guessay got it right!?)
Nahida: (Well, they guessed right about one thing: Tatarasuna was sabotaged.)
The Balladeer: Must be a riveting conversation you three are having. Funny how all the good ones happen when I'm not involved.
Paimon: Ah! Wh—What makes you think we're talking to each other?
The Balladeer: Don't insult me. You're having a private conversation without me. Obviously, I must be the topic of said conversation.
Traveler: We have every right to keep certain things confidential.
The Balladeer: Of course you do. You can't have your prisoner knowing too much.
Paimon: So, uh, have you found anything yet?
The Balladeer: Still looking. Don't get your hopes up, though. You and your twin come from outside this world. It wouldn't surprise me if there was nothing on either of you in Irminsul at all.
Paimon: ...Wait, how'd you know about that? Did Nahida tell you?
The Balladeer: It's not like we've never met before. And anyway, you're world-famous. It'd be more surprising if I didn't know a few things about you.
Traveler: Every conversation with you is hard work...
The Balladeer: Right now, we have to keep the peace. I'm not interested in creating more misery for myself, and making cordial conversation is something I can manage.
The Balladeer: ...Huh? Wait...
Paimon: This light... It looks similar to those saplings. What could it be?
The Balladeer: ...Anonymous data?
Paimon: Hey! Don't you forget the agreement. You have to share it with us!
The Balladeer: Shush. Just wait.
Escher: ...Mr. Niwa, are you certain this is worth the risk? We are talking about Tatarasuna's furnace, after all. It may not pay to act rashly...
Niwa: There's no one else who can enter the furnace. It has to be me.
Escher: Is that so...? *sigh* Well, since you insist...
The Balladeer: *gasp*... It's...
Traveler: (That name... Niwa was the man in charge at Tatarasuna. Plus, he belongs to the lineage of Isshin Art...)
Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: ...But your attitude is better than I thought.

## Talk 8

Escher: I have been in Tatarasuna for some time now. You have shown me great hospitality, as has Mikoshi Nagamasa... and indeed, everyone else.
Escher: Under your leadership, Tatarasuna is a warm, welcoming place, like a giant village. People are gainfully employed, their lives have purpose. They are motivated.
Escher: As I understand, the Raiden Shogun has, in recent years, eliminated much of the evil that plagued Inazuma. As for Tatarasuna, it was originally established as a means of safely disposing Crystal Marrow.
Escher: The forging industry with Crystal Marrow as a raw material has since flourished, giving rise to generations of swordsmiths — some world-renowned, others unknown... all passing on their legacy.
Escher: Skills, blood, dreams... Every smith brought into this trade looks to find their purpose between steel and blade. That is why you accepted the proposal brought to you by myself and Akame.
Niwa: Yes, well... Were it not for you coming to Inazuma and happening to make Akame's acquaintance, the two of you never would have joined forces. And he would be the first to admit that there's no way he could have revolutionized our forging process like this on his own — at least not on the same timescale.
Niwa: You allowed Akame to take all the credit for a method that you jointly developed, he sold it to me, and now, every piece of ore here is smelted using the new technique.
Niwa: Even now, you remain one of Tatarasuna's key consultants, working right here alongside us. I believe it is you, Sir, who are truly responsible for the changes in our manufacturing and forging methods.
Escher: You flatter me. From the outset, I saw much that was commendable in the forging industry of Inazuma, and it has been my great honor to befriend you all.
Niwa: So you say, Escher... But is this really the truth?
Escher: My good sir, what do you mean?
Niwa: ...I tried to resist thinking it was all connected because I didn't want to speculate, and I didn't want to believe that things could turn out this way.
Niwa: What have we gained from adopting your new technology? Ominous, black smoke, mounting production problems... Worker fatigue and casualties are up, and continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
Niwa: And recently, as you well know, someone died because of that strange filth inside the furnace. We've kept the truth from spreading outside, but still, I suspect you understand it better than I do.
Niwa: None of the people who went out to get help have come back. Now, our mutual friend, the kabukimono, is taking the golden feather to Narukami Island to seek an audience with the Shogun. This is our last hope.
Niwa: But that doesn't faze you, does it, Escher? Nothing does... Otherwise, why would you still be standing there with that smile on your face?
Escher: I'm just surprised that you finally chose to be so sincere. I'm sure you've been harboring these suspicions for quite some time.
Niwa: ...
Niwa: Mikoshi Nagamasa may have noticed that there was one common denominator among all these events... namely you, Escher. But Mr. Mikoshi is more cautious than I. He does things by the book.
Escher: After all, Nagamasa is the adopted son of Mikoshi Torachiyo, the youkai struck down by the Shogun's own hand. If he truly seeks to redeem his family's honor, an abundance of caution is well-advised.
Niwa: ...You're well-informed on the subtleties of his situation for a mechanic all the way from Fontaine. Are you sure you're not a little overqualified?
Escher: Why, Mr. Niwa, are you suggesting I find a job as a diplomat? Sadly, I am so very attached to my craft...
Niwa: Enough, Escher.
Niwa: I'm here because an evil force is raging inside the furnace, and someone needs to take your new device inside the high-risk zone so we can absorb it and put an end to the problem.
Niwa: ...I'm in charge here, and I'm about to take some responsibility and head inside, probably to my death. But what about you? What are you still doing here?
Escher: Judging from the look in your eyes, you don't seem to trust me.
Niwa: Drop the act. We're past that now. Whoever you are, it looks like your plan to destroy Tatarasuna has worked.
Niwa: I just want to know what you're still doing here. What's left? Don't you have all your answers by now?
Escher: Honestly, I'm just waiting for the right moment.
Escher: A moment like this where you finish talking and I stop you from entering the furnace.
Niwa: Argh! You, you...
Escher: ...Heh, you're a little smarter than I initially gave you credit for.
Escher: I thought I'd disguised myself exceptionally well, at least for the first few days. But to my surprise, you had your people look into my background right from the start.
Escher: It's a long journey from Inazuma to Fontaine, but that didn't stop them. Eventually, they managed to confirm that Escher was an alias, and that I was not from Fontaine at all.
Escher: And yet, despite all of that, you still fail to realize my true identity, and what I seek in Tatarasuna. Did you really think you would be able to see through my plan?
Niwa: ...Ugh... If you kill me, there's no one who can get inside the furnace... So you're really going to destroy this place... is that it?
The Doctor: Oh, but you're quite wrong — there is one other person. Hm, some may not see him as a person, but... you told him yourself: "You're not a puppet. You're a human... you're just missing a heart."
Niwa: ...!
Niwa: Whoever you're working for won't get away with this. They'll be found out. But... this makes no sense. What are you really trying to accomplish by all this? Why go to all this trouble?
The Doctor: It's no trouble at all... Patience is a virtue which I have in abundance. This is all part of a carefully controlled experiment.
The Doctor: If you must know, I am happy to divulge my true identity. I am a Fatui Harbinger. Call me "The Doctor."
Niwa: ...The... Fatui? Who... What do you want...?
The Doctor: Just to create a minor inconvenience for your nation.
Niwa: That's it? THAT's why you... gave us your cursed technology... just to let loose the evil energy from the Crystal Marrow...
The Doctor: Hehe, look how even the righteous soul is filled with venom when faced with its demise.
The Doctor: My device functions precisely as you say. It is the only chance you have of preventing a catastrophe and keeping the truth from the outside world. However... I did not make it with you in mind.
The Doctor: It is easier for a person to be possessed by evil spirits when they are filled with hate. So, give in to your fury... I want to see what happens when a malevolent heart is placed into an unsuspecting puppet.
The Doctor: Make no mistake: Even without you, that pure, innocent puppet would only end up being used by someone else instead. What other reason would a human have for befriending one who is not of our kind?
Niwa: ...*gasping for air*... *gasping for air*... *cough*
Niwa: If you give him... my heart... tell him that both Nagamasa... and I... see him as... one of us.
Niwa: He has nothing to prove to anyone... because not everyone... just wants to use other people. The only ones who think like that... are people like you...
The Doctor: What a beautiful way to see the world. It almost makes me feel a little guilty... Hm, then out of respect for you, I shall redefine myself.
The Doctor: Think of me as a monster or a demon, if you wish... At least this way, your death is not a consequence of your own folly turning you into an easy target. You simply lost to something more powerful than you could ever hope to defeat.
The Doctor: I say, Mr. Niwa, let's see what happens. Will your puppet friend become a human? No, that will prove quite impossible.
The Doctor: ...Mr. Niwa? ...Tsk, already dead. What a pity.
The Doctor: Phew...
The Doctor: Jester, I have completed the task you gave me. Creating a gap and infiltrating Inazuma's inner workings... Heh, what fun it was.
The Doctor: I'd like to introduce a puppet to you. If he proves useful, let's make him our newest comrade. And if not... let's turn him to dust.

## Talk 9

The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: Hey, are you all right?
The Balladeer: ...Dottore? Hahaha... Dottore!!!
The Balladeer: ...
The Balladeer: Good, good...
Paimon: Was that The Doctor? Did he... turn into a mechanic from Fontaine?
Traveler: I'm afraid so.
Paimon: But why did we see things from his perspective...?
Nahida: When I touched The Doctor to confirm whether he'd eliminated all his segments, I read this memory in his mind. You have to admit, it must be the truth.
The Balladeer: Maybe so... But it means nothing.
Nahida: Does it? But this memory shows that Niwa didn't betray you. He never meant for you to be the one to take the device into the furnace.
Nahida: You know very well what that means. Even more so than I.
The Balladeer: ...
Traveler: (This betrayal was a lie that he has believed for hundreds of years. Was this part of The Doctor's experiment?)
Traveler: (If the betrayal never happened... it existed only in his imagination. But where does this leave him?)
Paimon: Let's... give him some space. He looks really mad. Paimon doesn't want to be anywhere near him right now.
Traveler: Okay, let's go over there.
Nahida: (We need to give him some time to process his emotions.)
Paimon: (Paimon's still confused about the Tatarasuna incident. So The Doctor was behind it, but why has that gotten him so worked up?)
Nahida: (Nobody has ever deceived you like that, Paimon. It's natural that you find it difficult to understand. Perhaps he needed to learn this someday.)
Nahida: (So now you have the complete picture. Katsuragi took the kabukimono to live with the people of Tatarasuna. Later, The Doctor showed up, disguised as a mechanic from Fontaine... and that's when the trouble began.)
Nahida: (It was all a horrific experiment planned by The Doctor... Everything he did was just to plant seeds of disaster in Inazuma that would bear fruit in the future.)
Nahida: (Of all the unwitting participants in The Doctor's experiment, The Balladeer became the main test subject.)
Nahida: (After the events you just saw in that memory, The Doctor put Niwa's heart into the device and handed it to The Balladeer. Then, he instructed him to enter the furnace and absorb all the filth caused by the smelting process.)
Nahida: (The load was far beyond what he expected, but The Balladeer survived... He left the furnace in sheer exhaustion and said to the mechanic: "This device seems to have protected me. What's in it?")
Nahida: (The mechanic answered: "Niwa fled this place for fear of punishment, but he left you a gift. He said it's the one thing that you've been looking for... He took it straight from the chest of one of his innocent servants.")
Nahida: (The mechanic removed the withered heart from the device as he spoke.)
Nahida: (The Balladeer was stunned that such unthinkable cruelty had brought him the thing he'd been longing for his entire life. A heart acquired through cold-blooded murder is a cursed thing, but it had protected him from the filth...)
Nahida: (He thought Niwa had completely betrayed him, and yet this very betrayal had ensured his survival. Overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, The Balladeer threw the heart to the ground and left Tatarasuna without looking back.)
Paimon: (Holy moly... So The Doctor killed an innocent man and pinned everything on the victim? That's terrible...)
Traveler: (Being betrayed and abandoned by a close friend is sure to cause great resentment... Now we know what was behind his decision to take revenge on the Raiden Gokaden a hundred years ago.)
Traveler: (But it doesn't mean that vengeance was the right decision...)
Nahida: (Yes. Only if he understands this can he choose a new path forward.)
Traveler: He was the one behind the Tatarasuna incident.

## Talk 10

Sawada: Hmm, I've not given much thought to my target audience yet... Then again, this topic should appeal to readers of all ages, surely?
Aqaba: Yeah, whatever you write, it's sure to be a huge hit! Unlike my paper... Essays are a nightmare to write, and barely anyone reads them. Don't get me wrong — the topic's great, I just wish I could find more information on it...

## Talk 11

Black Screen Text: A while later...
Paimon: Sh—Shall we see how he's doing?
Paimon: Hey, you all right?
The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: That's a scary expression.
The Balladeer: ...Are you worried about me? If we didn't have such a history, I'd almost think that qualifies me to be your friend.
Traveler: We just want to make sure this doesn't affect the plan.
The Balladeer: It won't. I'll keep my end of the deal.
The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: Hey, are you investigating the stuff we wanna know about?
The Balladeer: That's why we're here.
The Balladeer: But unfortunately, there's no information about the Descenders in Irminsul.
Nahida: If even you can't find anything, that seems to confirm it: Irminsul does not keep records on the Descenders. Anyone who comes from beyond this world is not counted as part of Teyvat.
Paimon: Does that mean we have to leave empty-handed...?
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Not unexpected, but still... thank you.
The Balladeer: Don't thank me just yet.
The Balladeer: You look really upset... Heh, well, since Irminsul was a dead end, I guess I can share some other info that might interest you.
Paimon: Huh? About what?
The Balladeer: #The reason why there are records about your {M#sister}{F#brother} in Irminsul... It might have something to do with Khaenri'ah. Apparently, Khaenri'ah was {M#her}{F#his} first destination when {M#she}{F#he} arrived in this world.
The Balladeer: #Plus, {M#she}{F#he} only came to this world because the heavens responded to the summoning.
Paimon: The heavens... responded?
The Balladeer: #The Jester told me this himself. You can take his word on this. He was a royal mage in Khaenri'ah, and lived with your {M#sister}{F#brother} for a time.
Traveler: The Jester, another Fatui Harbinger...
The Balladeer: I don't know the details. It's up to you whether you want to believe me. All I can say is, I wouldn't lie to you about this.
The Balladeer: Did you get all that, Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Nahida: Yes. Astonishing news.
The Balladeer: Does this info count towards my mission? It wasn't from Irminsul, but was it valuable?
Nahida: Very valuable.
The Balladeer: Good. In that case... I'll take some time for myself now.
Paimon: Huh? What have you done?
The Balladeer: Lesser Lord Kusanali was right: My power's all but completely spent. Even if I use all of the divine power left in me, I can't sustain this shield for very long.
The Balladeer: #{NICKNAME}, I shared a secret with you, and now you owe me. So, in return, I'd like you to answer a question for me.
Traveler: What do you want to know?
The Balladeer: Give me your hand.
Traveler: ...!
The Balladeer: (...Can you hear my voice inside your head?)
Traveler: (Are you trying to brainwash me?)
The Balladeer: (No, I can't do anything like that anymore. At most, all I can do is exchange a few words with you.)
The Balladeer: (So tell me: In this world, is it possible... to change the past?)
Traveler: (!!!)
Traveler: (Wait. Why would you ask that...?)
The Balladeer: Done.
Paimon: Huh? What the... What happened? Paimon only saw you hold hands for a second...
The Balladeer: #Nothing. I was just thanking {M#him}{F#her} for helping me.
Traveler: (Wait, that look... Did he see me hesitate? But that was because I know about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...)
Traveler: (Uh-oh, I think... by not denying it immediately, I gave him the answer he needed...)
The Balladeer: So long. I suggest you get yourselves out of here quickly.
Paimon: Where are you going? Hey, wait up! Didn't you say not to go running off!?
Traveler: Balladeer! Stop!
The Balladeer: Fast reaction time. But I don't think we'll be seeing each other again.
The Balladeer: From this day forth, the names "Balladeer" and "kabukimono" will cease to exist.
The Balladeer: ...Those who died in Tatarasuna because of me deserve another chance at life.
Paimon: Hey, Balladeer! Don't do anything stupid!
The Balladeer: You know, I never did like insects. Hordes of the puny things swarming together can be a real nuisance... and I enjoy nothing more than to stamp them out like the pests they are.
The Balladeer: But if a colony of harmless ants isn't threatening anyone, I guess they deserve to be left alone... Luckily, everything can be set right. It's time to solve this once and for all.
Paimon: Balladeer! Balladeeeer!
Paimon: Uh-oh, he disappeared! C'mon, we gotta find him somehow!
Traveler: Paimon, we have to stop him!
Traveler: ...Why?

## Talk 12

Paimon: Oh no, he's really gone...
Nahida: ...Hello? Can you hear me?
Paimon: Nahida!
Nahida: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, Balladeer, what happened just now? I was suddenly cut off by some kind of power...
Paimon: It was The Balladeer's fault! He... he shut you out.
Black Screen Text: You tell Nahida everything that happened...
Nahida: ...I didn't think he'd be capable of something like that with so little power left.
Nahida: Did he keep some of his power hidden when he was defeated? Or... did he achieve something beyond his abilities, and it took everything he had...?
Paimon: Where the heck did he go? It's all our fault, we were supposed to keep an eye on him... Sorry, Nahida...
Nahida: Don't be, it's not your fault. Please let me handle this from here, even though I'm not sure I can solve it.
Nahida: We're running out of time. Follow my lead and get out of Irminsul as soon as possible.

## Talk 13

Paimon: We're out! And we're at... uh, an inn or something?
Nahida: This is an emergency. I'll have to ask you to stay here for now. Everything's arranged, and nobody will disturb you.
Traveler: No, I want to help you!
Nahida: I'm sorry, but this isn't something I need your help with. Leave this one to me.
Paimon: An emergency? How bad is it? Nahida, will you be okay?
Nahida: Don't worry. If my assessment is correct, though there may be some minor disturbances, it won't lead to a disaster. Please rest and recover your strength here until I say it's safe.
Paimon: ...Her voice has gone.
Paimon: Paimon can't shake the feeling that something really big has happened. What do you think The Balladeer meant? And why did he suddenly grab onto you before?
Traveler: (Paimon doesn't remember Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... And The Balladeer's question was a strange one. It's hard to explain in full, and the truth might be very distressing for Paimon...)
Traveler: (I'll skip the part about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata for now, and focus on The Balladeer.)
Black Screen Text: You tell Paimon what The Balladeer asked you, and what he might have been planning...
Paimon: He wants to change the past? But... surely that's impossible.
Traveler: It's not easy, that's for sure.
Paimon: Right! You can't just rewrite history. All that stuff happened already in real life!
Paimon: It's like... Umm, imagine Paimon drank all the water in this inn. Even if no one was there to see it, Paimon would sure as heck remember drinking it.
Traveler: Yeah, great example.
Paimon: Hmm, so why does Paimon still have a bad feeling about this...? Paimon can't help but feel scared about what he might do...
Paimon: *whine* Paimon's so confused...
Traveler: Maybe he wants to erase himself from history.
Paimon: Huh!? ...Aaah!!!
Traveler: Paimon! Are you okay!?
Paimon: Sorry, Paimon accidentally, uh... Aw, it's The Balladeer's fault for causing Paimon all this mental stress!
Paimon: But erasing yourself from history...? It's unthinkable! Is that really possible in Irminsul?
Traveler: Not necessarily, but... maybe.
Paimon: ...Whew... Uh-oh, Paimon's head is overheating from trying to understand what he's up to... and it's still not working!
Paimon: Gaaah!!! Paimon's had it with that little brat! He's been nothing but trouble ever since we met him!
Paimon: There's no way he'll actually succeed, right? Otherwise... won't everyone who's connected to him be affected too?
Traveler: (Indeed. If The Balladeer does erase himself from Irminsul, many people in Inazuma will be affected... I can't imagine what that situation would look like.)
Traveler: (Worst case scenario, it will affect everyone with a connection to the Raiden Gokaden... Kazuha, Ayaka, Ayato... Will this mean that they'll disappear!?)
Paimon: There's nothing we can do about it at this point... Hey, have you got any ideas on what we should do next?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Seems like now there's nothing left for us to do but to go to sleep. But Paimon's still so worried! Paimon won't be able to sleep a wink tonight...
Traveler: Me neither.
Paimon: So how about, uh... w—we list all our favorite foods to take our mind off things? Heck, if that doesn't work, Paimon's probably gonna collapse of anxiety here.
Paimon: Alright, Paimon'll start. First dish, hmmm... Mondstadt Grilled Fish! Oh, and Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Tea Break Pancakes, Cream Stew, Sautéed Matsutake...
Paimon: ...And Jueyun Chili Chicken, Almond Tofu, Satisfying Salad...
Paimon: Ooh, ooh, also Adeptus' Temptation, Golden Shrimp Balls, Triple-Layered Consommé, Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup, and, and...
Paimon: Um... Umm...
Paimon: ...Mm? Huh...
Traveler: Paimon? What's wrong?
Paimon: Uh... What are we... Wh—What was Paimon supposed to be doing just now?
Paimon: Paimon was, um... talking...? Huh, Paimon suddenly can't remember what she was talking about. What was it, again?
Traveler: You were getting so worried about the situation with The Balladeer...
Paimon: Hmm? The Balladeer...?
Paimon: Is that a food, too? Huh... Weird name, though...
Traveler: (...!?)
Traveler: (Paimon doesn't remember The Balladeer!? That must mean... he actually pulled it off?)
Traveler: (But how did he have that ability? This doesn't make sense...)
Paimon: What's wrong? Your eyes are like saucers... Was it something Paimon said?
Traveler: No, it's nothing.
Paimon: So, The Balladeer... Is that someone's name? 'Cuz it sounds like a nickname or something.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (If this is really happening... I need to know what else has changed.)
Traveler: Paimon, come with me.
Paimon: Hmm? Okay, sure! Where are we going?
Traveler: I want to go back to Inazuma.
Paimon: Huh? Fine by Paimon, but... is everything okay? You're acting like this is an emergency.
Traveler: Now's not the time to explain...
Traveler: Let's get over there first.
Traveler: ...that you started listing foods.
Traveler: I'm just guessing here.
Traveler: Isn't there anything I can do?
