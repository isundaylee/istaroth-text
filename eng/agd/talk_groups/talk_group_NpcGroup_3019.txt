## Talk

Owada: When will today end... Ack, you scared me!
Owada: Are... are you here to report something?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Owada: I'm the Yoriki of the Police Station, the superior of every Doushin here. Just call me Owada.
Owada: The Police Station is in charge of keeping order and peace. If you see anything out of order, you can come here and report it to us...
Owada: That being said, I still hope that nothing comes up. May the Electro Archon bless us all.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you get a lot of reports?
Owada: Shush! Stop saying that word. If there were indeed reports every day, do you think we could handle it?
Owada: I'm getting too old for this. I only wish to clock out on time daily and retire peacefully...
Owada: Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not slacking off. I have been in this line of work for far too long and have seen everything. I just want the world to be peaceful so that everyone can live happily in peace. Wouldn't that be great?
Owada: The less crime we have, the better... And if it's a case about losing your pet, please visit Ryuuji at the detective agency for help.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Owada: Goodbye. Stay safe.

## Talk

Traveler: Ryuuji?
Owada: Ryuuji is from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency, and he's an old acquaintance of mine.
Owada: Back when he was the victim of a frame job, I wanted to do something, but sadly, my power was limited...
Owada: Luckily, he met the president of that detective agency, who helped to clear his name.
Owada: Anyway, it's best that we don't see another case like that one... or any cases at all. Yeah.
