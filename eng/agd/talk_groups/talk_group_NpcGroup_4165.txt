Traveler: And you are...
Behaim: I am... *sigh* I don't remember. Guess I am just a graybeard drifting in the wind.
Behaim: When I was a young lad, I met a girl from Sumeru in a place where the wind blew.
Behaim: Who would have thought that this girl, beautiful as a flower in the spring, was the captain of a merchant fleet!
Behaim: I was mesmerized by her, and followed her to the home of trees and flowers. I lived a life that was more delightful than in the most romantic poetry.
Behaim: Now she is gone like a spring flower in the wind... and I'm still here.

Traveler: The past?
Behaim: Yes, those things of the past...
Behaim: I'm old. My memory is like drawings in the sand, easily erased by the wind.
Behaim: Thankfully, under the blessings of Lord Barbatos, the story of me and her is still traveling with the wind.
Behaim: The past that I still remember is like the lingering wind. It is still lively but will suddenly dissipate at some point.
Behaim: Haha, I should visit the nearby carpenter shop to make a sign that has "Where the Wind Lingers" carved on it. Then I'll put it up in front of my house. What do you say?
Behaim: That way, even if I become truly senile one day and forget everything, I'll at least have this to find my way home.
