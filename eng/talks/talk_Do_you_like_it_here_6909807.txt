Traveler: Do you like it here?
Clorinde: Don't worry, I'm not picky about my surroundings.
Clorinde: How noisy or crowded a place might be... Those factors are inconsequential. I'm not easily affected by my external environment.
Clorinde: Most importantly... I've found no threats to our survival in this place. You've done well.
Traveler: Um... Thanks?
Clorinde: Think nothing of it. I should be the one thanking you for keeping this place so safe.
Clorinde: In any case, thank you for inviting me to this place.
Clorinde: I'll be staying here for a little longer. I hope my being here doesn't inconvenience you.
Traveler: We are in The Realm Within, after all.
Clorinde: Its mechanical principles and aesthetic design are both quite commendable. This place is truly eye-opening.
Traveler: ...Am I supposed to laugh?
Clorinde: Ah, that's entirely up to you. Different people have different senses of humor. I don't know what you find amusing, so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to give you an answer.
