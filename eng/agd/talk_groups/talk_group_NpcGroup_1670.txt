Knotty: So cold... Huh? Is that someone trying to talk to me, or is it the cold making me delirious again?
Knotty: ...Okay, I guess I wasn't hallucinating after all. Well, what is it?

Traveler: Who might you be?
Knotty: What, can't you tell? I'm an elite member of the Treasure Hoarders... Achoo!
Knotty: ...Our boss reckons that this inhospitable mountain must be home to lots of treasure, and I was sent here to scout out the way... Never expected it to be this cold, though.
Knotty: Hmph. You here for the treasure too?
Knotty: Go if you want to, I'm not going to stop you. But once you do, you'll know just how cold this place is... Achoo!

Traveler: Are you alright?
Knotty: This place is terrifying... I went up the mountain once — not only did I find nothing, but I've basically turned into a popsicle to boot...
Knotty: Man, I could go for a bowl of hot soup right about now...
Knotty: ...Ah, that's good stuff. Can you smell that?
Knotty: There's a campsite just ahead, and the chef there is always making soup. I can smell it from all the way over here...

Traveler: Why don't you go have a bowl?
Knotty: I know what our reputation's like around here. Everyone thinks we're a bunch of reprobate crooks...
Knotty: ...Well, if that's what we are, then we should act the part! I'm an elite member to boot. How can I just act all meek and mild over a bowl of soup...
Knotty: Achoo! Achoo! ACHOO!
Knotty: Ugh, a bowl of hot soup in this weather would be an archon-send and no mistake...
Knotty: ...N—No! This is a matter of pride. A test of will! I will not give in. I can't... give in...
