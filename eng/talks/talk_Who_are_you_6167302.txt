# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Nantuck: My name is Nantuck, one of the people in charge of the Mondstadt Fishing Association.
Nantuck: Huh, from the looks of you, you appear to have recognized me for my other role. Ah, so this is the frightening power of fame, eh?
Nantuck: Well then, there's no point pretending. That's right! The famed sea-life author Nantuck â€” that's me!
Nantuck: ...Eh? You've never read anything I've ever written? Well, that's because I haven't published anything yet. But fret not! A great work by yours truly will soon sweep across the literary markets, that much I can guarantee.
Nantuck: And if you'd like, I'd happily put you first in line when my first signing session comes up.
