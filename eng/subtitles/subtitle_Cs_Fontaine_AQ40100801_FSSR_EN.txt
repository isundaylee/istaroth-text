My thanks to you both
I will take it from here
Sure you don't need a hand?
Quite sure
Wow...
So what's your secret, hmm? Let me guess...
Who knows
Maybe it's just your sense of responsibility
Sounds about right
A day may come when the prophecy is fulfilled
And the waters burst forth...
But it is not this day
This ancient power could easily obliterate an entire race...
The tsunami of fury
Would unleash endless catastrophe
This sentence is too severe
Forgive me for overruling it
