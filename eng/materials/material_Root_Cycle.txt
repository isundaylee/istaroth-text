# Root Cycle

One of the keys designed by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo for the tower. When combined, the keys form a peculiar shape of three and a half circles, for which there is a special explanation.
The innermost circle is the Cycle of Hyperborea, symbolizing the age when the world was frozen and the lost paradise.
