Neuvillette: "The smuggling case was solved by the joint forces of the Gardes and Marechaussee Phantom..." This is the one.
Neuvillette: The list of involved suspects should be... Ah, found it.
Paimon: What does it say?
Neuvillette: The principal offenders Domenico, Inika, Youna and others have been caught. They have been sent to the Fortress of Meropide following trial.
Neuvillette: Those with close connections or mutual interests with the offenders but who did not participate in the case will not stand trial.
Neuvillette: Among them, surveillance of Esseim has ceased on account of his good behavior. All other personnel remain on our watchlist.
Paimon: So many names... Is the one who sent that threatening letter to Kiara on the list?
Neuvillette: Yes. There's something suspicious about Esseim, to be precise.
Neuvillette: It seems like he's closely related to the core members of the smuggling case, and he moves around without much restriction.
Traveler: Should we tell Navia about this?
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette, someone claiming to be from the Spina di Rosula just checked in with us.
Sedene: He said and I quote, "We have located the suspect. They're chatting at the café."
Paimon: Huh? How did Navia find them so quickly? We've only just figured out the suspect's name...
Neuvillette: I too am perplexed. The café isn't too far from here. We should head over and take a look.
