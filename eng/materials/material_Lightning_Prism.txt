# Lightning Prism

An Electro Hypostasis channels nearby elemental energy to repair damaged elemental entities. Contains the essence of Electro energy.
An ordinary prism separates white light into its component colors; a Lightning Prism, however, channels flowing energies and weaves them into lightning. It will continue to do so even after the Electro Hypostasis has been defeated.
