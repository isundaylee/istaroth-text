# Ninken by the Shore

Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
Thoma: You're a vicious little thing, aren't you? You almost bit me again!
Thoma: Look at you, wasting away... you must wanna eat a little something?
Thoma: You don't have to come back with us, but c'mon â€” a dog's gotta eat, right?
Thoma: You're not worried it's poisoned, are you? Here, I'll take the first bite.
Thoma: See? Delicious and poison-free.
Traveler: Thoma...
Thoma: Come on, just have a bite. A little tiny bite, and then I'll leave you alone, how's that sound?
Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof!
Thoma: Looks like it has zero intention of eating the food we brought... Is it just me, or does it look kind of on edge?
Thoma: Maybe it's something in the sea... Or something nearby that's got him on alert.
Traveler: Those monsters, perhaps?
Thoma: You think he was attacked by monsters... Hmm, it's possible.
Thoma: People do tend to lose their appetite in dangerous situations. Maybe it's the same for dogs, too. Let's clear out the area on behalf of our canine companion here.
Thoma: #Thanks for helping out. This place should be a little more tranquil now, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: You're really putting yourself out there...
