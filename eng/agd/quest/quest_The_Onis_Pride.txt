# The Oni's Pride


## Talk 1

Arataki Itto: Okay... Looks like we lost 'em
Arataki Itto: Hang in there, homies... Hang in there...

## Talk 2

Arataki Itto: As boss of the Arataki Gang, getting rescued by my own boys feels... pretty humiliating.
Arataki Itto: I promise to never let you down, boys! Alright, we've got some footprints to follow. Let's find Takuya!
Paimon: It was real touching and all, what they did, but those few guys weren't much of a gang...
Arataki Itto: Hey, it takes Mora to run a gang, okay? They're all I've got for now.

## Talk 3

Arataki Itto: Huh? Is it just me, or are there more and more footprints here?
Arataki Itto: At least we know we're headed the right way. Let's see what else we can find ahead.

## Talk 4

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.

## Talk 5

Arataki Itto: A wrecked cart and some goods...
Arataki Itto: Look alive, we've got company!

## Talk 6

Arataki Itto: Seems they definitely don't want us going any further.
Arataki Itto: Let's see what's waiting for us up ahead.

## Talk 7

Arataki Itto: Huh, besides the footprints, there are other signs of life here, too. Must be plenty going on around here...
Arataki Itto: Let's investigate. They couldn't have just disappeared into thin air... unless they're all ninjas or something.

## Talk 8

Arataki Itto: Heh, a child that made some poor choices...
Arataki Itto: Anyway, let's get going. While we still have time.

## Talk 9

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.

## Talk 10

Granny Oni: Just leave everything to me now.
Granny Oni: It looks like Granny Oni's about to get a few more oni to look after.

## Talk 11

Masato: I still think you should leave it alone... they're too dangerous.
Masato: Never mind the goods, I'm lucky just to have escaped with my life.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Well, he's pretty...
Paimon: Weird, but at least he's not a bad guy.

## Talk 13

Arataki Itto: We can't get caught here.
Arataki Itto: Looks like I'm up to bat. Just wait here, and we'll escape together when the time's right.
Arataki Itto: Whatever you do, don't attack any of the Tenryou Commission or they'll be after you too.

## Talk 14

Arataki Itto: They gotta pass through here some time. So let's just hang tight for a while.
Arataki Itto: If I'm not mistaken, they'll be showing up any time now.
Paimon: Yeah, things might get a little rough, so we'd better be prepared.
Paimon: Oh, here they come!
Arataki Itto: Yeah, there they are. And one of them has horns.
Arataki Itto: Alright, it's go time. Let's get 'em!

## Talk 15

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.

## Talk 16

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.
