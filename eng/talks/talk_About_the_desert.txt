Traveler: About the desert...
Darina: I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
Darina: Not to mention the dangers that the sandstorms pose, and the ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
Darina: According to some legends, there used to be no desert in Sumeru, and it was the battle between King Deshret and the Greater Lord that created the desert...
Darina: Oh, but I don't really care how the desert was formed. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
Darina: That's when we Traveling Merchants will be able to do business more safely, after all.
