Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Marjorie: A music festival? Didn't we just hold the Windblume Festival?
Paimon: This one's taking place in Inazuma, Marjorie, and it's a serious musical exchange! If you've got any tunes you like, we can play it for you right here and now.
Marjorie: Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't remember this one's name, but could you play it if I were to just hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Marjorie: Oh, that'd be grand!

Traveler: How was that?
Marjorie: This tune is so gentle, just the way I remember it.
Marjorie: My dad used to play this one for me on his harmonica while we were on the way back from Springvale.
Marjorie: He said that this tune represented Springvale itself, and that's where Dad's dad grew up.
Marjorie: Shame that my grandfather would pass before I was ever born.
Marjorie: Thanks for playing that music. You know what? I've decided that I should spend a bit more time with my dad. He's an adventurer, so he tends to spend time out in the field.
Marjorie: So, if you don't mind, I might have to give this festival a pass, but if there's another opportunity, I'll come — and drag him along as well!

Traveler: Do you know anything about presents?
Marjorie: Presents? I've got a lot here. But what do you need them for?
Traveler: Rudolf wants to give someone a present.
Marjorie: Rudolf? A present? Well sure, I've got a lot of good stuff here... But couldn't you at least tell me who the present is for?
Marjorie: "Someone" doesn't exactly give me a lot to go on.
Marjorie: For Jilliana? I see, so it's for Rudolf's wife.
Marjorie: Let me think. Ah, yes, I do have a present that she'll definitely like.
Marjorie: That said... Hehe, did you bring enough money? This present will run you 900 Mora.
Traveler: A present for Jilliana...
Marjorie: A present for Jilliana? From you, I presume? You do need to tell me who it's from, because it makes quite a difference in what I'd recommend.
Marjorie: Oh, it's from Rudolf... Hmm...
Traveler: Rudolf wants to give Jilliana a present...
Marjorie: Oh ho. You're quite experienced in helping people choose presents, aren't you? Your conditions are very clear — I can work with this.
Marjorie: So this is a present that Rudolf wants to give to his wife Jilliana, right?

Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Marjorie: You want to sell treasure? That's quite a surprise.
Marjorie: I imagine that an adventurer as skilled as you must have some truly rare goods to sell.
Marjorie: Let me have a look.
Black Screen Text: You tell Marjorie about the Dragonbone Orb.
Marjorie: Huh, isn't this what the bards called the "Fretnaught Fruit"?
Marjorie: To think that it really exists... So its real name is the Dragonbone Orb.
Marjorie: If its effects are as you say, I'd be willing to pay 80,000 Mora and some specialty dishes for it.
Marjorie: Hmm... How does 80,000 Mora and 5 Moon Pies sound to you?
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Marjorie: Hehe. I mean, it's such a unique treasure.
Marjorie: Why, it has abilities straight out of a fairy tale! I doubt those alchemists would be loath to part with their Mora.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Marjorie: I'll take this, then. Thanks for your patronage!
Marjorie: Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.
Marjorie: As such, it might be best to cover it with a diaphragm or place it within a sealed container to ensure its quality.
Marjorie: I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
Marjorie: If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Marjorie: Sure, no problem. Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
Marjorie: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

Traveler: About the Dragonbone Orb...
Marjorie: How about it? Told you that my price was the best, hehe!
Marjorie: If you sell it to me, my price is 80,000 Mora and 5 Moon Pies. Sounds reasonable, yes?
Traveler: It's yours.
Marjorie: I'll take it, then. Thanks for your patronage!
Marjorie: Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.

Marjorie: I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
Marjorie: If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
Traveler: Let me think about it one more time.
Marjorie: Sure, aren't you the careful sort? Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
Marjorie: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

Traveler: Tell me about your wares.
Marjorie: Which one caught your eye? Every item here is unique. Every purchase here is a bargain!
Marjorie: They were all purchased from the adventurers. Each of them represents the passion and courage of these adventurers—
Marjorie: So don't bother asking for a discount. You can never discount passion and courage!

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: How did you come to own this shop?
Marjorie: Why did I open this shop, you ask? It's because of my dad.
Marjorie: He's the Master of the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch. He always brings tons of treasures after each adventure.
Marjorie: He'll then tell me the story behind each of the treasures... He was my hero when I was little.
Marjorie: I wanted to share these stories with everyone, so I opened this shop—
Marjorie: But not long after opening, my dad became a bit more doddery and talks to himself all day...

Traveler: Did I hear you talk about Wolvendom?
Marjorie: Oh, yes. I did see something strange in Wolvendom not long ago.
Marjorie: From the silhouette, it seemed to be a boy, but he was with a pack of wolves, and they seemed very close, too...
Marjorie: Perhaps I was mistaken. I was quite a distance away, after all, and it was only a glimpse.
Marjorie: I mean, how could humans live alongside wolves? How strange...
