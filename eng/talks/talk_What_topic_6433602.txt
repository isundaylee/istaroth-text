Traveler: What topic?
Nabati: It's about the belief of Children of the Forest near Vimara Village...
Nabati: According to my inference, it must be because wild vegetables grow luxuriantly here, and they were anthropomorphized... That's how the Children of the Forest came to be.
Nabati: *sigh* Jokes aside, this topic is far less interesting than studying the human body...
