# Mortal Pursuit


## Talk 1

Paimon: Look! There's a chunk of solid phlogiston right over that spout!

## Talk 2

Chasca: Hmm... We need a clear shot. Let's get rid of these obstacles first.

## Talk 3

Mutota: Chasca, you're finally back! Things are getting really tense in the tribe. Have you made any headway with your investigation?
Allpa: Some people think we arrested the merchants just to support the flying squad and crack down on the Phlogiston Wings.
Traveler: If things are still escalating even though we've rounded up the merchants...
Chasca: We've found some promising leads, but there's a major obstacle standing between us and the irrefutable evidence we need...
Black Screen Text: Chasca explains what you found out about Tepal, and your theory about the airborne workshop...
Mutota: A relic from the Cinder City? Ugh... so Och-Kan's still managing to sow discord, even after all these years...
Allpa: An airborne workshop... and a hot air balloon above the trial arena... And that's where you're trying to get to now?
Traveler: Any ideas how we can get up there?
Allpa: Neither Phlogiston Wings nor a qucusaur can take you that high up. Do you really think that's where Tepal is hiding?
Mutota: Hmm... You know what... There might just be a way.
Paimon: Really!?
Mutota: Do you still remember those spouts in the arena? When they were all blocked, the gaseous phlogiston was trapped and unable to flow.
Mutota: But now, it's flowing freely. If we were to block them up again...
Chasca: You mean... All of them except the one at the very top of the arena? To build up the pressure there?
Mutota: Precisely. With all the gaseous phlogiston flowing through one spout, it would create a high-pressure wind current...
Paimon: And then we just ride it up into the sky.
Mutota: Yes. It has its risks, but with Chasca's abilities, I think she could manage it...
Allpa: It's an extremely risky approach... but I agree that it's feasible.
Mutota: If you want to give it a try, check with Inkanak at the trial grounds. She can explain how to block the spouts.
Mutota: Chasca... If anyone has a hope of seizing this evidence from the high heavens, it is you.
Traveler: Maybe there are other parties out there fanning the flames too?

## Talk 4

Coyllur: Although I get where they're coming from, isn't bad-mouthing the qucusaurs going a step too far?
Zhunan: But without the Phlogiston Wings, I'll never make it...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Ugh... Oof... Paimon's never flown that fast before... She feels ready to throw up...
Traveler: At least we made it in one piece.
Chasca: Ah-hah... just as I thought. It might look like a regular hot air balloon from the outside, but up close, it's clearly been heavily remodeled.
Chasca: And sure enough, it only descended below the cloud line because the custom-built machinery malfunctioned.
Traveler: Can you tell what the issue is?
Chasca: I should be able to figure it out, with Tepal's notebook. Thankfully, I know a little DIY from fixing up my guns when they're having issues.
Chasca: Mm-hmm... That should just about do it. Now all it needs is a nice, hard kick...
Paimon: Uh... Maybe that works on your guns, but...
Paimon: Huh!? We're really moving!

## Talk 6

Xilonen: Hmm? How's the sleuthing going?
Traveler: We're good for now. How is Puma doing?
Xilonen: Hanging in there â€” she seems to have calmed down now. I'll check in with her again later.
Xilonen: I think something about handing you that notebook meant she was finally able to let go of a few things. So maybe this was for the best.

## Talk 7

Huascar: No more qucusaurs! We want Phlogiston Wings!
Mukki: Have you gone mad? The qucusaurs are our partners!

## Talk 8

Mutota: We'll do our best to manage the conflict within the tribe while you're gone. Hopefully it'll buy you some time.
Allpa: Chief, we should put a defense plan in place... just in case.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #It actually worked... But wait, how are Paimon and Traveler supposed to get up there?
Chasca: Coya can give you a lift. She's actually been following us this whole time.
Coya: ...
Paimon: Wow... Paimon didn't notice at all!
Traveler: Why didn't she come and join us?
Chasca: Probably because she didn't want to get too close to humans... Or maybe just me. But right now, we need her power.
Coya: Cheep...
Paimon: Whoa! You didn't even have to summon her...
Coya: ...Cheep.
Chasca: Yes, up there... That's probably where Chime is.
Chasca: Alright. Let's go have a little talk with this Tepal.

## Talk 10

Black Screen Text: You hurry to the trial arena and explain the situation to Inkanak...
Inkanak: Goodness me... That is a very bold idea...
Chasca: Maybe so, but we have to act fast. What's the quickest way for us to block off the spouts?
Inkanak: From a technical perspective, I'd have to advise taking some measurements and carefully planning this out first... But I'm guessing that's not what you want to hear?
Traveler: Right.
Inkanak: ...Then we'll have to take the rough-and-ready approach. See the solid phlogiston over there?
Inkanak: Our prior inspections revealed that some kind of stable structure has formed inside, making it highly damage-resistant...
Inkanak: It's not without its weak points, but unless they're all struck at the same time, the structural integrity won't be threatened...
Paimon: So... what happens if we do strike them all at once?
Inkanak: It'll collapse.
Chasca: ...Okay, I see where you're going with this.
Inkanak: Yeah, you got it! As long as you hit all the weak spots at once from the right angle, the solid phlogiston will fall right on top of the spout, and block it up.
Chasca: You're right about "rough and ready"... Sounds like my kind of plan.

## Talk 11

Inkanak: As long as you hit all the weak spots at once from the right angle, the solid phlogiston will fall right on top of the spout, and block it up.
