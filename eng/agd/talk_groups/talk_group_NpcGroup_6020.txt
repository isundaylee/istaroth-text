Alom: Sorry, I haven't heard of any good mining outcrops lately. Perhaps they've all been mined already.

Alom: Looking for intel on where to find ores around this neck of the woods, huh? I know some places where you can often find Condessence Crystals, but I can't leave right now. Are you able to gather them yourself?
Alom: I'll mark any such location on your map so you can go there and check things out. Be careful though.

Traveler: What beat?
Alom: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just playing some intense music in my head — the kind that's perfect for forging.
Alom: I'm guessing you can't hear it? It's a pity that I'm tone-deaf as well, or I'd try singing it for you.
Alom: But feel free to stand by and listen to the rhythm of my ironworking. Just think of it as a form of street music.

Alom: I'm not sure why, but this kind of rhythm helps relieve my fatigue from all the repetitive toil. Really keeps my energy levels up, you know?
Alom: Yeah, stone can sometimes serve as a musical instrument.
