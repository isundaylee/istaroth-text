# Inspiration Eruption

Buies: This type of game sure is inspiring, hahaha!
Traveler: What new game?
Buies: Traveler! Good timing! I happen to need someone to playtest my new game.
Buies: Look here. I'm calling this game "Inspiration Eruption."
Buies: It perfectly captures the entire process of how we poets create poetry!
Traveler: You mean drinking, drinking, and more drinking?
Traveler: Enlighten me.
Buies: Hahaha, hilarious. Though using wine to let one's creative juices flow is certainly a good idea.
Buies: However, wine alone is not enough to inspire truly extraordinary poetry.
Buies: Before we write a poem, we have to start by seeking out inspiration.
Buies: Some like to travel, some prefer solitude, while others... really enjoy using wine to stimulate their creativity.
Buies: This is the most challenging part, since we cannot pinpoint where inspiration lies.
Buies: So most of the time we feel like we haven't found our muse, and become anxious and depressed...
Buies: But in truth, inspiration has already visited us and left its mark inside our heads without us ever knowing.
Buies: At the right juncture, they will come bursting out and take the form of a great poem... or a painting... or something else.
Traveler: And you can turn all that into a game?
Buies: Hahaha! Of course! The process of making poetry is quite clear and easily understood.
Buies: It just so happens that there are a few tabletop game designers in Mondstadt interested in my ideas.
Buies: After some discussions and a few brainstorming sessions, we finally came up with "Inspiration Eruption"!
Buies: You can try it right now if you're interested.
Buies: Play a few rounds, and maybe you'll become a poet yourself!
