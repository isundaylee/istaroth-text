# Pita Pocket

A bread with varied fillings. The flat dough has puffed up in the oven, reminding you of a lovely Pufferfish. The bread is usually cut in the middle into two separate "pockets," hence the name, "Pita Pocket." It is said that people of Sumeru used to dip the bread in sauce. But nowadays, people usually stuff the "pockets" with different fillings and then take big mouthfuls.
