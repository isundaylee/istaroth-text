Traveler: What kind of story would you like to hear?
Futaba: Granny always tells me scary stories. I'd like to listen to something different this time! Something to do with gods and legends...
Futaba: Wait, are you saying that the Anemo Archon is a drunkard, and that Geo Archon never takes Mora along when he goes out? Erm... are you just messing with me?
Futaba: I think I'll just go and listen to Granny's stories.
