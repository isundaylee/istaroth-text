# Any Unsolved Mysteries?


## Talk 1

Paimon: This place sure looks pretty normal.
Paimon: Guess there won't be anything to eat here...
Traveler: Don't give yourself away too soon, Paimon.
Paimon: *cough* Wâ€”Well, y'know, looking for secrets is hungry work! Everyone knows that!
Paimon: And anyway, we've recently been eating barbecue a lot to save time. Aren't you sick of that already?
Paimon: If we can find some shells or conches, we can stew them with some fruit.
Paimon: They'll be fresh and sweet and springy...
Traveler: That sounds pretty terrible. Not my cup of tea.
Paimon: Come on, give it go! It might open a whole new culinary world to you!
Paimon: #Wait a moment! Look over there, Traveler.
Paimon: That's weird, that device just appeared all of a sudden.
Paimon: And there's some luggage nearby, too. Is that Fatui gear?
Traveler: Huh. Right on the Mora, Paimon. Good work.
Paimon: Right? Paimon was right on the Mora...
Paimon: Waaait a moment. There's nothing good about this discovery!
Paimon: If this is Fatui business, then there's gotta be some scheme afoot!
Paimon: If we leave this thing be, things might eventually get out of control.
Paimon: Whatever the case, let's see what we can do about that device first. If you think we should, let's have a look through that Fatui gear.
Paimon: #Let's do this like we always do, Traveler, and then we can kick back and start looking for something to eat instead!
Traveler: Sounds like how you'd taste, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon isn't some aquacultural product!
Traveler: Well, that's your enthusiasm explained...

## Talk 2

Remnant Records: I: Wow, how surprising, that something assembled with spare parts could actually be so powerful.
Remnant Records: I: We'll deal with it according to our orders from above.
Remnant Records: I: After it is cleaned up, we'll throw it in the shallows.
Remnant Records: I: Once buried in the sea sand, its energy should quickly drain out.
Remnant Records: I: The device will probably still affect nearby areas... but it should stop working after a while and make no further trouble.
Remnant Records: I: ...
Paimon: Hmm... Many records are lost, and these pages are all that remain.
Paimon: D'you think these notes were left by the Fatui?
Paimon: "We'll deal with it according to our orders from above." Could this be a destruction guide for the device assembled with spare parts?
Paimon: The destruction process is just to "leave it in the shallows" ...Paimon thinks it means to bury it by the seashore.
Paimon: But didn't the Fatui make these devices in the first place? Why destroy them?
Traveler: Maybe there's some conflict between factions.
Paimon: Inside the Fatui? That's hard to imagine...
Paimon: But the mechanism wasn't mentioned in the notes at all. What on earth is that...
Paimon: Why don't we have a look around? There might be other records nearby!
Traveler: Maybe it's because of some personal beef.
Paimon: Is... is that so? Paimon guesses the Fatui are actually quite complicated...
