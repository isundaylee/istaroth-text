Okazaki Rikuto: Hello there, youngster. Have you attended the festival that the Yashiro Commission and Yae Publishing House have organized in Ritou?
Okazaki Rikuto: I've heard that it's very well done indeed and that it's been very popular amongst the youngsters. Even a store run by an old codger like myself got quite a lot of customers who came for the festival.
Okazaki Rikuto: Everyone's all dressed up to nines and in high spirits, to boot.
Okazaki Rikuto: Which is good, of course, very good! It feels like Inazuma itself is growing younger once more, haha!
