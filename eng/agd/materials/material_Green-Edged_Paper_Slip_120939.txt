# Green-Edged Paper Slip

A special "pass" with green patterns drawn along its edges. It is not clear exactly what material this is made of, and it makes a rustling noise when you rub it. On one corner, it reads "If you have picked this up accidentally, please return it promptly to..." A small map has also been drawn on it.
