Shushan: Chenyu Vale is full of noteworthy treasures... But in my opinion, the jade and ores are the most precious.
Shushan: I stumbled upon an area rich in ores while on a stroll the other day.
Shushan: Qiaoying Village is in no way lacking ores right now, so feel free to take a look for any you might need...

Traveler: You are?
Shushan: Hmm? Why, aren't you an intelligent-looking youngster?
Shushan: I'm Shushan. The trustiest stonemasons of Chenyu Vale have come from my family for generations now, ever since the time of my ancestors.
Shushan: Many of the local stone buildings were built by my family.
Shushan: Even after retiring, I still haven't found an apprentice worthy of inheriting my skills...

Traveler: Craftsmanship?
Shushan: The craftsmanship of cutting and transporting stones, the techniques required to carve on stone surfaces... These are only some of the many things a stonemason needs to learn to perfect their craft.
Shushan: There's not only jade to be found around here. All manner of high-quality stone lie in this vale, the best materials for building roads and houses.
Shushan: I'm not the only stonemason around these parts, but I'm sure everyone would want their family craft, passed down from generation to generation, to continue shining brightly.
Shushan: Am I wrong?

Traveler: Young people, you say?
Shushan: You need skill and stamina to work with stone. Your body won't be able to cope unless you start training from a young age.
Shushan: But some youngsters are too eager for success and end up taking the wrong path...
Shushan: After learning some fancy skills from elsewhere, they carve and polish pure white stones to make mementos, which they then sell to outsiders...
Shushan: Such things are nice to keep as a souvenir if reasonably priced, but they're not worth it at all if they're too expensive.
Shushan: After all, ordinary stone is not the equal of jade. It should be used to build ordinary houses, roads, and bridges.
