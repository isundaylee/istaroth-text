Traveler: Is something the matter?
Cadmael: Well, I failed my flight test. It went horribly. I couldn't fly well at all — in fact, I didn't even make it up to the clouds.
Cadmael: That makes it the second time now... To be honest, this is all pretty discouraging.
Cadmael: I know "second time" isn't a lot for many riders — but it's not a good sign all the same.
Cadmael: When I think about my tribespeople who've wasted the best half of their lives without success, throwing themselves into flying for years on end... I'm kinda scared that I'll become like them.
Cadmael: Perhaps... I have to just accept the fact that I'm "Wingless" and get out of here...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Cadmael: I just hope I'll make the right decision... And I hope you do, too.

Traveler: But you haven't left yet, have you?
Cadmael: Yeah. I mean, I haven't completely lost all faith just yet.
Cadmael: I wouldn't be pacing here like this otherwise, would I?
Cadmael: Am I really cut out to be a rider? Do I really have the talent? Is one mistake going to ruin everything for me?
Cadmael: I know this idea may seem childish and like a waste of time to our elders, but people have to take responsibility for their own lives.
