## Talk

Arapandu: #Varuna Contraption, with the sun shining; and Traveler Contraption, with the moon shining?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you talking about?
Arapandu: #Ah, it's Nara Traveler.
Arapandu: #Nara Traveler healed Varuna Contraption, so the trees and seeds are lively again.
Arapandu: #That's why we are naming Varuna Contraption as Traveler Contraption, to show our thanks.
Arapandu: But that would break Nara Varuna's heart, if Nara Varuna comes back.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arapandu: #Hmm, hard to name it. Arapandu will tell Nara Traveler when the name is ready.
