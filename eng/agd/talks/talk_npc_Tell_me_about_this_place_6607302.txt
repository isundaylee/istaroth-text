Traveler: Tell me about this place...
Kupo Nui: We've got a pretty great location, wouldn't you agree?
Kupo Nui: It used to be just an old house owned by my family, but Miss Amina took note of the wonderful scenery here, and suggested that I turn the place into a restaurant.
Kupo Nui: It was a fantastic idea. We've had steady business ever since we opened. It seems like both locals and tourists really enjoy having some drinks by the beach.
Kupo Nui: The only problem is that I've always had problems securing staff. I have a big family, but only a few of them are interested in helping out.
Kupo Nui: So I always tell everyone to help themselves. You can even bring your own ingredients and cook by yourself, we won't charge you anything extra.
