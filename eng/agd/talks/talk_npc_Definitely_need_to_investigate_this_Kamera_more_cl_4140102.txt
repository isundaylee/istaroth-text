Ji Tong: Definitely need to investigate this Kamera more closely...
Traveler: Claim Fortune Trove
Ji Tong: How have the photos turned out? Let me see...
Traveler: Where did you get this Kamera?
Ji Tong: Oh, I bought it off a merchant from Fontaine.
Ji Tong: He said this model prints photos with a unique effect, which is certain to make it catch on.
Ji Tong: I took him at his word, but I quickly discovered that I don't recognize anything that this Kamera prints...
Ji Tong: Maybe I'm using it wrong? But I don't know how to track him down, ugh...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Ji Tong: Bye... Ugh, this Kamera, such a konundrum...
