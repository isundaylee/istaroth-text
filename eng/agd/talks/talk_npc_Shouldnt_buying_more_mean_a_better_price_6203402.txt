Uncle Gao: Shouldn't buying more mean a better price?
Uncle Gao: It's my fish, I'll do as I wish!
Uncle Gao: These fish are as fresh as they come! Buy one and it's good for you. Buy two and that's a deal. Buy three and you're practically stealing from me! More sales means more Mora, got it?
Uncle Gao: Besides, the more fish I sell means the fewer fish I have, and fewer fish means a higher price. Don't you get the principle of "limited supply"? These are fair prices.
Uncle Gao: I have only one thing to say to people like you: either buy something or scram!
