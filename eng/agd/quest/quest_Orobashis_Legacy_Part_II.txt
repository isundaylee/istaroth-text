# Orobashi's Legacy: Part II


## Talk 1

Place: It seems that two critical components are missing from the ward.
Traveler: Submit Item

## Talk 2

Kaji: How're things going? Have you finished repairing the wards already?
Traveler: Not yet.
Kaji: It's fine. Take your time.
Kaji: And if you don't manage it, just leave it. The most important thing is that you shouldn't stay in this place too long — it's dangerous.
Traveler: I'm still working on it.

### Additional Talk 1

Observe: The strange stone lantern seems to emit an ominous energy.
Paimon: This stone lantern is so creepy... It feels familiar.
Paimon: Oh, someone's written something on the lantern post!
Observe: "Soldiers stationed here, if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Mr. Kaji."
Observe: The handwriting looks new, yet eroded by rain. A few clear lines of smaller writings are below.
Observe: "Please don't believe these strange notes. We've got no time to lose! This must an enemy trick meant to slow us down."
Observe: "Whoever leaves the team without permission will be severely punished!"
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

### Additional Talk 2
