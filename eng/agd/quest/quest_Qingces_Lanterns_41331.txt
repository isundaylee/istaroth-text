# Qingce's Lanterns


## Talk 1

Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* The Lantern Rite is here once again...
Traveler: Is there something on your mind, Granny Ruoxin?
Granny Ruoxin: Things should be festive and lively during the Lantern Rite, you know?
Granny Ruoxin: But in Qingce Village, the elderly are too old and the young are too young.
Granny Ruoxin: All those young workers that have since flocked to the big city are either too busy and can't get time off work to celebrate the festival...
Granny Ruoxin: Or they're too far away to make it back home in time.
Granny Ruoxin: Lantern Rite is a lively festival, it's a time when everyone should gather together to celebrate...
Granny Ruoxin: Sure, I understand that it mustn't be easy for them either, but... *sigh* What about all the festivities?
Granny Ruoxin: Ugh, there's no use in complaining. That's no way to celebrate...
Granny Ruoxin: If you'd be so kind, I'm sure Ms. Bai could use a hand right about now.
Granny Ruoxin: The young lady said that she wanted to prepare a table full of food for everyone and is already hard at work on the preparations. I'm afraid that she won't be able to manage on her own...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, thank you. You're too kind!
Traveler: Don't worry, I'll go lend her a hand.

## Talk 2

Ms. Bai: Seems we still need quite a few more ingredients...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_NPC): Let me lend you a hand.
Ms. Bai: Huh? Oh, are you willing to help? You've come right on time! I was just starting to worry that we wouldn't manage to get all the ingredients.
Ms. Bai: Let me see here... If you could, please help me get three chunks of Raw Meat and three pieces of Fowl.
Ms. Bai: In the meantime, I'll think of a way to procure the other ingredients.

## Talk 3

Ms. Bai: Great, that should be just enough. Ah yes, I'll also need you to help me go to Pops Kai and tell him to bring all the chairs and tables over.
Ms. Bai: I plan on making lots of dishes, so if we wait too long to set up the tables, I'm afraid that the food might start getting cold.

## Talk 4

Ms. Bai: Were you able to get those three chunks of Raw Meat and Fowl?

## Talk 5

Pops Kai: Oh? Are you looking for me?
Traveler: We'll be needing the tables and chairs soon.
Pops Kai: Ah yes, the tables and chairs... I remember now. I've already prepared everything.
Pops Kai: Ah, but there should still be some more inside the shop. Alrighty, let's just bring them all out then.
Pops Kai: That should be enough tables and chairs for everybody.
Pops Kai: I never expected that you'd come all the way here to help me.
Traveler: I'm happy that I could help.
Pops Kai: #Heh! I must say that you're quite an extraordinary young man... But why haven't you gone home yet? Don't you plan on celebrating with your family?
Traveler: ...
Pops Kai: No need to fret, I won't ask any further. I'm sure you have your reasons.
Pops Kai: If you're willing to celebrate the festival here, you're more than welcome to join us. As they say, the more the merrier.
Traveler: Well, there's reasons...

## Talk 6

Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* Who knows when the young folks will finally get some time to rest...

## Talk 7

Little Luo: I wonder if Mr. Adeptus will come to Lantern Rite...
Traveler: We'll be releasing Xiao Lanterns in the village soon...
Little Luo: Oh, we'll be releasing the lanterns back at the village? Thanks for letting me know.
Little Luo: If we release enough Xiao Lanterns, maybe Mr. Adeptus will come...

## Talk 8

Granny Ruoxin: Ah, you're back. Sorry for making you do so much work on a festive day like this.
Traveler: I'm glad I could help.
Granny Ruoxin: Thank you, you're too kind. I've also been doing my part and managed to make quite a few Xiao Lanterns for the people of Qingce Village.
Granny Ruoxin: If you'd like, you can find me near the gate later this evening. We'll release the Xiao Lanterns and celebrate the festival together.
Granny Ruoxin: But who knows where the children have run off to... There's no way I could go and find them with these old legs...
Granny Ruoxin: Could I trouble you to round them up for me? They've always loved releasing the Xiao Lanterns.
Granny Ruoxin: And be sure to tell anyone else you find along the way to head back to the village... The more the merrier, you know.

## Talk 9

Little You: Ugh, I still can't catch my shadow.
Traveler: We'll be releasing Xiao Lanterns in the village soon...
Little You: We get to release the Xiao Lanterns tonight? Awesome! Lemme go tell my big brother!
Little You: I heard grandpa say that we get to make a wish when we release the lanterns. Is that true?
Little You: I have a big wish that I've been thinking about for a long time now...
Traveler: Oh really? What's your wish?
Little You: It's that I... Ah wait, I shouldn't tell you... Grandpa says that if we tell others our wishes, they'll never come true.
Little You: Just wait till I tell my big brother, I'm sure he'll have a wish too!
Little You: Oh wait, it seems we have to write our wish on a lantern... So I guess just thinking about it won't be enough.

## Talk 10

Chang the Ninth: Ah, hello. Do you need anything?
Traveler: We'll be releasing Xiao Lanterns in the village soon...
Chang the Ninth: Granny Ruoxin will be releasing the lanterns? *sigh* She'll probably start to worry if I don't show up...
Chang the Ninth: Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'll make my way over there shortly. At a festival like this one... the more, the merrier.

## Talk 11

Jiangcheng: Wife... Wife?
Traveler: We'll be releasing Xiao Lanterns in the village soon...
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lanterns? Ah yes, I remember now. Hmm, I suppose it is about time to release the lanterns.
Jiangcheng: Thankfully Granny Ruoxin always remembers such traditions. Let's go make a wish together, shall we?
