## Talk

Michica: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Michica: What, what? A package... exploded!?
Michica: ...Oh, no. Great... Uhh, I mean, sorry, just me being overly sensitive...

## Talk

Michica: The amount of contraband I've confiscated from packages would probably be enough for me to open my own shop.

## Talk

Traveler: Going to get a new job?
Michica: Huh? Opening a shop?
Michica: Oh no no, I don't actually have any plans to open a shop. It was just an analogy.
Michica: Once you've worked here for long enough, you'll see just about anything.
Michica: Get distracted for one second, and something in a package gets broken.
Michica: Get distracted again, and the delivery address literally evaporates into thin air, because it was written in that kind of ink that changes with the outside temperature...
Michica: ...*sigh* Forget it. There's no point going into it. There'll only be more pleasant surprises waiting for us.
Michica: Sorry you had to listen to all of that. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

## Talk

Traveler: Can you sell it to me?
Michica: What? The contraband?
Michica: Hey, kid, cut it out!
Michica: Ahem, that was really just a joke! There's no way I'd actually go out and sell any of that stuff.
Michica: Just pretend you never heard anything, okay? You have my thanks.

## Talk

Traveler: Safety first.
Michica: You're right.

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been lately?
Michica: Okay... ish... Mostly because we've been short-staffed.
Michica: The area affected by the war was so vast that many of our couriers, who were tasked with carrying battle reports, ended up collapsing from exhaustion. Many others are still busy running to and fro between the various camps.
Michica: We are now prioritizing the delivery of intel related to the Abyss and reconstruction efforts. The efficiency of other package deliveries may be affected as a result â€” we apologize in advance.

## Talk

Traveler: Alright... Would you sell to me, then?
Michica: ...No, I'm not asking you to repeat everything.
Michica: I'm not jesting! Just pretend that my complaints have all been burned away by the Sacred Flame, taking my troubles with them!
