Traveler: What do you know about the Lawrence Clan...?
Lawrence: Heh... I actually have no connection at all to the Lawrence Clan. *sigh* It's a bit of a long story...
Lawrence: You must know Wagner, the blacksmith? Well, the one other thing he enjoys besides working with metal is drinking competitions. Placing a bet and seeing who can drink the most. The drunker he gets, the more outrageous the bets become...
Lawrence: The whole reason his shop is called "Schulz's Blacksmith" is because he lost to his apprentice, Schulz, in a drinking game.
Lawrence: ...Ahem, now, my father is a merchant from Fontaine, and he came to Mondstadt to do business. Though, you'd be forgiven for thinking he came for the drinking culture alone...
Lawrence: One day, the two of them got drinking together. My father bet on his son's name â€” that is to say, my name, and... yeah.
Lawrence: *sigh* At that time, my father was not to know that the name "Lawrence" came with so much baggage...
