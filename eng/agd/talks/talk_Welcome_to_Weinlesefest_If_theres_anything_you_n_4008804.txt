Leah: Welcome to Weinlesefest! If there's anything you need help with, please contact the Knights of Favonius.
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Leah: Well, speaking of that, there's actually no requirement a location has to meet to host it. This celebratory event has been held in Mondstadt City itself several times before as well.
Leah: But personally, I prefer the site that they selected this year. Compared to the hustle and bustle of the city, Cider Lake has prettier scenery and a more rustic charm.
Traveler: About the Knights of Favonius...
Leah: As one of the festival's sponsors, the Knights of Favonius will maintain order on-site while ensuring that every guest will enjoy the festivities to the fullest.
Leah: As such, I'd also like to remind our guests to drink in moderation! Over-drinking and bothering other guests will result in a visit from us.
Traveler: Bye.
Leah: Bye, enjoy the festival!
