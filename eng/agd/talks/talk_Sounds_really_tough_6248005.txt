Traveler: Sounds really tough...
Duqin: It's all right. Compared to the guys working as long-distance escorts, we're just moving goods within the city. The work is much less intense, and it's safer too.
Duqin: Of course, some of us aren't official guard material yet, so they're trying to work their way up.
Duqin: The journey from Liyue Harbor to Yilong Wharf is a great ordeal for guards, and you'll never make it without some skill!
