# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How's your research going?
Hosseini: Smoothly enough, I suppose. Before arriving at Ritou, my previous research topic was "The Practical Uses of the Energy Amplifier."
Hosseini: Although things went wrong and our research sample was destroyed, we were able to rescue the situation by recovering some sample data.
Hosseini: I have you to thank for that save, Traveler.
