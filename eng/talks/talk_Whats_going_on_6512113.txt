Traveler: What's going on?
Hinterman: Boss said that the crisis in the "prophecy" had passed, so loads of people came back to town. We're all pitching in, so reconstruction is coming along nicely.
Hinterman: It's still a little chaotic though, and people can hurt themselves if they're not careful. That's why I'm on guard here, to stop any outsiders from wandering in by accident.
