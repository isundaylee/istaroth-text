Traveler: What's wrong?
Zhuyu: My wife has a weak constitution, so she's always getting sick. This time, though, the illness got very serious. She still hasn't fully recovered.
Zhuyu: As a sailor, I blame myself for spending all my time out at sea and not being here to take better care of her over the years...
Zhuyu: Now, I've decided to leave the ocean behind and pick medicine for her up in the mountains. I want to do everything I can for her. Even if just to ease things for her a little.
