Traveler: Only if there's treasure...
Soraya: Whatever treasure you find, you can keep. Material wealth isn't what appeals to me.
Soraya: In Liyue there's a saying that goes: "Money belongs to the world outside your head." I'm more interested in acquiring knowledge than money.
Soraya: So while you're hunting for treasure, please also keep your eyes peeled for stone pillars and stone tablets.
Soraya: Given how ancient these ruins are, any knowledge we can hope to find will be most likely be written on stone.
