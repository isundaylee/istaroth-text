Hirano: Ah, well... Ahem, you are right. As the guard of the Kamisato Mansion, I shouldn't really let my guard down.
Hirano: I have a friend who is also a guard at the Tenryou Commission. He told me that he was very worried about those people affected by the Vision Hunt Decree seeking revenge.
Hirano: Now that I think of it, the peaceful Kamisato Clan is far safer than the other two Commissions, who've made a lot of enemies.
Hirano: This might also be because Mr. Thoma is too reliable. I have always felt safe here. Hahaha...
