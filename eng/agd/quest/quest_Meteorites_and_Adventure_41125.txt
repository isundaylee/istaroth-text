# Meteorites and Adventure


## Talk 1

Jack: *sigh* If only I could go check it out...
Traveler: What's up?
Jack: Ah, it's you. Well, it's not like anything special happened...
Jack: Hmm. No, I suppose this is actually quite special...
Traveler: You mean the meteorites?
Jack: Yes! You must have seen them too, right? They've been falling from the sky for a while now.
Jack: Thanks to the Anemo God's protection... or maybe just blind good luck, none of them have hit the city so far.
Jack: But quite a few have landed outside the city, and they say that whoever touches one of those meteorites will fall into a deep sleep... a kind of slumber that no one can wake them up from.
Jack: Cyrus has already gathered and commissioned quite a few adventurers. Some were sent to inform those still out there in the wild to seek shelter in the city...
Jack: The others were to help the Knights of Favonius ascertain the positions of the fallen meteorites...
Jack: And perform search and rescue operations around those meteorites.
Jack: As for me, Cyrus said that I'd best stay in the city and help to take care of those who've fallen unconscious.
Jack: Maybe it's because my skills aren't up to par yet... But if I'm always stuck with these small tasks, I'll never get the chance to become stronger.
Jack: *sigh* Regardless, I have to do what I've been assigned to do, and do it well... Still, can I ask you for a favor, Traveler?
Jack: I'd like you to help me go out there and gather some information regarding those meteorites...
Traveler: What would you need information for?
Jack: Cyrus always says that you should be fully prepared before starting any adventure.
Jack: If I could persuade him that I understand the situation well enough, and that I've made the necessary preparations...
Jack: Maybe he might let me join the investigation teams.
Jack: But I'm busy helping people here at the moment, so I can't go out to gather any information.
Jack: So, please, Traveler! Help me go outside and investigate the situation. You don't have to go far, just the Whispering Woods will do.
Jack: If you find anything, come back and tell me. Whether I can go out and investigate or not... it's all in your hands now!
Traveler: So you want to sneak out and...
Jack: What? Sneak out and... No! Not at all!
Jack: I do want to go out and investigate, yes... But help is needed inside the city, too, and that's very important! I can't just drop my duties like that...
Jack: But it's just that... Well, Cyrus always says that you should make full preparations before starting any adventure.
Jack: If I could persuade him that I understand the situation well enough, and that I've made the necessary preparations...
Jack: Maybe he might let me join the investigation teams.
Jack: But I'm busy helping people here at the moment, so I can't go out to gather any information.
Traveler: You mean the half-price anniversary promotion at Good Hunter?
Jack: What!? The Good Hunter's having a promotion today? How did I not hear about that?
Jack: Uh, no, wait! That's not what I wanted to talk about...
Jack: So, meteorites have been raining down from the sky lately. I'm sure you've seen them too.
Jack: Thanks to the Anemo God's protection... or maybe just blind good luck, none of them have hit the city so far.

## Talk 2

Reckless Pallad: Well, looks like I've shaken them off for now. Still, what on earth is going on here...
Traveler: Did you come to investigate the meteorites?
Reckless Pallad: Yes, I did. Took a commission from the Guild and all to investigate matters related to the meteorites.
Reckless Pallad: But monsters near the spots where meteorites have landed have starting acting up all of a sudden.
Reckless Pallad: Their strength, movements, and a whole host of other things are totally abnormal, and there's more of them than you usually see, as well.
Reckless Pallad: I was discovered, and didn't dare stay in the area, and so I took a few lesser-tread paths to shake them off my trail.
Reckless Pallad: I have to report these abnormalities to Cyrus as soon as possible.
Traveler: Is there anything else of note?
Reckless Pallad: Anything else? Well, if I had to say it, it's that quite a few scholars are refusing to return to the city.
Reckless Pallad: No matter how hard I tried to convince them, they insisted on continuing their research.
Reckless Pallad: There aren't enough of us adventurers out here either, so we can't simply send them reminders every few days...
Reckless Pallad: This is such a headache...
Reckless Pallad: Well, Traveler, if there's nothing else, you should be seeking shelter in the city too. We haven't the time to be dallying out here.

## Talk 3

Jack: You're back. Did you discover anything?

## Talk 4

Jack: *sigh* I wonder if I'll be able to convince Cyrus...
Traveler: Why do you want to join the outdoor investigation?
Jack: Well, um... I mean, you have to take part in important jobs to prove your worth, you know? That's what I think, at least...
Traveler: But if you mess up...
Jack: Hey! I haven't done anything yet! Don't jinx me!

## Talk 5

Traveler: The monsters seem to be somewhat abnormal.
Jack: Abnormal? Perhaps it's the influence of the meteorites, then... Still, I suspect that someone has reported this already.
Jack: Besides, I have trouble taking on normal monsters. As for these abnormal ones... the less said the better.

## Talk 6

Jack: Alright, I understand the situation now. Please take these as thanks for helping me investigate.
Jack: Scholars who refuse to seek shelter, abnormal monsters, and a lack of available manpower...
Jack: Come on, Jack, think... There has to be some way to convince Cyrus...

## Talk 7

Traveler: There aren't a lot of adventurers out there investigating...
Jack: Ugh. Now that you mention it, there weren't a lot of adventurers who took up this set of commissions...
Jack: It's always the same few people coming and going. Cyrus has been quite concerned, as well.

## Talk 8

Traveler: There are still some scholars who refuse to seek shelter in the city.
Jack: Is that so... Well, they've never been the easiest to convince.
