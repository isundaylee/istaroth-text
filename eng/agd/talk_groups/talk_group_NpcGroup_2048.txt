Traveler: About Iron Chunks...
Master Zhang: Yes, that's my commission. I'm all out of Iron Chunks here.
Master Zhang: Well, have you brought me ten Iron Chunks?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Master Zhang: I see. Well be sure to get me those Iron Chunks as soon as you've got them, the fire's hot and customers are waiting.

Traveler: About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
Master Zhang: My dad left me this place when he retired. He lives in Qingce Village now.
Master Zhang: When he left me the shop, he also left me with a word of advice — a solid business is founded on solid relationships.
Master Zhang: Whenever I get laborers and miners coming in here for repairs, I never charge them for it. In return, I only ask that they keep me informed when they find any rare ore.
Master Zhang: It's every ironmonger's dream to fashion a legendary weapon, the sharpest blade of them all... Liyue is the land of the Lord of Geo, so I figure this is where I'll have the best chance of finding the prize ore I'd need...
Master Zhang: If I can get the edge over the competition right from the source, from the raw materials, I can push them out and really strengthen the Hanfeng name... Hehehe, so let me know if you find anything!

Master Zhang: Ores... You've been to the many ore veins nearby, haven't you?
Master Zhang: I don't have anything new for you right now. Perhaps you should try your luck later.

Master Zhang: Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: Recently, they've come across a lot of Crystal Ore. It's just a shame that I've been busy. If you've got the time, go mine some, come back here and have them refined.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.

Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: They've found quite a fair bit of abnormal Crystal Ore lately. Some call them Magical Crystal Ores — ordinary Crystal Ores can't hold a candle to them in either form or quality.
Master Zhang: It's a shame that they are so hard to work with. Even I cannot make heads or tails of them...
Master Zhang: If you can find a way to work with these ores, do come and find me.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
