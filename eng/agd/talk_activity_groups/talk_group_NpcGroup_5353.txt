## Talk

Foscari: Oh, it's you, friend!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are?
Foscari: Ah, have you forgotten my name? Faustus of the Mercatores Exquisiti, on a mission from our merciful God King!
Foscari: Thanks to you rescuing me, I was able to send the spices from the south here in time.
Foscari: Ah, God King be praised! May his glory ever shine!

## Talk

Traveler: A route towards the south?
Foscari: That's right. As long as you follow the aqueducts newly built by our God King, a ship can sail beneath the high sea and reach the desert to the south.
Foscari: The previous trade route followed the northern border and was susceptible to barbarian harassment, the best efforts of our patrolling troops notwithstanding.
Foscari: Ah, by the great Golden Symphony! With the new aqueduct, commercial activity is at last secure! This, surely, is a manifestation of our God King's boundless grace.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Foscari: Alright. Safe travels, friend.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are?
Foscari: Hello there, friend. I'm Foscari, assistant to His Excellency the Doge. I'm preparing to construct a new navigation route.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Foscari: See you. I hope you have a pleasant time. After all, I imagine a town with too many talkers and too few thinkers could be a bit much.

## Talk

Traveler: Mercatores Exquisiti?
Foscari: That's right, my friend! We Mercatores Exquisiti are our God King's most loyal!
Foscari: And it was for this fealty that he gave us trade permits, allowing us to conduct business with nations beyond our high sea.
Foscari: Of course, that is not the full extent of our special privileges.
Foscari: We also have the right to bypass any Vicarius, and to make slaves free citizens. We even have the right to make contact with barbarians...
Foscari: As long as it aligns with the Golden Symphony's interests, any deed is permissible.

## Talk

Traveler: What do you sell here?
Foscari: We mainly import rare goods from the southern nations, such as henna satin, spices, and even some Jinn devices...
Foscari: It is some manner of desert-folk spellcraft. More cunning and clever by far than those barbarian slaves.
Foscari: That said, I'm all out of my present batch of goods. Should you be interested, you can wait till the next shipment comes in.

## Talk

Foscari: With new routes shall come new opportunities. I'm going to push for this, for sure!

## Talk

Traveler: New sea routes?
Foscari: There are always people saying that we should consider everyone's happiness, that we shouldn't ruin the peace of our little town...
Foscari: Hmph! They've just deluded themselves into thinking that they are happy. You won't find more idiotic people in the entire world!
Foscari: The only reason they're so self-satisfied is that they've never seen the outside world at all. Those with a brain have long ceased to entertain such folly.
Foscari: Everyone has the right to pursue their own happiness. Petrichor is not some ancient hamlet to be forgotten by all.
Foscari: I wish to establish links with the Spina di Rosula, cooperate with them — I want our town to become an important junction on shipping routes. That'll breathe new life into our home...
