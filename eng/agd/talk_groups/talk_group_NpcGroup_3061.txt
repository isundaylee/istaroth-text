Traveler: I'd like to know about these hot springs!
Mikawa Akane: Unlike Natlan, there are actually no natural hot springs created by volcanic activities in Inazuma.
Mikawa Akane: A long time ago, after hot spring culture had been introduced to Inazuma, the locals became fascinated by the warmth and relaxation brought about by the hot water. So they tried every possible way to create a hot spring in Inazuma.
Mikawa Akane: In the end, Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi from the Kanjou Commission introduced a high-efficiency boiler from Snezhnaya, which could bring up the temperature to the level of a hot spring. The water was also mixed with precious minerals and plants collected from various nations. Thus, the first Inazuma hot spring was created.
Mikawa Akane: Although there are also hot springs for the commoners in Inazuma, I don't think they can afford these minerals due to financial restraints. As such, they don't really have the same benefits as the Royal Hot Springs.
Mikawa Akane: But if it's a hot spring funded by the Kanjou Commission, the outcome could be different... Hehe.

Traveler: May I try the Royal Hot Springs?
Mikawa Akane: I'm sorry. I can't let you do that.
Mikawa Akane: The Royal Hot Springs are only for those from the Shogunate. Access priority is based on a strict hierarchical system.
Mikawa Akane: With private rooms and very few customers, it is also often the place for our lords' private discussions. No outlanders allowed.
