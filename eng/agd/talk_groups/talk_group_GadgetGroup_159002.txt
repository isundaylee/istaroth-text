## Talk

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The front line troops on Yashiori Island have been badly traumatized, much to the concern of the Clan Head..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...Lord Masahito once sent a letter describing the chaos caused by the 'Tatarigami.' However, the Clan Head's response was one of fury rather than of sympathy."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...As a result, we were sent to inspect the situation on the island, report the truth, and encourage Lord Masahito to pull himself together and crush that hive of rebel scum..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...Otherwise, the Clan Head might consider demoting Lord Masahito from his post as General and assigning Lady Sara instead."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...We've landed on the island, and will continue south and camp along where the Jakotsu is. We will play it by ear from there."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...There seem to be pirates not far south of Fort Mumei. We will arrange for a search later..."
