Traveler: You are a night owl, too?
Mawyo: Of course I am! Nighttime is precious, and it'd be a waste if we didn't use it properly.
Mawyo: Look at this coffee shop. It's a very popular one, and has provided me with a great deal of precious intel.
Mawyo: Adventurers' commissions, clues to treasure maps, and business opportunities for new toys... Every piece of information contributes to my career as a freelancer.
Mawyo: Well, although the tavern might be a better source of information, I just can't hold my liquor. So I have to give up on it.
