# Unexpected Battle


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, do you hear that? Sounds like someone's arguing over there. Let's go see what's happening!

## Talk 2

Paimon: #Huh, what's up with these guys? Now they're suddenly charging at us!? Ahh, watch out, {NICKNAME}!
Tadaaki: This single chance belongs to the Kono Ittou Art.

## Talk 3

Reina: Are you ready for the competition?
Traveler: Okay, let's begin!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Today's the opening ceremony for the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition. C'mon, let's head to the arena.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa, now this is an arena... Paimon had no idea the Outlander Affairs Agency would have a place like this.
Kamisato Ayaka: This is the indoor training area for the Kanjou Commission. It's thanks to Miss Chisato that we were able to use this venue.
Hiiragi Chisato: You're very welcome, Miss Ayaka. I'm only happy I could help.
Paimon: Chisato, what's that over there?
Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, that? Well, it's...
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem. Traveler, do you have a moment... to talk?
Traveler: Oh, of course.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm, where should I begin...
Traveler: Maybe start by explaining the letter... What was that about?
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah yes, that... Nothing slips by you. To be honest, I felt a little apprehensive when I first heard that everyone wanted me to be the Archon's Emissary.
Kamisato Ayaka: I've been making public appearances ever since I was a child, but this is the first time I've ever acted as the ambassador for such an event, not to mention wearing an extravagant outfit while participating in combat.
Kamisato Ayaka: In the past, only the most skilled swordsmen of a reputable clan in Inazuma were qualified to be the Archon's Emissary. I'm afraid my skills can't even begin to compare to theirs.
Kamisato Ayaka: I was worried that I might not be up to the task, so I wanted to write to you and ask for your advice at that time.
Traveler: We're friends, you can have my advice anytime.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I know. But that's probably why I didn't send the letter in the end.
Kamisato Ayaka: You've helped me many times before, and you've always lent me your ear when I speak about my troubles. But if I'm always turning to you for help, it almost feels like you're somehow besting me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, is it strange for a friend to think that way?
Traveler: Not at all.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you. I was really delighted to learn that you also entered the competition...
Paimon: Hey Ayaka... Huh? What were you two chatting about?
Kamisato Ayaka: #I was just saying that it's delightful to have the Traveler join the competition. Given {M#his}{F#her} reputation in Inazuma, the competition is sure to be even more exciting.
Paimon: Heehee, yep! Having the Traveler join will definitely heat things up a little!
Hiiragi Chisato: Paimon's right, I look forward to seeing you perform.
Traveler: I understand how you feel.
Traveler: I'd be happy to help however I can.

## Talk 6

Younan: Hmm? Are you one of the contestants in Warrior's Spirit?
Traveler: You're from Sumeru?
Younan: Yes. We Eremites are tasked with ensuring safe passage of goods from Inazuma to Sumeru, which is why we often come to Ritou.
Younan: You can sign up for this Warrior's Spirit contest as long as you have a weapon for close-quarters combat. How could I say no?
Younan: Hah, not that I'm bragging, but my brothers at Port Ormos are famous for their martial prowess, and I'm the best out of them all!
Younan: #It seems that you know your way around a sword, {M#young man}{F#young lady}, but you do look a little... frail. If we see each other on the field, don't blame me for not going easy, haha!

## Talk 7

Kamisato Ayaka: It's getting late and Miss Chisato and I must return now. The two of you should have a good rest for the next couple days. We'll see you on the day of the competition.
Paimon: Thanks, you two! Will do! See you on the day of the competition!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Oh look, there's Ayaka and Chisato.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah Traveler, Paimon, you made it. Did you rest well yesterday?
Traveler: Yes, I did, thanks.
Hiiragi Chisato: That's the Traveler, composed as always.
Paimon: Mhm, it's important to keep a good mood before a competition. We're in it to win it!
Onodera: Looks like you all are in good spirits today. Everything should be set to go for the opening match...
Paimon: Speaking of which, are these two boxes for voting?
Onodera: That's right, I've arranged everything. The box on the left contains the ballots for Warrior's Spirit, while the box on the right is for the other events. The results will be revealed in the third round of the competition.
Onodera: And given how strong the Traveler is, you're practically guaranteed to make the third round, right?
Paimon: You bet!
Mizuta: Mr. Onodera, we'll start with the box for Warrior's Spirit then!
Onodera: Alright, thank you!
Paimon: Things are about to start soon. Let's head to the arena.
Kamisato Ayaka: Good luck, Traveler. I hope you'll do well in the competition.
Hiiragi Chisato: Well, Miss Ayaka and I should go watch the matches. See you later.
Traveler: Actually, I didn't get much sleep.
Hiiragi Chisato: And yet, you're still just as composed as always.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Whew... you finally got them to stop. Hey you two, this is all just a big misunderstanding! We're just passing through here. We didn't want to steal anything.
Traveler: Yeah, what's all this about a chance to compete?
Tadatsune: ...
Tadatsune: Ugh... senpai, how could this happen? This youngster completely overwhelmed us with only a few moves!
Tadatsune: I thought this would be our chance to show the power of the Kono Ittou Art to the world. Who knew we would be defeated before we even set foot in the arena...
Tadaaki: No need to say any more... What happened here only proves that we're out of our depth.
Tadaaki: *sigh* Master did always tell us that no matter how strong you may become, there is always someone stronger. But we didn't listen...
Tadaaki: As for this entry ticket, I'm afraid that no matter which of us use it, the results would be the same.
Paimon: Wait, what are you two mumbling about? You guys were at each other's throats just a moment ago.
Tadaaki: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. We're disciples of the Kono Ittou Art. Just now, we were about to duel to see who would enter the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition.
Tadaaki: This competition is very important to any practitioner of the sword arts, and since we rarely see anyone pass through here, we mistook you for a competitor trying to steal our entry ticket. Again, I apologize.
Traveler: Now that that's been cleared up...
Tadaaki: Ah, just a moment, please! If it wasn't for you, I would have never realized my own inadequacy.
Tadatsune: Right, our fight just now was a real eye-opener. I know now that I must further cultivate both my mind and swordsmanship.
Tadatsune: #Senpai, I have an idea. Why don't we give the entry ticket to {M#him}{F#her}?
Tadaaki: Fine by me. Only a real swordsman is qualified to stand in the Warrior's Spirit arena. We still require more training.
Paimon: #Wait wait wait, you mean you want {NICKNAME} to compete instead of you?
Traveler: Isn't this a little sudden?
Tadatsune: It's up to you if you want to join. Either way, this entry ticket is useless to us now. We bid you two farewell.
Paimon: And there they go, just like that... Ugh, so what do we do about this entry ticket they left us?
Paimon: Let Paimon see here... "Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Competition... hosted by the Yashiro Commission." Hmm, since it's being held by the Yashiro Commission, why don't we go to the Kamisato Estate and ask about it?
Traveler: But we don't know anything about the competition...
Traveler: You may continue your duel.

## Talk 10

Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato should have arrived on Ritou by now. She went to discuss competition matters with Miss Hiiragi Chisato of the Kanjou Commission.
Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato also has an important responsibility in the competition. Since you're going to see her, she can fill you in on the details.

## Talk 11

Hirotatsu: Are you really going to enter the competition? Heh, in that case, see you in the arena.
