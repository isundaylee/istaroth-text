Traveler: About the tea shop...
Fan Er'ye: What do you think of the place? Let me tell you something, that stage, these tables and chairs, the private rooms upstairs, the performers, the kitchen staff...
Fan Er'ye: I was the one who made it all what it is today. I paid my dues when I was young... Granny Ruoxin and I used to sing together on that stage all the time.
Fan Er'ye: Eventually I made a name for myself and saw some success. Enough to buy the place up myself. Now I run it.
Fan Er'ye: Granny Ruoxin? Hehehe, oh how times change. Put it this way, forty years ago she was no less of an acting sensation than Yun Jin is today!
Fan Er'ye: Sadly, she had her heart stolen by some adventurer in green clothing who never came back for her. Poor thing, she's had no one to rely on her whole life...
Fan Er'ye: Maybe things could have been different if I had only told her the way I felt... But I digress. No use in digging up the past.
