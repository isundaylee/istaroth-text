# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Want to chat?</color>
Xiao: ...Idle chatter?
Xiao: ...If you wish, I'll accompany you.
Traveler: I thought you'd refuse.
Xiao: Hm?
Xiao: To make a request but prepare yourself for rejection...
Xiao: Human interaction really is troublesome.
Xiao: Generally, I don't partake in activities like "chatting."
Xiao: But if it's with you... I'll try.
Traveler: How have you been?
Xiao: Are you asking about the effects of my karmic debt?
Xiao: ...No issues.
Xiao: It is of my own doing, so I alone will bear the consequences.
Xiao: ...I don't know if it's related to you, but recently, the pain from my karmic debt has been less excruciating.
Xiao: It's much easier to bear than before.
Xiao: As for any excess concerns... Best to leave that for yourself.
Traveler: You seem a bit reluctant.
Xiao: That's not it.
Xiao: I didn't expect you to make such a request.
