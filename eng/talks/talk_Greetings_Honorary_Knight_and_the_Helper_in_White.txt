# Talk Dialog

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. I'm not technically on duty right now, but I can't go home yet, thanks to this extracurricular project that Ematol has given me.
Traveler: Extracurricular project?
Phonia: Basically, she's worried her record of your experience playing "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades" might not suffice, so she wanted me to take some extra recordings.
Paimon: Wow! You two really are close, aren't you?
Phonia: The way I see it, this is just a way of banking some credit so Ematol might actually feel guilty the next time she plays a prank on me.
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon's not sure she actually will, but at least it adds another layer to your relationship!
Traveler: Come on Phonia, lighten up!
Phonia: Oh, you think I'm taking it too seriously? People often say that my responses are a bit too by-the-book. Boring, even...
Phonia: But I'm just trying to cut down on unnecessary communication so I can get some peace and quiet.
Paimon: #Umm... {NICKNAME}, we should probably go now...
Traveler: Anyway, keep up the good work!
Phonia: Thank you, and have fun. Once we're done with all the recording, it'll finally be time for this cog in the machine to get some rest...
