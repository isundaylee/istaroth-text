Ziryab: "Fresh breeze in the night" or "Fresh night breeze"? How about just "Night breeze"?

Traveler: What are you doing?
Ziryab: I'm pulling my hair out on how to win her heart.
Ziryab: "Fresh breeze in the night" has too much emphasis on time, when I think about her day and night.
Ziryab: On the other hand, "Fresh night breeze" sounds rather cliche, like a line in a child's fairytale.
Ziryab: But just "Night breeze" would save more room for more serenade.
Ziryab: But the people in the square discussing the candidates for the next Grand Conservator are messing up my thoughts. If only I could have a quieter place to think.

Traveler: How about indoors?
Ziryab: Tried it, didn't work.
Ziryab: You got either couples flirting, or someone pushing fliers on choir, card games, cross country, and other events on you in the study.
Ziryab: I could have just stayed in the dorm room, but my dumb roommate tried to make hotpot with a prototype burner...
Ziryab: I won't go into details, except the room is still full of smoke.
Ziryab: I don't trust myself to write anything Hana will appreciate in that condition.

Traveler: The next Grand Conservator?
Ziryab: Yes, the current Grand Conservator announced a few days ago that he was going to retire, and the next Grand Conservator needs to be voted in by the sages.
Ziryab: Practically everyone is talking about this. Didn't you hear them chattering about it?
Ziryab: Something about Vikram of the Vahumana being good with people, and Rifaet of the Haravatat being incredibly intellectual. Stuff like that...
Ziryab: I think there're even fan clubs of some sorts that've been set up by some students. From what I see, there's too little schoolwork.
Ziryab: Hana's better. She doesn't care about these mundane things.

## Talk 4

Ziryab: Ahem... "Melodious night breeze, be my words, express the daylight delights"...
Hana: ?
Ziryab: "Here I stand in the wind, just to hear your gentle sing-along."
Ziryab: What do you think of that?
Hana: What do I think of what?
Ziryab: The lovely poem I just composed. How does it make you feel?
Hana: Is this... for your literature class?
Hana: I'm sorry, I don't quite get it...
Ziryab: That's okay, just listen closely...
