Traveler: You seem very confident.
Cintli: Of course.
Cintli: But it's not just down to my efforts alone. Our Collective of Plenty is situated right by a volcano, where the soil was already rich and fertile to begin with.

Cintli: So when I said that the fruit and vegetables we grow in the Collective of Plenty are the best in the whole of Natlan, I wasn't just bragging. That's something everyone knows.
