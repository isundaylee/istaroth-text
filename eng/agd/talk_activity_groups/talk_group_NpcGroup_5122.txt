Traveler: Hello there.
Melissa: Hello. Here to buy fish?
Melissa: Sorry about that, but I'm currently enjoying a no-fishing season â€” that is to say, I'm on vacation.
Melissa: When not out at sea, one can take a stroll in the breeze, listen to the flowing water, and think about the countless souls that live alongside the fish... Interesting, no?
Melissa: It really brings to mind that one phrase, "one who sleeps with dead fish lives still, but one who sleeps with living fish..."

Melissa: I mean, the line trails off, doesn't it? Why, we could just tack on something silly like "is a Blubberbeast" or "is a Bubbly Seahorse," or something like that, eh?
Melissa: The underwater world must be a lovely place. Alas, I can't dive, so all I can do is listen to Archenoul talk about it.
