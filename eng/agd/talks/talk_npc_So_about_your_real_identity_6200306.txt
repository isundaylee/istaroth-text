# Talk Dialog

Traveler: So, about your real identity...
Uncle Tian: Shh... Don't shout it for the whole world to hear. Other than a few people in key posts, the number of people who know my identity can be counted on one hand.
Uncle Tian: People have ever been made to choose between status and freedom.
Uncle Tian: It has taken a lot of effort for me to preserve both, haha.
Uncle Tian: But I, too, shall give up my seat as one of the Qixing someday. The more freedom I experience, the more status feels unwieldy and clumsy.
Uncle Tian: ...I hope that "he" too can enjoy his freedom, now that he has thrown off his yoke.
