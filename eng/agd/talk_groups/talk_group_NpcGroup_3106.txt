Kano Nana: Hello. I'm so sorry, but may I... ask you something?
Kano Nana: Have you ever met a little creature with ears and a tail?

## Talk

Traveler: A little creature?
Kano Nana: If you meet a creature... I mean a girl who's about this tall, please let me know.
Kano Nana: This girl's name is Sayu. She is a little ninja from the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. She's very, very cute.
Kano Nana: But she doesn't like to work and hides away to take naps all the time. She said that she'll grow taller this way...
Kano Nana: Sayu has an aptitude for ninjutsu, so she's very elusive. She can even be a bigger headache than Heizou...
Kano Nana: I really hope I can find her soon. Then I'll have some time to ask Lady Yae for the latest novels...

## Talk

Traveler: Heizou?
Kano Nana: Ah, I was referring to a distant cousin of mine. Surname's Shikanoin, and the name's Heizou.
Kano Nana: He doesn't like to abide by the rules and always gets himself in trouble.
Kano Nana: I figured he'd grow out of his rebellious phase... I didn't expect him to become a detective. Now I can't even find out where he is.
Kano Nana: As his elder cousin, I just want to take good care of him. But to do that, I need to find him first...

## Talk

Traveler: The latest novels, you say?
Kano Nana: Yeah! But it's not just the "latest" novel! It's the draft of a yet-to-be-published work!
Kano Nana: You have probably heard of Yae Publishing House already, right? The owner of this publishing house is the Guuji Yae herself, our head shrine maiden.
Kano Nana: Ever since Lady Yae learned that I am a novel enthusiast, she would often offer me the drafts of Yae Publishing House novels to read.
Kano Nana: Let me tell you a secret. When Lady Yae is acting as the boss of Yae Publishing House, she behaves very differently than she does as the Guuji. She's actually really kind and often asks me about my thoughts on these new novels.
Kano Nana: Hehe, if my silly comments can help her out, that's nice, then.

## Talk

Traveler: Ears and tail?
Kano Nana: Yeah, I'm looking for this girl who has the ears and tail of a badger.
Kano Nana: But the ears and tail don't actually grow from her body â€” they're just part of her outfit.
Kano Nana: Her name is Sayu. She is a little ninja from the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. She always disappears to slack off if she gets a chance.
Kano Nana: Some say that the big tail on her outfit has lots of ninjutsu items hidden inside, which can help her hide... Alas, that's a big headache for anyone who is in charge of looking for her, like me.

## Talk

Traveler: So, what's with you and the Yashiro Commission?
Kano Nana: Specifically, you're asking why a ninja from the Yashiro Commission would a shrine maiden to look after her, right?
Kano Nana: Because the Yashiro Commission is in charge of the religious and ceremonial affairs as well as other cultural matters in Inazuma. Therefore, the shrine maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine must also follow the orders of the Yashiro Commission.
Kano Nana: Though I suppose a ninja like Sayu who likes to slack off and needs a specific person to look after her is something of an exception...
Kano Nana: Please help me look out for her while you are traveling around. Please!

## Talk

Traveler: I'm sorry...
Kano Nana: Ah, you have never seen her... That's okay. Thank you anyway.

## Talk

Kano Nana: Hello. I'm sorry, but... Sayu has disappeared again.
Kano Nana: Please let me know if you see her.

## Talk

Traveler: She's the same as always, huh?
Kano Nana: Yes. she doesn't like to work and hides away to take naps all the time. She said that she'll grow taller this way...
Kano Nana: Sayu has an aptitude for ninjutsu, so she's very elusive. She can even be a bigger headache than Heizou...
Kano Nana: I really hope I can find her soon. Then I'll have some time to ask Lady Yae for the latest novels...

## Talk

Traveler: What's the deal with you and the Yashiro Commission again?
Kano Nana: Specifically, you're asking why a ninja from the Yashiro Commission would need a shrine maiden to look after her, right?
Kano Nana: This is because the Yashiro Commission is in charge of the religious and ceremonial affairs as well as other cultural matters in Inazuma. Therefore, the shrine maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine must also follow the orders of the Yashiro Commission.
Kano Nana: Though I suppose a ninja like Sayu who likes to slack off and needs a specific person to look after her is something of an exception...
Kano Nana: They say that the big tail on her outfit has lots of ninjutsu items hidden inside, which can help her hide... Alas, that's a big headache for anyone who is in charge of looking for her, like me.
Kano Nana: Please help me look out for her while you are out traveling. Please!
