# Equivalent Exchange Once More


## Talk 1

Viktor: Hmm... How should I carve this again...
Traveler: Hi!
Viktor: Ugh, who's there? Stop bothering me already, I'm...
Viktor: Eh!? Traveler!? What brings you here to Sumeru?
Viktor: Come on, Rudolf can't have sent you to beat me up, right? I did nothing but send Lily a little gift way back when!
Traveler: I'm just stopping by...
Viktor: So you're still traveling. Just can't stop, can you?
Viktor: But, you know... I didn't expect to see you here in Sumeru...
Viktor: My original orders were to relocate from Mondstadt to Snezhnaya.
Viktor: But another order came and I was sent to Sumeru City to assist Mr. Vsevolod. Moreover, I was told that I was being transferred to Lord Pulcinella's command.
Traveler: Pulcinella?
Viktor: Yes... Well, no. I shall stop here, or Mr. Vsevolod would criticize my insensitivity to affairs of confidentiality.
Viktor: *sigh* The names of our Lord Harbingers are no secret. I can never understand why he's so antsy about it.
Traveler: So, what are you doing in Sumeru?
Viktor: Oh, Mr. Vsevolod and I are mainly responsible for logistical support and coordination. In short, we go shopping a lot.
Viktor: It doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's certainly nicer than idling away in the Mondstadt Cathedral.
Viktor: Hehe, my current job also comes with lots of free time, and no one's keeping an eye on me...
Viktor: So I picked back my childhood wood carving hobby back up. And guess what, Sumeru happens to be rich in wood. Perfect for practice!
Viktor: And you know what? My wood carvings are actually popular among kids. They have been bothering me about it, so I promised to carve one for them each.
Traveler: Aren't you with the Fatui?
Viktor: Yes, so what? I mean... Who says a Fatuus can't make toys for kids?
Viktor: Besides, I'm just the supply guy. As for all those fancy great deals, I'll just leave them to the Lords.
Viktor: All in all, that's the situation here. I wasn't able to return to Snezhnaya, but I kinda like Sumeru. There's food, entertainment, and a pretty nice environment here.
Viktor: After work, I just grab some food and get myself a nice sunny spot for some wood carving.
Viktor: However... Haha, everyone gives me those skeptical looks, just like the one you gave me when we first talked.
Viktor: But there's nothing I can do. I'm a Fatuus after all.
Traveler: I still don't really trust you even now.
Viktor: Okay... Basically, I'm quite happy with my life now, and I even managed to keep some savings.
Viktor: If these days continue, I might just settle down here in Sumeru...
Viktor: Ahem, well, that's enough of that. Now that you're also here, Traveler, let's continue our "equivalent exchange," if you're in.
Viktor: But I'm also out of stories, so your payment will be in real currency this time around.
Traveler: Well, that works better for me.
Viktor: Alright, let me make the commission clear.
Viktor: I ordered some wood from Hamawi lately, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Viktor: I can't go talk to him during working hours, or Mr. Vsevolod will scold me for sure.
Viktor: Traveler, would you please do me a favor and ask Hamawi about my wood delivery?
Traveler: Just get my payment ready.
Viktor: Rest assured. I won't let you down.
Viktor: Anyway, I'll leave this to you, Traveler.
Traveler: You sure you're not up to anything...?
Viktor: Come on, when did I play dirty tricks in our trades before? Don't worry, I can't be bothered, anyway... What's wrong with a peaceful, simple life?
Traveler: Am I taking commissions from the Fatui?
Viktor: Of course not, you'll just be doing commissions for Viktor.
Traveler: Who says I trust you now? Stop cottoning up to me!
Traveler: You're not trying to pump the kids for information... Are you?
Viktor: Hey! I'd never do that! What's with your horrible stereotype of us Fatui?
Traveler: Another Harbinger?
Traveler: That's right, come back to Mondstadt with me!
Viktor: Ha, ha, ha, alright. Want a pair of shackles to lead me away while you're at it?
Viktor: Okay, enough joking around. I've got things to deal with.
Traveler: Vâ€”Viktor?

## Talk 2

Viktor: I didn't expect myself to ever be able to pick up wood carving again...

## Talk 3

Hamawi: What awful luck...
Traveler: About Viktor's wood delivery...
Hamawi: Are you talking about the wood that the Fatuus ordered?
Hamawi: *sigh* I knew dealing with the Fatui wouldn't end well.
Hamawi: We were attacked by monsters while transporting that wood. All of us made it back alive, but our cart didn't. We were forced to leave the wood by the roadside.
Hamawi: I dare not go over there, nor can I find someone to get rid of those monsters so soon...
Traveler: We aren't Fatui...
Hamawi: Aren't you a Fatuus? Then why are you helping him?
Hamawi: Anyway, I can only leave my cart there for now and see if I can hire someone to deal with the situation.
Hamawi: If you are anxious to get the wood, I'll mark the approximate location of the cart on the map for you, then you can go take a look for yourself.
Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 4

Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 5

Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...
Traveler: About Viktor's wood...
Hamawi: This wood... You've chased away all the monsters? You're stronger than you look...
Hamawi: Thank you. I'll head over with a few others later and bring the wood back.
Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 6

Viktor: How did it go? Has my wood arrived?
Black Screen Text: You tell Viktor what happened...
Viktor: Monsters again? Sheesh, is it just me, or does it feel like every cart in the world is being attacked by monsters...
Viktor: Ugh, never mind... it's all good as long my wood gets here.
Viktor: Oh, right. Here's the payment I promised you. Count it up if you like.
Viktor: Uh, by the way... Um, is Lily doing well?
Viktor: I didn't say goodbye to her before I left. I hope she isn't angry...
Traveler: She's doing really well.
Viktor: Alright. *cough* Come on, don't look at me like that. I was just a little concerned!
Viktor: Anyway, make sure you count your remuneration up. I prepared the exact amount, Traveler.
Traveler: Go back and visit her yourself.
Viktor: Mr. Vsevolod will definitely kick my rear end if I do that. Forget it.
Viktor: I don't quite dare to send a letter directly either.
Viktor: Receiving a letter from a Fatuus sounds like a bad thing, after all. Hahaha...
