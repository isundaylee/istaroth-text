Traveler: You're still here?
Tanjiyy: Haha, yeah, I've reported everything I discovered to the Akademiya and applied for a new project...
Tanjiyy: Now, I'm going to figure out what on earth happened here...
Tanjiyy: Mm, this will add a nice footnote to my historical research.
Tanjiyy: Don't worry about my safety. The General Mahamatra's keeping an eye out for us. He's promised to provide abundant supplies and protection for the researchers sent here.
