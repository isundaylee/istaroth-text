Mona: I for one definitely need some rest... I'm aching all over.
Mona: You should sit yourself down and take a rest too, you know. The chance won't come by very often.
Mona: And who knows how long it'll be before we reach the end of this domain. We simply have to conserve our strength â€” that much is indisputable.

## Talk 1

Mona: Oh, don't give me that look. I can't give you any astrology-based advice in here.
Mona: What do you mean, why not? Look around you. Do you see any starlight in here? My scryglass has been completely undecipherable since the moment we arrived.
Mona: But I can still be of assistance in other ways, of course. My profound powers of prediction extend beyond astrology.

## Talk 2

Mona: Oh, you've got to be kidding me...! I just found a fairytale in one of these books that the old hag told me once...
Mona: She said that she was the one who wrote it, and no one else in the whole world knew the story...
Mona: So... that was just another one of her tall tales, hmm? Ugh, and you know what else she did? She handed it to me, saying she wanted to give her disciple a gift that was the only one of its kind in the whole world... I cannot believe that woman!
