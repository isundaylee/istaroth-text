# Bantan Sango Case File: The Truth (Just About) Comes to Light


## Talk 1

Ryuuji: Oh, you're right on cue.
Ryuuji: I just finished scouting out several suspicious spots.
Ryuuji: One of those encampments is guarded by the "Top"...
Ryuuji: Ahem. I mean, by "Black Shadow." If you've got no other questions...
Traveler: As for yesterday's investigations...
Ryuuji: As for that, I don't know anything at the moment.
Paimon: Eh!? Didn't Sango get you to go investigate?
Ryuuji: She did, yes, but... How should I put it?
Ryuuji: For example, "some overripe Lavender Melons" and "muddy hand-prints on a door" don't connect meaningfully in my mind.
Ryuuji: But for Sango, these are the materials she needs to unlock mysteries as complex as "yosegizaiku."
Paimon: "Some overripe Lavender Melons" and "muddy hand-prints on a door"... How are these related, actually?
Ryuuji: I'm just using an analogy. At her direction, I investigated some locations in Yashiori Island and Chinju Forest before reporting what I had seen back to her.
Ryuuji: As for any conclusions she might have drawn from my reports, only she knows what they are.
Ryuuji: To be honest, only Shikanoin is able to keep up with her train of thought...
Traveler: Shikanoin?
Ryuuji: Someone from the Tenryou Commission. We had the privilege of making his acquaintance on a previous case.
Ryuuji: He's a rather... unique character. You'll know what I mean should you ever meet him.
Ryuuji: Well then. The animals are in your hands.
Paimon: Paimon's still thinking about those "overripe Lavender Melons"...

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: Ah. Wonderful! This should be all of them now...
Ryuuji: ...Wait. Why *isn't* it all of them?
Paimon: Uh-oh... Why does Paimon feel like this is just dragging out?
Ryuuji: It is true that resolving cases sometimes requires a great deal of patience. Going the wrong way could end with you finding nothing at all.
Ryuuji: We have found a great deal of these little animals, so we are at least headed in the right direction.
Ryuuji: We might just have missed a few clues along the way or left a few locations un-searched, thus leading to our current impasse. It will be a temporary one, I believe.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it! You're saying that we'll need a bit of boom shaka-laka to finally clear this up!
Ryuuji: Mm, yes, you could say that we are presently boom shaka-lacking. But not by much, I would say â€” we have been making great progress thanks to the two of you.
Traveler: (He... actually understood you, Paimon.)
Paimon: That makes a ton of sense, Ryuuji!
Ryuuji: You flatter me. This is merely experience talking.
Ryuuji: The further down the truth is buried, the more value there is in uncovering it.
Ryuuji: It's just a shame that we don't have any additional information at the moment. Hmm...
Ryuuji: I suppose I'll simply report our present status to Sango.
Ryuuji: She should be able to consider some angles that haven't come to mind yet.
Paimon: Sure! Paimon has faith in your good sense, after all!
Ryuuji: Then it's decided. Let's meet at the usual place once more clues emerge.
Ryuuji: If I am otherwise occupied at the time, you can just look for Sango directly.
Traveler: (It feels like he already understands you pretty well, Paimon...)
