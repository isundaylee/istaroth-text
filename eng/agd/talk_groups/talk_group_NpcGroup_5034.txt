Traveler: What game?
Veta: A game of guessing your savings.
Veta: I'll call out a number, and you can tell me if it's higher or lower than the correct number. Bet you I'll get it in 3 guesses.

Traveler: Why are you playing over here?
Veta: My dad's a Snezhnayan envoy who's been posted to the Northland Bank. He won't let me run too far off.
Veta: Look, that's the bank. It's between a clockwork workshop and the clock shop. Pretty awesome, isn't it?
Veta: My dad's taught me how to distinguish between good and bad people, so don't worry, I'm not gonna go running off with bad people.
