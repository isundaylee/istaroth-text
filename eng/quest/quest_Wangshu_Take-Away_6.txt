# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got something else to do.
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah. Later, then.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it now.
Smiley Yanxiao: Good on you.
Smiley Yanxiao: I really can't spare the time right now...

## Talk 3

Laid Back Ling'guan: Agh, I don't think I can get back in time.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: So it's like this: that air-headed Ling'guan ordered some Come And Get It, saying that she'd come back and eat it later. But my money's on her having wandered off somewhere and gotten lost.
Smiley Yanxiao: Go deliver this to her. <color=#00E1FFFF>Steady now, and don't run around however you like</color>, or it'll spill.
Smiley Yanxiao: <color=#00E1FFFF>Try to avoid touching elemental stuff as well, or the taste might get all mixed up</color>.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it goes bad, come back here and I'll whip up another serving for you.
