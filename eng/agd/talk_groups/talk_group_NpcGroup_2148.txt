Iron Tongue Tian: Haha, haha, you gotta quit while you're ahead. That's enough for today!

## Talk 6

Iron Tongue Tian: Tea Master Liu Su was once my senior. He loves to tell elegant, high-flown stories.

Traveler: (Keep listening)
Iron Tongue Tian: So I'm not sour at all that my senior is famous and earns a lot of money.
