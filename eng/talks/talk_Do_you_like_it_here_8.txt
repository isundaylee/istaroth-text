# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Mika: Yes, I love it!
Mika: This place is amazing, beautiful, and peaceful... There's so many wonderful things I've never seen before.
Mika: I doubt there's any other place in Teyvat that can compare to this.
Mika: Even if you just give me a tiny tent, I'll still be super comfortable here.
Mika: Oh, but... if I'm gonna be camping outside, I'll have to trouble you for some firewood to make a campfire...
Traveler: No need for that — it's temperate here year-round!
Mika: Th—Thank you... I hope me being here isn't too much of an imposition...
Mika: Um... If there's anything I can help with around here, please do let me know!
Mika: I used to spend a lot of time cleaning and tidying the house and yard. That was a while ago, but I'm probably still okay at it...
Traveler: You're my guest, Mika.
Mika: Aw... That's extremely kind of you... Thank you ever so much!
Mika: Uh, I guess I should stop with all the formalities before I ruin the mood...
Mika: Alright, I'll make myself at home, then. I want to do a detailed survey of this place... I'll do my best to understand your design philosophy!
Mika: That way, I can help you out if you ever need it.
Traveler: All a guest needs to do is make themselves at home.
Traveler: Of course I'd get you what you need!
