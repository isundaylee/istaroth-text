Traveler: Is this work for the Fontaine Research Institute?
Antoine: Ah, what are you talking about? The Institute has been rendered a ruin. Its capacity for research has been lost! All that remains is the official agency.
Antoine: But what cannot be denied is that many independent engineers — of whom I am one — still use kinetic cores designed by Guillotin, the Institute's founder.
Antoine: The aircraft is merely one step in the realization of my goals.
Antoine: My final objective is the creation of sufficiently powerful and affordable kinetic cores.
Antoine: I wish to attain greatness like that of Guillotin and build something that can change Fontaine.
Antoine: Imagine a nation as I envision it, dear friend. Humans freed from gravity, free to fly through the skies.
Antoine: Clockwork meka shall perform all the labor we need on the ground.
Antoine: While we, having primacy over all other beings, shall be freed from such. We shall be free to think, to produce art, to develop culture!
Antoine: Is this not lovely?
