Traveler: What happened?
Mermet: I was reprimanded because I accidentally gave the wrong route while guiding a cargo ship, and it almost ran aground.
Mermet: Okay, fine, I'll admit it's partially my fault, but you can't pin all the blame on me.
Mermet: The routine hydrological surveys at the harbor have been suspended for a while now, so my charts haven't been updated for ages.
Mermet: If I had the latest hydrological charts, this kind of problem wouldn't have occurred in the first place.
