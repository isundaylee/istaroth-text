# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Great heroes may be going a little too far...
Paimon: #Yeah, Traveler and Paimon are used to this already!
Paimon: Although they were able to catch us off guard, it's good that nothing serious happened!
Paimon: Now that Elchingen has been arrested, what are you and the other staff gonna do...?
Balfour: *sigh* The organizing team has been disbanded and everyone is being investigated. The good news is that most of us are just ordinary employees and didn't get involved with Elchingen's crimes...
Balfour: I was questioned by the Corps of Thirty just before you guys pulled through. I still have to head to the Citadel of Regzar to assist them in their investigation after I deal with the mess over here...
Balfour: How could I have been so blind and allowed Elchingen to play me like a fiddle! I honestly thought he was a good person... Dang it!
Traveler: He's in the hands of the law now.
Balfour: You know, even if the person behind it all had ill intentions to begin with, the competition itself still holds an incredible purpose! Don't let such a great opportunity be ruined because of a few bad apples!
Balfour: Let me know if you guys are ever in the mood to organize another Beast Tamers Tournament. I'll be sure to give it all I've got to make it something great!
Balfour: But if you're too busy and don't mind letting me take care of it, I'll be more than happy to continue organizing the Tournament!
Paimon: That sounds great! Mr. Balfour, you truly are one of the most responsible people Paimon has ever met!
Paimon: Hopefully everything will go smoothly, and the Wisdom Orb modifications will live up to everyone's expectations!
Traveler: Don't be so hard on yourself.
