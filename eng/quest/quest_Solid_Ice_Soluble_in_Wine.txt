# Solid Ice, Soluble in Wine


## Talk 1

Eula: A small Foamy Reef, please... Thank you.
Traveler: Eula?
Eula: I... I'm fine.
Paimon: Huh... There's something off about Eula. Was she already drinking before she got here?
Paimon: But, Foamy Reef has coffee in it. Would it upset her stomach if she has coffee after liquor?
Paimon: For her tummy's sake, let's water it down before serving it to her!
Traveler: What's the matter?

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: Following Paimon's instructions, you mix water into the coffee...
Eula: This tastes pretty good...
Paimon: Wow, she didn't even notice how much water we added. She must've had a lot to drink.
Eula: One more, bartender... Huh? Wâ€”Wait, it's you guys?
Traveler: We're learning to become bartenders...
Traveler: You only just now noticed us?
Eula: Ugh...
Eula: Sorry. I just came here from The Cat's Tail. Perhaps I had a little too much to drink...
Traveler: Is something troubling you?
Traveler: I'm here if you want to talk.
Paimon: Yeah. It's pretty lonely to drink by yourself. You'll feel better if you talk to us!
Eula: ...
Eula: I suppose I always do drink alone.
Eula: As long as I'm in Mondstadt, I'll never be welcome at taverns. I was actually feeling good today and wanted a drink, but they still wouldn't get off my back...
Eula: #Tell me, Traveler, how did you manage to make so many friends?
Eula: People always sound so appreciative and are always smiling when they talk about you.
Eula: But as for me, just mentioning my family name is enough to make everyone...
Traveler: Hey, don't think like that.
Paimon: You didn't choose to be born into the Lawrence clan, and we don't care about that kind of thing. The Eula we know is a great person!
Paimon: But you don't like being straightforward. You always pretend to hold a grudge, and you try to hide your tenderness away from everyone...
Eula: Hey, who said I was pretending.
Traveler: Others will accept you, Eula...
Traveler: There will be many people who accept you one day, Eula...
Eula: Do you think so? Heh, it's impossible to imagine, even when I'm this drunk...
Eula: Even after being a Knight of Favonius for all this time, people still... whatever.
Traveler: Winds always change their course.
Paimon: Oh, right! Tone-Deaf Bard said something wise like that, too.
Paimon: Just be yourself, Eula... and keep moving forward.
Paimon: Sooner or later you'll change what people think about the Lawrence clan!
Traveler: Yes, just be patient.
Eula: Okay, thank you...
Eula: I... ahem! I should go now.
Traveler: Would you like me to walk you back?
Eula: No need. I want to remember what you said, and I won't be able to think about anything else until I write everything down.
Paimon: Eula sure is a lot more open after a few drinks.
Paimon: But it does feel like something's missing without her signature revenge line.
Paimon: Uh-oh... When she wakes up in the morning, do you think she'll come threatening us to forget about what happened today?
Traveler: Hmm, maybe.
