# Pontoon Parkour


## Talk 1

Confused Bystander: Ugh... My boyfriend asked me to solve a difficult problem. My head hurts just by thinking about it... Here it is: "<color=#00E1FFFF>You have 5 wood boards. Use them wisely to cross the river.</color>"
Confused Bystander: Arranging the 5 wood boards next to each other can only make me go half the distance. If you were to put space between them to reach the other side, the gap would be too big for me to jump across.
Confused Bystander: An <color=#00E1FFFF>adult man</color> could jump further... I guess I can't do it after all.
Confused Bystander: What do you think? How should we arrange them?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Arrange next to each other.
Confused Bystander: Are you sure? You'll barely manage to reach half the distance though.
Confused Bystander: Please wait a moment, I'll arrange them like you asked.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Arrange with gaps between them.
Confused Bystander: Are you sure? The gap between them would be too big to jump across.
Confused Bystander: Please wait a moment, I'll arrange them like you asked.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let me think again...
Confused Bystander: Sure, no problem. I'll take the boards back.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I've made up my mind.
Confused Bystander: Here goes the challenge! Try to cross the river as quickly as possible! Ready... Go!

## Talk 6

Confused Bystander: Quick! Don't waste time! Cross that river!

## Talk 7

Confused Bystander: Awww... You couldn't reach the other side in time, just like me.

## Talk 8

Confused Bystander: Wow! Incredible! Thanks to you, I can brag to my boyfriend now!

## Talk 9

Traveler: I'll practice a bit before trying.

## Talk 10

Confused Bystander: How is it going? Are you ready to tackle the challenge?
