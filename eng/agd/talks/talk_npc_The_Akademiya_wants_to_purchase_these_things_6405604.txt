Traveler: The Akademiya wants to purchase these things...?
Zohreh: That's right. After all, researchers, students, and other staff all need to sleep and eat.
Zohreh: The Akademiya may have a handle on knowledge, but they still depend on the people for production and need to purchase daily supplies from the private sectors on a regular basis.
Zohreh: However, the Akademiya also provides everyone with free healthcare, imparts knowledge through the Akasha Terminal, and covers the costs of holding necessary festival celebrations.
