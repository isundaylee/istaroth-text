Arakanta: So much fun! Arakanta is very happy playing games with Golden Nara! And Nara is so fast! So amazing! Like a real tiger!
Arakanta: It is fun playing with other Aranara and real Rishboland Tigers, but playing with our new friend, our Nara friend, is even more fun!
Traveler: Why would the Rishboland Tiger chase Aranara?
Arakanta: The Rishboland Tiger and Aranara are friends, and friends play together. But Arakanta noticed that Nara are afraid of the Rishboland Tiger. That's why Arakanta came up with a new game for Festival Utsava!
Arakanta: Thank you, Nara. Here is an Aranara flower for Golden Nara!
