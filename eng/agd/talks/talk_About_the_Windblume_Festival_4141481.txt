Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Goth: Oh, my, if it isn't the Windblume Festival again. The youth of the city have come out to play.
Goth: Haha. I wonder what flower shall be offered up to the Anemo Archon this year? Will it still be a Dandelion?
Goth: When I was a young man, I used to enjoy debating the identity of the Windblume as well. I was quite the dyed-in-the-wool Dandelionite.
Goth: Come to think of it, my wife and I met during the Windblume Festival. It was truly love at first sight...
Goth: *sigh* How the years have gone by since then...
