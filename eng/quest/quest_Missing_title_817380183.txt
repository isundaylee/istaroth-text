Traveler: What are you doing here?
Hanayama Kaoru: I was wondering where I could find some flower seeds, so that I can plant flowers around here again.
Hanayama Kaoru: The population of this island was evacuated during the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: I moved back after I heard that everything had been resolved.
Hanayama Kaoru: But all the flowers I planted around here have withered, and I can't find any seeds anywhere. What a pity... this is the perfect place for planting flowers...
