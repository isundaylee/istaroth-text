Traveler: That's very... far-sighted.
Yusuf: Of course! You may not know this, but Ms. Sulaykha is a real genius. She was invited to study at Akademiya.
Yusuf: She rejected those block-headed adults, though. She said, and I quote, "Learning is no fun compared to making money."
Yusuf: Ms. Sulaykha also told me that the biggest secret to building wealth is to "stay away from the Kalimi Exchange."
Yusuf: A genius boss with a caring heart. I should have enough to last me for life!
