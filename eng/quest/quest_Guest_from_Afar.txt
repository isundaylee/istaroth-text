# Guest from Afar


## Talk 1

Verr Goldet: How stressful...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Verr Goldet: Something about this area just unsettles me. I can't quite explain it.
Verr Goldet: It doesn't help that all our guests seem to be the hypervigilant types too...
Verr Goldet: If there's the slightest disturbance, we end up with broken windows and doors, sometimes broken floorboards too.
Verr Goldet: Thankfully the guests do sort the repairs out themselves. But these piecemeal repairs have left us with an assortment of different bits and pieces that don't go together, and it just looks horrendous.
Verr Goldet: Could you take a look around outside the inn? If you find anything untoward, just... sort it out. I need to look after the guests.
Traveler: Okay.
Verr Goldet: Thank you.
Traveler: What is wrong with these people...
Verr Goldet: Oh come on, they're not that bad! They're just used to being in survival mode out in the wilderness. You can't blame them for being on high alert.
Verr Goldet: Please, just take a look around the vicinity. I'm sure you won't encounter anything too disastrous.

## Talk 2

Verr Goldet: All done?
Traveler: Not yet.
Verr Goldet: Don't take too long. The guests are more likely to overreact to any disturbances once night sets in.

## Talk 3

Verr Goldet: All done?
Traveler: Yes.
Verr Goldet: Wonderful. Tonight will be a peaceful night.
Verr Goldet: Please accept these as compensation for your trouble.
