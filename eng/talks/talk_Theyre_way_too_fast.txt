Traveler: They're way too fast!
Aeval: I—I see. Feedback noted! I'll report it to the higher-ups. Thank you for your suggestion...
Aeval: "She" is not that young anymore, I'm afraid. I've heard that the aquabuses are converted small naval boats from Fontaine's navy after it got disbanded.
Aeval: They were way faster when first converted than they are now — they got slowed down to keep operational costs low. I'll keep your suggestion in mind and pass the feedback on, though!
