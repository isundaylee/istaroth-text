Traveler: What are you doing?
Chourei: Hm? I'm here to maintain order at the port.
Chourei: To be honest, this port is very safe, and there aren't many issues. The most dangerous thing that has happened so far was a dispute between the captains of two cargo ships about who should enter the port first.
Chourei: One of the captains let their emotions get the better of them, and jumped directly from their own ship's mast to confront the other captain.
Chourei: Needless to say, everyone was pretty startled, and in the end, Ms. Cassigneul herself had to step in to mediate.
Chourei: You should've seen how far that captain leaped. Are all sailors that strong?
