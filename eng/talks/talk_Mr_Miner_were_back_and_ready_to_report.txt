Paimon: Mr. Miner, we're back and ready to report!
Yuehui: Ah! Am I glad to see you again! I was getting nervous... At first, I figured I'm paying a fair price, and these are professionals. But then I thought... Goodness, I'd hate to send someone off on a strange commission and then for something bad to happen to them...
Yuehui: I'd never be able to forgive myself if you came to any harm!
Paimon: Don't you worry, mister, it was nothing we couldn't handle! Anyway, we're back, aren't we? And the good news is, we got to the bottom of what's been going on!
Yuehui: Excellent, excellent! So then, what's the situation down there?
Paimon: Uh... Heh, well... Ummm...
Traveler: It's like a hilichurl hospice.
Yuehui: Huh? ...Hospice?
Paimon: ...Uh, basically, the hilichurls down there don't wanna fight anymore. Leave them in peace, and they won't cause you any trouble.
Traveler: What Paimon said.
Yuehui: Well, we certainly wouldn't be going out of our way to provoke them, you can count on that. The last thing any of us miners are looking for is to stir up trouble... All we're looking for is, well, all that glitters.
Paimon: Now there's a philosophy that Paimon can get behind.
Yuehui: ...I gotta be honest, I didn't really understand the situation you were describing, but having your assurance that everything's okay is the main thing. It means we can get back to work straight away.
Yuehui: I'm very grateful to you both! You came a long way for this. Please take these as compensation.
Traveler: You have nothing to worry about.
Traveler: Hilichurl utopia. Hili-topia, if you will.
Yuehui: Sorry, hili-topia...?
