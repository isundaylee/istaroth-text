# Materials: MATERIAL_CONSUME_BATCH_USE

## Fragile Resin

An item used to restore Original Resin by 60 points.
This crystalline substance pulsates with a little energy that can be absorbed by Original Resin.
The flow of energies of all sorts is the source of many wonders and challenges in this world. Those same energies are also contained within this crystal.

## Transient Resin

An item that can be used to replenish Original Resin. Once used, it will replenish 60 Original Resin.
Once obtained, it will *automatically dissipate* after a period of time.
·The expiration time will be calculated from the Monday after this item is obtained, and it will disappear seven days from then.
·Multiple Transient Resins obtained on different weeks will have their expiration dates counted independently.

Pure energy that will dissipate with time. In this, it is similar to all else that is lovely in this world. But seize this opportunity and go make the world a slightly better place, as is fitting for one who dwells within the bounds of "time."
