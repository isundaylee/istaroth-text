It's said that long ago
A human samurai once stumbled across the Mikawa Flower Festival
What's a human doing here?
We erected the barrier, didn't we? Ugh, what a pain...
The youkai at the festival began discussing
How to drive away the human
When suddenly, they heard a voice
This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!
What difference does it make if a human joins us youkai!?
The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai
And when he spoke, the other youkai fell silent
You there, young man. Do you drink sake?
...Yes, I do
Hah! Then join us. We can enjoy tonight's festivities together. Haha!
And so, the youkai and samurai celebrated together
The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)
Their spectacular game ended in a draw, and a new friendship was forged...
Haha, I can't believe a human could keep up with me
Witnessing the dynamic powers of the youkai
Will certainly help hone my swordsmanship
You're a swordsman!?
Yes, I'm currently traveling the world in search of formidable opponents
Then let's make a deal
We meet for a duel every ten years, whaddya say?
I look forward to it
