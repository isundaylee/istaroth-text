Kavus: #When will you be free, Traveler? I want to hear more stories from you!

## Talk

Traveler: About Rana...
Kavus: Rana would tell us stories every time she returns from the forest. But I still prefer stories of the sea...
Kavus: I swear I'll become a great captain!

## Talk

Traveler: About Aranara...
Kavus: #No... I won't say anything... We agreed to keep it a secret, even from Traveler.

## Talk

Traveler: About the tale of the giant sea serpent...
Kavus: #Yes, the giant sea serpent in Traveler's story sounds amazing. But there's nothing more to it now that it's already been taken down.
Kavus: I wonder if there are other giant sea serpents... If so, that'll be the moment when Captain Kavus makes his entrance!

Kavus: So you say...

Kavus: Will Rana come back this time?

## Talk

Traveler: About Rana...
Kavus: Rana said she was leaving for a trip and would be away for a very long time, much longer than before...
Kavus: But since I'm older than Sudabeh and Iotham, I'll take care of them for her!
Kavus: Let's play with Rana once she gets back!

## Talk

Traveler: About Aranara...
Kavus: Rana has gone traveling, and I haven't seen my friends in the forest for a long time...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Kavus: #See you, Traveler, please visit Vimara Village often!

## Talk

Traveler: Take good care of Sudabeh and Iotham.
Kavus: I will. I'm gonna be a good big brother, and I'll never leave them behind! Otherwise, Rana will criticize me.
Kavus: #There will come a day when I become Captain Kavus, free as a seagull. To make it come true, I've been fishing with Dad. These are the fish I caught, I want to give them to you, Traveler!
Kavus: #Um... By the way, Sudabeh said recently she's been learning to cook on her own so that she can be a big girl soon. So if you happen to eat something suspicious she made... well... please don't be hard on her, Traveler!
