## Talk 2

Muepu: Want to try "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?
Traveler: I've forgotten the rules, sorry...
Muepu: Three Qucusaurs will fly off. Keep your eye on the middle one...
Muepu: When they all fly back, *recognize... the one originally in the middle*. That will do.
Traveler: Alright, I'll give it a try.
Muepu: When ready, hit the target and start!
Traveler: I've got something else on, so I'll be back later.
Muepu: Fine. I will be here.

## Talk 3

Muepu: No more prizes left. No more prizes, no more challenge.
Muepu: Any other questions?
Traveler: Could you tell me more about "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?
Muepu: Passed down in the tribe from long ago...
Muepu: Keen eyes are critical to us, the Flower-Feather Clan.
Muepu: This generation, I am in charge.
Traveler: Is there a reason why you speak so slowly...?
Muepu: Previous injury. Fell from a very high place...
Muepu: Throat and chest... Can't speak like before.
Muepu: But I don't think it's... too terrible.
Traveler: No worries, no questions for you.
Muepu: Wish you well. Goodbye.
