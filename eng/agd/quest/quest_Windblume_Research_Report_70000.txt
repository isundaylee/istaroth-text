# Windblume Research Report


## Talk 1

Paimon: Well, that's those pictures taken. Oh, right, let's not forget to take a picture of Flora, too!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, that's that. Let's get those pictures back to Sayid.

## Talk 3

Flora: Welcome to Floral Whisper. We're always very busy during the Windblume Festival.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hmm, what else did we need to take photos of... Oh, right! The Anemo Archon statue in front of the Cathedral, that's been all prettied up with flowers!

## Talk 5

Sayid: Have you finished taking those pictures?
Traveler: Got them all right there.
Sayid: Oh, these are very well shot. I'm sure that they'll come in handy in my research.
Sayid: Seeing such lovely sights reminds me of the festivals in my hometown, Sumeru...
Traveler: What do you celebrate there?
Sayid: Ah, I suppose you're not familiar with our traditions. Every year, we celebrate the Sabzeruz Festival to commemorate the birth of Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Sayid: But if we want to compare the atmosphere, I'd say that there's some difference between the festivities now and the ones back home...
Sayid: Speaking of which, I wasn't able to take part in this year's Sabzeruz Festival either. It's been so long â€” I wonder how things are at the Akademiya nowadays...
Sayid: Well, I'm getting off-topic. Regardless, thank you for your help. Please accept these as payment.
