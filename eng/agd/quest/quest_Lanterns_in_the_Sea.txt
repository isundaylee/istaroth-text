# Lanterns in the Sea


## Talk 1

???: Alright, you folks from the Treasure Hoarders, yeah? I thought I insinuated in my letter there that you should have done like I done and put on a mask and a costume and so forth...
???: ...But it seems you didn't all get the memo. Hehehe... it's pretty cool though... gutsy.
Paimon: Hmph! Well guess what? We don't need to go sneaking around everywhere wearing disguises! Because unlike you, we would never do anything so shameful that we would need to wear masks while doing it!
Paimon: Really!? I was in the middle of my speech and everything!
Traveler: I think he just enjoys dressing up...
???: Wait a second now... You folks ain't no Treasure Hoarders! What game are you two playing!?
Traveler: This get up is pretty cool, though...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Tell us your diabolical plan, now! It's over, buster!
???: Okay! I give up!
Paimon: Give up now or feel the wrath of my Paimonial... Huh? You're giving up just like that?
???: I, uh... I'm just a lowly apprentice thief who really looks up to the Treasure Hoarders...
Paimon: An apprentice thief!?
???: Yeah... For a greenhorn like me, 'specially working on my own an' all... The Treasure Hoarders? Man, they're my heroes...
Paimon: Wait a second, soâ€”
???: ...So, I thought I'd try and set up some sorta lucrative opportunity, then submit my pledge of loyalty...
Paimon: Wait a second! None of this is making any sense!
Paimon: Paimon was expecting a serial arsonist to be someone more... sinister! Evil-looking! But instead... We get you!?
???: ...Arson? What the heck are you talking about?
Paimon: Don't pretend! Paimon's seen you, loitering around piles of highly flammable materials!
???: Oh... Oh yeah, yeah, I know where you're talkin' about. But I was only checking the place out.
???: My plan ain't got nothing to do with those lantern construction materials.
Paimon: ...Are you serious!?
???: I just wanted to nab me the biggest chunk of Plaustrite in twenty years is all...
???: I was gonna wait till nightfall, chop off half the tethers, float it out to sea...
Paimon: Oh...
???: Then all I'd have to do is find some way or another of bringing it down, so I could hide it underwater in the shallows. The perfect crime!
Paimon: Uhh, for a perfect crime, it sure has a lot of holes... For example, how exactly were you planning to bring down the Plaustrite once it was airborne?
???: I was still in the process of figuring out the details, hence why I hadn't made my move yet.
Paimon: This guy is an imbecile!
Paimon: #Okay, Traveler, let's teach him a lesson.
Paimon: Let's go find Yaksha-man and debrief.

## Talk 3

Xiao: I see. Human stupidity is infinite in its randomness... But it is of no consequence to me.
Xiao: Now. I am here, at the place you insisted upon. The Mingxiao Lantern is in sight. Why did you summon me here?
Traveler: To see the Mingxiao Lantern, of course.
Paimon: You are obviously one of the heroes this festival is all about... Why don't you want to get involved?
Xiao: I cannot be near crowds of people. Carefree, happy crowds of people... I simply cannot.
Xiao: Too long have I spent suffering and slaughtering. It is all I know...
Xiao: I will discuss it no further.
Xiao: Goodbye.
Xiao: ...
Xiao: Though, if while you are in Liyue you encounter any trouble of a supernatural nature, call my name.
Xiao: Whether yours or Liyue's, I hear all cries for help, all prayers for peace, and all the wishes carried by the lanterns.
Traveler: Thank you... and Happy New Year.
Paimon: Happy New Year!
Traveler: To celebrate Lantern Rite, of course.
