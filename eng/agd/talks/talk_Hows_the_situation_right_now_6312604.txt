Traveler: How's the situation right now?
Nathan: Though I'm part of the resistance, if I'm to be frank about the situation, both sides have their strengths.
Nathan: The Shogunate is better trained, organized, and equipped. However, the Sangonomiya troops have unwavering morale and determination, and the people are extremely united.
Nathan: Don't underestimate the will of the people. Even though the resistance can muster fewer troops and is outmatched in equipment on the battlefield, we still believe that we have a fighting chance.
