Xixi: *yawn*
Xixi: Gah, I burned several nights reading the books I bought during the festival. What did they call them again? "Fan novels"? Yeah, that's what they called them. And I've got to say, I got more confused the more I read them.
Xixi: In this one, these two people got together in the end, But in that one, they separated...
Xixi: But they're the same characters, right? Then why did the stories end differently? I don't get it.

Xixi: Haaa... Atchoo! Hmm? Do you need something?

Traveler: What is this place?
Xixi: This is the International Trade Association.
Xixi: ...
Xixi: ...Hmm? What else do you want?

## Talk

Traveler: What can I do here?
Xixi: Hmm. The International Trade Association used to be a gathering place for foreign traders. Everyone would come here to mingle and exchange business news. It was a bustling place.
Xixi: As for now... because of the lockdown, foreign traders have become a rare sight in Inazuma. As you can see, it's all much quieter now.
Xixi: Those merchants who need help would probably just visit Kurisu directly.

## Talk

Traveler: About Kurisu...
Xixi: President Kurisu is very reliable! Every outlander on Ritou can count on him.
Xixi: He's been living in Inazuma for a long time, after all. He has all sorts of secret resources...
Xixi: Oh no, I'm talking too much! Um, you didn't hear that...
Xixi: Well... Anyway, even if you aren't a merchant, you can still ask Kurisu for help. As outlanders, we all have to look after each other here... That's what he always tells us.
Xixi: For a fellow outlander like yourself, I believe the President will definitely welcome you with open arms if you ever find yourself in trouble. Yeah.

Xixi: Hoo... Goodbye...

Traveler: What can I do here?
Xixi: Hmm. The International Trade Association is a gathering place for foreign traders. Everyone comes here to mingle and exchange business news.
Xixi: Lately, the number of outlander merchants has increased greatly, and so the number who need help has also gone up.
Xixi: I've been so busy that I haven't slept well the past few nights. *yawn*
Xixi: Still, I'm only doing some of the simpler reception work. For more details, it'd be best if you asked Kurisu.
