# End of the Line


## Talk 1

Paimon: *yawn*...
Paimon: Wait... Where are we...
Traveler: We're still underground.
Traveler: Paimon, are you feeling better?
Paimon: Yup, way better! Paimon just got a little fright because she's never seen a crazy place like this before...
Paimon: Who would've thought the best guide in all of Teyvat could end up so out of their depth... Hahaha...
Traveler: Fatigue and fear are normal.
Paimon: Yeah. Heehee...
Paimon: So anyway, Paimon just had the weirdest dream. There were cattle mooing constantly...
Ushi: Moo!
Paimon: Yeah, just like that!
Paimon: Aw, Ushi, you were looking after Paimon?
Ushi: Moo, moo.
Xiao: ...
Yanfei: Traveler, it looks like the Conqueror of Demons is awake.
Traveler: How do you feel?
Xiao: ...I'm fine. Don't worry.
Xiao: The karma I carry is dangerous to humans. Keep your distance.
Yanfei: Well, I have adepti blood in me. So, I wouldn't worry too much.
Xiao: ...Even so.
Paimon: What happened while Paimon was sleeping? How did Xiao get here?
Xiao: With a little help, I was able to find my way here.
Traveler: All thanks to Yanfei.
Yanfei: Conqueror of Demons, could you tell us what happened before you joined us?
Xiao: No need to be so formal. Just call me Xiao.
Yanfei: Oh, sure.
Xiao: ...
Xiao: It was a senseless battle.
Xiao: I came here looking for someone, but when I found them... they weren't anything like how I expected.
Yanfei: Madame Ping says that you usually base yourself at Wangshu Inn to guard the main road through Dihua Marsh. It's unusual for you to go looking for someone yourself... Are they an adeptus?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I'm looking for a yaksha called Bosacius.
Traveler: (I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere before...)
Yanfei: Bosacius... Is that one of the Five Yakshas, like you?
Yanfei: I thought that you were the only one left. Aren't the other four... gone from the world?
Xiao: You could say that. But Bosacius's body is the only one that was never found.
Xiao: Yakshas deal with god's remains all the time, and we become tainted by karma. Over time, it inevitably drives us to madness... The last time I saw Bosacius, it was the day he lost his mind.
Xiao: He left. No one knew where he went and I never heard from him again.
Xiao: But Bosacius was the eldest of us. He once told us, as Yakshas we will experience countless wars. Whether we live or die, we must promise to take care of each other and know each others' fate, to the very end.
Yanfei: Did he forget his promise because he lost his sanity...
Xiao: It's possible. But I did not.
Xiao: I am the sole survivor. So it is my duty to find out the fates of the others.
Paimon: What made you come to The Chasm? Did you hear something about Bosacius being here?
Xiao: Did you know that five hundred years ago, the beasts of Khaenri'ah invaded The Chasm?
Traveler: I've heard a thing or two.
Xiao: That war lasted a long time. It is said that in the midst of the battle, a brave yaksha was seen putting up a heroic fight.
Xiao: But no one knew the yaksha's name.
Yanfei: But... there were many more than five yakshas in total, so there's no guarantee it was Bosacius.
Paimon: Wow... But you must think it was probably him if you came here to investigate, right?
Xiao: I am by no means certain. And I didn't have any other clues except for this one.
Xiao: But Bosacius was proud. If he had taken part in that war, he would have announced his name. So at first... I thought the nameless yaksha couldn't be him.
Traveler: ...You found Bosacius?
Xiao: ...
Yanfei: Wait, so it was Bosacius you were fighting with? Did he injure you?
Xiao: ...Yes.
Paimon: No way...
Yanfei: The invasion of monsters from Khaenri'ah, the battle in The Chasm, and Yelan's ancestor... I have a feeling that somehow, these are all connected.
Yanfei: Life is full of coincidences, but this is too much of a coincidence. Could this all be related to the Fantastic Compass mentioned in the will, too?
Xiao: What will?
Yanfei: Oh, right. I came here because of a will.
Yanfei: Maybe it's not something you've come across much before? But both mortals and adepti sometimes write out their final wishes so somebody else will carry them out after they've passed. It's known as a last will and testament.
Xiao: And this... can be done at any time?
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, you wanna write a will now!?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: It was no accident that you saw my illusion that day. This place used your desire to find me to create a trap that you would willingly walk into.
Xiao: Pure deception is easy to spot, but the truth laced with lies can be a fatal combination. What you heard were really things that I said.
Xiao: It made sure you heard my real voice to create panic. This one-way communication was the bait.
Xiao: If we hadn't managed to get in touch through the spatial rift, we may well have lost someone by now. Rather than murdering in cold blood, this space seems more intent on consuming souls.
Paimon: How is this even possible...
Xiao: Our opponent is very clever. It is not safe to stay here.
Xiao: Everyone, whether I accomplish what I came here to do or not, I must find a way to get you out safely.
Yelan: ...
Xiao: I rejoined to warn you that it's extremely dangerous here. If you stay here too long... this space may well devour you.
Paimon: But how do you know?
Traveler: What happens if we get "devoured"?
Xiao: ...You might become a shadow of your former self, wandering the underground like a lost soul.
Yelan: Sounds like you saw them too...
Yanfei: Yelan, you're back.
Yelan: I've been back a while. I was listening to the conversation.
Yelan: I've seen some strange things here, too. Objects that shouldn't be here, strange figures appearing then vanishing... I don't think any of it's real.
Yanfei: So they're just illusions?
Xiao: At first, I had the same thought.
Xiao: But it's not that simple. There may come a day when these illusions become real and attack you.
Yelan: From what you were saying a moment ago, it sounds like you know a way out of here?
Xiao: I can't say for sure... it's just a guess.
Xiao: As Yanfei said, this space is chaotic and unstable, but it has its weaknesses. By attacking the point where both spaces connect, I was able to create a rift and move from one to the other.
Xiao: So... If I use all the energy I have, I may be able to tear a passage out of this chaotic space.
Yelan: Really... So powerful attacks can affect the space itself. I'd wondered if that was a possibility.
Yanfei: Whoa whoa whoa, but what do you mean by all the energy you have?
Xiao: ...I mean, it will take everything I've got.
Paimon: Wait a minute, when you said you were gonna get us out safely, you mean... you're gonna stay here?
Yelan: You can't be serious...
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I saw Bosacius underground. That's when I realized the horror of this place.
Xiao: A single blast can only create a very small opening. To send you back to the outside world, I may need to continuously channel power in order to keep the tunnel open.
Xiao: ...I know how to fight to the bitter end. I can do this.
Traveler: But if this takes all the energy you have, you'll...!
Yanfei: No... No way. Even if what you're saying is true, I can't agree to this.
Paimon: Paimon neither! It's not much of an escape plan if we've gotta leave someone behind!
Traveler: We should leave together.
Xiao: It's only a good or bad plan if there are other options to compare it to. But that's not the situation we're in right now. I doubt you'd still be stuck here if anyone had a better idea.
Yanfei: But can you be certain that your plan will work?
Xiao: I cannot.
Paimon: What is wrong with you? You can't bet your life on something if you don't even know it's gonna work. It's not worth it!
Yanfei: To conclude, I'm not agreeing to this plan.
Xiao: What if I told you... this is my last will?
Yanfei: You...
Yelan: That's your strategy, huh?
Yelan: No offense, but we have no guarantee this plan of yours will succeed, or even that it's safe.
Yelan: You said it yourself, yakshas pose a danger to humans. You really expect us to accept your self-righteous plan just because you say so?
Xiao: The battlefield is a treacherous place. Every opportunity you take, you put everything on the line for. If you fear sacrifice and failure, you can never be victorious.
Yelan: I've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. So I know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end.
Xiao: ...
Yelan: You say these things in the hope that we will understand and accept them. But if you don't even know that your self-sacrifice is going to pay off, all you're doing is hurting morale.
Yelan: Besides, if you were really so determined to end it all, you wouldn't have given us the opportunity to share our opinions. You think you're oh-so cold and ruthless, but I'm not buying it.
Yelan: And anyway, losing one of us so the rest can escape? Some victory that is.
Yanfei: Yelan... Don't be so harsh...
Yelan: ...
Yelan: Point is, it's not time for drastic measures yet. It's possible there's a hidden passage leading to the exit that we just haven't discovered.
Xiao: What if there isn't? Or if we don't find it? And in the end, I'm so weak that I don't have the strength left to sacrifice myself... what do you propose we do then?
Yelan: As things stand, there's no difference between sacrificing you and trying to find another way out in terms of the likelihood of success. If we can't say that one strategy is better than the other, we certainly shouldn't be rushing into a risky course of action.
Traveler: (Is Yelan seriously getting annoyed...)
Arataki Itto: Did someone say a strong enough strike can break us outta this place? Yeah, that's right, I heard ya.
Arataki Itto: No one's staying behind to let anyone else out, alright! Enough talk, it's time... for action!
Arataki Itto: C'mon, whatever you are, let's see how long you manage to keep us trapped in here after I'm finished with you!
Yelan: Easy now...
Traveler: (The atmosphere is so tense... What should I do?)
Traveler: I'll always be with you, Paimon.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Itto!
Kuki Shinobu: ...
Arataki Itto: Phew... hah... how 'bout that, huh? The path, did ya... see it...
Kuki Shinobu: ...*sigh* Why do you always have to do things like this...
Yanfei: Shinobu...?
Paimon: What happened to Itto? Did he pass out?
Ushi: Moo!
Kuki Shinobu: The boss used up all his strength in one punch. Maybe that's the reason he managed to tear open a passage.
Yelan: ...Let me see if there's any way I can stabilize it.
Yanfei: He did this because he heard us arguing, right?
Kuki Shinobu: The thing with Boss is, he just can't stand conflict between teammates.
Kuki Shinobu: Whenever we get into an argument in the Arataki Gang, he always goes and does something shocking to calm everyone down.
Kuki Shinobu: Today, he's done it again. He may not have known you for very long, but when he said he sees everyone as part of the same team, he truly means that.
Ushi: Moo.
Kuki Shinobu: Another thing with Boss is, he hates it when other people sacrifice themselves, but he always seems to end up doing it himself... That said, there's a slight distinction to be made with him.
Kuki Shinobu: When he does things like this, he doesn't really think he's sacrificing himself, because he genuinely believes that he's strong enough to defeat any obstacle he's facing.
Paimon: Giant ego alert... And wasn't he just doing the same thing Xiao suggested? So stupid!
Traveler: Why didn't you try to stop him?
Kuki Shinobu: The boss is hardly open to persuasion. Besides, he always acts without thinking. There's no doubt that he really thought he was about to solve everything in one hit.
Kuki Shinobu: It's not just him either. The other guys in the Arataki Gang are more or less the same. That's why they need someone like me to clean up after them.
Kuki Shinobu: I couldn't stop him if I tried, so I might as well just let him do his thing. Besides, often his hare-brained intuition is surprisingly on point. We might punch our way out of here yet.
Paimon: Uhh... Itto... Please tell Paimon you're okay...
Xiao: ...I'm sorry.
Kuki Shinobu: Don't be, you have nothing to apologize for. Both you and Yelan made some very good points.
Kuki Shinobu: Still, if this was an Arataki Gang issue and you were one of our members, I have to say I'd side with Yelan on this one.
Kuki Shinobu: The boss definitely wasn't sacrificing himself. He firmly believed that we'd be able to find a way out through the passage he opened up, and he's certainly not expecting to be left behind.
Kuki Shinobu: Everyone's important. We have to support each other if we're going to get out of here. Your survival is of huge importance to some people... no, to a whole lot of people.
Paimon: ...Shinobu...
Kuki Shinobu: Everyone, let's all do our best to try and find a way out. There's still a chance... I'm sure we can escape.
Kuki Shinobu: Leave the boss to me. Don't worry.
Xiao: ...
Yelan: Everyone, it seems this passage doesn't lead to the outside world, but deeper inside.
Paimon: What the... so Itto's efforts were in vain...
Yelan: No, it's still worth exploring. I'll go and take a look first.
Yanfei: ...Aha, I see! I'm with you.
Paimon: Uh, what?
Yanfei: So far, I still haven't found the thing I came looking for. That magical device. Remember?
Yanfei: If this domain has the power to project our imaginations or the things we're searching for into reality... Well, maybe I can use that to my advantage to track it down.
Paimon: Oh, right! No wonder she keeps telling us to keep going... If it's a magical device, it must be super powerful!
Yanfei: Well, I can't guarantee that, but it's worth a try.
Xiao: I will find a way.
Traveler: Wait...
Yanfei: #Let them go. But if you were planning on going into that domain too, {NICKNAME}, then come with me.
Yanfei: After all, I'm just a lawyer, hehe. We'll be safer if we team up.
Yanfei: By the way, um... You and Xiao seem pretty close, huh? Yelan got a bit worked up just now, so I just wanted to apologize on her behalf.
Yanfei: I have to say, though, if Yelan hadn't spoken out like she did, I'm not sure she would've gotten through to him. Also... self-sacrifice is something Yelan feels strongly about. She'd try to stop whoever it was.
Yanfei: From what I know, she's lost comrades in the line of duty before, and then was rescued herself. Maybe being a survivor is what makes her so against seeing other people sacrifice themselves.
Yanfei: How can things ever be the same again, knowing that your life was saved when others weren't? In a way, salvation can also be a burden.
Yanfei: ...If I were her, I'm not sure if I would have done anything different.
Traveler: ...
Yanfei: Oh! Wait, one second, I'll be right there.
Yanfei: ...Hya!
Yanfei: Right, that's much safer. Since Itto can't fight right now, I've cast a spell to protect you guys.
Kuki Shinobu: Thank you, Senpai. Please be careful.
Yanfei: We will, same to you.
Yanfei: Alright, Traveler, let's go.

## Talk 3

Yanfei: What's this?
Traveler: What a weird and wonderful scene...
Yanfei: Look at that huge disc in the distance... Hold on, is that the Fantastic Compass?
Traveler: It's even bigger than a cooking pot...
Paimon: What? That's the best description you can come up with? It's way, way bigger than that!
Yanfei: Huh, well, it seems our theory checked out. In my humble legal opinion, that's almost certainly the magical device I've been looking for. It really showed up...
Yanfei: But, if this really is the Fantastic Compass... It's so huge! How the heck am I gonna lug that back to my office!
Yanfei: #...Ahem, I mean, come on Yanfei, don't give up now. Let's investigate the area first, {NICKNAME}.
Yanfei: What the...! Are they... are they Treasure Hoarders?
Traveler: What are Treasure Hoarders doing here?
Yanfei: They look familiar... Oh, yeah, I bumped into these rapscallions a few days ago.
Traveler: It's even bigger than all our heads combined...
Traveler: Spacetime has become totally chaotic...

## Talk 4

Yanfei: Phew, easy peasy. Just like last time.
Yanfei: You know, when I ran into them before, I was working on a big commercial case. The defendant hired them to attack me, just to get back at me.
Traveler: Being a legal adviser sounds tough...
Yanfei: Eh, happens all the time. Luckily, I'm well trained in martial arts, so taking them down was a piece of cake.
Yanfei: But these are the exact same guys as I met last time... Is this space recreating scenes from my memory?
Yanfei: Maybe this is one of the ways our adversary intends to devour us... unbelievable.

## Talk 5

Yanfei: I thought we might run into some other people here, but apparently not...
Traveler: Yanfei, what's that sound?
Yanfei: The Fatui? Whose memory is this?
Yanfei: Aaah, watch out!
Yelan: Hmph, just as I thought.
Yanfei: Yelan, you're here!
Yelan: I will take you down no matter how many times you show up.
Yanfei: Hey, relax, we're all together now.

## Talk 6

Yelan: Amateurs. And still they dare to come after me.
Yanfei: You've still got it.
Traveler: That voice just now...
Yelan: Remember how I said I'd seen some illusions myself?
Yelan: Those were the same words I heard last time. The space seems to be reproducing that memory...
Yelan: Now that you know, at least we're all on the same page.
Yanfei: He said the word "fantastic"... was he talking about the Fantastic Compass?
Yelan: Yanfei, see that thing on the ground?
Yanfei: Yeah, we tinkered with it, that's how we met up with you. I guess it's a miniature version of the Fantastic Compass in the distance... It has a close connection to the entire space.
Yelan: Hmm. It looks somewhat familiar, let me think...

## Talk 7

Yelan: ...Another new space.
Yanfei: If everywhere within this space follows the same rules, there must be another small Fantastic Compass somewhere around here.
Xiao: ...Bosacius, I can't believe someone like you would end up as a lost soul underground.
Traveler: Xiao!
Yelan: No enemies? Hold on...
Yanfei: Wait... is the enemy hiding itself? Oh no, we should go help him—
Xiao: Stay back!
Xiao: This is my fight... do not come near me.

## Talk 8

Xiao: Ugh! ...*cough*
Xiao: Enough... phantom, be gone!
Bosacius: Argh!
Paimon: Xiao, are you okay?
Traveler: You haven't even recovered from your injuries yet...
Xiao: This is my purpose. Don't worry about me.
Yelan: So your invisible opponent was the legendary Bosacius, Marshal Vritras?
Xiao: Yes.
Xiao: So excuse my stubbornness. Bosacius has been missing for centuries... This may have been the last time I will ever see him.
Paimon: He was saying something about holding the line at all costs...
Xiao: He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.
Paimon: But didn't you say he'd always announce his name? How could his name be lost to time? ...What happened?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I don't know. Maybe he forgot who he was.
Yanfei: Because the karma you spoke of drove him to madness?
Xiao: Bosacius had already gone mad before he disappeared. There was no way of knowing if his memories were intact.
Yelan: He still took part in the battle of The Chasm, despite having gone mad?
Traveler: ...
Xiao: We yakshas are not a race that thrive in peacetime. It's likely that he was drawn by the scent of bloody war.
Xiao: Slaughter is what we do best... Maybe it's the only thing we know.
Traveler: ...
Xiao: This battle confirmed my suspicions. As we had speculated, this space reflects information from people's minds.
Xiao: In other words, despite going mad, Bosacius came here. The illusion we saw just now is the impression he left behind.
Xiao: This space recreated him as he was during the battle. The way he fought was so self-destructive... He couldn't possibly have survived.
Traveler: He fought the monsters...
Yelan: Bosacius's illusion said he'd discovered the monsters' weakness and lured them underground.
Yelan: What kind of place could this be? Defeating Khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure.
Yanfei: Guys, it could just be me, but... I think I'm suddenly feeling more tired than I was.
Yelan: This space is really starting to affect us.
Xiao: I believe Bosacius stayed here, underground. But now he is gone, and only his illusion remains.
Xiao: If we don't leave, we may meet the same fate.
Traveler: Let's go.
Xiao: Time to move on.
Xiao: You fought well, Bosacius. Goodbye.

## Talk 9

Yelan: ...
Xiao: I rejoined to warn you that it's extremely dangerous here. If you stay here too long... this space may well devour you.
Paimon: But how do you know?
Traveler: What happens if we get "devoured"?
Xiao: ...You might become a shadow of your former self, wandering the underground like a lost soul.
Yelan: Sounds like you saw them too...
Yanfei: Yelan, you're back.
Yelan: I've been back a while. I was listening to the conversation.

Yanfei: Whoa whoa whoa, but what do you mean by all the energy you have?

Paimon: Wait a minute, when you said you were gonna get us out safely, you mean... you're gonna stay here?
Yelan: You can't be serious...
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I saw Bosacius underground. That's when I realized the horror of this place.
Xiao: A single blast can only create a very small opening. To send you back to the outside world, I may need to continuously channel power in order to keep the tunnel open.
Xiao: ...I know how to fight to the bitter end. I can do this.
Traveler: But if this takes all the energy you have, you'll...!

Yelan: I've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. So I know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end.

Yelan: Easy now...
Traveler: (The atmosphere is so tense... What should I do?)

## Talk 10

Kuki Shinobu: Don't worry. Ushi and I know how to take care of the boss.
Kuki Shinobu: I think I can speak for both of us in saying, it's not our first rodeo.
Ushi: Moo, moo!
Kuki Shinobu: Go on, get outta here. And be careful.

## Talk 11

Paimon: There's nothing here at all!
Yanfei: What a creepy space.
Yelan: It has the feel of the Abyss.
Yelan: But... where are the opponents?
Xiao: ...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: I think this is my memory.
Paimon: Your memory? Of what?
Traveler: Of emptiness. That's the power of the Abyss.
Paimon: The Abyss? So... this place is created purely based on your memory?
Traveler: I'm afraid so. Because I will always remember...
Traveler: ...That the Abyss took my twin away.

## Talk 12

Paimon: *gasp* It's... it's...
Traveler: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}! Wait!

## Talk 13

Paimon: Huh? What's that shiny round thing on the ground?
Traveler: (It looks like...)
Yanfei: ...The Fantastic Compass?
Yelan: In the other spaces, the Fantastic Compass was always partially buried in the ground. But this one is lying flat, intact... as if somebody left it here.
Paimon: #Oh... {F#he}{M#she} was just a figment of your imagination, {NICKNAME}...?
Paimon: #So {F#he}{M#she} appeared as an illusion because you miss {F#him}{M#her} so much, huh?
Traveler: #I can sense that {F#he}{M#she} is not here.
Traveler: But at least we found this.
Paimon: Mmm...
Yelan: Yanfei, are you sure this is the Fantastic Compass you're looking for?
Yanfei: I think so. There were no pictures in the will, but based on the description, it seems to check out.
Yanfei: Yelan? What is it?
Yelan: From the design and build, this Fantastic Compass looks extremely similar to the catalysts used by my clan. I just need to do this, and...
Yelan: ...Hmph, someone's used this before. There may be a hidden message inside.
Yelan: Let's get out of here and find somewhere safer.
