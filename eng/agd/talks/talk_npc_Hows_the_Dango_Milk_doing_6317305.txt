Traveler: How's the Dango Milk doing?
Tomoki: Thanks to our Almighty Shogun, the number of people who came to buy some Dango Milk went up significantly. They all think it's pretty good, too.
Tomoki: I've given it a little thought, and given the kind of business we've been doing recently, there'd be no problem switching to just selling Dango Milk. Still, I love experimenting more...
Tomoki: I originally wanted to replace Dango Milk with some new creative dish, but my customers all missed its flavor. So after discussing it with them, I decided to return Dango Milk to the menu every so often.
Tomoki: As it turns out, it sold even better that way! Sometimes I couldn't even keep up with the demand, haha!
