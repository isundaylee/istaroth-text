# Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...


## Talk 1

Babel: Esteemed Master of the Jinni! There is an urgent matter that I need to inform you of!
Babel: I was so shocked when I first heard about it... Oh, where should I begin...
Paimon: Huh? What is it?
Babel: Jeht... Jeht, she's... I hate to say it, but she... could very well be a traitor to the tribe.
Paimon: Huh!?
Traveler: Do you have any proof?
Babel: Some time earlier, we caught a northerner who knew Jeht. He told us... that Jeht had revealed to them the location of all our outposts.
Babel: If all our outposts are exposed, the actions of the entire Tanit tribe in the desert will be utterly restrained...
Babel: What's more, according to him, Jeht has already sent out several batches of assassins, her very target being you... who possesses the Jinni.
Paimon: Huh!? Isn't that...
Traveler: Ahem!
Babel: If his confession's true, Jeht should be active in their camp.
Babel: And according to our recent reports, the northerners are indeed closing in on our tribe. They have bypassed our sentries and set up camps at a dangerously close distance.
Traveler: Those are signs, not proof.
Babel: In the desert, no one should take any ominous sign lightly. The excessive speculation of "Jeht is a traitor" is just the worst inference I have made based on the existing signs...
Babel: Plus... She hasn't been back for a long time. I'm really worried about her.
Babel: Please forgive me for making such a speculation... But I genuinely think of her as my own daughter. No matter what she might've become, it is the consequence of my own mistake...
Babel: Therefore, esteemed Master of the Jinni, I beg you, regardless of the path she has chosen, bring her back to me...
Babel: Whether she lives to prove her innocence, or has paid for her missteps.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: So... did Jeht really betray us?
Babel: I'll mark the location of the northerners' forward operating base on your map. Just keep looking in this direction and you won't miss it.
Traveler: I will find her, figure everything out, and bring her back.
Babel: Sorry, it all happened so suddenly... It's hard even for me to accept such a twist.
Babel: Please bring her back to me and let me talk to her, will you?
Paimon: Don't worry. We will!
Traveler: Tell me where she might be.

## Talk 2

Yuften: H—H—Hello, e—e—esteemed Master of the Jinni!
Traveler: How have things been lately?
Yuften: N—Not too bad. It was quite a shame that we lost Aderfi, a—along with all those goods. Fortunately, we still have contact with o—other merchants, so the l—loss is s—still acceptable.
Yuften: Th—The supply of seeds, soil, and Anahitian Blessing is fairly normal, b—but some annoying bandits s—s—still show up every now and then and rob our caravans. D—Darn it!
Yuften: Traitors, and Jeht... Ugh! Must be those northerners behind all this!
Traveler: About the northerners...
Yuften: Th—They came into the desert a long time ago. Th—They'd trade things with us, teach us new te—te—techniques.
Yuften: At that time, w—we thought they were good people, much warmer than those city people who live in trees...
Yuften: But then, th—they started using those advanced, shiny things to lure our people, make them b—break away from the tribe, and m—make them rebels.
Yuften: Th—That's when we discovered that these northerners a—are not good people, b—but enemies that should be guarded against.
Yuften: F—First it was Aderfi and Azariq, now even Jeht...
Yuften: *sigh* Sometimes, I—I—I don't even know who to trust.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Yuften: I—I—I'm sorry... I never thought sh—sh—she would become a traitor.
Yuften: Matriarch Babel trusted her so much. I—I—I adored her as well. She was like a l—little an—antelope, hehe... But that northerner said, he said...
Yuften: Sh—She may be coming for you. If you are to investigate the matter, please d—do be careful!
Yuften: Th—The assault last time... Sh—She must've been the one who's behind it.
Yuften: *sigh* H—How, how could this happen...

## Talk 3

Investigate: Hmm... "Gerardo," "Ice Cream," "Pierogi"... They have mixed passwords from different times! Which one's the real password?
Traveler: Guess we have to try them one by one.
Investigate: Yeah... Paimon has no better idea.
Investigate: And it looks like they've moved the location of their main camp! Hmm... This map looks way too ugly! Paimon can only roughly make out the direction they went...
Investigate: Well, let's catch up in the direction they left, shall we?

## Talk 4

Investigate: (An opened matchbox with the Fatui's Delusion logo printed on it. Used matchsticks are scattered around it, not yet buried by the sands.)
Investigate: (One cannot help but wonder why the Fatui Skirmishers would use this method to start a fire when they could simply drive elements.)

## Talk 5

Investigate: (An empty wooden box, which has not been buried by the sands yet. Obviously, it was just recently abandoned, and the owner should not have gone far.)

## Talk 6

Yevgraf: Who are you? Password!
Paimon: Password! What was the one that we found again?
Traveler: "Gerardo."
Yevgraf: ...
Yevgraf: Huh? "Gerardo"? What is that? Sounds like some air freshener brand.
Yevgraf: Hey, Ilyusha, "Gerardo"! Does that ring a bell? I've never heard of it.
Ilyusha: "Gerardo"? Nah. Is that the brand of the baby powder you use?
Yevgraf: Do I look like someone who uses off-brand baby powder? The Mr. Charming Yevgraf, using "Gerardo"!? Am I a joke to you?
Ilyusha: C'mon, I was just asking! Why are you so worked up!?
Yevgraf: How dare you humiliate me and ask me to calm down? Am I someone with such bad taste? Do I look like someone who uses "Gerardo"?
Ilyusha: *sigh* Alright, sorry! I apologize, come on! Stop fighting over some baby powder! Anyway, what did you just ask...?
Ilyusha: Hold on a sec... Yes, you asked about the password! Ah, I do have a vague impression. Lemme check the password list real quick...
Yevgraf: Hmph, this is the attitude that my colleague should have!
Yevgraf: Hey, you there! Do I look like someone who uses "Gerardo"?
Paimon: Eh...?
Traveler: No...?
Yevgraf: See, I told you! I only use Fontaine brands. And listen, if you are looking to buy any skin care or hair products, my advice is all you're gonna need.
Yevgraf: Don't get yourself fooled by that stupid "Gerardo."
Ilyusha: Hey, hey, Yevgrash, I found it! The password "Gerardo" was selected by Captain Zoya. It's... uh... her favorite puppy.
Yevgraf: Oh! Oh... I—I see.
Yevgraf: I—I've never used "Gerardo," actually.
Ilyusha: I know, I'll keep it a secret.
Yevgraf: Thanks, man.
Paimon: ...
Ilyusha: But... Well... This password has expired, now that we just changed it. Now it's... Well, it's a little embarrassing, haha. It's that... little... thing.
Yevgraf: What? Captain Zoya's cat?
Ilyusha: Pfft... Ahem! N—No. It's another cute little animal. As soft and furry as a cat, but smaller and more docile...
Traveler: I guess it's bigger than a mouse, but smaller than a ferret.
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing!? This isn't the time for riddles! We still have business to do!
Yevgraf: That's right! And we, too, have serious work on our hands! Sorry, that was the correct password, but unfortunately, it's no longer valid.
Ilyusha: Ding ding ding! You're out! Both of you!
Ilyusha: Then what was Captain Zoya's order again? Ah, that's right... Those who fail to match the password shall be executed on the spot.
Yevgraf: So, uh, sorry, friend. I can't let others know that I've used "Gerardo."
Ilyusha: Yeah, we're really sorry... Wait... What do you mean you've used it!?
Yevgraf: Shut up and fire!
Traveler: "Ice Cream"?
Yevgraf: ...
Yevgraf: Uh... Nope.
Traveler: Um... "Pierogi"?
Yevgraf: Nice try. What next? "Cheese"?
Paimon: *sigh*
Traveler: Never mind. Let's just fight.
Yevgraf: Uh... Thanks.
Paimon: Hey, you've actually got manners!

## Talk 7

Investigate: Hmm... There's another document mentioned here. Why don't we search that one, too?

## Talk 8

Yevgraf: Who are you? Password!
Paimon: Password! What was the one that we found again?
Traveler: "Gerardo."
Yevgraf: ...
Yevgraf: Huh? "Gerardo"? What is that? Sounds like some air freshener brand.
Yevgraf: Hey, Ilyusha, "Gerardo"! Does that ring a bell? I've never heard of it.
Ilyusha: "Gerardo"? Nah. Is that the brand of the baby powder you use?

Yevgraf: Hey, you there! Do I look like someone who uses "Gerardo"?
Paimon: Eh...?
Traveler: No...?
Yevgraf: See, I told you! I only use Fontaine brands. And listen, if you are looking to buy any skin care or hair products, my advice is all you're gonna need.
Yevgraf: Don't get yourself fooled by that stupid "Gerardo." These brands always like to come up with names like that, but they can't even tell you why. They'll just throw fancy words around and pair them with fancy packaging...
Yevgraf: And boom! They toss their products onto the shelf and make big money! Money from us honest and simple folks!
Ilyusha: Hey, hey, Yevgrash, I found it! The password "Gerardo" was selected by Captain Zoya. It's... uh... her favorite puppy.
Yevgraf: Oh! Oh... I—I see.
Yevgraf: I—I've never used "Gerardo," actually.
Ilyusha: I know, I'll keep it a secret.
Yevgraf: Thanks, man.
Paimon: ...

Paimon: *sigh*
Traveler: Never mind. Let's just fight.
Yevgraf: Uh... Thanks.
Paimon: Hey, you've actually got manners!
Traveler: Look, I just found a boot of yours.
Yevgraf: Huh? Oh, I see... Uh, thanks? Ilyusha? Ilyusha!
Ilyusha: Yes, Yevgrash! I heard you!
Ilyusha: What's wrong this time? Is it your recycling device? I'm not your mechanic, y'know? I have my own tasks to work on!
Traveler: What's a recycling device?
Ilyusha: It's a... well, special equipment of the desert expedition team. Think of it as a water purification device that can convert the water excreted by the human body into drinking water.
Ilyusha: In this way, we can not only save the time looking for toilets everywhere, but also produce enough drinking water for ourselves, which is rather important in the desert, don't you think?
Paimon: So you're saying... Ewwww!
Traveler: Fascinating.
Yevgraf: That's enough. Is this boot yours?
Ilyusha: I don't think so. It doesn't smell like mine.
Yevgraf: Smell?
Ilyusha: I never wash my feet.
Yevgraf: Ugh, stay away from me.
Yevgraf: Alright. It's not ours. Anything else?
Traveler: No. Let's fight.
Yevgraf: But thanks anyway. After I bury you, I'll ask whose boot it is for you.
Traveler: Gross.

## Talk 9

Investigate: That's how it is... They're taking Jeht to the canyon!

## Talk 10

Orest: Stop... Please stop hitting me! I'll give you whatever you want!
Paimon: Hmm... These are all daily supplies for camping. Looks like they were taken from a nearby tribe...
Paimon: #Paimon sees no other clue... {NICKNAME}, let's ask this guy!
Orest: Wait, what do you want to know? I'm not telling you anything. I don't know anything!
Traveler: Name. Tell us your name.
Orest: What?
Traveler: She's Paimon, and I'm your worst nightmare. What about you?
Orest: What?
Traveler: Can you understand me? Yes or no?
Orest: Y—Yes...
Traveler: Very well. Your name. Tell me.
Orest: O—Orest. Private Orest Snezhevich.
Orest: I—I really don't know anything... I just joined the desert expedition team, and I haven't even familiarized myself with the organization of our forces. You literally can't get anything out of me!
Paimon: We haven't asked you anything!
Traveler: Jeht. Does this name ring any bells?
Orest: N—No...
Traveler: Liar. Tell me everything you know.
Paimon: #{M#He}{F#She} means that if you tell us, we'll let you go!
Orest: Wait, wait! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything I know, but that's all I know!
Orest: That girl named Jeht... She... she's a monster.
Paimon: ...?
Orest: They were going to bring her back in a cage... But she woke up and tore the cage apart, and then, the guy standing closest to her... Oh my, poor Jophery...
Paimon: What happened...?
Orest: He... he, uh... changed. He became like... like festive confetti...
Paimon: Huh!?
Orest: You know, uh... Sometimes bits of confetti would fly into your mouth and you'd just try to spit them out, right? But, but...
Orest: Well, when we realized something was wrong, we realized... that those weren't confetti, it was Jophery...
Paimon: Ah! Stop, stop! Paimon's feeling sick...
Orest: What happened later... I wasn't sure. It was all messed up...
Orest: Thanks to our medic, Lieutenant Muldoon, who acted fast and saved us all.
Orest: "Shoot her! Shoot her!" "Pull out your guns!" He yelled like that. And we fired at her with all the Electro bullets we had that were supposed to paralyze our prey.
Paimon: What!? With guns and bullets!? She could die!
Orest: Someone already died! One of our people!
Orest: *sigh* Anyway, long story short, she's alive and asleep. She fell into a deep slumber this time.
Orest: But... the thought of her waking up and going into a rage again, I can't help but... *cough*
Paimon: Is Jeht... really that scary?
Orest: She... she's not a girl... She's a monster! A real monster!
Traveler: Calm down.
Orest: You... you know, I came to the desert... to do this business. I can earn a lot of Mora, a lot of tax-free Mora every day... *cough* I get to support my family...
Orest: I mean... I can afford to send my sister to school, an esteemed one... so that she won't be sent to the House of the Hearth like me...
Orest: Well... I'm not saying that the House of the Hearth is terrible or anything, but I want her to have a brighter future, y'know... She's an orphan too, just like me...
Orest: She wanted to learn the violin or something... I don't really get that rich people stuff...
Orest: Anyway, I was ignorant and naive back then... All I knew was that when I grew up and joined the Fatui, I would be able to make her wish come true...
Orest: Sorry, my apologies... I must've talked too much... *cough* I wasn't trying to win your sympathy or anything, I just wanted to say...
Orest: ...that I did not join the Fatui just to suffer like this!
Paimon: (Wow... Is Jeht so scary when she gets angry...?)
Traveler: Tell me where she is and you can go home.
Orest: Th—Thanks... I'll mark the location on your map.
Orest: See this camp? It's the transfer station where we transported her. Even if she's not there, you should be able to find the next location.
Orest: If possible, when you arrive at this camp, can you warn my colleagues and officers for me?
Orest: Uh, just let them get rid of that nightmare as soon as possible... Our mission has already failed, and there can be no results.
Paimon: What about you? Aren't you going back?
Orest: No... As long as they insist on capturing her alive, I dare not to go back.
Traveler: We are better at beating people than passing on messages.
Orest: Thanks... If that's all, I'll be leaving now.
Paimon: You can go now! Don't go back to the camp or we will beat you again!
Black Screen Text: Orest limped away, and his lonely figure quickly faded into the desert...
Paimon: Alright, we should leave as well! The next camp isn't too far away.
Traveler: I'll make sure everyone is well-persuaded.
Traveler: I get it.
Orest: N—No! You don't get it! H—How could you possibly get it!?
Traveler: Or you can be like your colleagues.

## Talk 11

Investigate: Hmm... There's another document mentioned here. Why don't we search that one, too?

## Talk 12

Investigate: There's nothing about Jeht... Let's keep looking and see if there're any other files at the camp.

## Talk 13

Investigate: That's how it is... They're taking Jeht to the canyon!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm... It seems that someone in the tribe is working with the Fatui, that's why Jeht... Ugh! Who could it be?
Traveler: Maybe it's the same person who framed Jeht for her rebellion...
Paimon: Then we'd better find Jeht first and fast. She's still in great danger, and now, the Tanit tribe is no longer a safe place either.
Paimon: Let's hurry!
Traveler: We must find Jeht first and fast.
Paimon: You're right. After all, she's still in great danger. We must find her soon and figure out what's going on!

## Talk 15

Babel: You're back. Is there any news about Jeht?
Traveler: I need a bit more time.
Babel: Of course... Please, make sure you find her.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: I still cannot fathom why she'd cooperate with those dangerous northerners... Maybe it's those northerners who kidnapped her.
Babel: In any case, she would need to either confess to the Tanit or publicly prove her innocence. It's the tribe's rules, and there's nothing I can do about it.
Traveler: About the Fatui...
Babel: As I said before, the Tanit used to have established a trade relationship with them. But soon after, these northerners started planting spies and training moles among us...
Babel: Only by then did I realize that the people who sent them to the desert are probably not well-intentioned...
Babel: Hence, we expelled those northerners from tribal territory, and only allowed them to settle on the outskirts of the desert.
Babel: Who knew they harbored such... lofty ambitions, and still tried to infiltrate our tribe regardless. Perhaps they heard about the Eternal Oasis...
Traveler: Bye.
Babel: May quicksand and poisonous winds stay away from you, esteemed Master of the Jinni!

## Talk 16

Investigate: (Apparently, these are military assets belonging to the Fatui Skirmishers. It is unclear how they ended up here. They're already filled with sand...)
Investigate: (Wearing these now must be extra tormenting...)

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Babel: Greetings, esteemed Master of the Jinni. Have you got any news?
Traveler: We're still looking for Jeht.
Babel: That's good... I hope you find her soon. I'm also very... very concerned about her.
Babel: Ugh... You have no idea how much I want to question those northerners in person, but if I rushed it, it would definitely alarm them, which would be even more detrimental to Jeht's safety.
Babel: Therefore, esteemed Master of the Jinni, on tribe's future rests on your shoulders.
Traveler: She's been kidnapped by the Fatui.
Babel: Is that so... In other words, she didn't betray the tribe? No... We still can't rule that possibility out...
Babel: I see... Can you confirm her location? I will send people to rescue her immediately.
Traveler: I... I don't know.
Babel: ...
Babel: In this case, even if we sent out a rescue team, it would only alert those northerners... It isn't to her advantage.
Babel: Although making such a decision makes my heart ache much, I refuse to startle our enemy. I will continue to wait for your words.
