Traveler: Tell me about potion-making...
Carabosse: Well now, to think that you'd be interested in such. I suppose you're also one enthralled by "possibility." Good, good.
Carabosse: You see, in potion-making...
Carabosse: You process ingredients that don't have any effects on their own, mix them together, and they'll turn into potions that can work in lots of different ways!
Carabosse: It is a deed akin to using the impression things have given you in your memories, and combining them with flashes of inspiration to create new "realities."
Carabosse: Even I do not know what the potioning possibilities are! This is the excitement of being a potioneer.
