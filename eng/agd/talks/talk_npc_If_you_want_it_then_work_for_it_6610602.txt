Traveler: If you want it, then work for it.
Pacha: Haha, that's true, but as we all know, most members of the Flower-Feather Clan enjoy flying in the sky on their Qucusaurus friends.
Pacha: It's hard enough to see one on the ground, much less set up a meeting.
Pacha: Hmm... But now that I think about it, both the Scions of the Canopy and the Flower-Feather Clan like high places, and have a pretty good relationship with one another...
Pacha: Which means, I shouldn't give up just yet!
Pacha: Mhm, it's a good thing that I'm not afraid of heights. Next time, I'll try my luck with a hot-air balloon and go even further up.
