# Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III


## Talk 1

Jeht: Next up is the third cave... Will the big iron ball still work?
Azariq: It is over 500 years old now. I doubt we can rely on it much longer, so we must act quickly.
Liloupar: I shall lead the way. Our path gets smoother the further we proceed, it would seem.
Azariq: Alright, come on, folks. Into the pilot cabin.

## Talk 2

Azariq: Turning the panel on should do the job. Hmm, guess I'll let you do it.
Azariq: Wouldn't be nice if I stole all the fun from you, y'know?

## Talk 3

Azariq: ...
Jeht: What's wrong, Azariq? Feeling unwell? We can take a break if you're tired.
Azariq: No, I'm good. Real good, in fact.
Azariq: Jeht, we need to talk.
Jeht: Hmm? Is it something important?
Azariq: #...Before that, {NICKNAME}, I have a favor to ask of you.
Traveler: What is it?
Azariq: Would you hand the Mother of the Jinn over into my keeping?
Paimon: Huh!?
Liloupar: Well, well, aren't you a hasty lad? Far too hasty for your own good...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Azariq, you're like an elder brother to me, and I respect your guidance. But I... I don't understand. What's going on? Please, tell me!
Azariq: I'm doing this for the Tanit. We're getting close to our destination, and it is for the best that we take care of the Mother of the Jinn, rather than leave her in an outsider's hands.
Jeht: Is this... a request from Matriarch Babel?
Azariq: It is the rational choice. If she knew of this, she would give us her consent.
Jeht: That wasn't my question. I'm asking you, is this a request from Matriarch Babel!?
Azariq: As I said, I do this for the Tanit. The Mother of the Jinn will be an invaluable asset in our hands, while in the hands of this outsider, she's nothing but a toy — a trinket.
Azariq: Think about it! If we possess her power, we'll be able to recreate verdant oases in the desert again. Hasn't that been Matriarch Babel's pursuit this whole time?
Azariq: Once we finish this quest, Matriarch Babel will recognize your contributions by appointing you her successor, and your outlander friend will also be rewarded accordingly.
Azariq: Everyone wins here. You, me... and of course, your friend.
Azariq: You'd agree with me too, wouldn't you, outlander?
Traveler: I wouldn't be so sure.
Paimon: Liloupar doesn't seem to like you much. Paimon doubts she'd come with you!
Liloupar: Hehe, well said. But allow me to remind you: the contract between my Master and I can only be broken by death.
Azariq: You are right. My apologies.
Jeht: ...!
Jeht: This is nonsense...
Azariq: ...?
Jeht: I said that this is nonsense, and you're full of it... traitor.
Jeht: You insult me with your filthy lies, and I demand the right to respond with my blades.
Azariq: Whoa... Just a second there, little wildcat. We were just having a friendly conversation. Why did you suddenly go berserk? Haven't we always been like family to each other?
Jeht: Family? Perhaps... and perhaps not.
Jeht: First, you plot murder against our guests and taint our hospitality without Matriarch Babel's permission. This is an act of betrayal.
Jeht: Second, you've learned technologies from the northerners, but you've refused to share the knowledge with the tribe. That is against our code.
Jeht: And third, you deceive your fellow tribes-people and place them in peril.
Jeht: You're right, you know. I've always tried to view you as my brother. But what about you?
Jeht: You have forgotten your mother's name. Thus, I demand that you cleanse your defilement with your weapons.
Azariq: Wait. Calm down, calm down. Look, we're in the middle of the desert. If you kill me now, who will be able to prove your innocence?
Azariq: "Oh? So our little wildcat has finally bared her fangs against her tribe, huh?" That's what everyone will say. You'll be seen as a traitor.
Azariq: Will someone who has betrayed their own tribe ever be accepted in the desert again?
Jeht: So what? The only reason I've let you live till now is that you never did us any harm. But now, that reason, too, is gone.
Azariq: I suggest you calm yourself down. We can still talk. There's no need to resort to violence.
Jeht: I am calm! Pick up your blade!
Azariq: *sigh* I didn't expect things would go this far... I can only hope you will forgive me.
Traveler: I respect Liloupar's decision.
Paimon: Yeah, although, uh... she looks like a bottle right now, you should've asked for her consent first.

## Talk 4

Azariq: *gasp* Wait, please, stop, little wildcat...
Jeht: Shut up. You disgust me.
Azariq: *gasp* I'm not asking for your forgiveness. Just... hear me out...
Jeht: Last words, huh? Make it quick.
Azariq: You... you let me down... Jeht, I thought you'd understand... *gasp* I reckoned we could work together...
Azariq: *gasp* You... struggled outside to make a living, too... We are so alike... You care about the Tanit... and you've always been loyal, no?
Azariq: Please reconsider... *gasp* Think about it... Imagine what the Eternal Oasis will bring us... An infinite future, fertile fields, and endless opportunities...
Azariq: Future children... will no longer have to beg for food from that city in the rainforest, nor will they need to learn the killer's trade. They will no longer have to rely on some strongman just to live with some dignity...
Azariq: Think about it, Jeht... Babel is... no worthier... than us... to rule the Tanit...
Azariq: *gasp* Think, Jeht, think... You're a smart girl... You would... have done the same... for the Tanit...
Jeht: Are you finished?
Azariq: Go... If you... spare my life... I can get my friends on the outside to... spare yours, too...
Azariq: Ha... Or what? Are you... *gasp* willing to be the first member of our tribe who... slaughters your own? I hope you have given thought to... the fate of traitors—
Black Screen Text: "The one who fails to return alive is the traitor... or so you just told me."\nSays Jeht.
Paimon: ...!
Traveler: ...
Liloupar: Ahem. I understand if you may wish to mourn for your fellow tribesman or something... But I am obliged to tell you that this big thing will not hold up for much longer.
Liloupar: My master, for your own safety, we should leave as soon as possible.
Jeht: Yes... Let's go.
Traveler: Are you alright, Jeht?
Jeht: No. I... want to throw up, actually.

## Talk 5

Jeht: #{M#You're awake! How are you feeling? Are you hurt? Can you still walk?}{F#You're awake. Phew... I thought... Sorry, I'm just being a little... Don't mind me. Um, are you hurt? Heh. Need me to carry you?}
Paimon: #Whoa... That was horrible... Are you alright, {NICKNAME}? Let's get out of here as soon as we can! Who knows if this big guy might explode again...
Traveler: I feel a little dizzy, but don't worry, I still recognize you...
Paimon: Hmph! Still joking, huh? Alright, alright! Let's get out of here!
Liloupar: I am still here as well. My bottle remains intact.
Paimon: Hmm... Jeht, Paimon's more worried about you, honestly. You okay there?
Jeht: Just got a few more scratches. Nothing much.
Liloupar: Alright, let us move on. A safe place, this is not.
Traveler: My rear hurts, but my legs still work...
Jeht: I did a quick check on you. Your bones are fine. There's just a big bruise. Fortunately, you escaped serious injury.
Jeht: But if you have trouble walking, let me help.

## Talk 6

Jeht: You shameless traitor! You dare to show up here? Explain yourself!
Aderfi: Wait, please, calm down...
Jeht: I am calm! You just mentioned Azariq, didn't you? I've already dealt with that filthy creature, and I wouldn't mind having a repeat performance with you!
Aderfi: I thought you saw him as your brother...
Jeht: Brother, my foot! And you, traitor, had better take stock of your situation. Each word you say could be your last!
Aderfi: I... He... Wait, I'm really confused right now. Just give me a second to organize my thoughts, please!
Jeht: Organize your thoughts? Of what? Of teaming up with the Fatui? And you guys! You're with him, aren't you!?
Fatui Skirmisher: Uh...
Fatui Skirmisher: Uh... It's a long story, if you would...
Jeht: Shut it! I'm so sick and tired of having to "be reasonable" with the bad guys. I don't care what you have to say. My blades, though, have lots of things to say to you!
Aderfi: Wait...!

## Talk 7

Jeht: Hmph... I need to wipe my blades. Help me keep watch.
Traveler: He was working with Azariq...
Jeht: Judge the criminal first, then find the evidence, huh... Whatever. It makes no difference.
Jeht: Azariq... So he wanted to murder Matriarch Babel, then become the co-leader of the Tanit with me by "marriage"... and then make us all puppets for the northerners?
Jeht: ...And that's why he had to take you, who might already know what was going on, out of the picture, and gain control over the Jinni. From the very beginning, he had assumed that I would trust him absolutely and go along with his scheme...
Jeht: I trusted him so much, too! I never... I never imagined he was such a disgusting person.
Liloupar: Alright. Revenge has been had, and the drama comes to a close. Drumroll please! And who has had the last laugh? Oh my, it's our little Jeht!
Liloupar: *sigh* This is exhausting. Shall we proceed?
Jeht: Matriarch Babel needs to know about this.
Liloupar: Returning now just to give her a report? Oh, I wouldn't call that wisdom.
Liloupar: Do you really think that desert woman would believe that these two stupid men — and not you — are the traitors if you return empty-handed?
Liloupar: For the sake of argument, let's assume you have proof of their betrayal. But knowing what you do of the desert dwellers' traditions, do you think your tribe will focus on the evidence and not pay a single slice of attention to the fact that you killed your tribesmen?
Liloupar: Will Matriarch Babel have eyes only for the proof and forgive the shame caused by your brutal slaughter? I, for one, think she'd much rather hear some good news.
Jeht: ...
Liloupar: If you wish to return to rest for a moment, you can. But speak nothing of what transpired here. That is my advice.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Agreed.
Paimon: Hmm... You two didn't argue at all. That sure is a new one.
Traveler: Liloupar's analysis is on point.
Jeht: If we didn't have more important things to do, I would've cut their heads off and taken them back with me.
Traveler: Well then, let's move on.
Jeht: Alright. I will watch your back.
Paimon: Speaking of which, where are we going?
Paimon: The big iron ball is totally broken, and there are no clear paths around.
Liloupar: Worry not, little one, you still have me.
Liloupar: Well, there is this hole over there that the big iron ball created as it fell. We should be able to reach our destination if we go through it.
Paimon: Eh? So you can sense stuff like that too? Wow, you're better than a compass! Maybe Paimon should call you Liloupass from now on.
Liloupar: As I said, my fragment guides me. Let us go. Enter that big iron ball, and we should find a path from there.
Traveler: You're growing wiser, Jeht.
Traveler: Why do villains always leave a trail to be found...
Paimon: Beats Paimon... Hey, that's not the point!

## Talk 8

Masseira: How utterly stupid. The tiger pulled out her fangs and smoothed her teeth just to welcome a bride.
Masseira: Now that the tiger is just one step away from her goal, she just gives up everything else — The tail? Useless! The ears? What are they for!?
Masseira: But remember, "If not handled well, your scimitar's blade could be turned against yourself." Hmph, I'm not talking about you, golden canary. I speak of...
Masseira: You'd better watch out for your friend Jeht. Take care of her, hide her fangs, and smooth her raised hackles.

## Talk 9

Jeht: So... are we just one last step away from reaching the Eternal Oasis now?
Paimon: What's the matter? Are you unhappy, Jeht?
Traveler: Are you alright?
Jeht: Hmm... I don't know. I mean, I do look forward to fulfilling my parents' dreams at last.
Jeht: But I can't help but get mixed feelings when I think of all that we've been through along the way.
Jeht: Although I now have the tribe to call home, betrayals and schemes are never far from me. Are the Tanit truly where I belong? Have I really been accepted by them?
Paimon: Jeht...
Paimon: Umm... Let's not wallow in the sad things, Jeht. The past is the past... and anyway, we've beaten all the bad guys now, haven't we?
Traveler: Paimon's right. It's water under the bridge now.
Jeht: Yeah, you're right. Let them sink into the sands. We have more important things to do!
Jeht: But... *sigh* When Dad was with me, I could say "Home is where Dad is." But now, I'm all alone.
Paimon: Gah, stop wallowing in self-pity, Jeht. You're better than this! Also, we're here for you!
Jeht: *chuckle* Don't get mad, Paimon. But you're right. I need to keep my chin up.
Paimon: Now we're talking! Huh. Aren't we supposed to head out now? We can go up using this platform, right?
Jeht: Haha, alright! Now, enough sentimentality. Let's go!
Traveler: It's not the end of the world even if that isn't where you truly belong.
Jeht: Ha, you're so carefree! You know, I was starting to forget that you're a traveler, unconstrained anywhere by anything or anyone!
Jeht: It's only that... hehe... when Dad was with me, I could say "Home is where Dad is." But now, I'm all by myself.
Traveler: What's wrong? You seem preoccupied.
Jeht: Haha, I'm alright. I'm in a good mood, actually. It's just... *sigh*
Jeht: Dad went through all kinds of setbacks and betrayals in his adventures, and I just realized that I'm on the same unfortunate path as him.
Jeht: Although I now have the tribe to call home, betrayals and schemes are never far from me. Are the Tanit truly where I belong? Have I really been accepted by them?

## Talk 10

Babel: #What's the matter, {NICKNAME}? Did you encounter any trouble during your adventure?
Babel: If you are thinking about Aderfi, he will soon reap what he has sown. Or did someone else offend you?
Babel: Don't worry. I will handle them properly.

## Talk 11

Black Screen Text: As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
Black Screen Text: Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see flaring flames and blunt blades...\nYou see the freezing moonlight and viscous honey...\nThrough the golden honey, you see the underlying scheme...
Black Screen Text: The princess sees the consequences of her innocuous error, her sanity giving way to madness...\nHer invincible husband is shaken by the tragedy, his greedy heart blinded by ecstasy...\nAll the sorrow, joy, and madness are finally turned into food for the Jinn-Mother to devour...
Black Screen Text: "It is curtains for the carnivorous Night of Honey — Such is the end of the Jinni's lover..."
Jeht: #{M#Listen here, Jinni. If anything happens to him, I'll get you for that.}{F#Listen here, Jinni. If this does any harm to her, I'll get you for that.}
Liloupar: Harm? Oh, come now. Addiction, though... Now that is a more probable risk.
Paimon: Addiction is not okay, either! It's unacceptable no matter what!
Liloupar: The golden honey, the golden scheme... Departure breaks the heart, yet the kingdom lives on under the usurper's rule...
Traveler: What are you saying?
Liloupar: You have seen that which I speak of.
Liloupar: I once believed that he would bring this land into a bright future, but he proved no different from the other shallow, mortal tyrants. I was furious... No, I was in pain.
Liloupar: I was once deeply and madly in love with him, but when I was betrayed like that... Only destruction three times greater than that love could quell my sorrow and pain... Perhaps.
Liloupar: In short... I used the hands and hearts of my own children to complete an impeccable killing. Such is the consequence of betrayal.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Let's get moving. This is giving me goosebumps.
Traveler: You... It was you who murdered them...
Liloupar: It was not "murder"... It was punishment. For my lover, and for myself.

## Talk 12

Jeht: Right there in the center is the Crystal Goblet of Al-Ahmar. If we get there, we should be able to find a way to enter the Eternal Oasis.
Liloupar: ...
Jeht: What is it? Got anything to say, Jinni?
Liloupar: Something smells familiar here. But no, it's nothing important.
Liloupar: Anyway, let us head over there first. Please be careful, my master. I will protect you from the sandstorm.

## Talk 13

Ferigees: ...
Paimon: Ahh! What is this place?
Jeht: C—Careful! I sense a strange power!
Liloupar: ...
Ferigees: ...You. The destroyer of Gurabad, the Mother of the Despicable.
Liloupar: I have returned, sister.
Ferigees: "Sister"? I don't understand. Are you calling me... "sister"?
Liloupar: Yes. Ferigees, my sister... I have returned.
Ferigees: #You are here to see our mistress, aren't you? Let me guess, you have brought your new master and... {M#his}{F#her} desert slave?
Jeht: This person's starting to tick me off...
Paimon: Well, sure sounds like she's Liloupar's sister, alright.
Traveler: It seems to run in the family...
Paimon: Wow... If that's the case, Paimon certainly doesn't want to be a guest at their place...
Ferigees: Hmph. You cannot pass.
Liloupar: Ferigees, I understand your concerns. I would even be willing to bow in apology, but please, let me see our slumbering mistress, if for but a moment.
Ferigees: You are worthy no longer, fallen traitor. There is no place for you now in the oasis realm.
Liloupar: ...
Ferigees: Leave now, before my patience runs dry and these mechanical shackles rumble, and never show yourselves here again.
Liloupar: Sister, you shed the form of a Jinni and constrained yourself to this husk for thousands of years. Is this the "survival" that you so desired to pursue?
Ferigees: ...
Ferigees: So, you dispense your kindness to me? Despicable traitor, my shackles have nothing to do with you!
Ferigees: Ugh... Agh... Ahh...! The shackles... they tighten... Leave! Leave now!
Liloupar: My master, if I may so ask, please assist me in freeing my sister from her suffering...
Traveler: Hold on, I don't get it...
Ferigees: Still so arrogant and inconstant... You disappoint me, my sister.
Paimon: Gah! Paimon hasn't even figured out what's going on yet, and we're about to fight already!?
Traveler: You mean...

## Talk 14

Ferigees: You broke this shell... My spirit and form... shall soon vanish with it also...
Ferigees: Folly... Just like some mere mortal... Why... What kind of desire... Did you hold...
Ferigees: The empty tomb... It will crumble... Just like me... and just like you, who are not whole...
Liloupar: I know, my sister. Still, I must go there, where our mistress slumbers. That is where the answers I seek lie.
Ferigees: No... Nothing there... But... the coalescence of... regret...
Liloupar: Farewell, my sister.
Black Screen Text: The ancient mechanism named "Ferigees," or perhaps the Jinni "Ferigees" who indwelled the mechanism, is silenced forever.
