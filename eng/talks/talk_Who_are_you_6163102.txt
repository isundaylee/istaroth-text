Traveler: Who are you?
Siegfria: My name's Siegfria. I work odd jobs doing deliveries back and forth between Mondstadt and Springvale.
Siegfria: When there's no jobs going, I pick wild vegetables and trade them for a bit of meat with the hunting guys.
Siegfria: I figure that even hunters can't eat meat every single day of their lives, so everyone's happy.
