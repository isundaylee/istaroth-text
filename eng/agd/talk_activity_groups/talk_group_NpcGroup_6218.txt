Lastan: If only I'd known, I'd have asked someone with more experience to come along with me...

Traveler: Is something the matter?
Lastan: You could say that...
Lastan: There's this letter that's really tough to deliver. The recipient is a traveling doctor, so we've got to deliver it while he's here at the tribe.
Lastan: I don't know why, but it's almost as if this letter is cursed. It always seems to miss him by a hair...
Lastan: I'm new to this whole courier business, and my more experienced colleagues all assured me that "beginner's luck" was a thing, so they persuaded me to give it a go. We even made a bet...
Lastan: ...Do you think they were just messing with me?

## Talk

Traveler: I wish you luck.
Lastan: To be honest, I don't really mind, as long as I can get this letter delivered!

## Talk

Traveler: Maybe there really was no other way.
Lastan: True. They've all tried delivering it themselves, and you saw what happened.
Lastan: Goodness, and I've just started at this job, too... Do you think I can handle it with my limited experience?
