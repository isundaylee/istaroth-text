Mikhail: Heh. Have you heard? It seems that the Sumeru Akademiya has made a real mess of one of their big projects!
Mikhail: The Six Darshans have been left leaderless as a result, which has forced the weak Dendro Archon to take over.
Lyudmila: Wait, so do you mean that something terrible has happened?
Mikhail: Terrible? No, not at all. It's wonderful news, in fact!
Mikhail: I've heard that Lord Dottore managed to infiltrate Sumeru during the chaos and perform a great work in the Tsaritsa's name with almost no effort at all!
Lyudmila: Huh... Then what about Lord Scaramouche? I've heard that he was recently seen in Sumeru as well...
Mikhail: Lord Scaramouche? Ah, you mean the one with the famously bad temper? To be honest, I've heard that he hasn't been seen since his assignment in Inazuma.
Mikhail: Are you suggesting that he might be related to the project in Sumeru as well?
Lyudmila: I'm not sure, really. But it seems that a lot of the soldiers under his command have been transferred elsewhere...
Mikhail: Huh. Hmm... Well, you know, transfers happen all time, so who knows if those things are related at all?
Mikhail: Anyway, I doubt that this will take away anything from the results that Lord Dottore has gotten this time!
