# Good Hunter Express


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Sara: Eh? But... Oh, alright, I'll get someone else to do it...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Sara: Thank you so much. It's much too far away, and we haven't the people to spare.
Sara: Ah, yes, please be careful while you travel. <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't run too fast or use your wind glider. You definitely shouldn't climb either...</color>
Sara: If you takes too many bumps along the way, the meat sauce and spaghetti might come apart... and if that happens, I don't think the customer will accept it.

## Talk 3

Slacking Angelo: Sheesh, I wonder where my order's gone. And I'd gone through so much trouble to find a comfortable spot like this, too...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Right, I believe a certain... Angelo ordered — and paid for — a serving of our Flaming Red Bolognese.
Sara: After that, he asked that we deliver it to him near Brightcrown Canyon. But that's some distance away, and I don't have anyone I can send there...
Sara: If you're alright with it, could you help us deliver it to him?
