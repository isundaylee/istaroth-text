Traveler: Uh, it's going to be a bit hard to treat this as my home...
Jinwu: Oh come on, you've been here a long time. This place is probably even more familiar than home!
Jinwu: Anyway, this place isn't that bad. There's no sunlight in here, but you don't have to worry about the wind, the frost, or the snow.
Jinwu: In any case, I've been down here in the mines for so long that the surface is really what's unfamiliar to me.
