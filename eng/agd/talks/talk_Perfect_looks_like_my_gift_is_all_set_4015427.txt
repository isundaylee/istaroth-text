Beidou: Perfect, looks like my gift is all set.
Eula: Is it time for your return journey, then? If you're heading back to Dornman Port, I'd be happy to accompany you.
Beidou: Yeah, I think I've gotten my fill of sight-seeing, so it's probably time I headed back. Don't wanna keep my crew waiting.
Beidou: #Traveler, Paimon, I'll see you some other time. Oh, and good luck with your business!
Eula: On behalf of the Reconnaissance Company, I'd like to express my gratitude to you as well.
