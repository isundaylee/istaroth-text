Hiroyuki: Hmm, things could get dicey if we entered a war of attrition...

Traveler: A war of attrition?
Hiroyuki: Yes. I'm currently considering conflict scenarios versus the Shogun's Army.
Hiroyuki: I've fought against the enforcers of the Vision Hunt Decree before. I know how strong they are.
Hiroyuki: By contrast, we Sangonomiya troops suffer from a severe material shortage. Watatsumi Island's production capacities just can't keep up. A war of attrition is therefore strictly disadvantageous to us.
Hiroyuki: Not to mention how Vision wielders are in the vast minority. How long can us ordinary people stand against the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hiroyuki: *sigh* This path of resistance is an arduous one indeed...

Traveler: Hey there, are you well?
Hiroyuki: Yes, and I hope you're doing well, too! Now that the war's over, I can finally enjoy the scenery here on Watatsumi Island again.
Hiroyuki: Have you been to the Sangonomiya Shrine? The huge coral really is something, isn't it?
Hiroyuki: The flora unique to the island is also definitely worth a few extra long looks.
Hiroyuki: *cough* Well, I might be getting a bit too relaxed, yes. The war is over for now, and the Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, but our differences with the Shogunate remain...
Hiroyuki: Still, that's not going to stop me from taking this opportunity to relax a little.
