Jehiet: Oh, are you a guest from afar...?
Jehiet: If so, you should rest for a good while in Vimara Village. It is much more comfortable here than in the desert...

Traveler: About the desert environment...
Jehiet: The temperature difference between day and night in the desert is frightening. The wind howls and the sun burns...
Jehiet: I didn't care about that when I was young. But now, I prefer places that are warm and humid...

## Talk

Traveler: About Iotham...
Jehiet: Iotham... There was a foreign couple in Vimara Village once, and they left Iotham behind when they left.
Jehiet: We didn't quite know what to do...
Jehiet: At that time, I felt terrible for the little child. If they didn't want to raise him, I would!
Jehiet: It was just one more mouth to feed. How could I watch him starve?
Jehiet: Iotham is a good boy who's sensible and holds respect for the elders. Now my biggest wish is that he can grow up happy and healthy.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye...

Traveler: I'm sure Iotham will grow up, healthy and strong.
Jehiet: Thank you, little guest. Iotham has told me so much about you. He admires you a lot!
Jehiet: You're still young with much room for growth. Keep a healthy diet, and you can be stronger. Now, these are for you.
Jehiet: Come back to Vimara Village if you ever feel tired or need a break. Iotham will be happy to see you.
