Traveler: This will not affect the sales revenue.
Bernhard: Indeed, Knights of Favonius has done this before - auctioning off the loot of Treasure Hoarders to raise money for charity.
Bernhard: Even if the package's origins are questionable, it's all the same.
Paimon: Come to think of it, the Treasure Hoarders wouldn't dare do this in a Knight of Favonius' shop, would they?
Paimon: Besides, he just left the package and it didn't seem like he made half a Mora.
Paimon: People who are willing to follow the charity sale must be very kind, and we don't have to be so nervous!
Bernhard: Then we'll take this package. I'll make a note of it and report it to the head office.
