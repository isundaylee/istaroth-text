# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Thoma: Sure! The atmosphere here's really relaxed. It's perfect for chatting the day away.
Thoma: By the way, I've been hoping to show you around the Grand Narukami Shrine when we get the chance.
Thoma: The Sacred Sakura at the shrine is in bloom year-round. Seeing the falling blossoms dance in the wind is quite a sight to behold... definitely a surefire way to make you fall in love with Inazuma.
Traveler: Yes, I've seen them before.
Thoma: Haha, great!
Thoma: And speaking of the Grand Narukami Shrine, one word of advice... Don't ever attack any of the kitsune nearby.
Thoma: Not that you'd ever dream of doing something like that... would you?
Traveler: Of course not, I always respect the wildlife.
Thoma: Ah, that's good. I always knew that you were a kindhearted person.
Thoma: I know an old lady who loves telling stories about the unnatural. She told me that someone was once sentenced to "judgment by lightning" after attacking one of the kitsune near the shrine.
Thoma: Kitsune are highly favored by the Grand Narukami, so I guess the offender only got what was coming to them.
Thoma: Regardless, you should probably try not to provoke any animals you encounter, regardless of the species.
Thoma: All plants and creatures equally deserve our respect.
Traveler: ...Why, what's the worst that could happen?
Thoma: Huh, you're not seriously considering it, are you? Trust me, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Attacking a kitsune is bad luck.
Traveler: I'd love to join you next time.
