# Lumenstone Adjuvant

When equipped in The Chasm's Underground Mines, this precious crystal can provide illumination.

It has many similarities to the Glazed Sand Crystal that may only be found within The Chasm, but it stores even greater power within it.
May it be as a sun in your palm, lighting the way through the lightless tunnels and bringing comfort where all is dark.
