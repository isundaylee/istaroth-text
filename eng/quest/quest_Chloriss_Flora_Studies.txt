# Chloris's Flora Studies


## Talk 1

Traveler: Heard you need some Cecilias...
Chloris: Hmm? Oh, you must have seen the commission I put up.
Chloris: Well, have you gathered three Cecilias yet?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Chloris: Alright, then. Just remember to give them to me as soon as you've gathered enough. I need them for my research.

## Talk 2

Chloris: These should be plenty for me to conduct my research.
Chloris: Here, these are for you. Take them â€” and thanks for the help!
