Bulletin Board (Arataki "The Strongest" Itto): "Crawl out of whatever hole you're in and fight me fair and square!"
Bulletin Board (Arataki "The Strongest" Itto): "This one's for taking my Vision away! An eye for an eye!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Everyone, no need to worry! This fellow is just a small-time hooligan.
Bulletin Board (Reply): Madam Kujou Sara promises that she has nothing to do with this person and that she will handle these messages immediately.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board (Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House): "Though this is not a serious matter, I still hope that it will become more common knowledge."
Bulletin Board (Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House): "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous 'Toki Alley Tales,' written by Takizawa Kyouden."
Bulletin Board (Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House): "Though it's nothing major, Lady Yae still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
Bulletin Board (Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House): "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
Bulletin Board (Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House): "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board (Message): "I am about to leave my parents and sister. Though I come from a martial family, the thought of war still makes me uneasy."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Is the war really necessary? Will Her Excellency the Ogosho really take responsibility for the war and for every one of us?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "As a samurai, perhaps now is not the time for doubt."
Bulletin Board (Reply): A samurai should never have cold feet before a battle, nor should they doubt our Shogun's decisions.
Bulletin Board (Reply): I urge you to turn yourself in for posting inappropriate messages in public. You will receive a lighter sentence of detainment and re-education.
Bulletin Board (Reply): Removing or defiling this message is prohibited.

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Citizens of Inazuma, please stay alert while traveling at night. A monster in the form of a tanuki has been spotted around the city lately.

Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Please report to a nearby Doushin or to the Tenryou Commission upon seeing it!
Bulletin Board (Childishly Written Message): "I've told you, it's not a tanuki! Not a tanuki! Not. A. Tanuki. You hear!?"

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board (Message): "Due to the current situation, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is going through some tough times. We can't just sit here and do nothing."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Miss Ogura's father was once a relative of the Kujou Clan. If we don't help each other, that would put the samurai name to shame."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Please don't worry, Miss Ogura. We'll round up some old friends, and we'll help you get through this tough time."
Bulletin Board (Reply to Message): "I really appreciate your kindness on my late father's account, but I am afraid I must decline."
Bulletin Board (Reply to Message): "I don't want to trouble everyone over such a small matter. I am sure that my brother and I can make it through."

## Talk 11

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board (Agent Advertisement): "Thanks to the careful consideration of Tenryou Commissioner Kujou Takayuki, the Vision Hunt Decree was implemented swiftly, preventing those who opposed it from fleeing."
Bulletin Board (Agent Advertisement): "The real estate assets of the fugitives will be rented out or sold today. The Tenryou Commission guarantees the legitimacy of these transactions!"

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): With the permission of Guuji Yae Miko, the Grand Narukami Shrine will provide help to those businesses and families affected by the war in the form of aid loans and food aid.
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): We ask that those in need of help visit the Kamisato Clan to file the required paperwork.
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Bulletin Board (Message): "I'd just like to say a big thank you to Lady Yae and the Yashiro Commissioner for their consideration. It's just that there are way too many people here everyday for food aid..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "People are not receiving the daily allotment of food aid that they are supposed to. What should we do..."
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): I am sorry, but we don't have a better way. Lady Yae and the Commissioner are doing their best to handle the situation.

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): The fight against the rebels proceeds apace. Only one more strike, and they shall be destroyed completely.
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): We hope that all young samurai will join together and fight to accomplish this great work!
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Come join the army! Or you may regret not having done anything for your country when the war is over!
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Please visit the Tenryou Commission for information about joining the army.
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Attention! Families that have received draft orders must send at least one adult to join the military.
Bulletin Board (Message): "This war is a monster that devours people..."
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): What right do those who haven't joined the army have to criticize the war effort? It's because the rebels have been defeated that you are able to sit here and whine!
Bulletin Board (Message): "Is that so? My husband wounded my younger brother on Yashiori Island. He may never walk again."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I haven't heard anything from my husband since then... Perhaps he was killed by some rebel? And who's to say that that rebel was never once an honorable samurai?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "Forgive me, but I do not see the point of this war. I will no longer send people to join the army."
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Just because these posts are anonymous doesn't mean you are free to spread slander. Such anti-war sentiment is naught but part of the Sangonomiya rebel's propaganda campaigns!
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): Defacing of military draft notices is prohibited! Anyone caught will face severe punishment!

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): "The Yae Publishing House's reader's forum will take place as planned. All are welcome, regardless of whether they come from territories controlled by the Shogunate or the rebels!"
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): Even though the ongoing war is a bitter one, Lady Yae Miko ensures equal treatment for all on account of sharing a common hobby.
Bulletin Board (Reply): As a major publishing house, isn't welcoming rebels to a leisure activity a bit much?
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): So long as our great Shogun doesn't forbid it, then it's perfectly fine. Shouldn't the Tenryou Commission refrain from making controversial remarks?
Bulletin Board (Grand Narukami Shrine Notice): Besides, it seems a little out of order to label those who merely live under the dictatorship of the rebels "traitors."

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board (Message): "I have taken a short break from the frontline on Yashiori Island to come home. My parents seem to have gotten a lot older, while my wife looks very exhausted."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I feel very guilty about not spending more time with my family because of the war..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Inazuma seems to have become a lot more quiet. Friends who used to be talkative are now mostly silent."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Strange. I thought my family would enjoy the war stories that I had sent home."

## Talk 19

Bulletin Board (Message): "I, Tatsunosuke, hereby announce that the military strategy dojo will be permanently shut down starting today."
Bulletin Board (Message): "The Path of the Sword is an art meant to protect others. It should not be used to kill our brothers."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Lately, I have witnessed a lot of my disciples fighting against each other. Though I am no saint, my conscience was still pricked by it."
Bulletin Board (Message): "It's time to put a stop to all this."
Bulletin Board (Message): "This is why I am shutting the military strategy dojo down, and why I shall never reopen it. I've also forbidden my disciples from serving the Kujou Clan."

## Talk 20

Bulletin Board (Message): "Despite this long period of peace, it seems that few are altogether willing to fight on behalf of our lords..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "But if the eldest son of Lord Kujou is already on the frontline, then what have we to complain about?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "And I've heard that Lord Masahito is an honorable man who looks after his soldiers. I wish I could be assigned to his command."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Madam Kujou Sara is also a good commander... although she is famously strict with her soldiers, at least she is fair and no selfish motives."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Leaders like them are rare in the Tenryou Commission..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I will stop talking about my superiors now, I think. Dear parents, please don't worry. I will come home triumphant soon, and I will bring our family honor!"

## Talk 21

Bulletin Board (Message): "If it were up to me, I would expel all the outlanders in Ritou!"
Bulletin Board (Message): "The war just won't end, and the Vision Hunt Decree remains in effect. I find it hard to believe that the outlanders have no hand in this at all!"
Bulletin Board (Message): "Those outlanders must have some way of smuggling Visions and rebels into our country..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "If only we could make the Sakoku Decree more strict. All these problems would be gone!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Please don't spread rumors and defame outlanders!
Bulletin Board (Reply): The Vision Hunt Decree and the suppression of the rebels are also going very smoothly!

Bulletin Board (Shogunate Announcement): Rest assured that Kujou Takayuki's militant brutality, forced seizure of Visions, and suppression of the citizenry is now being reversed post-haste!
Bulletin Board (Arataki "The Unbeaten Troublemaker" Itto): "Hah! No wonder I couldn't find you anywhere, Kujou Tengu! Guess you're moving up in the world, huh!"
Bulletin Board (Arataki "The Unbeaten Troublemaker" Itto): "Well alright then! Guess I'll just march right up to Tenshukaku's gates and challenge you to—"
Bulletin Board (Scrawls): (The words here cannot be made out, almost as if the person who wrote them suddenly had a fall. Or perhaps...)
Bulletin Board (Tenryou Notice): The rude lout who has been harassing Madam Kujou Sara has been arrested. Please be at ease, citizens.

## Talk 25

Bulletin Board (Message): "I am currently seeking my foolish younger brother, Shikanoin Heizou. He names himself a detective and behaves arrogantly and disrespectfully."
Bulletin Board (Message): "He has gone missing again in recent days — if anyone has seen or heard of him, please let me know about his whereabouts."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "He's gone again, is he?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "He's gone off to investigate again, yes... I can only hope that no one else gets hurt in the process."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "...Oh, so you were just worried about other people, huh..."

## Talk 26

Bulletin Board (Message): "Thanks to your aid and support, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos has weathered the worst of this storm."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Word is that the Kanjou Commission is currently negotiating with Liyue's mercantile guilds and that the import of silks and ready-to-wear clothes will soon resume..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Once my brother returns from his duties, we shall refurbish this store together."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Once again, I, Ogura Mio, would like to thank all our neighbors and friends for lending a helping hand. I will find a way to repay you all in turn."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "No, no, it was what we should've done. You're too polite, Miss Ogura!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): "Well, the war's over in any case, so don't mind if I engage your services again the next time I need a custom-made kimono!"

## Talk 28

Bulletin Board (Message): "General Gorou was here again."
Bulletin Board (Reply): Ah, to think that I was not present to receive such fine guests from faraway Watatsumi. You have my most sincere apologies for my failings.
Bulletin Board (Message): "Uh, wow, that's kinda formal... How am I supposed to reply?"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Eh, you can just take that to be the Narukami way. All roundabout and longwinded-like, not like us Watatsumi folk!"

## Talk 29

Bulletin Board (Message): "Thank you, Lady Miko, for your painstaking efforts, but I fear that some of our hurts may never be healed."
Bulletin Board (Reply): It is "companionship" that gives "eternity" meaning. The past may have been cruel, but the future shall be longer still.

Bulletin Board (Message): "Ever since I read one of his books, I've always wondered what sort of person he might be."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Don't think about it too much. Maybe he's just like most authors from Inazuma. You know the type: some sickly, thin, glasses-wearing middle-aged man."
Bulletin Board (Someone Else's Message): "He could also be some rotund scholar who speaks weirdly and stuff, you know..."
Bulletin Board (A Third Person's Message): "You know what I think? I think he's got to be some mountain of martial muscle! A powerful body and a sharp mind, all rolled into one!"
Bulletin Board (Yet Another Person's Message): "You're all wrong! I mean, just look at that lovely handwriting! It's gotta be a beautiful young woman, one who knows her way around books and scholarly tomes of all kinds!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Please control yourselves! This is a public notice board, not someplace to endlessly jabber about personal matters!

## Talk 32

Bulletin Board (Message): "The Kamisato siblings of the Yashiro Commission have been in higher spirits lately."
Bulletin Board (Message): "It seems that the recent changes have seen the Kamisato Clan's prestige grow significantly. I suppose that's the unpredictability of life for you, huh?"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Ah, are you feeling a little sour about our Commissioner's rise, my friend?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): "No, no, I wouldn't dare... I'm just saying that it's going to be tough times for the other two major Commissions."

## Talk 33

Bulletin Board (Message): "We fought to the death against the folks from Sangonomiya, and now we need to rebuild an island together with them..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I mean, I know that it's an arrangement that comes down from the top and that everyone acknowledges that this is the right thing to do, but it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, you know?"
