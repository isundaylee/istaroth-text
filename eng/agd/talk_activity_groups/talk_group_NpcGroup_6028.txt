Balam: Hello, friend!
Balam: Sorry to put you on the spot like this, but from where you're standing, is there anything about my voice that sounds a bit off?

## Talk

Traveler: Not at all, it's positively booming.
Balam: Phew... Thank goodness for that.
Balam: Seems like there was nothing wrong with that drink I just had after all. Though my throat still feels a bit sticky...
Balam: A host's voice is their greatest weapon, so we can't get careless with it.

## Talk

Traveler: I can't hear anything wrong with it.
Balam: I see. Well, I guess there's no problem after all.

Traveler: Any tips for maintaining a healthy throat?
Balam: Exercise more! The trick is to stay healthy.
Balam: You heard that right. The only way to keep your spirits up so you can speak confidently is by staying healthy.
Balam: Projecting your voice so that everyone hears it when you're up in a hot air balloon isn't easy, especially when you're competing against the roar of the crowd and the contestants' impassioned cries.
Balam: I get through so much water over the course of a competition that I could even drink the People of the Springs dry!
Balam: Oh, and speaking of which, if you want to keep your throat in top shape, you should drink more water and less unhealthy beverages!

## Talk

Traveler: But drinks make people happy...
Balam: Do they, then? Well, guess there's no choice in the matter. I suppose we'll have to just compromise on one item here, then?
Balam: As I see it, drinking water isn't exactly something too sad, but some prefer sweeter things.
Balam: Alright, then, let's have ourselves a little pick-me-up.
