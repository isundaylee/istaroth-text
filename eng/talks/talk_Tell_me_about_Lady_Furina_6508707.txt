Traveler: Tell me about Lady Furina...
Sedene: Are you asking where Lady Furina lives?
Sedene: She used to have an apartment on the top floor. I remember someone did once try to get in there by jumping off the roof.
Sedene: Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger â€” he is presently hard at work at the Fortress of Meropide.
Sedene: Anyway, that kind of thing won't happen again. Lady Furina left her official post to pursue a life closer to her own desires.
Sedene: She seemed a lot more relaxed last time I saw her, so I don't think you need to worry about her.
