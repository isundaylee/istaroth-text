Cyrus: Oh, Traveler. As you can see, the Windblume Festival's come around again.
Cyrus: Every festival, there are plenty of youngsters that like to go out and adventure in the wilds.
Cyrus: Ah, what can I say. I'm old. I know what these kids are thinking better than they do.
Cyrus: To me, the Windblume Festival represents the continuation of the rebelliousness passed down by the resisting heroes from the era of the Stormlord of the Tower.
Cyrus: But... I suppose I can't expect the younger generation to think like me, right? Haha!
Cyrus: Well, if the youngsters can feel the charm of adventuring through the spirit of the festival, I suppose it's worth it.
