Traveler: Do you only sell liquor?
Karpillia: Um, too young to drink, are you? Well, we do sell other stuff too, like Mondstadt's famous Dandelion Wine...'s brewing ingredients!
Karpillia: That's a Mondstadt specialty. It's not supposed to be in the inventory list. But since you're also an outlander like me, I will make an exception and sell you those.
