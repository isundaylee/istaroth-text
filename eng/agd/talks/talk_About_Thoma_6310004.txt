Traveler: About Thoma...
Hirano: When Mr. Thoma first came to the Kamisato Clan, people suspected him on account of his being an outlander.
Hirano: But from my observations, Mr. Thoma is steady and friendly â€” and he is a truly reliable fellow.
Hirano: I mean, why else would he be the trusted assistant of the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato, right? Haha!
