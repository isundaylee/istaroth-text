*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Dandy: Hmm... I need to think this through...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Dandy: Oh it's nothing. I was just thinking that Wangshu Inn is such a tall building; I wonder how long it would take to climb down all those stairs.
Dandy: I was going to go and try myself, but then these piles of leaves scuppered my plans. I just want to clear them all away...
Dandy: But that would mean walk down the stairs clearing them one step at a time. It's tiring to even contemplate.
Traveler: I'll try.
Dandy: Haha, great. Thanks a lot!

### Additional Talk 2

Dandy: Have you finished sweeping away all the leaves yet?
Traveler: Yep. All gone.
Dandy: Thank you so much! Here's your reward.
Dandy: Next... I am trying to find the optimal means of ascending this flight of stairs.
