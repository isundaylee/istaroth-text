# The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler

"This is a rather orthodox light novel, with its contents essentially being an edited version of real life in Teyvat. What is surprising, however, is that the author seems to be highly knowledgeable about Watatsumi Island, with many vivid, almost lifelike descriptions." â€” Ms. Hina
