Traveler: How have things been lately?
Chanca: Thanks for asking. Things have been going great.
Chanca: Many old comrades have stopped by for meals since the battles ended. Though each of them still nurses injuries of their own, they all seem quite happy.
Chanca: ...Of course, it's possible that it's all just a front, and that they're hiding any unhappiness from me.
Chanca: We all know how the joy of peace and the pain of loss can coexist. I just hope they can come here often. They can eat and drink on the house!
