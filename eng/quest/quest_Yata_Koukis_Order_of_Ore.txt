# Yata Kouki's Order of Ore


## Talk 1

Traveler: You wanted some White Iron Chunks?
Yata Kouki: You can't sharpen your blade if it goes blunt in battle. So, best to have Mr. Amenoma make me a shiny new one well in advance.
Yata Kouki: Have you taken on my commission? If so, I guess you've got those 5 White Iron Chunks.
Traveler: Got 'em.
Traveler: Not yet.
Yata Kouki: Alright, well just bring them here once you've got them.

## Talk 2

Yata Kouki: Thanks a million. Please take this as a small token of my gratitude.
