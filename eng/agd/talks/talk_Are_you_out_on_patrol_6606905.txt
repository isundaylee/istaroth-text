Traveler: Are you out on patrol?
Tairona: That's correct. Reconstruction work within the tribe has pretty much all been handed out, so the chief assigned me to patrol the area nearby instead.
Tairona: According to the Pyro Archon, we gave the Abyss a thorough thrashing this time, so there shouldn't be any more major disturbances in the short term. But they are cunning enemies, so we must stay vigilant.
Tairona: So hobbies and whatnot will just have to be set aside for now. As the bearer of an Ancient Name, I'm sure Miss Mualani must have plenty to keep her busy too!
