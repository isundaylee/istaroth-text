# Stop, Albert. Stop!


## Talk 1

Victoria: Where are you hiding, you pesky little...
Traveler: What are you looking for?
Victoria: Me? Oh— I'm looking for a very dodgy person.
Victoria: His name is Albert and he always lurks around the Cathedral during the day.
Victoria: He looks like he's up to no good. I'm worried he's plotting something bad...
Victoria: Can you chase him off for me?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Okay.
Victoria: May the Anemo Archon protect you.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Shall I contact the Knights of Favonius?
Victoria: I thought about doing that...
Victoria: But I have no concrete evidence on him. There's nothing they would be able to do.
Victoria: For the greater glory of the Anemo Archon... Please, just get rid of this guy.

## Talk 4

Albert: Go, Barbara, go!
Albert: Hi, what's the matter?

## Talk 5

Albert: Keeping the Cathedral free of dead leaves is a service to Mondstadt and to Barbara!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Albert: Have you finished sweeping yet?
Traveler: Yep. All gone.
Albert: Thank you. The Cathedral looks much better now! I'm sure Barbara will feel better for it...
Albert: But, please don't tell Barbara about this.
Albert: The point here is to reduce her burden; telling her about it would only add to it.
Albert: As we agreed, I'll be on my way now. See? Nothing to worry about.
Albert: See you again soon... Maybe? Who knows.

### Additional Talk 2

Victoria: I have an update about Albert.
Victoria: Has he left?
Traveler: Yes, he's gone.
Victoria: Well, that's that sorted... But, what on earth were you doing sweeping leaves just now?
Victoria: Never mind, I suppose no more leaves means one less excuse Albert can use to get near the Cathedral in future.
Victoria: These gifts are my way of saying thank-you. Take them, and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
Victoria: If there's nothing else, I should get back to work. You should get back to yours, too.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Sister requests that you leave this place immediately.
Albert: Leave? What did I do wrong?

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Oh, I've already told the Knights of Favonius all about you and your antics!
Albert: What!? What am I supposed to have done? Tell me!

### Additional Talk 5

Albert: Me? Me, sneaking around, acting suspiciously, and plotting evil deeds? You guys have got this all wrong!
Albert: *sigh* ...Do you know Barbara? She's Mondstadt's angel.
Albert: Many people in Mondstadt admire her, including me.
Albert: In fact, I am head of the Barbara fan club.
Traveler: The Knights of Favonius will be here shortly.
Albert: L—Let me finish! I really look up to Barbara. I want to be like her — I want to do something for Mondstadt.
Albert: But I'm just an ordinary person with ordinary abilities. The best I can do is to do some sweeping around the Cathedral.
Albert: But Miss Victoria never listens to me, she just says she wants me gone.
Albert: Recently I noticed that no one has swept away the leaves around the Cathedral for a while. But if I tried to explain to Miss Victoria, she wouldn't understand...
Albert: Can you help me sweep away the leaves? For Mondstadt... And for Barbara?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: Alright then...
Albert: Thanks so much! Off you go then.

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Fine, if it gets you out of here...
Albert: Hey! I thought I just explained how I'm not a bad guy!
Albert: Well, okay. Sweep away the leaves for me, and I'll be gone.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: The Knights of Favonius will be the only ones doing any sweeping up around here...
Albert: I'm trying to do a good deed here! You don't need to report every little thing to the Knights of Favonius!
Albert: Alright, alright, you win. I'll be out of here as soon as the leaves are gone.
