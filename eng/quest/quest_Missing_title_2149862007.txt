## Talk 1

Pahsiv: #Paimon! Traveler!
Paimon: Wow, it's you, Pahsiv! Nice to see you again! What are you doing around here?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv... working! Pahsiv... tired! Pahsiv... lie down!
Paimon: Huh? You're... working?
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... Foggy Forest Branch... very throw!
Paimon: Huh? What's a Foggy Forest Branch?
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... Information!
Pahsiv: Willow, collect. Fog, handle. Spring, send.
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... Mist information!
Traveler: So you mean it's information about the Foggy Forest Path?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... very throw! Very many places!
Pahsiv: Pahsiv... searching! Pahsiv... tired! Pahsiv... eat! Pahsiv... lie down!
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... Very not many! But boxes, very many!
Pahsiv: #Ah... Thank you Paimon, thank you Traveler, here!
Traveler: You found us a treasure chest again?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! Box, treasure, flower, shiny, sweet, very many!
Paimon: Whoa, so there's other stuff, too? Y'know, Pahsiv, you're real nice, but it'd be bad if we kept taking your stuff for free. Why don't we exchange things instead?
Pahsiv: Ex... change?
Paimon: That's right! We're friends, and friends should exchange gifts in earnest with one another!
Paimon: So, we're gonna help you find your Foggy Forest Branches, and exchange those for your stuff. Whaddya say?
Traveler: And we can get you some stuff to eat, too.
Paimon: Right, we can do that! You're having a hard time by yourself, after all.
Pahsiv: Eat! Tidalga! Pahsiv!
Traveler: You like Tidalga?
Pahsiv: Tidalga! Tidalga! Tidalga Tidalga Tidalga!
Paimon: Uh, does that mean you eat five meals, or five Tidalga a day? Uh... Wow, you might have Paimon beat for appetite!
Paimon: Well, what about the Branches, then? Can we find 'em by following the Foggy Forest Path?
Pahsiv: Melusine...
Pahsiv: Foggy Forest Branch... very throw! Very many places! Very Erinnyes!
Traveler: The Branches are all over Erinnyes, then?
Pahsiv: #Smart Traveler! Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Foggy Path has flowers. Branches, also flowers!
Pahsiv: Branch, branch, branch, branch, branch, branch... Number!
Paimon: Huh. Ooh, Paimon gets it now. The Branches can be found in places with the same flowers as the Foggy Forest Path, and there are six locations, right?
Pahsiv: Smart Paimon! Pahsiv!
Paimon: Hehe, guess we're all clear now, eh? Make sure you rest up, Pahsiv. Just leave this to us!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Traveler, good thing! So, slowly, slowly! Pahsiv!

## Talk 5

Pahsiv: Boxes... Treasures... Melusine...
Paimon: Um, Pahsiv, did we run you all outta stuff?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv... go out! Pahsiv... find!
Traveler: It's fine if you don't have anything with you.
Paimon: That's right. We can just give you Tidalga anyway!
Pahsiv: Melusine!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, friend... earnest! Traveler, friend... earnest! So... swap!
Paimon: Um, well, alright then. How long will you be out, Pahsiv? Are we gonna see you around?
Pahsiv: See... around?
Paimon: Well, that's how we express the desire to meet again!
Traveler: "See you around" is how we say goodbye.
Paimon: That's right. We did say previously that we'll teach you how to say goodbye, didn't we? Well, why don't you try saying it?
Pahsiv: Good... bye?
Paimon: Uh, do you not know what that means?
Paimon: Hmm... Well, you can consider it a sort of exchange or swap, too. Kinda like swapping one tomorrow for another...
Paimon: You take a bit of your tomorrow and give it to us, and we'll give a bit of ours to you — and that's how we'll meet again! What do you think? Get it now?
Pahsiv: Swap tomorrow... for tomorrow! Pahsiv!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like you get it! In that case, let's say "see you around" for now — that way, we'll definitely meet again!
Paimon: See you around! Pahsiv!
Traveler: See ya!
Pahsiv: #See you, Traveler! See you, Paimon!
