# Unlimited Opportunity


## Talk 1

Ivanovich: Hmm... Not bad. I could make quite a pile off this. But there's just one problem...
Traveler: What problem might that be?
Ivanovich: Eh? Oh, Traveler, it's you. You've come at just the right moment! Might I interest you in a... Let's call it a...
Ivanovich: ...a wonderful, mysterious, never-before-seen, surefire-profit of a business proposition?
Ivanovich: I just need a little help from you, and we will both reap great rewards from it.
Traveler: The Northland Bank is a maximum-security facility, you know.
Ivanovich: Well, of course it is. Why, even the guards are from Snezhnaya. So... Wait, what? What were you thinking about?
Ivanovich: It seems as though your travels have broadened your horizons — your thoughts are truly imaginative.
Ivanovich: But my business proposition is one that is both realistic and down-to-earth.
Ivanovich: I suppose you know of those meteorites that fell from the sky?
Ivanovich: I want to find one of those meteorites, hack a few pieces off it, and bring them back.
Ivanovich: Afterwards, we will hire an able craftsman to carve them into jewelry and ornaments...
Ivanovich: Think about it. Ornaments made from a meteorite. Rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings... Sure to fetch a fine price with the rich and wealthy.
Ivanovich: Your part in this is simple, Traveler. You just need to make sure that my work remains undisturbed by monsters.
Ivanovich: How about it? Do we have a deal?
Traveler: You shouldn't go near those meteorites.
Ivanovich: What? Why not? I'm not letting this business opportunity pass me by.
Traveler: Did you find something new in Liyue's legal codices?
Ivanovich: Um, honestly, Liyue's laws are very well written indeed. One can hardly find a single loophole in them.
Ivanovich: *cough* B—But that's not the point! I always make sure to follow the law!

## Talk 2

Traveler: There will be a lot of monsters, you know.
Ivanovich: I do, and that's what I'll need you for, Traveler.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'm sure others have had this idea...
Ivanovich: Why, of course — and that's precisely why we should make haste.
Ivanovich: If you're willing to help, Traveler, let's set out at once.
Ivanovich: Every second we spend shooting the breeze is Mora we could stand to lose!
Paimon: Wow, we're not getting through to him at all, are we?
Paimon: Maybe we can convince him that his scheme won't make money, or that the meteorites are really dangerous...

## Talk 4

Traveler: You'll faint if you touch those meteorites.
Ivanovich: Hmm? Ah, yes, I'd heard that rumor. This could certainly pose a problem...
Ivanovich: But I believe that there are machines that can resolve this issue... There should be, right?
Paimon: Ooh, he's starting to come around. Is he... weighing the profits and losses of this scheme?
Paimon: Let's keep it up. We've got to convince him that this venture won't make money and that the meteorites are super dangerous.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Are you sure you can find matching ornaments?
Ivanovich: Oh, don't worry about that. I will find them one way or another.
Ivanovich: Silver, gold, precious stones... I should be able to get any of those easily.

## Talk 6

Traveler: You're doing pretty well for yourself. There's no need to take risks.
Ivanovich: Risks? Comrade, do you know what we say in Snezhnaya?
Ivanovich: Pursue perfection, comrade, pursue perfection! We must never rest on our laurels.
Ivanovich: Use ever more refined techniques, earn ever more Mora — that is how one should behave as a merchant.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Perhaps you could go to the Adventurers' Guild...
Ivanovich: Ha! They rejected my commission, saying that "you shouldn't touch those meteorites."
Ivanovich: Adventurers' Guild, my foot! There's hardly any spirit of adventure there.
Traveler: Isn't that because they also find those meteorites dangerous?
Ivanovich: Hmm... When you put it that way, it does make sense. But surely they can't be that dangerous...

## Talk 8

Traveler: Those meteorites are very heavy.
Ivanovich: Ah, that's a small issue. I have already chartered us a vehicle. Surely those meteorites cannot cause even hot air balloons to stop moving.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Will the Millelith even let you go?
Ivanovich: Oh, come now, dear comrade. We're not doing anything illegal.
Ivanovich: Understand this: this shower of meteorites is a disaster indeed, but I plan to turn it into opportunity!

## Talk 10

Traveler: But the people who buy those ornaments will...
Ivanovich: Agh, you're right... Even if I'm able to skirt the issue with machinery, those ornaments will need to be worn, won't they?
Ivanovich: If my customers are rendered unconscious, that... might reflect poorly upon me.
Ivanovich: Well, we could fashion it into a decoration that could be displayed far from anyone. But wouldn't that reduce the price significantly?
Ivanovich: Hmm, this is tricky...

## Talk 11

Ivanovich: Alright, alright. I understand. You mean to dissuade me from touching those meteorites, don't you?
Ivanovich: I don't think you'll accept this commission either, will you? Well, if you don't want to, it's fine.
Ivanovich: It'll be difficult to hire more guards on short notice, yes.
Ivanovich: But I won't give up! Even if I can't get my hands on a meteorite, I won't give this opportunity up so easily!
Ivanovich: Well, Traveler, I may not be going to get a meteorite, but I'll need you to help me with something else.
Ivanovich: If those meteorites really are so fascina— I mean, dangerous, that they can cause those who touch them to faint...
Ivanovich: Then the things around those fallen meteorites must also have been affected.
Ivanovich: Traveler, can you look for something in the area where they fell that you can bring back here? Plants, flowers... anything will do.
Traveler: Got it...
Ivanovich: Thank you. I simply cannot let such an opportunity slip by.
Traveler: Is this what merchants are like?
Ivanovich: Haha. I'll take that as a compliment. I'm counting on you, then.

## Talk 12

Ivanovich: I wonder if there's any way to turn these meteorites that render people unconscious into normal rock...
Ivanovich: Hmm, no, that's not right. If they turn back into normal rocks, there'd be no profit to be made...

## Talk 13

Ivanovich: Have you found anything?
Traveler: I did.
Ivanovich: Wonderful! Let me see.
Ivanovich: Ah, a fresh Sweet Flower. Not bad at all. It is indeed abnormal. This must be the influence of the meteorites...
Traveler: That might be problematic.
Ivanovich: Hmm? What do you mean?
Ivanovich: You were attacked while gathering flowers by... flowers? There are flowers that attack people?
Ivanovich: Aha, that must be the meteorites' influence! That would explain why those flowers are so special.
Traveler: I'm not sure there's a relation there...
Paimon: That's right! What do meteorites have to do with flowers, anyway?
Ivanovich: No, no, no, believe me. This flower is most certainly special in some way.
Traveler: There's nothing special about this flower, though...
Ivanovich: No, comrades, no. It was found beside one of those meteorites, so of course there's something special about it.
Paimon: But this Sweet Flower doesn't look, smell, or feel any different from ordinary ones.
Ivanovich: Well, as for that... that's not something you need to worry about.
Ivanovich: Here's your compensation, as we agreed. It was a pleasure doing business with you.
Ivanovich: Now, how to use this Sweet Flower... In a perfume, or as a bookmark? Perhaps it might even be good dried...

## Talk 14

Ivanovich: Alright then, you both make very good points. The meteorites do seem too dangerous. I shan't endanger myself unnecessarily on their account.
Ivanovich: Ah, but it still seems like such a shame to let such a huge opportunity go by like this...
