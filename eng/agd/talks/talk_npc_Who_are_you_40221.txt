Traveler: Who are you?
Stanley: Stanley! It's Stanley! Some adventurer you must be if you don't even know my name!
Stanley: I am a living legend among adventurers! The man who waded through the Mare Jivari and Geyser Realm!
Stanley: I have enough stories to tell for three days straight...
Traveler: The Mare Jivari?
Stanley: Sharp! That's the best out of all my legendary stories.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...And the monster created a vortex in the Mare Jivari, so I held tightly onto my friend's hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Are you guys falling asleep!?
Stanley: Wake up! You!
