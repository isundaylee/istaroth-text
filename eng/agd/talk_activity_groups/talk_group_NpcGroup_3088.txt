## Talk

Hiromi: Hello, outlander. Please don't stay out on the street for too long.

## Talk

Traveler: Why?
Hiromi: Because of the Sakoku Decree, of course. Ritou is not doing well lately, and thieves are running rampant.
Hiromi: You might get into trouble if you stay on the street for too long.

## Talk

Traveler: And you might be...?
Hiromi: My name is Hiromi. As you can see, I work at the commission.
Hiromi: Please abide by the laws in Ritou, or you're going to make my job difficult, too.

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder!
Hiromi: Don't mention it, outlander.

## Talk

Hiromi: Hello, Traveler. Do you need help with anything?

Traveler: Greetings!
Hiromi: I really appreciate what you did before.
Hiromi: Feel free to come find me if you need help with anything in Ritou. I will try my best to help!

## Talk

Traveler: About your big sister...
Hiromi: She... is not here yet. But since she and I have agreed to meet at Uyuu Restaurant, I'm sure that she will show up.
Hiromi: Anyway, I really appreciate your help. I will cherish the opportunity this time.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hiromi: Goodbye! All the best to you!

## Talk

Hiromi: Good day. When strolling through Ritou's streets, please keep your personal belongings safe at all times.

## Talk

Traveler: Why's that?
Hiromi: The Sakoku Decree has been abolished, and the number of people coming to Ritou has increased greatly... and with that, incidents of thievery have also gone up.
Hiromi: As such, I'm making sure to advise those I meet to watch out for their belongings.

Traveler: Who are you?
Hiromi: My name is Hiromi. As you can see, I work at the commission.
Hiromi: Please abide by the laws in Ritou, or you're going to make my job difficult, too.

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder!
Hiromi: You're welcome.
