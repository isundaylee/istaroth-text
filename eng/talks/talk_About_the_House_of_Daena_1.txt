Traveler: About the House of Daena...
Katayoun: The House of Daena is the Akademiya's library. Researchers and students can borrow many books on general knowledge here.
Katayoun: Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews.
Katayoun: In the past, most knowledge could simply be obtained through the Akasha, so many people only read books to personally ascertain the source of any knowledge they gained.
Katayoun: For a long time, the House of Daena was really more of a museum than a library.
Katayoun: But ever since the Akasha was shut down, the number of applications requesting access to it has increased greatly. I believe that the Scribe is presently hard at work dealing with that matter.
Katayoun: I reckon that more people will find their love of books rekindled soon.
