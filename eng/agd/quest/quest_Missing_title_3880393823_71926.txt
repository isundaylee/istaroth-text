# Missing title (3880393823)

Traveler: Best of luck to you.
Little Zuo: Thank you! Frogs are super hard to catch, though...
Little Zuo: So far all I've managed to grab is a few lizards, and even then only the tails...
Little Zuo: Maybe you could take them? I've gotta keep trying to catch a frog, and I definitely can't do it with my hands full of lizard tails.
