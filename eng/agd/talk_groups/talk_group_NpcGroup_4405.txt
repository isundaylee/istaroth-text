Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: The night is much cooler than the day, which makes it all the more reason to take better care of your health. Besides, you should stay where there's more greenery...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: Look at you! You're so young, but already sound like my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very beautiful. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry for not taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!

Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: But isn't the difference in temperatures between night and day precisely the reason you need to take care of yourself? You've only just recovered... You should spend a bit more time resting...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: And well, look at you! You're still a young man, but you already sound as old as my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very lovely. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry, I haven't been taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!
