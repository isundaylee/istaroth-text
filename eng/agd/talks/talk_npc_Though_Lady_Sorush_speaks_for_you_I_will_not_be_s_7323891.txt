Pyrrho: Though Lady Sorush speaks for you, I will not be so lenient should you make any suspicious movements!
Traveler: Look who sounds all reliable.
Pyrrho: Hmph. Of course. I am one of the oldest qualified members of our Order, after all.
Pyrrho: I am not quite the equal of our Vijnanapati, but as one of the desertfolk who have lived here for generations, the Order and I are as one by blood.
Pyrrho: So if you encounter any issues, you can ask...
Pyrrho: No, wait! No. I won't be answering any of your questions!
Traveler: So, about your Vijnanapati...
Pyrrho: He's a very knowledgeable scholar! He knows more than anyone I've ever met.
Pyrrho: We Skeptics were once a Darshan within the Akademiya, but our traditions of knowledge have been eroded after hundreds of years here in the desert, far from the city.
Pyrrho: It's all thanks to our Vijnanapati that we are recovering our ancient traditions. With him around, our Order shall soon reclaim our lost glory!
Traveler: Don't worry, you shan't hear questions from me.
Pyrrho: Hmph. As it should be.
