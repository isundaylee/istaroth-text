Traveler: Little beetle...
Feroz: Yeah, a little beetle. Even smaller than the tiniest golden scarab.
Feroz: Look at you, as thin as a stick. If you dare travel to the desert, you'll surely get crushed by the huge trunks and rocks left by King Deshret.
Feroz: Take my advice, hire a capable bodyguard, or stay where people are, away from the desert!
