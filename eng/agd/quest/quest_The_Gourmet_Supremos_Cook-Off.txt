# The Gourmet Supremos: Cook-Off


## Talk 1

Xudong: Get ready now, this dish is going to be amazing!
Kamei Munehisa: My dish shall be similarly fantastic, so prepare yourself.
Traveler: What are you two doing?
Xudong: Hello, Traveler. Parvaneh and Julie are out gathering ingredients, and we were supposed to prepare a meal for them...
Xudong: But Uncle Munehisa and I had a minor disagreement about what to prepare.
Xudong: So we decided to each come up with a dish for a competition. The winner will get to set the theme for today's meals.
Xudong: I'm making one of Liyue's specialties, Jewelry Soup.
Kamei Munehisa: And I shall make my best dish, Tri-Flavored Skewer.
Traveler: Any way I can help?
Xudong: Well, if you have time, we do need a judge...
Xudong: But since both of us need to prepare four servings of each dish despite only having two hands, we are a little overwhelmed.
Xudong: You can help us prepare the food before the judging begins.
Xudong: And of course, you can pick what dish to help with, since you are only one person.
Traveler: Xudong, will you be able to handle it alone?
Xudong: Don't worry about me. I used to run a restaurant in Liyue, so it's not hard for me to prepare a meal.
Xudong: That said, with a little help, I could make the food even better.
Xudong: Anyway, just pick a dish that interests you.
Traveler: Xudong, I'll help you.
Xudong: Oh! That's great, Uncle Munehisa, be prepared to be defeated by my dish!
Kamei Munehisa: I am not a man who gives up easily. Go ahead and do your best.
Traveler: Uncle Munehisa, I'll help you out.
Kamei Munehisa: Thank you, Xudong, be prepared.
Xudong: No problem. Go ahead and do your best.
Traveler: Uncle Munehisa, will you be able to handle it alone?
Kamei Munehisa: Don't worry. Just pick whoever you prefer. When I was in the Shogunate, I used to prepare meals for a lot of people all by myself. This is just four servings.
Kamei Munehisa: But if you want to help me, I'm sure I can make the dish even better.
Traveler: I suppose you're short one judge, then.
Xudong: Hahaha, that's right. We need a judge to try them.

## Talk 2

Xudong: Done. Thank you, Traveler. It smells so good.
Xudong: I'll try it first... Wow, that's great. The ingredients are cooked just right and it smells perfect.
Xudong: You could even call this a "Perfect Jewelry Soup."
Xudong: Okay, Uncle Munehisa, how's your cooking going? Ready to show it to the Traveler?
Kamei Munehisa: Well... I made a mistake. I realized that I didn't have enough Bird Eggs right after I started.
Kamei Munehisa: Although I did immediately go to get some Bird Eggs from the woods, the other ingredients were past their best by then.
Kamei Munehisa: Tri-Flavored Skewers made with ingredients that aren't fresh can no longer be considered a good meal.
Kamei Munehisa: I am ashamed to have been so negligent. I need to refine my skills more.
Kamei Munehisa: You win this time. But next time, Xudong, I will definitely beat you.
Traveler: That's the spirit, Uncle.
Xudong: Haha, I promise that I won't be an easy opponent.
Xudong: By the way Traveler, these are for you. Thank you for helping us all this time.
Xudong: Make sure to come next time we compete, too.
Traveler: Actually, I think it tastes alright...
Kamei Munehisa: I am not satisfied with just "alright." Even in cooking, one has to have the heart to pursue perfection.
Kamei Munehisa: This is the only way to become a master of the art of cooking.
Xudong: Ah, I see. Exactly... That's exactly it!
Traveler: That's right!
Kamei Munehisa: The art of the sword and the art of cooking are the same in this regard, and to me, they are both part of the art of existence.
Xudong: Great! Uh, way to go, Uncle Munehisa... I believe in you. Yeah...
Xudong: Uh... I have no idea how to deal with someone who is so... serious. I guess only Julie can, but she's not here right now...
Traveler: Honestly, I'm pretty shocked too.
Xudong: *cough* Well, thank you for your hard work, Traveler. Please take these. I—
Kamei Munehisa: Xudong, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about cooking. Do you have a moment?
Xudong: Huh? Oh, right, yes! I'll be there! I'll be right there...

## Talk 3

Kamei Munehisa: Hmm. The smell and how it looks... these Three Flavored Skewers should be called Extreme Skewers instead!
Traveler: Extreme... Skewers?
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe, I simply mean that it's a perfect dish... Well, would you look at the time. Xudong's Jewelry Soup should be ready now.
Xudong: Of course! Here is my Jewelry Soup.
Xudong: It might be a bit overcooked because I didn't handle the timing perfectly, but the taste should be fine.
Kamei Munehisa: Let me taste it.
Kamei Munehisa: Well, it does have a slightly burnt taste. It's not bad enough to ruin the whole pot, but it is still a flaw in the end.
Xudong: Hahaha, I was in a hurry this time. Next time, I'll prepare all the ingredients in advance, so this won't happen.
Xudong: You win this time, but rest assured that I won't make the same mistake next time.
Traveler: Seems like you got careless.
Xudong: Hahaha... Yeah, I was careless. I'll have to be more mindful next time...
Xudong: By the way Traveler, these are for you. Thank you for helping us all this time.
Xudong: Make sure to come next time we compete, too.
Traveler: Uncle Munehisa's Extreme Skewers have won the day.
Xudong: Extreme Skewers? What does that mean?
Kamei Munehisa: It means that these Tri-Flavored Skewer are of perfect quality.
Kamei Munehisa: To have an "extreme" pursuit means that your heart can never satisfied with mere "acceptability." Instead, the highest perfection is the goal.
Kamei Munehisa: Even in cooking, one must have the heart to pursue perfection. This is the only way to become a master of the art of cooking.
Xudong: Ah, I see. Exactly... That's exactly it!
Traveler: That's right!
Kamei Munehisa: The art of the sword and the art of cooking are the same in this regard, and to me, they are both part of the art of existence.
Kamei Munehisa: Come, Xudong. Allow me to tell you about the "extreme" path.
Xudong: Huh? O—Okay. Just give me a second, I'll be right there. Traveler, here is your payment...
Xudong: Uh... I have no idea how to deal with someone who is so... serious. I guess only Julie can, but she's not here right now...
Traveler: Just go get the Extreme Cookery experience.
Kamei Munehisa: Xudong?
Xudong: Huh? I'm coming. Just a second! I'll be right there...

## Talk 4

Xudong: How did it go? Did you get some Snapdragon?

## Talk 5

Kamei Munehisa: How did it go? Did you get Bird Eggs?

## Talk 6

Xudong: Then let's get started. Jewelry Soup requires Snapdragon, Tofu, and Lotus Heads...
Xudong: Lotus Heads and Tofu... Luckily, there's still some left. But there's not enough Snapdragon...
Xudong: Traveler, I'll be handling the ingredients. Just in case, can you please get me three more servings of Fresh Snapdragon?

## Talk 7

Kamei Munehisa: Thank you for your willingness to help. Tri-Flavored Skewer is simple to prepare, but it requires extra attention to the freshness of the ingredients.
Kamei Munehisa: I've gotten enough of every ingredient except Bird Eggs... Could you please fetch two fresh eggs for me, just in case?
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Kamei Munehisa: Thank you.
Traveler: How did you learn to make this?
Kamei Munehisa: When I was still serving in the Shogunate, I used to make this sort of small dish to go with wine.
Kamei Munehisa: But now...
Kamei Munehisa: Anyway, let's not talk about the past. I'm counting on you for the Bird Eggs.
Kamei Munehisa: I will be dealing with the ingredients here. Please bring the Bird Eggs to me as soon as you have them.
