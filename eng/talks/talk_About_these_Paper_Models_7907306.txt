Traveler: About these "Paper Models"...
Xudi: Oh! These paper model designs are based on my friends, who graciously agreed to my requests.
Xudi: See here? This squirrel is modeled after Clanche, who's always nagging me to try flying... And I have! I just, you know, spend more time on the ground than in the air.
Xudi: This toy soldier model is based on Devitt, who loves traveling and making toy models... but loves his hats even more.
Xudi: Last I met him, he was still in Constellation Metropole, tinkering with those hats of his.
Xudi: Ah, and look at this serious, solemn clockwork guard. That's based on Alof.
Xudi: Not the talking type, him, but ever loyal and dutiful. If I remember right, he's been busy training â€” not that he ever isn't.
Xudi: Ah, my apologies, I'm talking too much, aren't I? Well, activate the Fabricator, if you would.
Xudi: Dewdrops willing, a fine gift you shall receive, and with it the gift of a fine mood.
