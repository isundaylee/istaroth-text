Yoimiya: This lantern is so pretty...
Traveler: Yoimiya, this gift envelope is for you.
Yoimiya: Wow, so this is a gift envelope... So pretty! Thank you, it's going straight into my collection!
Yoimiya: Seeing you here, getting this gift... Guess it was worth the trip after all!
Traveler: Huh. Was this not a good enough time for you?
Yoimiya: No no, it's not that! The food is delicious, and there are so many fun things to do. It's just...
Yoimiya: *sigh* I heard, during previous Lantern Rites, there were huge firework shows or tons of Xiao Lanterns.
Yoimiya: But, not this time. I thought that huge tree-like lantern might shoot out fireworks at any moment...
Yoimiya: Still, Lady Tianquan's ritual was super impressive, and the lights were beautiful.
Yoimiya: Hehe, at the next festival in Inazuma, I'm gonna put on a giant light show, too!
Yoimiya: I'll let you know ahead of time and save you the best seat in the house, so don't miss out!
Traveler: See you.
Yoimiya: Yep, see ya!
