Tia: There was a little girl just now who wanted to go up to the roof to see the fireworks, but that green-haired guy next to her wouldn't allow it...
Tia: I heard that they had something else they needed to do... Well, I'm free right now, but Daddy still won't let me up on the roof! What's with that?
