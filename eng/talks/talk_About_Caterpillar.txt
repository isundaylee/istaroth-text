Traveler: About Caterpillar...
Estienne: Did you know he has two faces?
Estienne: Haha. What I mean is, his personality completely changes depending on whether he's talking to Lanoire or to someone else.
Estienne: You've probably noticed how kind he is to Lanoire. He even tells her the kinds of stories that little girls love.
Estienne: Personally, I like those stories of his that aren't that suitable for kids. Stories with magic in them, where you never know how real or fake they are.
Estienne: Now that I think about it, maybe Caterpillar doesn't see much difference between Lanoire and I. We're both kids, just with different interests.
