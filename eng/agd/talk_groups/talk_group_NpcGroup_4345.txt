Izad: I could help clean them up if I had my tools with me... I can tell you the location if you want to check it out.
Izad: Ores are pretty useful. You need them too, right?

### Talk 2 related talk 1

Traveler: And you are...
Izad: I'm a Forest Ranger of Avidya Forest. I'm in charge of liaison between the Forest Rangers and Pardis Dhyai.
Izad: We send regular reports on the ecological situation in Avidya Forest to Pardis Dhyai, and Pardis Dhyai provides us with all kinds of assistance.
Izad: For example, we recently received quite a bit of seeds and nutrients that Pardis Dhyai supplied for free.
Izad: The Forest Rangers are in charge of selecting suitable planting areas or distributing the seeds to the nearby villagers, so that we can all add a little more green to the rainforest.
