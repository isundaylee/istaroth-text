# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Matsumoto: I'm Matsumoto, the traveling food critic. Recently, I've found myself in a dilemma of having no dishes to try out.
Matsumoto: I have already finished going through every single restaurant on this street. Whether it's Uyuu Restaurant or Kiminami Restaurant, there is nothing new around here.
Matsumoto: With my years of experience as a food critic, I'd rate these joints as "mediocre."
Matsumoto: I have tasted every single bizarre gourmet dish there is, but I find that there is more authenticity in simple and plain things.
Matsumoto: If you asked me what the tastiest thing in this world is... I would say it must be the lemon drink with unlimited refill from Kiminami Restaurant.
