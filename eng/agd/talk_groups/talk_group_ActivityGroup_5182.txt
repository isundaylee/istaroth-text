Jami: *sigh* I'll wait a bit before showing this experiment report to my mentor.
Traveler: Why's that?
Jami: Well, my mentor's... still kinda laid up at Bimarstan.
Jami: The doctors say that he'll only recover next month at the earliest. Recently, many of my senior students have said that his temper's improved... Well, getting angry is counterproductive to recovering from internal injuries, after all.
Jami: Only when he sees me does he get so angry that his beard stands on end and he will try to get out of bed, clutching his cane.
Jami: The doctors say that we shouldn't meet for the time being. I mean, "absence makes the heart grow fonder," yes?

Jami: I wonder if my life would have been easier had I not chosen this topic back then?
Jami: Maybe I'd have gone with something my seniors had studied before, and done a synthesis of some kind...
Jami: I'd have edited the data to get the result I wanted... Not like anyone would want to replicate such dull research anyway...
Jami: That's what they call "shooting first and drawing the target later," yes? Either way, I just wanted you to know that research is mostly a process of muddling along.
Traveler: That doesn't seem to apply to you.
Jami: *sigh* I fear I was just an idiot who didn't realize what was going on. Our mentor was quite strict with us, too, so I just ended up on this path.
Jami: But since I'm here, I might as well go all the way. Ah, I do hope the experiment goes well â€” it's either that, or I'm done for once my mentor gets out of bed next month!
