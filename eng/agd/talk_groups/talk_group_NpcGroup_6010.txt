Traveler: So, you are...
Chanca: I'm the owner of the Weary Inn, and I also run a food stall at the entrance.
Chanca: Speaking of this place, I even stayed here for free back when I was a contestant. Who'd have thought I'd be the one in charge now, huh?
Chanca: Do you know anyone who's taken part in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame?
Chanca: If you did, that would make things a lot easier. You could stay with them, and you'd dine and bunk on the house — all you can eat, too!

Traveler: How have things been lately?
Chanca: Thanks for asking. Things have been going fine.
Chanca: Many old comrades have stopped by for meals since the battles ended. Though each of them still nurses injuries of their own, they all seem quite happy.
Chanca: ...Of course, it's possible that it's all just a front, and that they're hiding their discontent from me.
Chanca: Thanks to my old injuries, however, I can't really help them out anymore. The best I can do is treat them to a few more meals.

Traveler: Any recommendations?
Chanca: Well, I'd go with my personal specialty, Tatacos.
Chanca: That said, though, it's not hard to make. Almost everyone in Natlan knows how.

Chanca: Hehe, were you expecting me to just give you finished product? Nah, I'm going to teach you how to make one!
