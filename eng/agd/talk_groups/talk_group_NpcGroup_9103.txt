Xilonen: So, this is some sort of secret base... You did a great job with the place.
Xilonen: Wish I had a teapot like this. Then, nobody would be able to find me when I'm trying to slack off.

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Xilonen: It's great. I'm really liking my first time inside a teapot. It feels so different... nothing like being in one of the tribes.
Traveler: Which tribe is your favorite?
Xilonen: My favorite? Hah, my father would be so disappointed if he heard this, but...
Xilonen: ...My favorite tribe is actually the People of the Springs, Mualani's tribe.
Xilonen: There's the hot springs, the warm air, the delicious drinks... Not to mention the awesome record store and jewelry store.
Xilonen: It's a great relaxation spot no matter how you look at it.
Xilonen: Kinich's tribe is pretty great, too. They pitch their tents high above the ground, so there's always a refreshing breeze when you lie inside.
Xilonen: You can also go bungee jumping or grass skiing if that's your thing...
Traveler: Why not move to another tribe for a bit, then?
Xilonen: Well, haha... I've actually tried that before.
Xilonen: Mualani invited me to a party at her place not too long ago, and I stayed with her for a few days.
Xilonen: It was great at first, soaking in the hot springs every day, enjoying the drinks, going out to have fun with Mualani...
Xilonen: It's just... How should I put this? The longer I stayed, the more... unsettled I felt.
Xilonen: It's not that I was tired of the place or anything... I just felt compelled to go back to the Children of Echoes and check on things.
Xilonen: In the end, all I could think about was the unfinished business at my workshop, so I said a quick goodbye to Mualani and returned to my tribe.
Xilonen: The minute I stepped foot inside my workshop... No, the minute I saw the red cliffs of my tribe, I felt completely at ease. I really can't tell you why.
Traveler: So the Children of Echoes is your favorite tribe after all.
Xilonen: Eh, I wouldn't say my attachment is that strong...
Xilonen: Now that I think about it, I should take another vacation to the People of the Springs... I'll check in with Mualani in a few days.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Xilonen: Sure! I slept really great here, by the way — the temperature is perfect, and the beds and pillows are super comfortable.
Xilonen: It's the kind of sleep I'll be dreaming about for the whole week.
Traveler: You could always sleep a little longer!
Xilonen: Eh, I've had enough. I'm not the type to sleep in, anyway. Eight to nine hours a night, and I'm set.
Xilonen: Still, when work gets busy, it's hard to get that many hours in one go.
Xilonen: Especially when I'm working on an Ancient Name. Once I start, I usually can only sleep for three to four hours a day, if I get any sleep at all.
Traveler: Must be hard to forge an Ancient Name.
Xilonen: The technique itself isn't that complicated. Verifying the truth of the stories behind the Name is the real challenge.
Xilonen: They often stretch over long periods of time and involve many key individuals.
Xilonen: Generally speaking, to receive an Ancient Name, you have to do something in your lifetime that exemplifies the "spirit" of the Name.
Xilonen: The difficulty lies in verifying those deeds when the people at the center of the stories are long dead.
Xilonen: It usually comes down to checking records, but even then, it's difficult to say whether those accounts are accurate.
Xilonen: If I accidentally include a fictional story or falsehood in an Ancient Name...
Xilonen: It would become seriously defective, and potentially lead to cognitive issues for the current bearer.
Traveler: But there are always so many stories... How do you verify the authenticity of each one?
Xilonen: I use the woven scrolls from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Xilonen: Those records are usually pretty reliable. Citlali's knowledge comes in handy as well.
Xilonen: If I can't find anything in the scrolls, I reach out to my contacts from the six tribes and see if anything relevant pops up.
Xilonen: Once I have enough data, I find the stories that are connected and cross-reference them.
Xilonen: I jot down any inconsistencies and search related stories to determine if I'm dealing with a real error or a simple omission.
Traveler: Seems like a huge project...
Xilonen: Now you understand why sleep goes out the window when I start a new project.
Xilonen: It's work, work, work, all day every day, until it's finally finished.
Xilonen: Mualani once volunteered to help. She got one or two stories in, and then... light's out. I couldn't wake her up no matter how hard I tried.
Xilonen: Now you know why I always take advantage of an opportunity to nap.
Xilonen: Just talking about work is making me... *yawn* really sleepy.
Traveler: I'm willing to help!
Xilonen: You're more than welcome. I'm sure a seasoned traveler like you has a lot to offer when it comes to judging the authenticity of a story.
Xilonen: I'll let you know when I start my next project.
Xilonen: Oh, and make sure to bring a pillow when you come to the workshop. When you get the chance to nap, it pays to be ready.
Xilonen: Kachina tried to use a book, and her neck hurt so much the next day she could barely stand straight.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Xilonen: What I really want is to do absolutely nothing.
Xilonen: I don't usually get a chance to relax in a place where nobody can find me, so I might as well take advantage of the opportunity.
Xilonen: We can space out together. I'll teach you some tips on how to get in the zone.
Traveler: There are tips for that!?
Xilonen: Of course. The point of spacing out is to completely clear your mind. Then, you can separate mind from body and achieve a state of pure serenity.
Traveler: Sounds like some kind of ceremonial meditation from the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Xilonen: Well, I did learn a few things about meditation from Citlali.
Xilonen: There's a whole "communicate will all living things" part, but I don't have the talent or the patience for that. I was more invested in achieving inner peace.
Xilonen: Anyway, it's really not that complicated. Just do as I do.
Xilonen: First, focus your eyes on a random point in front of you... somewhere that feels comfortable.
Xilonen: Next, relax the forehead... then the shoulders. Keep your eyes fixated on that point. Focus on its location in space...
Xilonen: Now, exhale... And... Relax...
Xilonen: ... *snore*... *snore*...
Traveler: "Doing nothing" is more profound than I thought...
Xilonen: Of course. Just ask Ororon or Citlali — a lot of people in their tribe study the art of meditation.
Xilonen: Spacing out really isn't that different. Just like meditation, you need to clear your mind and calm your heart.
Xilonen: In the Masters of the Night-Wind, meditation is usually accompanied by some sort of action. Lucky for us, spacing out means doing absolutely nothing.

Xilonen: Hey, this looks just like the kind of venue we have in our tribe. You've even got a Dance-Off Stage... Yep, this place is performance ready.
Xilonen: Speaking of the Dance-Off Stage... *sigh* I wonder if I'll ever achieve my dream of being a full-time DJ...
Xilonen: If there ever comes a day when I don't have to make ancient names anymore, maybe then I'll finally be free...

Xilonen: 'kay, furnace, check... anvil, check... and you've even got a shop sign and display rack. Yeah, this is a fully equipped blacksmith's you got here. You just need to light it up and get smithing.
Xilonen: *yawn*... I'm suddenly feeling a little tired. Just looking at this stuff reminds me of being back at work...
Xilonen: ...Nope, it's not gonna pass, I'm getting sleepier by the second. I'm gonna need to take a nap...
