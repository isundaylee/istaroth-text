Traveler: About Miss Chisato...
Kujou Kamaji: Thank you so much for your help. This should have been a private matter, but I guess we ended up needing your help on multiple occasions.
Kujou Kamaji: Seeing her be so strong fills me with joy. I wish I could give her more support, but I don't want to sway her independent judgment.
Kujou Kamaji: As such, I've decided to give her some space and wait for her from a distance. Given her talents, I'm sure she'll do even better than me.
