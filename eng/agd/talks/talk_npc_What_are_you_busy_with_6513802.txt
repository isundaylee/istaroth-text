Traveler: What are you busy with?
Etienne: ...Oh, sorry. I'm just... really tired right now. Didn't notice you there.
Etienne: Very few people talk to me at work, in any case, since cargo inspection doesn't really involve the crew.
Etienne: And as you can see, that's what I'm doing.
Etienne: Though in practice, the one inspecting things is my dog, Baguette. I'm just here to take care of her in turn.
