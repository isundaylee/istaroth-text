# Braised Meat

A stewed dish. The meat slices were fried first, followed by the vegetable accouterments, after which they were mixed together. The soup was then added and simmered until it thickened. After this patient, slow cooking process, the meat has become soft and tender, bringing those who eat it a down-to-earth satisfaction.
