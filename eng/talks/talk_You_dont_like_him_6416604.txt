# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You don't like him?
Bhai: Honestly, I don't hate him at all. When he was young, he was passionate and talkative. He knew a great deal about poetry and singing, which was quite enviable.
Bhai: But now, his attitude is really driving me nuts. He could've done so much better than this!
Bhai: While you're alive, you should cherish what you have and live in the present instead of trapping yourself in the past.
Bhai: Old memories should be the nutrient of new life, not shackles keeping you in the endless loop of pain.
Bhai: The Greater Lord is a perfect example of this. She might have passed away, but what she left behind will nourish Sumeru for generations.
Bhai: This old thing has lived in Sumeru for so long yet still doesn't understand this. He hasn't learned a thing from her!
