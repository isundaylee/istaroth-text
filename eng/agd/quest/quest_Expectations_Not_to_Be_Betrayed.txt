# Expectations Not to Be Betrayed


## Talk 1

Paimon: Question! Doesn't it hurt your voice, talking all the time?
Yoimiya: It can get uncomfortable, I guess... But what else would I be using my voice for?
Paimon: Huh... you kinda have a point.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ahem, why did you cut Paimon off earlier?
Yoimiya: Because what he needs isn't an answer, just time.

## Talk 3

Yoimiya: Ah, here we are!

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: Okay, story time. So, whenever Kouichi brings one of his friends from the trade association to see me, they always mention how they used to play with me when I was a kid, or held me once as a baby, or something.
Yoimiya: But there are so many of them in that friendship group, and I don't remember anything from that age anyway. So I never have a clue who they are.
Yoimiya: One time, he shows up with another one of his friends, and the friend asks me if I remember him.
Yoimiya: So I'm like, "Yes, I do! You held me once when I was just a baby!"
Yoimiya: Kouichi just bursts out laughing and says actually, this is one of his carpenter friends. Turns out he's a lot younger than he looks — just a few years older than me.
Yoimiya: I went bright red and must have apologized, like, a million times. Arghhhh, it was so embarrassing.

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: The boat is a-ready and waiting. I'll mark the location for you on the map. Before you leave, I recommend that you pack some food and water. You can never be too prepared.
Sakujirou: Ah...
Sakujirou: *sigh* After how much effort it took to get back in, it's hard to convince myself to leave again... especially when I'll be going up against the stormy ocean on a tiny little boat... My prospects don't look great.
Yoimiya: Well, they won't look much better if you get caught by the Tenryou Commission...
Yoimiya: I'm afraid that sooner or later, they are going to find you here. Time is starting to run out.
Sakujirou: I'm sorry, I'll make sure to get out of here before they come. I promise I won't cause you and your family any more trouble.
Yoimiya: I didn't mean it like that. If we ever ran into any problems, I'm sure I'd figure something out.
Yoimiya: But if the Tenryou Commission does catch up to you, then make a run for the boat.
Sakujirou: Okay. I won't let them catch me...
Sakujirou: But... *sigh* Ah, I guess this whole trip was a waste in the end.
Paimon: Why did you wanna come back to Inazuma anyway? Is there something you wanted to do?
Sakujirou: I didn't use to like this place at all, that's why I left. But looking back on things now, I was really just running away from my responsibilities.
Sakujirou: Once I started to realize that, I got restless. I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the things I'd left behind...
Sakujirou: So, I... Ah, forget it, what does it matter now. It's too late, anyway. I originally wanted to make up for all my regrets, but instead, I found myself in the situation I'm in now.
Yoimiya: *sigh* What a pity...
Paimon: Talk to us about it, maybe we could—
Yoimiya: If only there was no Sakoku Decree, huh.
Yoimiya: Anyway, don't worry, we're not going to bother you about it. We'll keep trying to buy you as much time as possible until you reach your final decision.
Yoimiya: The Tenryou Commission... If only they weren't so overzealous, there might be a way...
Yoimiya: Oh, that's right! That elderly couple, old customers of ours — their son's in the Tenryou Commission, isn't he? Yeah, quite high up, as well.
Yoimiya: That's it! I'll go talk to them. Maybe they can do something!
Sakujirou: Um... Are you sure they won't just report me instead?
Yoimiya: Oh, don't worry about that. They're really nice people, I know them well. They won't cause us any issues.
Yoimiya: Alright, you should get back indoors, Sakujirou. We'll be back in no time at all.
Yoimiya: Okay, let's go. Time waits for no one.
Yoimiya: Wait, hang on... What about the fireworks? All those materials... there's so many orders to finish...
Yoimiya: ...Pops! Pops!
Yoimiya: Oh, never mind. I know, I'll write him a note telling him to sort out the fireworks!

## Talk 6

Paimon: That's way too small!
Traveler: It is technically sturdy though...
Kouichi: Can't be helped, I'm afraid, this is the biggest and sturdiest boat that I can provide. It's built from the finest Inazuman timber.
Kouichi: Still, I'll be the first to admit that if he's planning to ride this into the storm, it's going to be exceedingly dangerous...
Yoimiya: I'm also hoping Sakujirou won't have to use it. It's just there as a last resort.
Yoimiya: I gotta say, though, Kouichi, it feels like your craft has improved once again.
Kouichi: Haha, I'm not the one you should be praising. It's all thanks to the guys who kindly pitched in.
Kouichi: To avoid detection, we each worked on our own materials separately, then assembled them secretly in the night.
Kouichi: This is the largest we could afford to build it. Any bigger and there's no way it would pass the Tenryou Commission's inspection.
Yoimiya: Let's store the boat here for now, then. I'll fill Sakujirou in when I get back, he'll need to make some preparations before setting sail.
Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon feels really worried all of a sudden... Uh... Doesn't helping Sakujirou make you a collaborator in the eyes of the Tenryou Commission?
Yoimiya: Haha, maybe it does, but I knew what I was getting into from the moment I agreed to help him.
Yoimiya: My family has pretty good connections with the Yashiro Commission. We work very closely with them. And whenever there's a national event of any sort, the other two Commissions come to us, too.
Yoimiya: As long as I'm polite and respectful and don't cause a fuss, they won't look to cause trouble for me, either.
Yoimiya: And anyway, to your point about collaboration... you've been helping out too, right?
Paimon: That's true, this was all a collaborative effort... wait, huh? *gasp* Oh no!
Traveler: We were chased by the Millelith in Liyue, too.
Yoimiya: Ah, so you're seasoned crooks already, eh? Don't know what I was worried about then! Hehe.
Yoimiya: Anyway, thanks for everything, Kouichi.
Yoimiya: Oh, and your fireworks are ready, so just go and pick them up from my house whenever you want. While you're there, you can get my pops to settle the boat construction fees.
Kouichi: Oh, don't worry about paying anything. Third Sis would be sure to scold me if she found out I'd taken Mora from the Naganoharas.
Paimon: Who's Third Sis?
Yoimiya: Oh! Uh, let me explain this one, it's a story my pops told me. There used to be a thriving merchants' guild in Inazuma, it got really prosperous.
Yoimiya: At one point, there were a dozen or so kids born around the same time to the families of the guild. They all grew up together, each of them learning their respective family's business.
Yoimiya: They were a tightly knit group of friends, but eventually, they all grew up and decided they each wanted to go into business themselves.
Yoimiya: It was inevitable that their business would send them all to different corners of the world, and that they'd have far less opportunity to see each other in the future.
Kouichi: That's right. Just before we went our separate ways, the eldest of the group suggested that we should all go watch some fireworks together one last time.
Yoimiya: Hehe, they were all very ambitious types, and each had their own knack for doing business. One by one, they left, until Kouichi was the only one of them remaining in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: After that, he hardly saw them. But whenever one of them did come back to visit, fireworks would always be involved.
Kouichi: Yeah, no matter how close you and your friends are, there's always going to be some distance after being separated for a long time. But as soon as the fireworks lit up the sky, it'd instantly take us right back to our childhood, and we'd be chatting away like in the old days.
Kouichi: To us, those memories are eternal.
Paimon: Ohh, so this is what you meant when you were talking about commemorating things.
Yoimiya: Yep, that's exactly right. That's why I can't let people down when they're counting on me for their fireworks.
Yoimiya: Anyway, I need to go update Sakujirou. See you, Kouichi! Thanks again for your help!
Kouichi: Yeah, I should get out of here, too. I don't want to get caught red-handed.
Traveler: Do we have to be the bad guys in Inazuma as well?
Traveler: Makes me think of Atsuko.
