Archon, it's the Fatui!
The Archon of Natlan
A force to be reckoned with
The secret of the Ley Lines... is no secret to me
Long have they been destined for ruin
And since the oath made five centuries ago remains unfulfilled
What use is the Gnosis in your hands?
I don't know what you mean
But it sounds like this is about more than the Tsaritsa
In times of crisis, someone must pick up the mantle of salvation
Your plan has reached an impasse
And now it falls to me to create new "rules" for Natlan
But before the dawn of a new age
The old must be destroyed
I assume that's the end of your speech
Good. People like us
Let our blades do the talking
Masters of the Night-Wind...?
Send word
The Captain and his followers must be apprehended
