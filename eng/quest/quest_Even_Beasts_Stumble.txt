# Even Beasts Stumble


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the goods...

## Talk 2

Elber: Whew. Thanks, Traveler...
Traveler: It's good to see they're alright.
Elber: I'm Elber, a businessman. I was just relaxing here...
Elber: I never expected to get attacked by those hilichurls...
Traveler: Didn't you have any guard with you?
Paimon: We have heard in town that normally merchants would hire the Eremites to escort their goods.
Elber: Well, that costs you Mora...
Elber: The prices they asked for were just astronomical.
Elber: I'm running a small business. Can't afford that kind of price...
Elber: I thought, well, I know a thing or two about fighting monsters anyway, and it's not a long haul, so I might as well go on my own.
Elber: But I didn't expect the hilichurls to spook my two Sumpter Beasts.
Elber: I was run down by one before I could even react, and when I came to my feet, I got kicked by the other one.
Paimon: Uh-oh...
Elber: They soon ran away, and I was besieged by the hilichurls... Lucky for me, you were here to help.
Elber: But all my stuff is on those two Sumpter Beasts... Traveler, could you please help bring them back for me?
Traveler: I don't want to get kicked...
Elber: Don't worry. They are gentle in nature, it's just those hilichurls knocked over their food.
Elber: They had traveled so far with the loads and were very hungry. That's why they got so restive after their food was knocked over...
Paimon: So they were disrupted when eating and their food was messed up...
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon is getting angry just thinking about that!
Traveler: You are quick to catch on to that, Paimon.
Elber: Well, I'll just leave the food to you.
Elber: Please feed the Sumpter Beasts when you find them.
Elber: They won't throw tantrums as long as there's food.
Elber: I noticed one of them knocked over the hilichurls and ran away...
Elber: The other one seems to have been taken away by the hilichurls.
Elber: I'll mark their locations roughly and leave the rest to you, Traveler.
Elber: You'll be fairly paid for the return of my goods!
Traveler: They could knock me over...
Traveler: No one was protecting you?
Traveler: It was nothing.

## Talk 3

Elber: *sigh* You simply can't disturb Sumpter Beasts while they're eating.

## Talk 4

Paimon: This one... looks a bit irritated...
Paimon: Whoa... Look at its hooves. So sturdy.
Paimon: People could get stunned by a mere kick.
Traveler: Paimon, you can feed it.
Paimon: No! You go! Hurry!
Traveler: Please enjoy your food...
Traveler: No offense to your hooves...
Black Screen Text: The Sumpter Beast slowly swallows the food. It seems less restive now...
Paimon: It seems less angry now.
Paimon: Let's bring it back. Careful, don't get kicked...
Black Screen Text: You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...
Elber: Whew... I thought I'd lost it.
Elber: Thank you, Traveler. I can't express my gratitude enough.
Elber: I must check its condition now. Hope it wasn't hurt...
Elber: Traveler, please help me find the other Sumpter Beast.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa! This Sumpter Beast is huge. It must hurt so bad getting kicked by it.
Paimon: Feed it with the food Mr. Elber gave us.
Traveler: Nice and slow...
Traveler: Are these enough for it...?
Black Screen Text: The Sumpter Beast gulps down the food. It seems to be in a better mood now...
Paimon: It seems to be in a good mood.
Paimon: Let's bring it back.
Black Screen Text: You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...
Elber: Whew... I thought I'd lost it.
Elber: Thank you, Traveler. I can't express my gratitude enough.
Elber: I must check its condition now. Hope it wasn't hurt...
Elber: Traveler, please help me find the other Sumpter Beast.

## Talk 6

Elber: Now both Sumpter Beasts are back... Thank you so much, Traveler.
Traveler: About the goods...

## Talk 7

Elber: Great! I can't thank you enough, Traveler!
Elber: I could have gone broke if I'd lost the goods and these two Sumpter Beasts.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Elber: Oh, yes, your payment... Please wait a second.
Elber: Please take these. I can tell from your looks that you have been venturing around.
Elber: I happen to be in the business of those gears. You could use all these.
Elber: Whew... The Sumpter Beasts have been recovered and the goods are mostly intact. I should be off.
Elber: Thanks again, Traveler.
Traveler: About our payment...

## Talk 8

Elber: Besides this one, there was another Sumpter Beast that had wandered off.
Elber: Luckily, this one's looking good.
Elber: Traveler, please help me find the other one.

Elber: I'll return to the city as soon as I get the goods in order.
Elber: *sigh* I'll make sure to hire some escorts next time...
