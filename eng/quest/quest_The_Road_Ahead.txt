# The Road Ahead


## Talk 1

Manqu: Forgive my presumption, but I am confident that you will emerge victorious from the final trial — safe and sound, and having obtained the token.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Manqu, we're back!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Manqu: Phew, that sure was one long wait. Not gonna lie, the longer I waited, the more anxious I became.
Manqu: It was my idea in the first place, true, but if you went into the ruins only to never return, I'd be beside myself with guilt...
Manqu: Though, if you'll excuse my bluntness, I must ask — surely you've found the token that the Sage of the Stolen Flame left within the ruins?
Traveler: That was pretty tough...
Manqu: Hah, I knew you'd do it!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Look, they turned out to be these disk thingamajigs! We've already gotten our hands on both of the tokens!
Manqu: No, surely not... two Golden Entreaties!? G—Golden Entreaties actually exist? Incredible! I must include this in my research.
Paimon: So these things are called Golden Entreaties, huh...
Manqu: Th—That's right. Apologies, I'm just so excited. It is said that they were once handled by the legendary Sage of the Stolen Flame, and even the first Pyro Archon...
Manqu: For a moment there, I was thinking about what it might be like to keep them for myself as family heirlooms or something of the sort...
Paimon: #No way! We need them to save {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Manqu: I know, I know... Well, I suppose now you must set forth for the Great Volcano of Tollan.
Manqu: Legend has it that long ago, before Xbalanque became the Pyro Archon, it was there that he fought against the Flamelord who wielded the powers of blinding light and searing heat...
Manqu: When the dust had finally settled, the triumphant hero Xbalanque returned alive to become the first Pyro Archon.
Manqu: But as for what lies within the volcano, no one knows for sure. Some believe that an ancient dragon still resides there, deep in hibernation — yet others say it is but a husk, all inside having been incinerated by Xbalanque's flames.
Manqu: If you ask me though, these are nothing but storytellers' speculations...
Manqu: I'd love to go with you, but I'm afraid that would be asking a bit too much of this poor old body of mine...
Paimon: Don't sweat it. You've already told us plenty!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Manqu: Well, I must thank the two of you once again. I can't tell you how much seeing those Golden Entreaties means to me. Speaking of which, I'd better hurry back and get all this recorded...
Manqu: #Thank you once more, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. I wish you a safe journey...
Manqu: #And {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, I wish you success removing the mark of the Flamelord's Blessing.
Traveler: Farewell!
Manqu: Yes... At the journey's end, the place where all souls come to rest, we will meet again — I am sure of it!
Traveler: Tough as a piece of cake.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Oh yeah, remember to show Manqu the token you got. He should still be waiting for us over at the entrance to the ruins...
