Traveler: About Festival Utsava...
Arasaka: The more friends to share the "taste of happiness" with, the better it becomes. So when Festival Utsava comes, I will make sure every Aranara gets to have a "taste of happiness."
Arasaka: By then... I think Arapacati will have a good time like everyone else.

Traveler: About the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Besides the "taste of happiness," there is also the "taste of sadness."
Arasaka: It's a terrible salty taste, which makes you very sad even with just a small bite.
Arasaka: But Nara seem to like the "taste of sadness." I don't understand this.
Arasaka: Could it be that sharing the "taste of sadness" feels happy, too?
