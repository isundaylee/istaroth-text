# Talk Dialog

Rosaria: #Traveler, hello again...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Rosaria: Sure. Did you have something you wanted to ask me about?
Traveler: About Varka...
Rosaria: Oh. Yes, I read his letter. Barbara showed it to me.
Rosaria: She'd been so worried about her father, Seamus. She almost burst into tears when she read that "the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
Rosaria: Hmm? ...My thoughts?
Rosaria: Hehe... You're curious what he means to me as a father figure, is that right? Well, I guess I'm not like other daughters. I can't bring myself to worry about him.
Rosaria: He wouldn't be leading that many people if he didn't have the necessary strength and courage for it. He's not the kind of person you need to worry about.
Traveler: About Razor...
Rosaria: So, he's finally come to terms with everything?
Traveler: At the very least, he's no longer lost and confused.
Traveler: He has a direction now.
Rosaria: Hmm, sounds like he still has some way to go before he can say he's fully independent. But everyone goes through their own life in their own way.
Rosaria: Well done. It sounds like your efforts were all worth it in the end.
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Rosaria: I thought that if I made it to the Weinlesefest, I'd have the chance to spend a whole day in the tavern. Turns out, there's actually more work during a festival than usual.
Rosaria: I managed to escape to here, but I still can't completely let my guard down. Who knows when Victoria or Dahlia might show up and drag me off to the sung poetry event.
Rosaria: *sigh* The sooner this festival is over, the better.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Rosaria: Alright. But don't tell anyone else that I'm here. I don't want to have to move anytime soon.
