# Phantom of the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ha... This tent doesn't look like it belongs to Diluc. Maybe it's an adventurer camp?
Paimon: Oh, there's a piece of paper and a notebook over there. Let's read them.
Investigate (Someone's Notes): "Dear Darknight Hero, we are seeing a repeat of the phenomenon we encountered many years ago."
Investigate (Someone's Notes): "Although you fully resolved the issue last time, the ley lines seem to have been stimulated in some way and are releasing the monsters they recorded once more."
Investigate (Someone's Notes): "I'm sure you'll want to deal with those that pose the biggest threat immediately."
Investigate (Someone's Notes): "So I'm notifying essential individuals, per the operating procedures."
Paimon: Hmm... judging by the tone, it seems like this was written by someone Diluc knows well. Let's call him "Diluc's friend" for now.
Paimon: He saw something bad happen, wrote a note for Master Diluc, and then left.
Paimon: Huh... Isn't that pretty irresponsible? What if someone else had seen it? Also, he left his notebook behind...
Paimon: Mmm... Now that Paimon thinks about it... you know that strange ley line deposit on the beach?
Traveler: I bet that's the "phenomenon" he was talking about.
Paimon: Other than that, everything seems fine here... not a monster in sight.
Paimon: #Traveler, do you wanna read Diluc's friend's notebook, too?
Paimon: If not, let's head over and take a closer look at the ley line deposit.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa! Where did all these monsters come from!?
Paimon: Uh.. Wait a second... Is that Diluc?
Paimon: Huh... He looks kinda different than usual...
Paimon: Look at him go! So focused and full of energy! So this is Captain Pyro when he's in top form, huh!
Traveler: It must be Diluc from when he fought here in the past.
Paimon: Hey, you're right! Now that Paimon looks more closely, this Diluc does look younger than usual.
Paimon: But what happened back then? Why was he fighting here?
Paimon: Hmm. Guess we can just ask him about it when we see him.
Paimon: #What should we do now, Traveler?
Traveler: We shouldn't act rashly.
Paimon: Okay, let's see how young Diluc used to fight.
Traveler: Let's observe for now.
Traveler: The ley lines are showing the scene they recorded at that time.

## Talk 3

Paimon: The fight is over. Diluc wiped the floor with them... Guess some things haven't changed.
Paimon: So is there any actual danger here? It looks like it's only these illusions from the past.
Traveler: Diluc must have already been here.
Paimon: So, Diluc's already called it a day?
Paimon: Will more monsters come out if we go up to that weird ley line deposit again? And what about young Diluc?
Paimon: If it's like the other ley line deposits we've seen, then it should've disappeared now that all the monsters are defeated.
Traveler: So young Diluc's piqued your interest?
Paimon: No, no, hehe, Paimon's just a little worried is all.
Paimon: What if someone passing by gets curious, comes to check it out, then suddenly "Yaah!" A monster jumps out and clubs him over the head with a "swish" and a "smash"? That would be terrible.
Traveler: ...Why the sound effects?
Paimon: ...Because it sounds more dangerous that way!
Paimon: Anyway, we came here to help Diluc, didn't we? So let's stick around a little longer and make sure this place is completely safe before we head back.
Traveler: You've got a strong sense of responsibility.
Paimon: Hehe... Not really. Paimon just wants some fancy grape juice.
Paimon: #Come on, Traveler, let's finish what we came for. When we get the grape juice, you can have some of Paimon's half!
Traveler: Or have you suddenly developed an interest in ley line anomalies?
Traveler: At most, there might be a few remnants left.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Is that a camp over there? Diluc is camping out in the wild!?
Paimon: Huh... This is weird... Hmm... Maybe these enemies are really tough, and it's turned into a long, drawn-out battle?
Paimon: Let's go check it out!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Adelinde: Please send Master Diluc my regards when you find him.
Adelinde: Also, do be careful out there.
Adelinde: As Master always says, "Even when the odds of success are nine to one, you must never lower your guard."
