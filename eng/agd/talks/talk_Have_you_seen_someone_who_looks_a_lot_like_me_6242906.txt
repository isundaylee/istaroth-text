Traveler: Have you seen someone who looks a lot like me?
Qiaoxi: Does the person you want to find dress as... uniquely as you?

Qiaoxi: I remember everyone who crosses this bridge, never mind someone with such an unusual appearance.
Qiaoxi: I'll keep a look out on your behalf. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
