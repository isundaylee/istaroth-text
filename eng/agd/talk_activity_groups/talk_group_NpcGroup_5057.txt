Traveler: Could I have your name?
Louis: Friend, they call me the face of street food.
Louis: If I were to be given some high-flown title like some great figure, they would call me "Fish-and-Chips Louis." Simple and elegant, no?

Louis: And do I need to mention fish and chips for a walk through town? Their crispness and fragrance are praised by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain and seagulls alike!
Louis: Why, I cannot imagine what would become of Fontaine if fish and chips did not exist!
