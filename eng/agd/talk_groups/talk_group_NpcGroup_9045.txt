Traveler: How do you like it here?
Rosaria: There's no like or dislike. I'm not particular with my residences.
Rosaria: But it is certainly more comfortable here than at the cathedral...
Rosaria: At least no one's going to wake me up for morning prayer and prevent me from catching up on my sleep.
Traveler: You're still sleeping late?
Rosaria: Haha... thanks for your concern. I just have a few things to take care of.
Rosaria: I've lived this way for such a long time, it'd be strange to change.
Rosaria: Perhaps I'm more comfortable here than I thought I was...
Rosaria: Hmm... I'm getting soft. That won't do.
Traveler: Thanks for your hard work.
Rosaria: ...There's nothing to thank me for.
Rosaria: ...Never mind, I know you mean well.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Rosaria: Sure. But let me make this clear: If you're looking to confess, you should go find someone else.
Traveler: Sounds like there's a story behind that.
Rosaria: Ha... so, I was on duty this one time, receiving confessions from believers.
Rosaria: And, it was hard enough to make sense of their jumbled confessions, but then I had to use useless words like "May the Anemo Archon bless you" to make them feel better.
Rosaria: Ugh. Archons have mercy on me.
Rosaria: However, a lot of people believe that misfortune and suffering will never touch them because they're blessed by Barbatos.
Rosaria: I mean, sure, if this way of thinking makes them happier, then they can keep believing.
Rosaria: Wait... Was it Bartobas? O—Or was it Barsibato? I feel like I said it wrong again.
Traveler: It's just Barbatos, actually...
Rosaria: Yeah, let's go with that. Barbatos it is.
Rosaria: Um... Also, thanks.
Rosaria: Being able to talk to you so casually without having to worry about being nagged is quite the luxury.
Traveler: I'm not interested in confessionals.
Rosaria: Great. Then we're on the same page.
Rosaria: Instead of wasting your time sobbing and confessing your sins at church, you're better off repenting with concrete actions.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Rosaria: Hmm... let's go to the tavern.
Rosaria: We'll drink to our hearts' delight, and who cares if we get drunk?
Traveler: You actually get drunk?
Rosaria: ...I've never allowed myself to get drunk.
Rosaria: I used to think it was idiotic to leave yourself vulnerable in front of others.
Rosaria: But my perspective on that has changed.
Rosaria: Huh... Maybe it's because I trust you... but that's beside the point.
Rosaria: Angel's Share or The Cat's Tail, which one you wanna go to?
Traveler: Angel's Share.
Rosaria: If it's from Dawn Winery, you can be absolutely assured of its quality.
Rosaria: I'd recommend their Dandelion Wine.
Rosaria: You'll throw back a couple of drinks with me, won't you?
Traveler: ...
Rosaria: ...
Rosaria: Never mind, I'll drink for you.
Rosaria: Just return the favor when you're of age.
Traveler: The Cat's Tail.
Rosaria: Oh? Interested in their special cocktails, are you?
Rosaria: Their bartender doesn't work every day, but we can try our luck.
Traveler: I can't imagine you being drunk.

Rosaria: I didn't expect you to be into this kind of thing.
Rosaria: Growing grapes — are you taking a page from Dawn Winery and making your own wine?
Rosaria: Not a bad idea. If you succeed, remember to call me over. I'd like to try some.
