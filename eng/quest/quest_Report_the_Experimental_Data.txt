# Report the Experimental Data

Jami: Phew. I've obtained valuable experimental data once more, and it's all thanks to you.
Jami: I have to finish my report before my mentor recovers. With any luck, he won't try to test it himself again. I'll stop him from sparring with monsters willy-nilly, even if it costs me my life.
Jami: Worse comes to worst, I'll take to the fight myself. Even if I fail, they'll at least put "Jami — he sacrificed himself for his research" on my tomb, eh? Hahaha...
Jami: I had a drink with a junior two days back. He said he wished to study the applications of the Long-Lasting Fayz Potion in different environments.
Jami: That way, ordinary people traveling outside will not be helpless when faced with beasts like Rishboland Tigers or Spinocrocodiles.
Jami: If this potion becomes widespread, my research topic will... gain some practical meaning, won't it? Once that time comes, I'll most certainly put your name into the acknowledgments section...
