Li Dang: Wh—What happened? ...Y—You rescued me? Thank you...
Li Dang: Oh! And have you seen my brother? His name is Li Ding, we were climbing the mountain together.
Li Dang: But then, I... Well, I don't know. Did I get swallowed up by the amber? I think I must have been knocked out...
Li Dang: I just hope he didn't get trapped in amber too...
Traveler: I wouldn't know...
Li Dang: Alright then, I won't bother you anymore. Thanks again... I'm going to find my brother now.
Li Dang: I really hope he's okay...
