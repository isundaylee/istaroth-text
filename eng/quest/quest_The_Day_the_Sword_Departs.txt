# The Day the Sword Departs


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: Liyue... I wonder when I'll come back...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Sun Yu: Ah, Traveler! It's you!
Sun Yu: Well, my itinerary to Fontaine has finally been decided, and in a few days, I'll set off with that merchant.
Sun Yu: He's still got some business stuff to deal with. And I'm taking advantage of this time to make sure I've packed everything.
Traveler: You are not going to visit Jueyun Karst one last time?
Sun Yu: Haha, I might regret my decision if I were to do that.
Sun Yu: I'll just take a look around the city from here. I've lived here for so long, and this time, I don't even know when I'll be able to come back.
Sun Yu: Oh, by the way, Que'er... *sigh* She hasn't agreed to go with me in the end, but I already asked Zhiruo to take care of her.
Sun Yu: I've also left some of my savings to her. She's much brighter than I am. She can take care of herself.
Sun Yu: And perhaps one day, she'll understand my decision.
Sun Yu: Right, Traveler, can I ask you one more favor?
Sun Yu: Could you please fetch me some soil?
Traveler: I can help with that...
Sun Yu: For someone like me who is about to leave his hometown, he'd want to bring some souvenirs with him, right?
Sun Yu: With Liyue's soil carried with me, I can at least say that I haven't been completely disconnected from this land.
Traveler: Why don't you fetch it yourself?
Sun Yu: Hahaha... Like I said, if I were to walk around this place, tons of memories would sure come flooding back...
Sun Yu: And then, I'm afraid that the little courage I've finally mustered to leave my hometown would disappear.
Sun Yu: So, I can only leave the task to you, Traveler. I'll mark the location for you.
Traveler: What's so special about that place?
Sun Yu: Ahem... I used to practice my swordsmanship with Que'er there...
Sun Yu: Anyway! I'll be leaving the task to you, Traveler.
Traveler: What do you need it for?
Traveler: You are not going to walk around this place one last time?

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: Thank you, it should be enough.
Traveler: You don't look too excited.
Sun Yu: Ahahaha... Sorry, I don't want to put you out or anything...
Sun Yu: It's just that I still feel a little reluctant to suddenly leave Liyue, where I've lived for so long.
Traveler: When are you leaving?
Sun Yu: Once the supplies are ready, we will set off.
Sun Yu: Oh yes, the adventurer who took me to The Chasm will also travel with us.
Sun Yu: Hearing that I'm heading over to Fontaine, she said she was also intrigued and decided to come with us.
Sun Yu: The merchant is happy to have another adventurer to protect him. But to be honest, I'm really not good at communicating with people who are that enthusiastic... *sigh*
Sun Yu: Never thought that I'd travel this far one day...

## Talk 3

Little Que'er: He must've been on purpose, Zhiruo! He just... He just doesn't want to be with me! *whimper*
Zhiruo: Que'er, you and he have spent so much time together, he must know what you're thinking.
Zhiruo: This time, he's determined to leave Liyue and travel abroad, he must have his reasons. So what's the harm if you travel with him?
Little Que'er: I just don't want to leave here! What's wrong with us staying here forever? The Guhua Clan... I couldn't care less about the Guhua Clan!
Zhiruo: Then why don't you tell him that?
Little Que'er: I... *sigh* He's been drawn to the whole idea of reviving the Clan. If he knew I'd said that, he must hate me...
Zhiruo: *sigh* Que'er...

## Talk 4

Sun Yu: I'll be leaving the task to you, Traveler.
