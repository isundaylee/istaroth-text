Diluc: So, what do you think of the Weinlesefest? Have you enjoyed yourself?
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Diluc: Well, what would you like to know?
Traveler: About Razor...
Diluc: *sigh* I can sympathize with the anguish of being away from family.
Diluc: Certainly, a tragic situation. But tragedy can also drive personal growth, and perhaps learning how to face it head-on is part of growing up... part of becoming an adult.
Diluc: Having the support of some good friends will certainly make that journey easier.
Traveler: About the voices...
Diluc: ...When I unsealed the wine, it seemed that the words of my late father were sealed inside.
Diluc: I wonder what he would think if he were to see me now.
Diluc: Somehow, I doubt he'd share the same view as he did back then.
Traveler: Of course he would.
Diluc: Heh...
Diluc: If you say so.
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Diluc: To the people of Mondstadt, wine-making is a way of working through emotions, and remembering our history.
Diluc: We're only able to make such high-quality wines these days thanks to the peace we enjoy. War is a thing of the distant past.
Diluc: Even though you might not see me reveling with the crowds, I am grateful for this as much as anyone.
Diluc: Say, have you tried our latest product, "Fruits of the Festival"?
Diluc: If you have any thoughts on how it could be improved, I'm all ears.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Diluc: Sure. We'll talk when you're free.
