# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How about talking it out with him?
Sania: I've tried talking, and I've tried scolding.
Sania: You know, he even considered leaving the village to look for some work, but then he claimed he'd miss home... or that he was sensitive to the humidity...
Sania: In the end, he just can't bear to leave me here alone in the village. And what am I supposed to do about that?
Sania: He's a good man. He's so good, he would spend our Mora on helping others.
Sania: I'm not saying that helping others is bad, but we need to look out for ourselves first, right?
