# Big Business


## Talk 1

Landa: This is really bad...
Traveler: What happened to you?
Landa: Oh, you're a traveler... Well, you see, I'm a merchant, and I often shuttle between Mondstadt and Liyue on business.
Landa: I had just closed a big deal in Mondstadt, and was getting ready to deliver the invoices back to my boss...
Landa: But I never imagined that I'd be attacked by monsters while passing through this area.
Landa: I couldn't fight them off, so I could only flee for my life, and ended up stumbling my way into this inn.
Landa: But I've run off, and left all the invoices behind... Could I ask you to get them back for me?
Traveler: I've got this.
Landa: That's wonderful! I remember the places I passed by as I ran, more or less. Here, let me mark them for you...
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!
Traveler: What sort of invoices?
Landa: For wine, of course. What other business would one do in Mondstadt, anyway?
Landa: This is a huge deal. If anything goes wrong, my boss will hang the loss on me for sure.
Landa: Please help me out. I've marked all the rough locations out for you.
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!
Traveler: Who's your boss?
Landa: My boss? Uh, well, it's a really rich merchant in Liyue. Really rich.
Landa: Oh, just don't ask too much. I'm just the errand runner, I don't know that much about the boss.
Landa: But if I mess this one up, I'm going to lose this errand-running job for sure.
Landa: Please help me out. I've marked all the rough locations out for you.
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!

## Talk 2

Bao'er: This doesn't seem to have any use...
Traveler: Excuse me. Have you seen a box?
Bao'er: A box? Well, I did pick one up.
Bao'er: I already had a look inside, and it was a batch of invoices. Seems like someone was doing a real huge business venture.
Bao'er: Oh me, oh my, I wonder how much the owner of this box would pay to have it back?
Traveler: ...What do you mean?
Bao'er: Hey, don't look so nervous. I was just pulling your leg.
Bao'er: The value of the goods on those invoices is not low by any means. Makes one wonder which big shot in Liyue it was who signed off on it.
Bao'er: I've got a sense of time and place. I'm not about to kick the hornet's nest just because I can.
Bao'er: Still, don't you think it's a bit unreasonable for you to just take this and leave after all the time and effort I've spent guarding it?
Bao'er: How about this? Let's barter. It's the most traditional way of solving such problems.
Bao'er: You fetch me 3 Noctilucous Jades, and I'll give you the invoices. How does that sound?
Bao'er: I mean, these 3 Noctilucous Jades probably aren't worth anything compared to the things listed on those invoices.
Traveler: Alright.
Bao'er: Well, hop to it then. When you're back, we'll trade, one for one.
Traveler: What's written on it, anyway?
Bao'er: Oh, you don't know? So you're just here to do someone else's work. Well, that's just fine.
Bao'er: Let me give you some advice: you're better off not asking too much about transactions of this scale.
Bao'er: Alright, go get me those Noctilucous Jades, and I'll give you the invoices. Then you can pass it on to the person who requested your services.
Bao'er: All done, no mess or fuss.

## Talk 3

Bao'er: Did you get those Noctilucous Jades?

## Talk 4

Landa: Did you find the invoices?
Traveler: Found them all.
Landa: Thank you, truly! This is wonderful. I'm so glad that nothing went wrong.
Landa: If these invoices were lost, I have no idea how angry my boss would have been.
Landa: You want to ask what business these invoices were written for, don't you?
Landa: I'm sorry, I really can't tell you. It's a secret.
Landa: Well, here's your remuneration, please take it... Wait a moment. Why has this box been opened?
Landa: ...You met someone out in the wild who took a look at it after picking it up?
Landa: Oh, I'm dead. Dead. Dead! This... this won't do. I have to tell the boss quickly...
Landa: Oh, don't worry, I'm not suspicious of you. I mean, I did do my homework regarding your...
Landa: Ahem. Well, I need to find a way to contact my boss. Please carry on with your business.

## Talk 5

Bao'er: I only had a little look. That won't get me in trouble, will it?
