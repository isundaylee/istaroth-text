Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Tieshan: Rex Lapis... You know, I saw him once, in a crowd. He was disguised as a commoner, so nobody noticed. But I could tell from the way he carried himself — everything about him was so dignified and graceful.
Tieshan: How did I know it was him? To be honest, I can't know for sure...
Tieshan: But I believe that everyone in Liyue can recognize the one who founded our nation and watched over us for millennia, even if just by his silhouette.
Tieshan: I'm honestly still struggling to accept his death. Now I'll never know for sure whether it was really him...
Tieshan: Still, I shouldn't tear myself up over it. The Rite of Parting went smoothly — and so may Rex Lapis' journey be.
