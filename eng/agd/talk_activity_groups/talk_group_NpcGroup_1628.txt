## Talk

Shizhuang the Strong: I head up the mining operation around these parts. What's your business here?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
Shizhuang the Strong: Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. And then one day, they dug up... something very strange...
Shizhuang the Strong: In an effort to contain it, the Qixing insisted on sealing the place off, despite it going against their immediate interests...
Shizhuang the Strong: Now that did surprise me. It's not like those big business types to look past the Mora signs in their eyes.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Shizhuang the Strong: You take care of yourself as well.

Traveler: Something very strange?
Shizhuang the Strong: ...I didn't see it with my own eyes. But I'm told the ones who did have been in a coma ever since.
Shizhuang the Strong: Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
Shizhuang the Strong: Now I've actually heard that a small portion of The Chasm has been reopened, and that some of our comrades have returned to work. But I'm not too sure about the details...
Shizhuang the Strong: But there's no point thinking about all this either way. It's better to be patient and wait for further news.

Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Mining in the Chasm is prohibited now. The Qixing came and sealed the whole place off.

Shizhuang the Strong: If even the Qixing's response is to literally put a lid on it, then I certainly don't plan to look into it any further myself.
Shizhuang the Strong: It will serve me better to concentrate on my next step now the mine's closed. I can't go letting my curiosity get the better of me.
Shizhuang the Strong: I feel sorry for the boys though. Now the mine's gone, they're lost souls. They've got nothing to do with themselves, and it's really crushed them.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Shizhuang the Strong: Alright then. Make sure you stay away from the out-of-bounds area.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Shizhuang the Strong: Nothing much, just a few pig-headed miners trying to get into the Chasm. I managed to stop them.
