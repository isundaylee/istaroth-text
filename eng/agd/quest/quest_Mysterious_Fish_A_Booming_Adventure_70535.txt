# Mysterious Fish? A Booming Adventure!


## Talk 1

Klee: Okay, got it!
Klee: But... fish taste best when they're freshly blasted. Grill them over a fire and they'll turn extra crispy and smell sooo good!
Lisa: Don't worry, Jean has... informed me about all that a while ago.
Lisa: So, I went ahead and placed some orders at Good Hunter. Over the next few days, their chefs will be preparing the best fish fresh from the lake, and cooking them right away.
Lisa: Freshly cooked fish served with Klee's favorite spices and my specially prepared desserts... Hehe, I'm sure it'll be just as delicious as your catches.
Klee: Okay! Then I'll trust your taste, Lisa!
Klee: I promise I'll stay in the city and play Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure! I won't go fish blasting or make any trouble for Albedo's friend!
Klee: #Anyway, I'm gonna go look for {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight and Paimon now!
Paimon: Hehe, is someone looking for us?
Traveler: It's pretty rare to see you two together.
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight and Paimon!
Klee: Klee was just thinking about you, and then you appeared! How'd you do that? Oh! Did you somehow magically hear Klee's thoughts!?
Lisa: Oh? Little cutie and Paimon, you're here just in time. Looks like I won't have to go to the trouble of writing you a letter now.
Traveler: Klee's wishes summoned us here!
Paimon: We had some time on our hands and wanted to look for something to read in the library... Anyway, what's "Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure"? It sounds way more fun than reading a book!
Klee: It's a new game Lisa made for me! We came up with the name together. You're amazing, Paimon! You remembered the name so quickly!
Paimon: Whoa, you can design games, Lisa? Paimon thought that you were just into the books.
Lisa: Hehe, I merely drew some inspiration from Shroomsplosion, a game from back when I was a student. It really didn't take too much effort.
Lisa: As long as we keep Klee happy during these unique circumstances, I'm willing to design as many games as she likes.
Traveler: Unique circumstances?
Paimon: Oh, now that Paimon thinks about it, Klee mentioned Albedo's friend, right? Did something happen in Mondstadt?
Lisa: It's not too serious, but the situation still has to be treated with caution.
Lisa: Recently, fish species native to Sumeru have begun appearing in Cider Lake. Allowing them to spread would put the ecological balance of Mondstadt's waters at risk.
Lisa: Luckily, Klee noticed some fish she'd never seen before while she snuck out to play. She caught a few and showed them to Kaeya.
Lisa: If it weren't for Klee, I'm afraid most of the local species would've already receded by the time ordinary citizens fully grasp the situation.
Lisa: And if a change occurs in the underwater ecosystem, it could very well affect the quality of water in Cider Lake. Consequently, the entire wine industry of Mondstadt could be in danger... and that poses a major threat to our economy.
Klee: Hehe, I saved the day! I even got praised by Master Jean!
Traveler: Good job, Klee!
Paimon: So that's what happened... Good thing Klee noticed the fish before things got out of control.
Lisa: The Investigation Team sent out a few members to inspect Cider Lake and look for the origin of the intruding species.
Lisa: To avoid disturbing these little invaders, Klee has to keep her treasured bombs away for some time.
Lisa: The Investigation Team's instruments are extremely sensitive, so any explosion within a certain distance of the lake would affect their data.
Lisa: Jean said that Klee would definitely get bored being cooped up inside the city all the time.
Lisa: Albedo's busy making improvements to the Reconnaissance Company's experimental equipment, while Kaeya just left for a business trip. So, the task of looking after her fell on my shoulders...
Klee: #But I'm not bored anymore, because Lisa invented Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure! Mr. Honorary Knight and Paimon, let's play together!
Traveler: Count us in!
Lisa: Alright, the game table is right over there in the garden. The orders I've placed at Good Hunter will also be delivered there.
Lisa: Please enjoy yourselves! It's not every day that you get to play games with Klee, surrounded by the scent of flowers on the breeze, with delicious food delivered right to you~
Paimon: Wait Lisa, are you not coming with us?
Lisa: Don't you think it'd be a little unfair if the game's creator joined in? I don't want to spoil the fun.
Lisa: Besides, as the librarian, I still have my basic responsibilities to take care of.
Paimon: That just sounds like another excuse for staying indoors...
Lisa: Run along now, have fun playing with Klee!
Traveler: We'll take good care of Klee!
Paimon: Okay then, we'll catch you later, Lisa!
Traveler: Thanks, Lisa!
Traveler: We'll play until sundown!
Traveler: Well-deserved praise, indeed!
Traveler: We were brought here by the magic of pure coincidence!
Traveler: Sounds like you two just made an important agreement.

## Talk 2

Klee: #We're here, Mr. Honorary Knight! This is where we'll play Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure!
Paimon: Whoa, Lisa really picked a good spot! Paimon loves it here already.
Paimon: Alright, teach us how to play, Klee!
Traveler: Dodo-Adventures!
Klee: Hehe! Yeah, let's play!
Traveler: Kaboooom!
