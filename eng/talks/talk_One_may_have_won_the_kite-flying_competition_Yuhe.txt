Xianyun: One may have won the kite-flying competition, Yuheng, but this prize should truly be reserved for another.
Keqing: You need not be so humble, Honored Adeptus. Among all the kites, yours was quite literally a cut above the rest. Please accept this prize. You deserve it.
Keqing: Besides, I'm quite certain we owe a fair share of the success of this year's Lantern Rite to you...
Xianyun: ...Hm, if you insist, then one can hardly continue to refuse. However, there is another matter with which one would ask your assistance.
Keqing: Of course.
Xianyun: One would be much obliged if you could distribute this case of Sunglo Tea among the Millelith on duty. The security of the festivities rests entirely on their shoulders, after all. One presumes they could always benefit from something to invigorate their spirits.
Keqing: (Cloud Retainer is so thoughtful and attentive to others' needs! I would expect nothing less of an esteemed adeptus such as herself.)
Keqing: Understood. I'll get on that right away.
Xianyun: (Phew... a fortuitous result indeed. One's tea surplus has hitherto resolved itself.)
