(Quest is part of chapter: Waterborne Poetry: Part I Congenial Gathering)

# Congenial Gathering


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, it's so lively! Didn't think there'd be so many people here already.
Paimon: And a lot of them are familiar faces. Let's go say hi!

## Talk 2

Venti: ...How about that for an opening?
Hu Tao: Yes, yes, I like it, but if we could give it a bit more "oomph" it would be even better!
Hu Tao: I think we should lead with a bang, dip into a slippedy-slide, then whoosh into a woop-woop! Boom.
Hu Tao: Got it?
Venti: Got it! Completely understood.

## Talk 3

Xingqiu: Hmm? Well, look who's here! This poetry fest seems to have attracted talent of the highest caliber.
Paimon: Hey! Xingqiu and Chongyun are here, too!
Chongyun: I was actually heading into the mountains to train, but he accosted me on the way and dragged me here.
Xingqiu: Oh, how your words wound me! Is it not the responsibility of an exorcist of Liyue to ensure that this celebration of friendship between our two nations stays free of evil spirits?
Xingqiu: Besides, this is an excellent opportunity to meet heroes who have come from far and wide. Surely, you must be curious as to how that heroine of Mondstadt was able to lift such heavy objects like they were but a feather?
Paimon: Are you talking about Noelle? Yeah, she's super strong!
Xingqiu: Oh? Well, since you are so well acquainted, could we trouble you to introduce us later?
Chongyun: Okay, fine... but don't forget to help me with my investigation like you promised. That's the only reason I agreed to come at all.
Paimon: Huh? What investigation?
Xingqiu: Ahem, naturally, I could never forget such a thing. My word is my bond. Relax, dear Paimon, all will be revealed in time.
Paimon: Uh... Okay?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Mika! Noelle!
Mika: #Oh! It's Traveler and Paimon!
Noelle: Are you here for the Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala as well?
Paimon: Uh... you said that with a straight face... Is Paimon the only one who thinks it sounds weird?
Traveler: Are you here as Mondstadt's representatives?
Mika: R—Representatives?...? No, nothing fancy like that.
Mika: We were sent here by the Knights of Favonius to help maintain order and set up the venue.
Mika: But... I didn't really do anything useful so far. Noelle brought all these tables and chairs here from Mondstadt by herself... She's a true knight.
Noelle: Now that's just not true! Your efforts were indispensable — you selected the venue, drew up the layout, and so on. Also, you're the true knight here. I'm still in training! If anything, I should be addressing you as "Sir"...
Mika: What!? No, no, no, no, please don't! Just keep calling me Mika!
Paimon: Why does it feel like these two could keep this up all day...
Noelle: Anyway, Master Jean did say that as long as we keep on top of our work, we should take a look around while we're here and get involved in the poetry gala as much as we can.
Noelle: But I haven't written much poetry before, so I'm not sure if I'll fit in...
Mika: I actually have the same concern...
Traveler: The important thing is just to participate.
Paimon: #Yeah! Plus you won't be alone — we're joining too! Traveler's a really good writer, y'know!
Mika: Really? In that case... we'll try our best too!
Noelle: Perhaps... the challenge of writing poetry is a rite of passage that all who wish to qualify as a knight must eventually face?
Paimon: Paimon wouldn't go THAT far...
Paimon: But anyway, no backing out now! See you soon!
Mika: Sure! Maybe you can teach me a thing or two!
Noelle: Ah, Mika beat me to it! I was gonna ask for help, too...
Traveler: I'll teach you both.
Traveler: We'll write together.
Traveler: There's a first time for everything.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Diona!
Diona: #Traveler and Paimon? I didn't expect to see you here.
Paimon: Are you here to mix drinks?
Diona: That's right. I was specially asked to attend this event on behalf of The Cat's Tail, and I'm also here as a mixologist representing the Mondstadt wine industry.
Paimon: You're representing Mondstadt's wine industry? You must be hating every minute of it...
Diona: Of course I hate it! But it's also a purrfect chance to destroy the reputation of Mondstadt's wine business once and for all. Opportunities like this don't come around every day, y'know...
Paimon: Huh? How do you figure that...?
Diona: Hehehe, all I need to do is add some gross ingredients to the drinks, and I can create the most disgusting concoctions imaginable! Nobody will ever buy wine from Mondstadt again!
Paimon: Um... Paimon thinks you'll end up getting the opposite result.
Diona: Hmph! Just you wait, I ain't about to mess this up!
Traveler: Good luck.
Paimon: Are you gonna write some poetry with us too?
Diona: Poetry? Hmm, I've heard plenty of bards sing in the tavern before, but I've never tried writing any myself.
Paimon: You should join in. It'll be fun!
Diona: ...Fine. If I have time.
Traveler: Don't overwork yourself.

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: A sudden gust of wind forces everyone to briefly shut their eyes.
Venti: Poems and melodies wandering the wind, wafting to pastures beyond their home.
Hu Tao: Two greedy fishies struggling to swim, they ate so much that they're starting to groan.
Venti: Anemo Crystalfly draped in gold robes, a bright little light from that glaze lantern glows.
Hu Tao: Finches pinch the rice and scoot, while the boars of the forest anxiously root!
Venti: Welcome, one and all, to this festival of poetry, jointly organized by Liyue and Mondstadt!
Hu Tao: Or, in full: the "Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala"!
Hu Tao: We are your hosts: Liyue's versemonger of the darkest alleys, Hu Tao...
Venti: ...And Mondstadt's liquor-loving lyricist, Venti the bard!
Venti: The purpose of this event is to promote friendly, poetic exchanges between our two nations! So please, have fun, talk to other people, and make some new friends.
Hu Tao: If you're here, you're our guest, so please enjoy this poetry fest!
Venti: I'd also like to reassure everyone that this event welcomes people of all skill levels, from first-time rhymers to seasoned songwriters.
Venti: If you ask me, the most important thing you can bring to writing poetry is authenticity. That means reaching deep down to all the thoughts and feelings you usually hide away or struggle to express, and putting them into words... Just write from the heart, in whatever form you like.
Hu Tao: To help everyone really cut loose and enjoy themselves to the fullest, Venti and I have carefully prepared three themes, to be revealed over the course of three days!
Hu Tao: Let's get right to it! The first theme is... "Riddle Me This"!
Xingqiu: (Solving riddles, huh? Interesting. It's actually a pretty good choice for a warm-up activity.)
Mika: (Whew... I'm glad they're not making us write sonnets or something right at the start.)
Hu Tao: Does everyone see the lanterns hanging around the venue? These have been specially prepared for the riddle game.
Hu Tao: Simply write down your riddle and hang it on a lantern. Then, Venti and I will select a few to pose to the crowd, and you will try to solve them!
Hu Tao: We'll now give you some time to write down and hang up your riddles. Feel free to walk around and talk with the other contestants to get the creative juices flowing. And remember, whoever guesses the most riddles correctly will get a prize!
Venti: And with that, the "Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala" has officially begun!

## Talk 7

Noelle: What do you think the key to a good poem is, Mika? Do you have any idea?
Mika: Huh? I, uh... I'm not too sure either.
Mika: If I'd known we'd be doing this sooner... I would've asked Miss Lisa to recommend some books on the topic.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey you two!
Xingqiu: Oh? Hi Paimon. You know, for a moment there, I was worried I might lose to you.
Paimon: ...Ooh, are you collecting your prize right now?
Xingqiu: I am indeed! Though if you really want it, I'd be more than happy to give it to you.
Paimon: Seriously!? Wow, what is it?
Chongyun: Ummm...
Hu Tao: A most generous donation by yours truly as Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Namely, a buy one get one free coupon for our high-end customized service package! It's a pleasant surprise to learn you're so interested in it, Paimon.
Paimon: Hahahaha! Nope! Nuh-uh, no thank you! Hard pass — you can keep it!
Xingqiu: Are you sure? In that case, I'll gladly take it!
Hu Tao: Here you are! Now remember, this package comes with our "anytime, anywhere" on-demand collection service! Just give us a call and we'll be right there! ...With any luck, we'll still show up even if you're... unable to call.
Xingqiu: So, to what do we owe the honor, Paimon?
Paimon: Hmph! What do you mean, "we"? Chongyun's the one Paimon's looking for, not you. Wasn't he saying something about needing help?
Chongyun: Oh yeah, that...
Xingqiu: How about I put it in riddle form?
Paimon: Huh? Isn't the competition over?
Xingqiu: "'Twas like a demon not demonic, or devil devoid of the diabolic. Afar it floated free above the ground, but when approached, though sought, nought could be found."
Paimon: Um...
Hu Tao: Sounds to me like you encountered a ghastly little ghostie in the wild?
Chongyun: Perhaps I should just explain it...
Chongyun: Basically, while I was training this morning, I suddenly caught sight of a nonhuman entity.
Chongyun: It was floating in the air without any kind of external aid, and its body was almost transparent. At first, I thought I'd finally encountered a demon that wasn't repelled by my pure-yang spirit, and immediately prepared to exorcise it.
Chongyun: But none of my methods had any effect on it. And when I went to try and get a closer look at it and try to ascertain what I was dealing with, it disappeared into thin air.
Hu Tao: You're sure it's not a ghost or spirit of some kind?
Chongyun: Quite sure. I could sense that it had a physical body. And if it were a spirit, I'm sure it would have been scared away long before I saw it.
Chongyun: It's all my fault. I got overexcited, and in my haste I didn't ascertain its true nature before taking action. Thinking back on it... If it wasn't an evil spirit, maybe I offended some kind of adeptus, or illuminated beast...
Xingqiu: You shouldn't blame yourself. It was something you'd never seen before — anyone else would've reacted the same way.
Xingqiu: Besides, we're making up for it now by doing our best to find out the truth.
Hu Tao: Any thoughts, Venti? Have you managed to untangle Chongyun's twisted tale?
Venti: Why don't you take a guess first, Hu Tao?
Hu Tao: Oho, that means you have!
Venti: Hehe, I can't be absolutely certain, but I'm reasonably sure it's not what Liyue would call an "evil spirit" or "demon." So whatever it is, it's not dangerous.
Venti: Hmm... How about this? We can incorporate a "search" element into tomorrow's poetry activity.
Paimon: Ooh, does that mean we get to play outside while we write poetry?
Venti: Haha, close! ...But no.
Venti: Good ideas could just pop into your head out of thin air. But if you ask me, everyone should relax tonight, and get a good rest before tomorrow!
Paimon: You say that, but your gaze keeps drifting over towards the wine stand!

## Talk 9

Chongyun: Are you sure that wasn't really an evil spirit?
Xingqiu: Open your mind to all possibilities, and I'm sure you will find the answer.
Chongyun: I suppose that's true... Hey, wait a second, you're not planning on telling everyone here, are you?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Diona: Now, should I try adding Loach Pearls or Horsetails next...
Diona: Ooh, wait! Since we're in Liyue, I should add some Jueyun Chilis!

### Additional Talk 2

Venti: Hehe, that was a good little opening ceremony, wasn't it? Even if I do say so myself.

### Additional Talk 3

Hu Tao: We couldn't cajole Adeptus Xiao in the end. He said he'd take a peek from the peaks, but that was all he'd agree to. It's a real shame — I had the perfect poem for his entrance and everything.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Oh, let's see what's on this lantern...
Paimon: Hmm... "A tender sigh for home, how far the flowers roam. A visitor asks me 'why': For a dream beyond the sky."
Paimon: Okay, someone from Liyue definitely wrote this one.
Mika: I just read that one too! Liyue's poems seem pretty difficult to grasp.
Noelle: Dreams... sky... is it talking about some kind of bird?
Paimon: Umm, so it means something like... This thing's really far from home, it's in a vast area, and it's flying really high... Is that it?
Traveler: In a nutshell, yes.
Noelle: Oh, you're amazing, Paimon! It looks like I still have a lot of learning to do.
Paimon: Aw... It's nothing, really. Once you've spent enough time in Liyue, you just sort of pick up on these things.
Mika: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. Back when I was out with the Grand Master on the expedition, I started picking up some local customs without even realizing it.
Paimon: But back to the riddle — we still haven't actually solved it. What could it be talking about?
Noelle: Something that flies high and far... Oh, that makes me think of dandelions.
Mika: Oh! That makes sense. And Mondstadters believe that dandelions can carry your feelings on the wind.
Noelle: But maybe we're missing something? It can't be that easy. After all, it's a riddle from Liyue... What would their equivalent of the dandelion be? If there even is one...
Noelle: #What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: I think "dandelion" is the right answer.
Mika: Great! Then we'll have one answer ready to go when the game begins.
Traveler: The important thing is that it's authentic.
Noelle: Right, just like Venti said! As long as the interpretation makes sense, and reflects our perception of the poem, then perhaps there are no wrong answers.
Paimon: Well, no matter what the real answer is, the guessing's all part of the fun!
Paimon: Let's go look at the next one!
Noelle: Yes! I want to see if there's any Mondstadt-style riddles.
Traveler: Very clear and concise.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: This one says... ugh... this handwriting is just awful...
Paimon: ..."I have four corners like a square pancake, but I'm stuffed and seasoned and carefully baked. I pass through the lips one piece at a time, the more you consume, the broader your mind."
Paimon: Wow, Paimon's drooling from that one! Is there really a food that can make you smarter? Paimon's gotta try that!
Xingqiu: Haha, oh Paimon, you have to look past the surface-level meaning with riddles, or you'll fail to plumb their depths.
Paimon: Huh? So, have you got any ideas, Xingqiu?
Xingqiu: Heh, well...
Chongyun: Xingqiu just hung that riddle up a moment ago.
Paimon: Oh! So this is Xingqiu's riddle! Y'know, Paimon was expecting you to write something a little more... elegant.
Xingqiu: This festival is about building friendship and mutual understanding. With so many friends from Mondstadt present, I thought I'd try writing something more accessible and less flowery, so that more people could enjoy it.
Paimon: Hey, not bad! So, buddy, does that mean you can tell your old pal Paimon the answer on the sly...?
Xingqiu: Not a chance. You'll have to wait for the answer to be revealed just like everyone else.
Paimon: Hmph! Meanie.
Xingqiu: If that's how you feel, why don't you try and stump me with a riddle of your own?
Paimon: M—Maybe Paimon will! We'll see who stumps who!
Paimon: #...Traveler, you'll help Paimon come up with a riddle, right?
Traveler: Gladly.
Paimon: Hah, at least you're nice to Paimon!
Xingqiu: Haha, then I look forward to seeing the fruits of your literary labors.
Paimon: Hmph! Prepare to get stumped!

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: Hmmm... Even though Paimon said she'd write a riddle, Paimon really doesn't have any clue how.
Paimon: Let's start by reading a few more of other people's for inspiration...
Paimon: "On four long legs my slim body sits, I eat not a bite and drink not a sip. With a passionless face I greet countless guests, whom I carry all day without needing to rest."
Paimon: ...Is this talking about some kind of animal?
Traveler: All animals need to eat.
Diona: It's a chair!
Paimon: Huh? Diona, how'd you guess it so quickly? Wait, were you the one who wrote it?
Diona: No, of course I didn't write it! The answer just popped into my head.
Diona: I'm always telling the cats in the tavern that the chairs get tired from working all the time, so they shouldn't use them to sharpen their claws.
Paimon: Okay... So a riddle needs to have a bait-and-switch...
Diona: Are you tryna write one?
Paimon: Yep! And thanks to you, Paimon's just thought of one!
Diona: Maybe I should try and come up with one, too...
Paimon: Hehe, alright, Paimon's riddle is now hanging up! ....Diona, do you wanna know the answer?
Diona: Nah, no need. I don't really care about winning a prize.
Paimon: Oh, okay then... Well, looks like it's time to carry on with the event. We should regroup with the others.
Diona: Sure. Have fun!
Traveler: The answer must be some other kind of object.

### Additional Talk 7

Hu Tao: Heyo, looks like everyone's about done mingling and riddling! Gather round, and look this way!
Hu Tao: Venti and I have selected several riddles from everyone's contributions, and we added a few of our own to the mix for good measure. Shortly, we'll randomly select a few to read aloud.
Hu Tao: If your riddle gets selected, remember that you have to announce the correct answer at the end. Anyone who guesses correctly gets one point, and if nobody guesses correctly, the writer of the riddle gets a point. Sounds fair to me!
Venti: Of course, when the riddler reveals the right response, it only counts if everyone agrees that it's not too far-fetched!
Hu Tao: That's right! Now, if there are no more questions, it's time to reveal the first riddle!
Mika: (...Hopefully they'll draw at least some that I can get. Oh no, does only the first person to solve it get the points? ...Ugh, that means I have to be first to raise my hand...)
Paimon: Please choose Paimon's riddle, please choose Paimon's riddle...
Hu Tao: Riddle number one! Let me see here... Uh, this riddle is, uh... unique. Especially the handwriting...
Hu Tao: ..."I have... poor... cor—four! Four corners like a square... pancake? But I'm st—stuffed and seasoned? And carefully bu—baked. (Baked? Baked.) I pass through the... chips? Lips! ...uh, one piece at a time, the more you... uh, c—consume, consume, consume! The broader your f—mind."
Paimon: They drew Xingqiu's!
Xingqiu: Better answer as quickly as you can. You don't want someone else beating you to it...
Paimon: You! Drat! Um... it's, uh... PIZZA! The answer is pizza!
Hu Tao: Ehhh... Even without the author coming forward, I can confidently declare this answer wrong! How does eating pizza broaden your mind!?
Hu Tao: And while I'm no expert in exotic dishes... If I'm not mistaken, pizza is round, is it not? Like Mora Meat.
Paimon: But... eating pizza makes you happy, and being happy makes it easier to face problems that need solving, sooo...
Paimon: Okay, Paimon admits she may have jumped the gun on this one...
Noelle: (Maybe it's some other kind of food? No no no no, riddles are never that simple, and it needs to be something that makes people more intelligent...)
Paimon: If Paimon had known it was gonna be this tough, she'd have read more books in her time...
Traveler: ...!
Paimon: Wh—What is it? Have you got it?
Traveler: "Books"!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Traveler: They're square, and they've got lots of big words baked into them!
Paimon: Oh! Gotcha!
Paimon: ...Books! The answer is books!
Xingqiu: Haha, that was quicker than I expected! I was quite proud of that one.
Hu Tao: Oh? It appears the riddle-writer has announced the answer! Okay, one point to Paimon!
Mika: (Huh? So the answer was "books"? Argh, how did I not get that? C'mon Mika, concentrate...)
Paimon: Hehe, we're awesome at this!
Traveler: ...Ahem.
Paimon: #Oh... Uh, what Paimon meant to say was that you're awesome at this! Thanks for the point, Traveler!
Venti: On to riddle number two!
Mika: (I gotta get in there first this time...)
Venti: "High above the wispy clouds, amidst the gloomy snow-filled shroud, standing alone on an icy stage, beneath it every lowly sage." Looks like a poem from Liyue!
Noelle: Oh! It's—
Mika: I got it!
Noelle (Mika & Noelle): ...
Mika (Mika & Noelle): ...
Paimon: Eh? Looks like those two have some ideas. Hmm, could it be some kind of plant that lives in cold, high places?
Noelle: Mika, please go ahead. As a full Knight of Favonius, you represent all of us from Mondstadt here.
Mika: No, no, how could I? It was you who thought of it first. You should be the one to guess.
Noelle: My answer isn't necessarily correct. Besides, it's first-come, first-served, and you beat me to it...
Mika: N—No I didn't... You were just before me...
Venti: Ah, how gracious and considerate our fellow competitors are towards each other. A wonderful sight to see.
Venti: How about both of you say your answer at the same time? If you're both right, you'll each get a point.
Noelle: (Whoops, I didn't realize we'd made such a scene...)
Mika: (Oh, crud... Guess we dragged that out a bit...)
Mika: Um... So Noelle, what do you say...
Noelle: Yes, let's. Our answer is:
Mika (Mika & Noelle): "Cecilia."
Venti: That certainly sounds like a good candidate for the correct answer! A flower that blooms on the highest peaks and known for its exquisite beauty, the Cecilia is held by many Mondstadters to be the true "Windblume."
Venti: Uh... Although since the writer hasn't yet come forward to announce the answer, this probably wasn't the answer they were looking for. Sorry! Any other answers?
Mika: (I can't believe I was wrong... Maybe it's a plant from Liyue?)
Xingqiu: ...Is the answer "Qingxin"? The poem does evoke a strong sense of quiet, proud solitude in a high place.
Callirhoe (Riddle Writer): Correct! I wrote this one. Qingxin is the right answer.
Paimon: Nooo! Xingqiu got it before Paimon could!
Callirhoe (Riddle Writer): ...However, after listening to the host's description, I do remember reading about Cecilia flowers in a book once. They definitely fit the description of a pure flower standing proudly and alone on high.
Callirhoe (Riddle Writer): So, I'd like to approve the answer from our two friends from Mondstadt as well.
Noelle: Really? Thank you so much...
Venti: Haha! Well, since even the riddler themself agrees, all three contestants earn a point each!
Paimon: Darn it! Xingqiu's caught up to Paimon already!
Traveler: We're only just getting started.
Paimon: Yeah... You're probably right.
Hu Tao: Moving now to our third riddle... Huh? Why is the handwriting so... floaty...?
Hu Tao: "What's got no wings but flies in the air, never gets tired of floating up there, so full of Mora it comes out the nose, but in the sea glug glug glug down it goes!"
Paimon: That's Paimon's! They picked Paimon's riddle! Yay!
Chongyun: ...
Xingqiu: ...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: What is it? Why isn't anyone guessing? Is Paimon's riddle too hard?
Xingqiu: That's not quite it. More like... it's so ludicrously simple that we just cannot believe it.
Paimon: What!? No way... Well, go on then, tell us the answer if you're so sure.
Chongyun: The answer is... "Paimon."
Paimon: ...What?
Xingqiu: It's "Paimon."
Traveler: It's "Paimon."
Noelle: I was actually gonna say "Paimon," too...
Mika: Me too...
Paimon: No! You're all completely wrong! How the heck did you all think the answer was Paimon!?
Xingqiu: Paimon, do you have wings behind your back?
Paimon: ...Uh, no.
Chongyun: You're always floating, but you never seem to get tired of it.
Noelle: #And Paimon has a very healthy appetite, which must cost Traveler a lot of Mora in meal expenses.
Mika: #I've heard from the senior knights that Traveler rescued Paimon by fishing her out of the sea. So, that means Paimon can't swim, so if she fell in the sea, then, uh...
Paimon: Glug glug glug...
Paimon: Wait, wait... Now Paimon's doubting herself, what was the answer again...
Traveler: Think about it for a moment.
Paimon: No, you're all wrong! The answer to Paimon's riddle is obviously the "Jade Chamber"! You know, the Jade Chamber that's always flying up there in the sky!
Xingqiu: Is that so? Hmm, I still maintain that the riddle actually describes "Paimon" more accurately.
Xingqiu: In fact, if we just added two more lines to the poem, it would be the perfect riddle.
Paimon: Huh? What do you want to add?
Xingqiu: ..."The Traveler's companion and talkative guide, a praiseworthy presence always by their side."
Paimon: Aw, do you mean it? Can we really add that part?
Traveler: I can vouch for it.
Paimon: You think so too? Hee-hee...
Paimon: Okay! Then Paimon would like to announce that the correct answer to the riddle is... the widely adored "Paimon"!
Hu Tao: Great! And with that, the widely adored Paimon has gifted a point each to everyone who answered just now!
Black Screen Text: More riddles and giggles fill the air as the time flies by...
Paimon: Hehe, guessing riddles is a lot of fun. And even though Paimon didn't manage to beat Xingqiu, Paimon still feels like she got a little smarter!
Paimon: Oh — didn't Chongyun mention he was investigating something before? Let's go ask him about it.
Traveler: Paimon's the best travel companion ever!
Traveler: It's just one measly point.
Traveler: Every big word that passes through your lips as you read it out makes you smarter!
Traveler: Paimon!

### Additional Talk 8

Venti: Seeing my friends having such a lively discussion, I couldn't help but join in on the fun.
Venti: Of course, I promised Hu Tao I'd behave and do my job as a good host... but I really am parched from speaking so much. It would be negligent not to wet my whistle.
Venti: And you know what the best part is? Wine is to the poet's tongue as ink to his pen. So, two birds with one stone!
