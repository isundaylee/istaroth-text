# Bulle Sauce Duck Breast

A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. After saut√©eing the duck breast, slice it and plate the meat before drizzling Bulle Fruit sauce atop it. Crisp skin, sumptuous tender meat, and sauce mingling sweet and sour come together in an ensemble that is a classic Fontainian delicacy.
