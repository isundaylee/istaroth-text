# Finale


## Talk 1

Paimon: "The Soil Renewed: The Spina Di Rosula Talks Post-Disaster Rebuilding." I recently visited Poisson to meet with Miss Navia, spokesperson of the Spina di Rosula, and we spoke about Poisson's present and future.
Paimon: "Old soil can still give birth to new bloom," Miss Navia stated. "Hope is like seeing a small cookie when you're starving late at night — you just need a little of it."
Paimon: "Skyship Wingalet — Boon or Bane of the Fontaine Research Institute?"
Paimon: The various disputes that have arisen on account of Mr. Edwin have suddenly become a shield over the Institute, with Jurieu turning out to be a once-overlooked hidden gem.
Paimon: People always call the first researcher mad, but few know what to call the second. And should that latter person achieve a miracle, they would find it all the harder to find a word with which to classify him and his team...
Paimon: Wow, Paimon barely recognizes the people in the reports. Are those really Jurieu and Navia? They sound like real big shots...
Traveler: They might've been real big shots from the start...
Charlotte: What do you think? Pretty enthralling, eh? The Steambird's idea was pretty simple. With the disaster just having passed, we would print a free edition packed to the margins with good news to calm people down.
Charlotte: The value for these big scoops lies in their inevitable follow-ups. We'll publish further reports and go into the stories behind those people.
Charlotte: Edwin's assistant, Jurieu, created a true flying ship, while Navia is leading people in the reconstruction of their home... I'm sure that these stories could draw even your well-traveled eye.
Traveler: The articles do make me curious about how things will play out...
Paimon: Paimon's curious too... Wait a minute. Didn't we watch everything happen from start to finish? What's there to be curious about?
Charlotte: And that's exactly why I'd like you to come conduct interviews with me. You're the best incubators of news, if you haven't noticed — and also, with you around, I'm sure I'll get to see that Duke.
Paimon: Are you sure? Hasn't he turned you down several times already?
Charlotte: Oh, this time will be different. Come on! Let's head to Poisson first, and then make a trip to the Fortress. There are some things you'll only know when you get there.
Traveler: We just didn't meet them in that capacity.

## Talk 2

Charlotte: Navia!
Navia: Oh, it's you! What brings you all here?
Paimon: Hey! We're just having a look around!
Charlotte: I'm here to update myself on how things are going here. Hmm? Oh, the Fatui are here, too!
Navia: Ah, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Gerunt Snezhevich. He represented The Knave in sending us a large amount of supplies, and is helping with our work.
Navia: Our residents are hard at work as well. Thanks to everyone, work is progressing nicely. We've lost a lot of people, but we're moving forward — that will have to be enough.
Gerunt Snezhevich: Hello, Miss Charlotte. I'm a big fan of yours... I especially liked that article you wrote last year about Fontaine's stray cats.
Gerunt Snezhevich: But if you don't mind, could you not emphasize our role too much in your report? It's not charity we're doing here. We just happened to share the same interests as the Spina.
Charlotte: I get where you're coming from. I'll keep it as simple as possible... Or would you be willing to feature as "friendly neighbors"?
Gerunt Snezhevich: That would be fine, thanks.
Navia: Oh, you're back, too! How are things?
Clorinde: We've finished laying down the construction materials. It'll be another hour before the workers are able to go over there.
Paimon: Huh? You're here too, Clorinde?
Navia: Well, her reputation's greatly risen after that whole duel business with Miss Furina, so she's here in Poisson to wait out the heat... Alright, alright, she really came here to help me out.
Clorinde: There's too much to consider in the reconstruction of Poisson. The Spina has need of more decision-makers... and well, I do already happen to be connected to Mr. Callas.
Charlotte: Wait just a moment! Do you mind me asking a few questions? You know, about how you felt before the duel, about what it was like facing down a god... There's lots of exciting material there, I'd bet!
Clorinde: Forget it. I'm sure you can find a better theme than that, Miss Charlotte.
Charlotte: Ugh, I see you're the same as always... Couldn't you do me a favor, for Navia's sake?
Navia: #Well, if we're talking about doing things for my sake, you might as well just take a few more photos of me — or of {NICKNAME}! It's better than wasting time persuading Clorinde, at any rate.
Charlotte: #Of course I will — I'm not gonna let {F#her}{M#him} off that easy. Alright! Then everyone who wants to be in the photo gather up... and smile!
Paimon: How did it go? Was it a good shot? Did Paimon look cute in it?
Charlotte: Not bad. Your addition really helped the composition of the picture... Alright, hang on a moment, let me snap a few more shots...
Black Screen Text: Charlotte takes more pictures of Poisson to the clicking of shutters, and also does some rapid-fire resident interviews...
Charlotte: Alright, that should do it. I'll be back here later, anyway, so let's call it a day.
Clorinde: You're very quick.
Charlotte: Speed is of the essence when it comes to the news, and freshness is the key!
Charlotte: Also, not to brag, but I'm pretty good at building connections. Who knows, I might eventually get that interview with you after all, Miss Clorinde.
Navia: Wow, you really do have that never-say-die spirit. I'm impressed.
Clorinde: I'll hazard a guess that this is how you got that interview at the Fortress of Meropide.
Traveler: You already knew she was going?
Charlotte: Whoa, you're well-informed. Let me make a guess, too. I asked Sigewinne, who told Monsieur Neuvillette, and he told you, right?
Gerunt Snezhevich: That's a... very complete information chain.
Clorinde: In truth, all Monsieur Neuvillette asked me was "When did the Fortress become so friendly towards the media?"
Clorinde: I told him that it was best not to speak too soon — there's no guarantee that Wriothesley will make a personal appearance.
Charlotte: You're right. I've gotta treasure every moment I have with them — in which case, I'll be making a move first!
Navia: Stay safe, now! And tell me if you hear anything interesting — I'll treat you to afternoon tea in exchange!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow, guess we're here again, huh? There's a real nostalgic feeling to this place.
Wriothesley: Looks like you've been missing us.
Paimon: Duke! Did you come all the way to the entrance to greet us?
Wriothesley: Of course. I'm here to welcome you and our dear Miss Charlotte, whom our good Head Nurse recommended to me.
Charlotte: It's an honor to finally meet the much rumored Duke. Thank you for consenting to my visit to the Fortress, sir.
Wriothesley: No need to thank me — but that said, I shouldn't be the focus of your interview. I trust you recall our agreement?
Charlotte: Of course, of course!
Wriothesley: Alright then, this way.
Jurieu: ...
Lourvine: ...
Charlotte: Hmm? Hey, no need to be so nervous. I've already taken all the photos we need.
Lourvine: Um... Miss Charlotte... Do these pictures really need to be published on the cover of The Steambird?
Wriothesley: It would seem that Miss Lourvine doesn't want her face to appear beside that of Mr. Jurieu, hmm?
Jurieu: Sir, please don't say things like that!
Wriothesley: Ah, but it looks like dear Mr. Jurieu denies it. Might this interview be very important to you, then?
Jurieu: No! I—I just... This is my first time being interviewed, and I'm very thankful to The Steambird for...
Charlotte: Haha, now, I might not look it, but I did actually meet Mr. Edwin once, and I'll be honest, I enjoyed chatting with you more — you've definitely got more of that "genius" vibe going on!
Charlotte: The boat that brought about a miracle, the ark that saved the people! Why, you recreated a myth back there, like an emissary of legend!
Charlotte: ...Still, if I might ask, where's that flying ship now?
Paimon: Heh, looks like Charlotte's trying to get herself another exclusive scoop...
Wriothesley: I have to apologize, but that ship is presently in the bowels of our factory. I'm afraid it won't be easy for you to get a shot of it.
Charlotte: Really? Then in that case, could I have an interview with you to make up for that loss?
Traveler: (She really does know how to squeeze opportunities for all they're worth...)
Wriothesley: You already know my answer, I'm afraid. Best you interview our Head Nurse instead — or perhaps you'd like to take another photo of this couple of researchers?
Lourvine: Did you really have to use the word "couple"!?
Charlotte: Well, then, two solo photos will do!
Jurieu: Is my hair messed up? Please, someone help me have a look...
Paimon: Things sure are getting pretty lively here... Uh, we've seen this kind of thing before...
Sigewinne: Ooh, seems like everyone's here! Would any of you like to try this new drink I came up with...
Wriothesley: Ah, Sigewinne...
Lourvine: Ah, uh — Hey, Miss Charlotte! Why don't you, ah, take some pretty photos of our Head Nurse?
Charlotte: Hmm? Uh, sure! C'mon, Miss Sigewinne, over this way. Let's find a brighter spot...
Sigewinne: Huh? Oh, sure... Do I have to smile?
Paimon: So, how've things been at the Fortress?
Wriothesley: Same old same old, as you can see. Fontaine's undergone some changes, but this place's still more or less the same.
Jurieu: Other than that flying ship. It got a tad too much attention, I think...
Wriothesley: That's why I decided to let the interview go through. We should direct more public opinions toward the behind-the-scenes heroes — am I right, Mr. Jurieu? Miss Lourvine?
Lourvine: You're too kind, sir. I believe that you, too, should have your day in the sun — not that you would want that, which is a pity.
Wriothesley: Hahaha, I'll just leave the spotlight to you two.
Black Screen Text: You walk with Wriothesley for a while and share news from above ground with him...
Wriothesley: I see. Lots of things happened that day, huh? Anyway, regarding that Harbinger, I'm not sure you remember, but his three young followers are still waiting for his return.
Paimon: He sure did win them over, huh...
Wriothesley: I'll tell them that there's good news and bad news — the good being that their boss seems fine, and the bad being that they must face extended sentences for abetting his escape.
Paimon: Oh, actually, what about you? Are things gonna change for you, too?
Wriothesley: What change can there be? The Fortress will keep chugging along, and so will my duties.
Wriothesley: As to what Miss Furina's departure will mean for the nation, and if our laws and governance will be transformed... We'll leave those to the folks in the overworld.
Charlotte: Hey, everyone. The photoshoot's done!
Wriothesley: Good. In that case, let's call it a day here.
Charlotte: #Thanks for your cooperation. C'mon, {NICKNAME}, let's go. Till next time, everyone!
Wriothesley: There'll be a next time?
Charlotte: Maybe! Who knows? I might write a story about the underwater factory next time. Until then!

## Talk 4

Clorinde: You seem curious about the Fortress.
Navia: Of course! Ugh, that Wriothesley... I still remember going down to the Fortress to grill him for information on my father's case. Boy, did he take me for a ride... without telling me anything, of course.
Clorinde: But he did invite you to tea, didn't he?
Navia: Two large pots of it, in fact — it was good tea, though.
Clorinde: I have to agree. The tea there is very good.
Navia: Ah, speaking of that, would you like to have some today? I mean, you've got time, right?
Clorinde: I'd be partial to some shortbread.
Navia: ...Wow, it's like we've got a menu, or something... Sure, sure.
Clorinde: Good.
Navia: What flavor of biscuits would you like, Mr. Snezhevich?
Gerunt Snezhevich: Me? I'm fine with anything... but I would prefer chocolate, should you have it.
Navia: Alright. Leave it to me!
Clorinde: I'll go over the newly-arrived supplies with you later, Mr. Snezhevich. We should be able to finish the preparatory work today.
Gerunt Snezhevich: That works great for me.
Navia: Huh. Is it just me, or did you get a new lipstick?
Clorinde: I did. It was a gift from Sigewinne. Want to give it a try? I think the color would suit you, too.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Paimon sees them! They really are here. How did you know?
Charlotte: Navia mentioned that she stayed in touch with Lyney and the others after working together. Apparently, they've been at the docks distributing these strange pockets the whole time since.
Lyney: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon — ah, and Miss Charlotte, too.
Lynette: Would you like a Magic Pocket?
Charlotte: What sort of gadget is it?
Lynette: It's a wondrous bag that can be used to carry many things. The water level has returned to normal, but if you see any of your things floating around, you can use this to carry them — or you could trick a friend into doing it for you.
Charlotte: Trick a friend? Huh, I wonder which of my friends would fall for that...?
Lynette: You could just make a friend like Freminet here. Isn't that right, Freminet?
Freminet: Is this what you meant by "I'll help you make some more friends"...
Charlotte: To be honest, that sounds pretty sweet! Could I have your contact, please?
Freminet: Uhh... Oh, um... sure. Please, write down my address.
Paimon: Lynette sure is working hard to help Freminet socialize...
Lynette: He was the one who proposed doing this — he even wants to assist in our magic shows.
Traveler: Sounds like that would suit him.
Lyney: Yes, I was planning to first introduce Pers as an assistant, and later Freminet himself. In the future, I think we can leave underwater escape magic to him, too.
Lynette: That said, would anyone want to see a diver escape underwater?
Lyney: Oh, it'll work out. Every journey begins with a first step — he'll become a part of our show eventually.
Freminet: Lynette, could you come over? Miss Charlotte says she wants to take a picture of us...
Lynette: Got it.
Lyney: #My, that Charlotte is rather perceptive. She got rid of everyone the moment she realized I had something to say to you... So. How've things been, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I'm doing alright.
Lyney: "Father" says that you did a great deal during the latest events. She's very grateful for your contributions to Fontaine.
Paimon: Aw, that's alright. We were more than happy to help... So, what's she doing now?
Lyney: Oh, I guess you haven't heard. Well...
Lyney: After Lady Furina left, "Father" and Monsieur Neuvillette opened negotiations, during which he gave Fontaine's Gnosis to her as a "diplomatic gift."
Paimon: A "diplomatic gift"? A Gnosis?
Lyney: Yes. I was quite surprised at first, myself. But when I thought it over, there were actually a number of things going for it...
Lyney: It could have been done as an apology for the incident with Lord Childe, or as thanks for his help in tying the All-Devouring Narwhal down...
Lyney: Furthermore, "Father" did also lend significant aid to Fontaine and Poisson.
Paimon: Well, that's true, but this is a Gnosis we're talking about. Doesn't this seem a bit... irresponsible?
Lyney: I would agree, but I've also heard that... It seems that Monsieur Neuvillette has had a significant change of heart regarding the matter.
Paimon: Huh? So there's some reason for this that only Neuvillette knows about?
Lyney: I suspect you'll have to ask him about that yourself. Ah, yes, speaking of which, I did see him strolling around the entrance to the Fortress of Meropide a while back.
Paimon: Huh. Isn't he real busy and stuff? Paimon didn't think he'd have the time for that.
Paimon: But back to the topic, the Gnosis was given to The Knave, right? What about Childe?
Lyney: They say that he's returned to Snezhnaya to recover from his wounds. I hear that the recent disaster really did a number on his health.
Traveler: Well, I guess I can now call him one of my "war buddies."
Paimon: That's true. When you think about it, we've had loads of run-ins with the Fatui. To think we'd be allied with them this time...
The Knave: So shocked by such a simple switching of sides?
Paimon: Waah! Who—!?
Lyney: "Father"!
The Knave: Well, well, what do you know? Come to the docks to see how my children are doing, and meet the Traveler by chance. Please do not pay my accomplishments in Fontaine too much mind. I would have done them regardless.
Paimon: Are you going to... take the Gnosis back to Snezhnaya?
The Knave: That is our duty as Harbingers, yes.
The Knave: Don't be too preoccupied with "sides." The goal of the Fatui concerns not a single place or person, but the entire world. With such a grand goal in mind, it is inevitable that we must wear many masks.
The Knave: Switching my masks is something I've always done.
Traveler: Will you keep to your position?
The Knave: That depends on many things, no one truly knows what the future holds. What good is honesty if you can't rely on it forever?
The Knave: As for you, I very much look forward to our next collaboration. Good things cannot be achieved alone, and you've proved yourselves to be great partners.
Traveler: Actually, I just remembered something... Please help us deliver this.
The Knave: A Vision? ... Ha, alright. I'll remember to return it. Thank you for keeping it safe for him this entire time.
Charlotte: And that's a wrap for me! ...Huh!? You... You're...
The Knave: Greetings, Miss Journalist.
Charlotte: Ah, um... Hello. If I'm not mistaken, there are diplomatic channels I'll need to report to to take a photo of you...
The Knave: That is correct, so forgive me, but I will not be able to serve as a subject in your article. However, feel free to write as much as you'd like about our dear magicians — and our upcoming rookie talent.
Charlotte: I—I will!
The Knave: The sea breeze is quite pleasant. I shall continue my walk while the weather remains so agreeable. Farewell.
Lyney: Farewell, "Father."
Charlotte: ...She has such an intimidating presence... I didn't even dare to take a picture... Thankfully, I've already wrapped up all of my prescheduled interviews. Thank you all — this'll be more than enough for me to write about, I'm sure.
Lyney: #Don't be too nervous. Why don't you take a Magic Pocket before you go? Here, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you take one too.
Paimon: To move things about?
Lyney: That's right. Funny — I was giving out Magic Pockets when we first met, too, and what do you know? I'm doing the exact same thing right now. So many things have happened, but the Pockets are still the Pockets.
Lyney: I guess this must be "life." We will all follow our own paths, and serendipity will lead you to your fated friends.
Lyney: Alright then. We'll be handing out pockets in some other districts later, so we'll get going now. Have a good day, you two!

## Talk 6

Neuvillette: ...That's what she told me. Whether it would prove useful or not, I wanted to pass that information on to you.
Paimon: The remains... of the Third Descender?
Paimon: So that's what the Gnoses actually are? Paimon just thought that they looked like chess pieces. How could they be a person's remains?
Neuvillette: All the same, assuming that there was no misunderstanding or special metaphor at play, that is what she meant to say.
Paimon: And she said that it would bring "misfortune" and that you should chuck it, which is why you gave it to the Fatui...
Neuvillette: If she speaks the truth, then I would simply be putting Fontaine at unnecessary risk by keeping it here.
Traveler: (A Descender... She mentioned one of them...)
Traveler: I am the Fourth Descender.
Traveler: One, that the Gnoses are related to Descenders.
Neuvillette: I had guessed that you might already be familiar with this concept, but I did not expect you to be one of them.
Neuvillette: That means that the Gnoses, which are exceedingly element-compatible and can even enhance elemental abilities, do indeed come from the Third Descender.
Neuvillette: Hmm, I wonder... Does your body also possess similar properties?
Paimon: Like... Uhh, like being able to use elemental powers without a Vision? That does sorta count as special compatibility, right?
Paimon: No, no, let's not think about this stuff right now. It just feels creepy...
Paimon: #...Comparing {NICKNAME} to the dead Third Descender and all...
Traveler: Don't worry, I won't die so easily.
Paimon: That's what you say, but this topic still feels like bad luck.
Paimon: Once Childe recovers, let's get some more answers out of him — or go look for his Master and get the answers that way!
Neuvillette: I, too, believe it unwise to make too many blind guesses when information is lacking. The same is true of being at court.
Paimon: Alright. Whatever the case, it seems like the crisis here in Fontaine's over for now.
Neuvillette: Yes. All of Focalors' efforts were for this moment as well.
Paimon: But... She sacrificed herself in the end as a god, and she suffered through all those years as a human... Was that really what she wanted?
Neuvillette: ...I suppose that would be the mystery of a god's will.
Traveler: Can you understand the will of the gods?
Neuvillette: I suspect not. But once in a while, I too would guess that if wishes were like the clouds in the sky, they will one day return to the earth as raindrops...
Neuvillette: Life flows like water, and rain is the final answer. The water levels may sometimes tilt one way or another, but the rain falls fairly upon all.
Neuvillette: And what, ultimately, is the difference between the rains that fall upon all of us?
Traveler: And two, that the one who came before me has already died.
Traveler: For me, this information means two things.

## Talk 7

Jurieu: Here are the interview notes. They mention that the flying ship may have many uses in the future, and the journalist asked me what I thought of them...
Jurieu: ...Seriously, how would I know anything about that? Flight is just flight. Whether people want to use a flying ship to broadcast good news or organize weddings is none of my beeswax.
Lourvine: A wedding... Huh?
Jurieu: ...
Lourvine: ...
Jurieu: Why are you looking at me like that?
Lourvine: So, the flying ship can be used for weddings?
Jurieu: I didn't say that. That journalist mentioned it... And what does that have to do with us, anyway?
Lourvine: ...True. What does that have to do with us?

## Talk 8

Sigewinne: *sigh* You know, I'd love to see you in one of Charlotte's photoshoots one day.
Wriothesley: Is that really necessary? Our line of work doesn't really require much photographing.
Sigewinne: It's precisely because we don't need the pictures that they'll have value as keepsakes. You don't really look all that opposed to the idea, you know.
Wriothesley: Maybe I'm just happy that I managed to once again avoid the spotlight. I think this interview went well, either way.
Sigewinne: Yes, you successfully kept prying eyes away by using Mr. Jurieu and Miss Lourvine as shields. Very good.
Wriothesley: You should be happy for them. They have a bright future ahead of them.
