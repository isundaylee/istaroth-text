Traveler: Regarding the treasure...
Fujiwara Toshiko: Ugh, let's not even go there. I took that picture and asked around a bit, but there's nothing special about it. It's really just an ordinary picture.
Fujiwara Toshiko: But that's what I don't get. Why would people go to such lengths to conceal a simple picture?
Fujiwara Toshiko: After unlocking all those mechanisms, that was all we found. In fact, I doubt that this was the treasure I was looking for at all!
Fujiwara Toshiko: Did I read the treasure map wrong or something? Or is something wrong with the treasure map? Where is the real treasure located?
Fujiwara Toshiko: ...Did the Kanjou Commission take it for themselves, by any chance?
