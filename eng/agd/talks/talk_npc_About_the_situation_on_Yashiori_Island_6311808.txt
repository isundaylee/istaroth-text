Traveler: About the situation on Yashiori Island...
Miyazaki Saburou: Hmph. I'd only recently heard of that myself.
Miyazaki Saburou: Although I don't know the exact details...
Miyazaki Saburou: But I do know a thing or ten about those young idiots on Watatsumi Island!
Miyazaki Saburou: They learned nothing of Watatsumi's legacy, even going out and doing such a disgraceful thing!
Miyazaki Saburou: *sigh* If the Watatsumi Omikami praised in our songs heard of their terrible deeds, surely he too would weep in anger and grief...
Miyazaki Saburou: Watatsumi has suffered great humiliation under the rule of the Shogunate, yes... But paying back blood with blood was not Omikami's way.
Miyazaki Saburou: Thankfully, Her Excellency stopped those radicals in time. I only hope that they will learn their lesson and grow up...
