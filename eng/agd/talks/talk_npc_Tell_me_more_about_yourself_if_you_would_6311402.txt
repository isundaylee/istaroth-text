Traveler: Tell me more about yourself, if you would...
Kaida Ryouma: Before serving as an officer here, I used to live on Narukami Island and work for the Kujou Clan.
Kaida Ryouma: Hah... Life is full of twists. Who knew then that I would be fighting against them now?
Kaida Ryouma: I remember the two brothers from the Kujou Clan. They were understanding and very well aware of the commoners' situation. I didn't think they would support this war...
Kaida Ryouma: But now that we are on different sides, there is nothing for us but to do battle.
