Sosi: ...Oh! It's you, Lady Sorush's Yasnapati. If you have any questions at all, I'll make sure to tell you everything I know.
Traveler: About the Khvarena Monument...
Sosi: As you may have noticed, I haven't given up on investigating the Order of Skeptics' documents.
Sosi: Although there had been some discrepancies between the records and the apparent situation...
Sosi: I believe that as long as I look closely enough, the truth will emerge sooner or later.
Traveler: About the Fatui...
Sosi: Thanks to you all, Markozov has already withdrawn his troops.
Sosi: However, the Fatui would never give up that easily...
Sosi: Perhaps it's time for the Order of Skeptics to recruit more capable personnel. At the very least, they should do better than Pyrrho.
Traveler: I won't disturb you then.
Sosi: You're too kind. I'll be continuing with my work then.
