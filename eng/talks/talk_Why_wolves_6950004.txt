Traveler: Why wolves?
Wolfy: Why not wolves? Many a tale has wolves in it, and even the compendium personally burned by Madame Mage had a wolf character!
Wolfy: It is said that the Boar Tribe were once all wild boars, but the boars did bad things, so the master wanted to punish them.
Wolfy: The master took out a rusted set of scales, and told the boars to stack their own things on both sides. If the scales tipped to one side, they could leave.
Wolfy: But the scales were so rusty that putting just a small amount of weight was not enough to move them.
Wolfy: Those boars who placed their heads on the scales became wolves, lizards, and snakes, leaving only their strength. Those who offered their muscles became rabbits, leaping three paces to a bound, instinctively guiding people to treasure.
Wolfy: But there was one boar who placed things evenly on both sides, until the rusted scale broke right down the middle...
Wolfy: And so she became a mute person â€” for she had placed her voice upon the scales as well.
Wolfy: She is also a friend of Madame Mage, and I hear she likes to speak in people's heads!
