# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Dori: Yeah, let's work together and make a big, shiny, golden statue and place it out where everyone can see!
Traveler: So is this your recommendation as my new "renovation consultant"?
Dori: That's right. I've been thinking about what this place is lacking...
Dori: And then it hit me. What's missing is more shiny gold! Hehe!
Traveler: In that case... why don't we make a golden Dori statue?
Dori: Well, if you really insist!
Dori: But maybe we should wait until you can afford the rights to use my image.
Dori: For now, we can start with a simple Mora sculpture!
Dori: Because this place could potentially serve as my base, naturally, it should be to my liking!
Dori: #But let's get one thing straight: This is a collaboration between Traveler and the eminent Lord Sangemah Bay.
Dori: So you better bring your best to the project.
Dori: I prepared all the tools and raw gold a few days ago. Anyway, I'll cover the expenses this time, as long as you perform the labor!
Traveler: Wait... You'll cover the expenses?
Dori: Okay okay, enough idle chitchat.
Dori: Come talk to me when you're ready to get to work.
Traveler: Did I hear that right?
Traveler: How about... we make a shiny, golden Mora sculpture?
Dori: Haha, at long last, my tastes are beginning to rub off on you, my young apprentice!
Dori: Alright, we'll make a Mora sculpture!
