# The Boar Princess (VI)

The Boar Princess and her two wise companions brave an icy wasteland and scale a snowy mountain, where they discover a very mysterious inhabitant indeed...
See how this high-altitude, low-temperature adventure unfolds in volume six of The Boar Princess.
There is some childish handwriting on the title page, which reads: "Daddy, when you get home, you have to read me the one about the snowy mountain too!"
