Traveler: I don't need one. Thanks.
Safie: Whoa, you're confident. If you're that strong, why don't you join the Eremites?
Safie: You'll have a pretty good life if you can handle security jobs or escorting cargos.
Safie: I think Brother Aybak is doing it for our safety, but he always gives us jobs that don't require traveling to the city or facing any danger.
Safie: I can't deny that it's easy, but it's so boring! Even window shopping and counting Harra Fruits would be more interesting than those commissions.
