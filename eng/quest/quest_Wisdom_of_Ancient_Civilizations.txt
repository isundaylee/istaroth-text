# Wisdom of Ancient Civilizations


## Talk 1

Timaeus: Greetings! I am Timaeus, researcher of alchemy. Welcome to Mondstadt!
Traveler: Alchemy?
Timaeus: Alchemy is a craft that has been passed down since ancient times, but it is barely understood in the present.
Timaeus: Its mechanisms are magical and mysterious, completely unlike the principles that shape our understanding of the physical world.
Timaeus: If we can get the hang of this, we should be able to create some pretty awesome stuff!
Paimon: This must be your alchemist's work bench?
Timaeus: That's right. Why not give it a go yourself?
Traveler: I don't know, it sounds complicated...
Timaeus: You'll be fine, the procedure is actually very simple. If you're interested, I can show you the basics?
Traveler: Craft
Traveler: I'm afraid I'll blow something up!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Coooool!
Timaeus: All we are really doing is following the methods of the ancients as best we can.
Timaeus: Much as one who uses a wind glider needs not understand how it was built in order to glide.
Timaeus: The difference with alchemy is that every time I think I finally understand how it's supposed to work, something totally unexpected happens...
Traveler: What other uses does alchemy have?
Timaeus: To be honest with you, I just don't know.
Timaeus: There's a lot of other mysterious recipes I have to research first.
Timaeus: Over the course of your adventures, you should come across some alchemists' notes from ancient civilizations.
Timaeus: And as your Adventure Rank increases, more recipes will become available to you.
Traveler: Thanks for the explanation.
Timaeus: You're welcome. I look forward to hearing more about your exploits!
Timaeus: Well, see you next time. May the wind bring you good fortune on your path ahead.
Traveler: The next time you hear from me I'll be a Paimon-conjuring alchemy wizard.
Paimon: Why are you so obsessed with other Paimons? Do I no longer satisfy your Paimonial needs?
Timaeus: Haha... You two are a fascinating pair I must say.
Traveler: Can you conjure up a new Paimon using alchemy?
Paimon: Hey! You shall have no other Paimon before this Paimon!
Timaeus: Hahaha! Unfortunately my skills are not that advanced.
