# Skirk Voicelines

## Hello
I am Skirk, disciple of Surtalogi, "The Foul." You've proven your strength to me along your journey, and earned the right to speak to me as an equal. Now, let me witness how your fate unfolds.

## Chat: The Abyss
The Abyss is like the world's shadow. It's always there, and it will never perish.

## Chat: Meditation
Where do we come from, and where are we going?

## Chat: Final Destination
All things come to an end, even time itself.

## When It Rains
Nice. I like the rain.

## When Thunder Strikes
However fearsome the lightning may be, its wrath is limited to the realm beneath the clouds. The high heavens above remain clear.

## When It Snows
They say that at absolute zero, everything falls completely still... Compared to that, this is nothing.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
The wind sweeps away everything that clouds our vision.

## Good Morning
Sleep well? Looks like you're back to peak condition. Let's prepare to depart.

## Good Afternoon
High noon isn't a good time for sword practice, so I usually spend these hours in meditation. While hard work is essential, reflection and review are also important to keep you from straying off course.

## Good Evening
Oh... Nighttime already. Time moves so quickly in the outside world — it's all the more important to cherish it.

## Good Night
Get some sleep. I'll be practicing my bladework for a while longer.

## About Skirk: Reading
I bought some old books from Liyue recently. A passage in one of them stood out to me: "The wise man uses his mind as a mirror: Neither grasping out nor drawing in, it receives all yet keeps nothing. In this way, he triumphs over all things, and they can render him no harm."
That's a very enlightened state of mind. At first, I assumed it must have been penned by some renowned martial arts master. But after reading further, it turned out that he was just an ordinary traveler. People surprise me with what they're capable of sometimes. I suppose that's what they mean when they talk about "hidden strengths."

## About Skirk: Bladework
Come rain or shine, victory or defeat, I practice the blade whether I'm in the mood for it or not. Only those with true strength can bend fate to their will.

## About Us: Training
If you ever want to hone your skills, I can take you to the Abyss. You won't be disturbed there, and time will pass at a slower pace. It's an economical way to train.

## About Us: Goals
Perhaps you're right — maybe it will take everyone working together to bring order to the universe. But I can't afford to place my hopes on other people. I have to go a step beyond that, and show them that there really is a way we can get there.

## About the Power of the Abyss
Master taught me how to wield the power of the Abyss, and from surviving Khaenri'ahn research, I learned how to channel that power and make it mimic the elemental energy of Teyvat. The fact that you and I don't need a Vision to use the elements implies that our aspirations do not require the approval of the gods.

## Something to Share
Master tells me he first trained in the traditional Black Serpent Bladework of Khaenri'ah, but by the time he took me on, his style incorporated many techniques from other sources. That is what it means to be a true martial artist: constantly learning and adapting, always testing and overcoming your limits. Otherwise, you will stagnate.

## Interesting Things
During my journey through the stars, I came across a species with completely inverted sensory perception. They'd use ice to warm themselves up, and cool down by the fire. They'd be sweating buckets inside a cold, dark cave, but shiver uncontrollably under the blazing sun. So different from all the other creatures around them, and yet they lived quite happily. That's the miracle of life — unfathomably complex, but at the same time so simple.

## About Surtalogi
Very few people manage to earn themselves a name like "The Foul" and live up to it. I'm sure whoever gave him that name must have truly despised him. Master's certainly done his fair share of disgraceful things, and the fact that he is a former knight who turned his back on the chivalric code doesn't exactly make things any better. And yet, plenty of people still choose to follow him. They're drawn to his strength, composure, and confidence, and the fact that he's candid with everyone regardless of their background. He's not driven by emotion — he's on a mission to become a version of himself that is complete and perfected... That's why he's as powerful as he is. It's also why he's so dangerous.

## About Alice: Promise
As the Sustainer of the World's Borders, she tolerates my presence, but she did make me promise not to interfere too much with this world's affairs. That was fine by me, but I had to know the reason why. She said, many ecologists find it emotionally overwhelming when they observe the animal kingdom and see the predators hunting and the prey fleeing — but they'll never interfere in the process. Instead, they allow the laws of nature to take precedence over their own emotions. In her own words, "some call this being a callous observer, but I think it's merciful at the same time."

## About Alice: Gratitude
On one of the times that we met, she urged me to listen to the voice of my heart, and "learn how to enjoy my present life." She was being sincere and showing she cared, and for that I ought to thank her.

## About Dainsleif
At one time, he was Master's rival. At another, they were best friends, apparently... I had hoped he might give me some more information about Master, but the moment he recognized my style of bladework, he got very agitated and demanded to know Master's whereabouts. I don't want to deal with him. Hopefully I don't run into him again any time soon.

## About Dori
Ah, yeah, the shrewd merchant. She's one of Alice's friends. I occasionally sell rare monster carcasses to her, since I need Mora to get by in Teyvat. She's made a pretty good impression on me so far — never asks about my background, at least. I don't know how fair her prices are, but I also don't care: I only need enough to get by, any extra would be wasted on me.

## About Tartaglia
He's improved — next time we spar, I might even use both hands. Ajax has a lot of talent and he is fearless in battle, which gives him the potential to develop great strength. But I've seen many other bright sparks like him fizzle out before ever reaching their prime. If he truly wants to become the person he dreams of being, he still has a long road ahead.

## About Neuvillette
Lost power is always reclaimed in the end, in some shape or form. But where will this power lead? To a trial? To revenge? Or toward a new future? It's a question that strikes at the heart of his quest to find the meaning of his existence, and perhaps deep down he already has his answer.

## About The Will of the Moon
I once saw the three moons of Teyvat when I was passing through the false sky. Two are utterly destroyed, their lifeless remains drifting aimlessly through space. The one that remains intact shows no signs of life either, but its will has not faded completely. Maybe there's a chance that one day, a glimmer of truth will emerge in the false sky — a truth belonging to this world alone.

## About Nicole
I wonder if becoming human was an evolution or regression to her? How did it feel, witnessing the self-destruction of her species firsthand? I considered asking her these questions when we first met, but... given her personality, I thought better of it. I think I'll just leave her alone to work on her sculptures.

## More About Skirk: I
I spend most of my time training in the Abyss — there's little that deserves my attention on the outside. You've got nothing to worry about with me, though. I mean this world no harm.

## More About Skirk: II
The worst part about training for long periods is managing the physical pain and fatigue. You can use Abyssal power to help ease muscle strain, but that's physically draining too. So, I learned a few stretching exercises instead — they're surprisingly effective. If you find yourself having the same issues, I can teach them to you.

## More About Skirk: III
I met a bard once when I was exploring Mondstadt. He taught me how to play music, then dragged me to the tavern to drink with him. I quickly adapted to the feeling of inebriation, and felt completely fine even as we drank more over the next few days. That bard, though... at some point, I noticed he'd passed out cold in his chair. So I ended up having to pay his bill.

## More About Skirk: IV
Once in a while, I find myself gazing up at the stars. I know it's just a false sky, but I can sense that the creator had a romantic vision of the cosmos. Faced with the unfathomable vastness of time and space, humanity looks to history books to preserve a piece of themselves for the ages, and I think the creator of this sky shared the same desire. To capture a fleeting moment of the universe and make it last forever.

## More About Skirk: V
I never got the chance to learn how to play an instrument from my parents before they died. The one thing I do remember my dad teaching me was that the key to unlock your playing is to "lose yourself in the music." After I got to Teyvat, I bought a bunch of different instruments to practice with, but every time I got lost in the music, I'd forget my own strength. Ended up destroying quite a few instruments that way. After that, I figured I might as well build my own since I clearly needed something more robust. So I gathered some strong materials and built a few instruments from memory. Oh, here, take one. If it comes to it, you can even use it as a weapon and it won't break on you.

## Skirk's Hobbies
In my spare time, I play music from my homeland, albeit on instruments from Teyvat. I once thought that those melodies would eventually fade from my memory as the years went by... but they haven't. It's as if they're etched into my very soul. Every time I'm strumming my guitar, I'm so conscious that this music I'm playing is the last trace of that civilization's existence in the entire universe.

## Skirk's Troubles
I tried writing some poetry once. My mother was a good poet, and I wondered if she'd passed that talent onto me. But nope, whatever I tried, it just wouldn't click. I guess it's just not one of my strong suits. So be it. Poetry isn't gonna help me in battle anyway, so I don't have any real incentive to stick at it.

## Favorite Food
Back when I was training with Master, I'd frequently end up covered in cuts and bruises from head to toe. There was this particular kind of bug — I don't remember what it was called — but he always used to catch some and grill them for me after a session. Said it'd help with my recovery. They were plump little things. You knew they were done on the grill because they'd glow a beautiful golden color. Crispy shell on the outside with savory flesh in the middle... It's been so long that I don't really remember how they tasted, but I do remember I used to love them as a kid.

## Least Favorite Food
Food goes down easier when it tastes good, but even when it doesn't it's still edible. Just don't let anything go to waste.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Not bad.

## Receiving a Gift: II
It's okay.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Ugh... Waste of ingredients. Next time, I'm cooking.

## Birthday
Happy Birthday. I know some people like to throw a huge party, while others prefer a quieter affair. I don't know which kind of person you are, but for me, birthdays are a time to reflect on the past year — sometimes with pride in my progress, other times with profound regret.
...It's probably best not to ascribe so much meaning to birthdays after all. Each place has its own festivals for celebrating the land, one's ancestors, friendship... but your birthday is the one day of the year that is meant just for you. Okay, speech over — once again, I wish you a Happy Birthday, and I hope you keep growing into the person you aspire to become.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Uh... Is that it?

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
An improvement, but it's still not enough for me.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
Strength... There was once a time when I neither possessed nor sought it. But now it's in the palm of my hand, I'm never letting go.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
The universe is vast beyond measure, with stars stretching out into infinity. With that perspective in mind, my pursuit of strength seems like an equally endless journey. So, while I will never stop moving forward, I do try to set milestones for myself along the way. And I've reached a new milestone while journeying with you, because I've grown stronger during this time. That means it's now my turn to train you. The only question is... are you ready?
