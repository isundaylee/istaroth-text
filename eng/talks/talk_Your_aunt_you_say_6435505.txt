Traveler: Your aunt, you say?
Maziar: Yes, she runs a hotel. There's only one in Caravan Ribat, so it should be pretty easy to find.
Maziar: I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
Maziar: I learned a lot with her and I'm getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
Maziar: Even if the Akasha Terminals were still around, that wasn't something they could've taught you.
