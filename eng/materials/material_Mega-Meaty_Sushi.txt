# Mega-Meaty Sushi

Sushi made using barbecued meat. Layer upon layer of meat, thin and tender, is piled up in the same way that earth and stone pack together to form a mountain, with the delicate radish paste forming its snow-capped peak. This dish is not only a feast for the eyes, but for the mouth also.
