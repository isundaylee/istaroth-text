Traveler: Tell me about the Sword Cemetery...
Dr. Livingstone: What the... You've broken the three seals!?
Dr. Livingstone: Then... Does that mean you've defeated all three hilichurl tribes too?
Traveler: Sure does.
Dr. Livingstone: Wow. Such an appetite for action... Such boundless wisdom... Such great strength... I didn't know both of us were adventurers!
Dr. Livingstone: Thank you for succeeding where I did not. But I am going to stay here.
Dr. Livingstone: There are still many mysteries to be solved at this Sword Cemetery.
Dr. Livingstone: As adventurers, it is our duty to unearth ancient secrets. So I shall continue to investigate here!
