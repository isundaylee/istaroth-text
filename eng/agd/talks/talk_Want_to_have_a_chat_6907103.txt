# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Want to have a chat?
Cyno: Sure, I'll even tell you a couple of jokes.
Cyno: Why did the Sumpter Beast cross the road while burdened with heavy goods? To get to Sumeru's "Most Sumptuous Sumpter Beast" bodybuilding competition.
Cyno: Well, what do you think?
Traveler: Huh?
Cyno: Here's another one. Which creature has the worst personal hygiene in all of Teyvat? Cryo Slimes. Why? Because they always bounce on top of the water, and never go in for a bath.
Traveler: ???
Cyno: You don't find that funny at all?
Traveler: Uhh... it's very forced...
Cyno: Okay. Well, never mind...
Cyno: It's really hard for me to tell what jokes someone might find funny.
Traveler: Why are you so eager to tell jokes?
Cyno: It's because I always have this ultra-serious look on my face, and it stresses out the other matra.
Cyno: One time, it hit me that I should try telling a couple of jokes. So I gave it my best shot, and the room fell completely silent, with everyone just staring at me. But then, after a few moments, someone started laughing and said "you call that a joke!?"
Cyno: Then everyone else started laughing. Even though they were all saying that my jokes weren't funny, I could tell that I had lightened the mood.
Cyno: So I thought, even if the jokes aren't funny, at least telling them can still help the others around me feel more at ease.
Cyno: Besides... if I tell lots of jokes, not ALL of them can be bad, surely.
Cyno: I just need to stick to it, and I know that one of them will land... someday.
Traveler: Maybe a little...
Traveler: Is that all?
