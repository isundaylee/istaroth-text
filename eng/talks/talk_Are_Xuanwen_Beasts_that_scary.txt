Traveler: Are Xuanwen Beasts that scary?
Hung Fan: #I've seem 'em with my own eyes! You may be a tough young hero, but don't get cocky!
Hung Fan: The things are practically invulnerable! I've seen my betters using real-deal Iron Points against one...
Hung Fan: They were ruthlessly trying to stick it, but it looked like it was enjoying being tickled.
Hung Fan: If it were me, I wouldn't last half a second before I ended up as a Xuanwen snack!
Hung Fan: If you run into one of those terrible monsters, I'd recommend just taking a detour!
