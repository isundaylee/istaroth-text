Traveler: You seem to have opinions concerning Kameras, huh?
Depierris: Yes... and no. I think that Kameras are excellent, intricate creations that have provided untold convenience to many â€” of that, there can be no doubt.

Depierris: People's imaginations, and the beauty and spirit in their hearts, cannot be directly seized from the natural world. Don't you think so too?
