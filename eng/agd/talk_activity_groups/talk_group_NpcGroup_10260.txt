Li Dang: Wh—What happened? ...Y—You rescued me? Thank you...
Li Dang: Oh! And have you seen my brother? His name is Li Ding, we were climbing the mountain together.
Li Dang: I just hope he didn't get trapped in amber too...
Traveler: He's the one who sent us looking for you.
Li Dang: Phew... so he's safe then...?
Li Dang: Thank you! I will head up to find my brother now.
Li Dang: Here's hoping I don't run into any more amber on the way...
Traveler: He's at the top of the mountain.
Li Dang: He made it to the top? That means he should be okay...
