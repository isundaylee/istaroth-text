Traveler: What were you working as before?
Thurel: I was previously with the Gardes, and later, my technique with a gun saw me join the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for a time.
Thurel: Still later, I switched departments several times. I no longer remember what happened exactly.
Thurel: *sigh* The older I get, the less able I am to remember things that happened recently...
Thurel: The thing that left the deepest impression, surprisingly, was the job I was at the shortest â€” that happened when I was sent underwater as a guard by the Palais Mermonia.
