# The Master of Stars' Deception


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}... Is it just Paimon, or is there something weird about those hilichurls over there?
Traveler: They do give off a sinister energy.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too. We've seen plenty of hilichurls before, and they're always the bad guys... but this is different.
Paimon: Uh-oh, this is right by the Wangshu Inn, too. The guests are in great danger!
Paimon: #Now that we've seen it, if we don't do anything about it, Paimon will feel really guilty... Let's go take care of them, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: They seem unusually agitated.
Paimon: Right! Maybe it has something to do with that sorta... dark energy they're giving off?

## Talk 2

Paimon: These super evil hilichurls are more difficult to defeat than the usual kind, too.
Paimon: Hey, seems like people are gathering over there... Wonder what they're doing?
Paimon: Whoa, see that guy in the mask? He—He scared off all the hilichurls!
Traveler: Could he be an adeptus?
Paimon: Oh, you mean like Xiao? Now that you mention it, this guy's mask is kinda similar to the one that he wears...
Paimon: But the magic he was using seemed even more adeptus-y than Xiao's. Shall we go say hi?
Traveler: Looked like he was using some sort of adeptus art...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ahem. Hello! Allow us to introduce ourselves, this—
Starsnatcher: Please, if you're here to thank me, there's no need. Cleansing the world of evil is the duty of the adepti. Think nothing of it — One certainly doesn't.
Starsnatcher: ...Wait, who are you? One had assumed you were followers, but on closer inspection it seems that we have not met.
Traveler: We're just travelers passing by.
Paimon: #My name's Paimon! And this is my sidekick, {NICKNAME}.
Starsnatcher: One sees. One, too, shall introduce oneself, for it is good manners to comply.
Starsnatcher: Ahem... The one before you is the adeptus, Master of Stars, though one is better known to one's followers as "Starsnatcher."
Starsnatcher: One descended from one's mountain abode to cleanse the world of evil, whereupon fate saw fit that our paths should cross. Now... tell me that which you wish for.
Paimon: Our wishes? Paimon thought that the adepti in Liyue were just really good in battle... You mean you can grant people's wishes, too?
Starsnatcher: Hah... There are different levels of adepti... Are not the stars loftier than the mountains, clouds, and moon?
Starsnatcher: Yet, it is unbecoming of an adepti to boast of one's powers. One would have you first speak to one's followers, and only then make your verdict.
Traveler: We are following the trail of the adepti.
Paimon: #My name's Paimon! And this is my sidekick, {NICKNAME}.
Starsnatcher: Then it is right that our paths coincide. I, too, shall introduce myself, for with good manners to comply.

## Talk 4

Male Believer: Have you seen the Master of Stars in action? His power truly hails from the divine!
Male Believer: I believe that now, there is finally some hope for my ailing father...
Traveler: Tell me about the Master of Stars.
Male Believer: Watching him use his magic is all the proof you need. A true adeptus, no doubt about it.
Male Believer: Not long ago, I sought some medicine from him on behalf of my ailing father. The difference with Bubu Pharmacy's prescriptions was like night and day, I tell you.
Male Believer: Once it was boiled and ready, it gave off this really ethereal mist — seemed pretty adeptal to me! Hm... Could have also been because there was Mist Flower in it, though...
Male Believer: Adepti medicine is surely the most potent. My father will recover soon, I just know it...
Male Believer: Sure, you have to make some sacrifices if you seek help from an adeptus like the Master of Stars — I had to give a few antiques as offerings. But my father's life is worth much more than a few old relics, right?

## Talk 5

Female Believer: Finally, a life full of hope and purpose...
Traveler: What are your thoughts on the Master of Stars?
Female Believer: Oh! Are you believers, too?
Female Believer: After my fiancé upped and left, I cried every day...
Female Believer: But then I turned to the Master of Stars for help. At his suggestion, I started burning paintings of my fiancé and casting the ashes into the ocean at sunrise...
Female Believer: I can't explain it... but it really worked! I know in my heart that he will return. This is not some sort of positive thinking trick... I am certain of it.
Female Believer: I'm so overjoyed that I gave a portion of my wedding budget to the Master of Stars as an offering. After all, if not for him, I wouldn't be getting my fiancé back, in which case I wouldn't need it anyway...

## Talk 6

Mercantile Believer: The Millelith don't really need to do shifts when the Master of Stars is around, do they?
Traveler: What do you know about the Master of Stars?
Mercantile Believer: I'm a merchant, and I had an especially valuable batch of goods that needed transporting recently. So, I asked the Master of Stars if he would make the journey with me, as presumptuous as that was.
Mercantile Believer: Reason being, monsters run a mile as soon as he so much as holds up his talisman. We didn't have the slightest bit of trouble the whole journey.
Mercantile Believer: It didn't come cheap, of course... but then, soliciting the services of an adeptus is a monumental affair — just look at the Rite of Descension! So I can accept it, but I doubt that most from outside of Liyue would be willing to...
