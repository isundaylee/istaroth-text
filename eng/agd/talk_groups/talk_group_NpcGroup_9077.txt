Traveler: How do you like it here?
Yaoyao: Hehe, oh, this is much livelier than my place, but it also isn't quite the bustling hive of activity the wharf is.
Traveler: ...So you like it?
Yaoyao: Of course. Oh c'mon, you don't have to worry about me.
Yaoyao: You see, Master has taught me that "when in an abode, do as the adepti do"... Um, wait, I think it's "the guest should go along with their host"...
Yaoyao: But whatever the case, I love it here!
Yaoyao: I just hope I'm not imposing...
Yaoyao: I—If you don't mind, I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Yaoyao: And... you know, accompany you for a while.
Traveler: ...So it's not lively enough?
Yaoyao: No, no, that's not what I mean.
Yaoyao: This place is just like an adeptus's abode — I feel welcomed and comfortable here.
Yaoyao: It's an honor to be invited over to play.

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Yaoyao: Sure. I love chatting!
Yaoyao: It's always fun, no matter who I'm talking to!
Traveler: No matter who, you say? Such as?
Yaoyao: Well, such as... cranes!
Yaoyao: I encountered a very beautiful crane once while washing radishes by a brook.
Yaoyao: It had many colorful feathers, it was so pretty to look at.
Yaoyao: I called out to it, and to my surprise, the crane could speak!
Traveler: Was that Mountain Shaper?
Yaoyao: Hehe, well, let me give you some hints...
Yaoyao: We really hit it off, and then we shared the shredded radish salad that I made... She also told me a lot of interesting stories.
Yaoyao: Eventually, she declared that we had been fated to meet, and gave me Yuegui.
Yaoyao: She made it using her very own mechanical arts, you know!
Traveler: Oh, so was that Cloud Retainer?
Yaoyao: Bingo! Congratulations, you guessed it!
Yaoyao: Adeptus arts, mechanics... I'm really amazed by her many powerful and practical skills.
Yaoyao: Let's go talk to her together sometime, shall we?
Traveler: Was that Cloud Retainer, by any chance?
Yaoyao: Whoa, you got that without any hints! How did you guess?
Yaoyao: I guess the term "smart cookie" was made just for you, huh? Nice one.
Yaoyao: Aunty Cloud Retainer and I had a great time chatting, and then we ate the shredded radish salad that I made... She also told me a lot of interesting stories.
Yaoyao: Eventually, she declared that we had been fated to meet, and gave me Yuegui.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Yaoyao: Hmm... Are you interested in finches? I think they sing very beautifully.
Yaoyao: And I can sing too, by the way, hehe!
Traveler: Oh, really?
Yaoyao: Yeah! In the past, while my parents busied themselves planting herbs, I would often run off into the hills and forests to play...
Yaoyao: And there was one time I encountered a large finch teaching a smaller finch how to sing.
Yaoyao: The big finch would sing a line, the small finch would follow along, and so would I. ♪ *whistle*~ ♪
Traveler: You should come over to play more often in future!
Yaoyao: Sure, can't say no to that!
Yaoyao: And to thank you for "taking me under your wing," allow me to teach you the song of the finches.
Yaoyao: Don't worry, it's waaaay easier than learning to use a spear!
Traveler: Actually, I use a sword...
Yaoyao: Oh, don't worry, Master taught me this thing called... ah, "understanding by analogy"!
Yaoyao: I want you to see this as just us having some fun, not studying a difficult class or anything.
Yaoyao: So let's do it like this: I'll sing a line, and you'll follow after me.
Yaoyao: Don't sweat the other stuff. I'll make the arrangements!
Traveler: Most fascinating...
Yaoyao: Isn't it? This is what they call, um, "finding joy in the little things"!
Yaoyao: And I wanna share this little bit of joy with you.
