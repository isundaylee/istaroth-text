Traveler: What did Concini promise you?
Nacker: I don't give a hoot about his promises. I just don't want the Institute to terminate the Arkhium research project.
Nacker: Countless people put their hearts and souls into it, myself included. It's just a step away from fruition!
Nacker: If they pull the plug now, all of our magnificent research will have been for nothing!
Nacker: Raimondo, that fool, he's far too conservative! All he cares about is securing his own career. He couldn't care less about the state of the Institute.
