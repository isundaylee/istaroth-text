Traveler: And you are...?
Zayah: Hmm? I'm Zayah. A proud member of the Sangemah Bay business empire.

Traveler: Tea leaves?
Zayah: How did you know? A Liyue merchant named Boyan told me that Chenyu Vale's tea leaves are the most renowned in the land.
Zayah: I imagine that if we promoted Chenyu Adeptea to that big client of ours, he'd love it for sure. Bet he'd order at least 10 boxes...

Zayah: I don't trust it. Fool me once, shame on you — fool me twice, shame on me...
Zayah: I'm going to Liyue personally, and I'll taste it for myself.
