Shiliu: Why won't anything sell...

## Talk

Shiliu: What won't sell?
Shiliu: Jewelry. Even though I brought all of this personally from Mingxing Jewelry in Liyue Harbor. They're the best of the best, I mean, just look at these!
Shiliu: ...You dress funny, are you a traveler? Fair enough... I guess now you're going to tell me that these are no use to you on your travels anyway. Right?
Shiliu: *sigh* ...I totally misjudged this one. I thought I could increase sales by moving into Mondstadt...
Shiliu: Little did I know, people here would sooner spend every last Mora to their name at the tavern than take a look at what I'm selling...
Shiliu: Maybe they just can't afford it? Hmm... I suppose not everywhere is as affluent as Liyue...

## Talk

Shiliu: Tell me about Liyue.
Shiliu: Ah, so you want to know about my hometown?
Shiliu: Liyue has the busiest commercial port in all of Teyvat. There's merchants from all over the world there. Hehe, growing up in a place like that, I knew I wanted to go into business from a very young age.
Shiliu: Have you heard of Lord Morax? The god who watches over Liyue?
Shiliu: At the very least, you should know that the Mora you have there is named after him!
Shiliu: Ah, I haven't been back in a long time. Maybe the reason I can't make any money is because I'm too far away from Lord Morax?

## Talk

Shiliu: Goodbye.
Shiliu: Surprise, surprise. Another no-sale!

## Talk

Shiliu: What do you sell here?
Shiliu: Take a look and you'll see! Top-quality goods at low, low prices, all direct from Liyue.
