# Growing Pains


## Talk 1

Little Lulu: When will it be ready?
Traveler: No playtime today?
Little Lulu: Oh, hello! No, playtime doesn't seem to come at all these days.
Little Lulu: Little Meng's in a bad mood and prefers to sulk by himself, and Little Fei keeps disappearing all the time.
Little Lulu: I asked Little Meng what's wrong, but he wouldn't tell me. They're both acting so strange these days, I honestly don't know what's gotten into them.
Traveler: Welcome to the grown-up world, kiddo.
Little Lulu: Wait, so when you grow up you stop being happy? Then why do Little Meng and Little Fei want to grow up so bad...
Little Lulu: I guess I'll just not grow up, then.
Little Lulu: Anyway, we're getting sidetracked. I actually need your help with something.
Little Lulu: Can you fetch something from Ying'er's place for me? We already talked about it, so she should have it ready by now.
Traveler: My pleasure.
Little Lulu: Yay! Thanks!
Traveler: Ying'er's place, eh...
Little Lulu: I don't know what you're thinking about, but it's not that. I just asked Ying'er to make something for me. And she said she would.
Little Lulu: And now I'm asking you very nicely to help collect it for me.
Traveler: Are you unhappy, too?
Little Lulu: Me? No, I'm okay. But... I do need your help with something.

## Talk 2

Ying'er: Well hello again. Missing me already, huh? What are you here for this time?
Traveler: To pick something up for Little Lulu.
Ying'er: Little Lulu? ...Oh yes, that's right. She asked me to make some perfume for her.
Ying'er: But I'm afraid this isn't the best time... For some reason, since you were last here, my sweet-smelling side services have been in exceptionally high demand.
Ying'er: I've had an enormous number of orders. It's far too many for me to handle alone, especially since I also have the shop to attend to.
Ying'er: On top of that, Lulu's just a child. It would be a little inappropriate to give her the same type of perfume worn by adult women.
Ying'er: So I was racking my brains trying to think of a way to make my perfume more child-friendly. I've now decided on a suitable formula, but I haven't got around to making it yet.
Ying'er: If it absolutely can't wait, expediting it would not be impossible, but...

## Talk 3

Traveler: How does 3,000 Mora sound?
Ying'er: Wow, someone's desperate... Alright then, I will prioritize Lulu's perfume for the sake of our friendship.
Ying'er: I have to watch the shop during the day, though. My personal affairs are best dealt with at night.
Ying'er: Swing by tonight and I'll have everything ready for you.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I can help out.
Ying'er: Not a bad idea. You do have some experience in these matters, after all. Well, you certainly impressed me last time you were here. *giggle*
Ying'er: As it happens, I have some of the necessary ingredients on hand. I'll go set up in Chef Mao's kitchen.
Ying'er: Go pick three leaves of Mint, then extract the essential oil at a Crafting Bench. I'm sure you're still intimately acquainted with the technique?
Ying'er: Bring the Mint Essential Oil to me, I'll handle the rest.

## Talk 5

Ying'er: The perfume is ready. A bespoke variety made with Mint Essential Oil.
Ying'er: Here you go. It's ready for Little Lulu now.
Traveler: Okay.
Traveler: Why Mint?
Ying'er: It counteracts some of the more... hmm, stimulating elements with its neutral scent...
Ying'er: To be honest, I was very surprised to receive an order from Lulu.
Ying'er: It does make me reminisce about being that age, when one has one's first taste of love, oh how it makes the heart flutter... If only I had been a little more worldly wise back then...
Ying'er: Ahem... Anyway, I should let you get back to Lulu.

## Talk 6

Little Lulu: Hi, did you get my perfume?
Traveler: I did.
Little Lulu: Thank you! Ying'er makes the best perfume ever.
Little Lulu: I wonder what Little Meng and Little Fei will do when they smell it...
Little Lulu: I think that however they react, it will be a lot of fun to watch.
Traveler: They're going to love it.
Little Lulu: Hope so. That would be the best.
Little Lulu: Thanks for helping me. I'll go home soon and have a go of my new perfume.
Little Lulu: If it's good, then I can keep using it again and again.
Traveler: Who do you prefer to play with?
Little Lulu: Hmm? I don't prefer either of them... I prefer both of them! Little Meng and Little Fei are both my best friends.

## Talk 7

Ying'er: Why the hurry? I'm afraid being desperate in and of itself can't bring you what you want.

## Talk 8

Traveler: How does 3,000 Mora sound?
Ying'er: Hmm, it seems you can't quite afford it.

## Talk 9

Ying'er: Mint Essential Oil, you got it?
Traveler: How do I make it?
Ying'er: We did it together not long ago, you don't remember? Huh, so you're just as quick to forget as you are to get involved in the first place...
Ying'er: Let me give you a recap then. Go fetch three leaves of Mint, then extract the essential oil at a Crafting Bench.
Ying'er: Bring the essential oil to me, and I will take it from there.
Traveler: What uses does Mint Essential Oil have?
Ying'er: How to put this... it neutralizes some of the more stimulating elements in the concoction.
Ying'er: But more importantly, the scent is a good match for a child like Lulu.
Ying'er: A girl's scent is far more than a purely nasal affair...
Ying'er: This perfume must capture Lulu's youthful lust for life, her wide-eyed innocence... *giggle*

## Additional Conversations

### Additional Talk 1

Ying'er: Mint is an appropriate scent for a child like Lulu.

### Additional Talk 2

Ying'er: Here you are, one bespoke Mint perfume made specially for Lulu by yours truly. You can take it to her now.
Traveler: Okay.
Traveler: What did Lulu want this for?
Ying'er: She didn't tell me, and I didn't ask her.
Ying'er: No girl is without her secrets. Keeping some things hidden, displaying a penchant for tact, it's all part of a girl's charm.
Ying'er: Alright, off you go now, get this back to Lulu.

### Additional Talk 3

Ying'er: I don't know why Lulu would have a need for perfume... But I suppose she is growing up.
