## Talk

Elchingen: Hmm? Ah, hello you two.
Paimon: Hey, Elchingen! Fancy meeting you here!
Elchingen: Congratulations on advancing to the finals. Your duel with Haniyyah and the Ultimate Trial will no doubt be the highlight of this tournament.
Elchingen: Practicing aside, taking a walk is a good way to prepare yourself for the final. It keeps your mind clear and your spirits up.
Traveler: What are you up to?
Elchingen: I just wanted to find a quiet spot to reflect on what I have learned... what you have shown me.
Elchingen: I am now, more than ever, convinced that the relationship between master and servant improves dramatically when the servant is well-behaved...
Paimon: Master? Servant? What does that have to do with us?
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace, then.
Paimon: Huh? Oh, uh... Yeah! We have something super important to tell you next time we meet!
Elchingen: Very well. I shall patiently look forward to it. Best of luck with your preparations.
Traveler: We'll talk next time.
Traveler: All on your own here, I see...
