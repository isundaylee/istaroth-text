## Talk

Emilie: Hello. It's an honor to be invited into your home.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Emilie: It's even better than I imagined.
Emilie: I really appreciate the way this space combines popular aesthetics with your own personal style. Such a pleasant surprise.
Traveler: Got any decoration suggestions?
Emilie: Decorating is not one of my areas of expertise, I'm afraid. Although, I could certainly give you some advice on keeping the place well-ventilated, if you want.
Emilie: The ventilation system I use in my perfume studio is one that I designed myself. As you can imagine, a perfume studio has more stringent ventilation requirements than other indoor spaces.
Emilie: Beyond that, it's worth giving some serious consideration to the position of doors and windows. Of course, these are just suggestions. If you have friends with more relevant expertise, you should ask them, too.
Traveler: Could you recommend some fragrances to suit this place?
Emilie: Hmm... For a place like this, I would recommend an herbal fragrance.
Emilie: It would fit with the overall openness of the space, and bring in some of the earthy notes of the natural environment. Also, considering your occupation, it suits you down to a T.
Traveler: Occupation? You mean, being a traveler?
Emilie: Exactly. From what I've seen, at least, that seems to be your primary occupation.
Emilie: In my experience, travelers who spend a long time on the road have a better memory for scents than the average person.
Emilie: And ultimately, it all stems from the ground beneath your feet — the soil. That's where you spend every step of your journey, from start to finish.
Emilie: Herbal notes capture the essence of the natural environment. They're most suited to people with the deepest connection to the land.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you have time for a chat?
Emilie: Of course. As long as I'm not keeping you from anything.
Emilie: Why don't you pick a topic?
Traveler: Would this place work as a perfume studio?
Emilie: Ah, well, since you asked... Forgive me for being blunt, but I'm afraid not. The scenery here makes it a great place to live. But, it's missing quite a few necessities as far as a perfume studio is concerned.
Emilie: Perfumes have very strict storage requirements. It takes a lot of dedicated equipment.
Emilie: Of course, there's nothing stopping you from bringing the place up to spec. If you did that, it could make a fine studio space indeed.
Traveler: You seem like you're good at focusing.
Emilie: Well, I'd have to agree with you there. It's very true.
Emilie: My work requires a high degree of precision. So, it's a good thing that I excel at staying focused.
Emilie: Staying focused for three to five hours at a time is pretty easy for me.
Traveler: Got any tips for improving concentration?
Emilie: You're not the first person to ask me that question. Some people even believe certain perfumes can help you stay alert or increase productivity.
Emilie: But, unfortunately, that's just wishful thinking.
Emilie: Certain fragrances can have a temporary relaxing effect on people, but long-term exposure to strong scents actually has a negative effect on the brain.
Emilie: If you want my personal opinion, beyond being well-rested and sober, the best way to improve concentration is to minimize exposure to external stimuli.
Emilie: Before you begin a task, you need to remove all distractions and make sure your environment is suited to long hours of uninterrupted work.
Emilie: If you ignore those two factors, you're setting yourself up for failure, no matter what your mental state is.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Emilie: The way you've designed this courtyard is quite ingenious. You could grow all kinds of plants.
Emilie: I'd like to try cultivating some plant specimens — with your permission, of course.
Traveler: Will they be fragrant?
Emilie: Some of them will.
Emilie: But plants that don't give off a strong fragrance are equally important.
Emilie: Some plants don't have a distinct scent of their own, but can neutralize or modify other aromas. So they're often used to fine-tune a fragrance and control the intensity.
Traveler: Sounds almost like an experiment...
Emilie: Well, perfume-making is an experiment, and each ingredient is a different variable.
Emilie: Hence why finding a suitable place to grow those ingredients is so important.
Emilie: The same ingredient will exhibit different properties in different environments. That's true for minerals and animal secretions, as well as plants.
Emilie: It looks like you have the capacity to adjust certain environmental parameters in this marvelous little courtyard of yours. Which means, all different kinds of flora and fauna can grow in an environment suited to them.
Emilie: It's like you have a courtyard-sized petri dish at your disposal. I can think of some other experiments you could run here, too... But those are forensics-related. They have to do with identification and cleaning.
Emilie: And private residences aren't really the best places to run those sorts of experiments. I don't want to ruin the lovely environment you have going here.
Traveler: Sounds kinda cool, though...
Emilie: Haha, then you're welcome to visit my laboratory any time.
Emilie: I heard you're an experienced alchemist, amongst other things? Perhaps we can trade expertise.
Traveler: Great! You're welcome here any time, as well.
Emilie: Thank you! I'll certainly take you up on that invitation.
Emilie: This place is like an amalgamation of all your travels and everything you've experienced in life...
Emilie: Perhaps, one day, a perfume will be made that perfectly encapsulates the unique character of this place.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Emilie.
Emilie: Good Morning. Looks like you're ready to head out for the day.
Emilie: Then, I won't take up any more of your time. Good luck with your endeavors.

Emilie: #Good night, Traveler.
Emilie: By the looks of it, you've had quite a big day today. You should get some rest.

## Talk

Emilie: There are a lot of houses and gardens like this on the outskirts of Fontaine.
Emilie: Bright colors and fragrant flowers always have this way of washing away the exhaustion of travel.
Emilie: Every time I come across something like this on the road, I always make sure to stop and appreciate it for a little while.

## Talk

Emilie: Have you ever heard the saying, "All water in Fontaine converges in the Fountain of Lucine"?
Emilie: Sometimes, I wonder about the water used to wash away the remnants of the dead... Does it carry traces of their resentment away with it?
Emilie: Anyway, your fountain is quite different. The water is so much cleaner without all those coins people throw in to make wishes.
