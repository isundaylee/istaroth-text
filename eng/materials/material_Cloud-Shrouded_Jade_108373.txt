# Cloud-Shrouded Jade

Yun Jin's specialty. This sweet and sticky snack will somehow not affect your throat in any negative way, which is why it's Yun Jin's favorite. The aftertaste is most elegant, not something one would get sick of quickly. Come to think of it... This is quite a decent bit more than she would usually make for herself â€” but who are you to question her kindness?
