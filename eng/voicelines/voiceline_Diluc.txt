# Diluc Voicelines

## Hello
Diluc, of Mondstadt. Not interested in idle chit-chat. If you have things you want to get done, let me know.

## Chat: Relax
Guess we can rest a bit.

## Chat: Knights of Favonius
You should really bring the Knights of Favonius with you next time.

## Chat: Wine Guild
I still have a lot to do at the Guild. How about you take a rest while I go back?

## Chat: Preparation
We should prepare while we can, then make a preemptive strike against the enemy.

## Chat: Planning
Let's take a moment to rest and plan our next move.

## Chat: Warning
Every course of action has its risks. Be careful.

## When It Rains: Umbrella
I don't need an umbrella, but you can use one if you need.

## When It Rains: Cleansing
Rain... If only it could cleanse the corrupt souls of this world.

## When the Sun Is Out
Listen, as long as you stick to your own path, it doesn't matter what Mother Nature throws at you.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Some use the wind's whistling to drown out the sound of their crimes.

## Good Morning
No need for small talk. All that matters is that you were safe last night.

## Good Afternoon
Would you like to try the secret menu?

## Good Evening
Night has fallen.

## Good Night
Alright, see you next time. I'll make sure you leave safely.

## About Diluc
The legend of the "Darknight Hero"? An interesting rumor.

## About Us: Needs
Just say the word if you need anything. For reimbursements, ask Elzer.

## About Us: Proof
You have already proven your determination. Well then, it is now time for you to witness my resolve.

## About the Vision
Visions are a light in the sea of darkness that surrounds those who have lost their way. But for those who have faith, they are little more than badges of conviction.

## Something to Share
Occasionally I'll work the bar at Angel's Share. The tavern is known for being the center of information in Mondstadt.

## Interesting Things
What? Why do you ask? ...It's an owl, quietly watching its prey from the darkness, waiting for the perfect moment to strike... Flawless.

## About Kaeya
Kaeya? You can only trust half of what he says... at best.

## About Lisa
I believe Lisa has the potential to become the most reliable of the knights. If she's willing.

## About Jean: Enemies
Trifling matters can become Jean's greatest enemy.

## About Jean: Responsibilities
Her unparalleled sense of responsibility is the sole reason why she still hasn't found her true calling.

## About Mona
The land of Mondstadt, by the Anemo Archon's grace, is bountiful. I see no need for the harvest forecasts of astrologers.

## About Diona
Diona's attitude towards me is... how should I put it? Rather rigid. I've yet to find the opportunity to speak with her properly. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my family line or— Oh? It's not? She simply despises alcohol? Huh... I never thought I'd come across another bartender like myself in Mondstadt.

## About Varka
Grand Master Varka... While I understand his disposition, I can make no sense of his actions. ...I—I've said too much already. I've long since left the Knights of Favonius. Forget I said anything.

## About Eula
Ah, yes... I've heard about her. She has her own convictions. Her determination to liberate herself from the shackles of her clan is praiseworthy. But, she's... joined the Knights of Favonius.

## More About Diluc: I
You have business to attend to?

## More About Diluc: II
Huh? Knights of Favonius? ...I have nothing to say about them. We have different views is all.

## More About Diluc: III
It's been a long while since I played chess with anyone but my butler. I just so happen to have a moment. Care to play a round?

## More About Diluc: IV
Checkmate! ...Still, it's been a while since someone tested me this much.

## More About Diluc: V
Not bad. Be it chess or combat, you always seem to surprise me. Hm, working with you is quite the novelty. So... I look forward to continuing to work with you, partner.

## Diluc's Hobbies
The artwork in the manor? It's not mine. It's a collection that belonged to my late father.

## Diluc's Troubles
The darkness that seethes with evil, full of demons that must be vanquished, will take more than a blade to be torn asunder.

## Favorite Food
You want to know what's in my glass? It's... grape juice. My drink of choice.

## Least Favorite Food
I don't like alcohol. It's just... I don't like how it feels in my mouth...

## Receiving a Gift: I
Exquisite. Unforgettable flavors.

## Receiving a Gift: II
I can see the chef put their heart into this one. A fine dish.

## Receiving a Gift: III
...Umm, thanks.

## Birthday
Happy birthday. This is an important day for you. So tell me, what is it you wish for? If it is within my power to bestow it upon you, I will give it my consideration.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Power is necessary if we are to meet our objectives.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
What lies in wait for us? I rarely stop to think about it.
No matter what dares to stand in my way, I must press forward.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
I've become stronger... Though it is still not enough, I will always face the darkness.
For dawn to come, there must be those who dare to pierce the darkness with their light.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I used to believe... if I was to stamp out evil, I would have to walk alone in darkness. However, seeing your perseverance, I know I was wrong. Friend... I owe you my thanks.

## Elemental Skill: I
Huh!

## Elemental Skill: II
Hyah!

## Elemental Skill: III
Haah!—

## Elemental Burst: I
Flames, purge!

## Elemental Burst: II
Lay waste to the wicked!

## Elemental Burst: III
Dawn, break forth!

## Opening Treasure Chest: I
Hmph, better than nothing.

## Opening Treasure Chest: II
I suppose this will do.

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
We'll need more where that came from.

## Low HP: I
Is that all you've got?

## Low HP: II
Darn you!

## Low HP: III
You will pay for that!

## Ally at Low HP: I
Careful!

## Ally at Low HP: II
Don't burn yourself out! Retreat!

## Fallen: I
Where did I go wrong...

## Fallen: II
There can be no excuse... for defeat...

## Fallen: III
My flame... has been... extinguished...

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Urgh!

Let's go.

## Joining Party: II
What's our objective?

## Joining Party: III
Let's finish this, swiftly.
