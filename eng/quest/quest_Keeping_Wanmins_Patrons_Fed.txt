# Keeping Wanmin's Patrons Fed


## Talk 1

Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 2

Chef Mao: How many more dishes was that again...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Chef Mao: What am I doing? Why, I'm running Wanmin Restaurant, of course! Haha.
Chef Mao: Things have been getting busy with everyone going out to eat during the Lantern Rite. Even travelers from faraway lands have come to visit and join the festivities.
Chef Mao: Even though my dear Xiangling has returned to help, we're still struggling to keep our heads above water. As a matter of fact, she just went out on a delivery...
Chef Mao: While everyone else has been out hanging lanterns for the festival, we've been too busy to make a single lantern yet.
Chef Mao: If you don't mind, Traveler, could you lend us a hand?
Chef Mao: Do you happen to know Atsuko? She's the girl from Inazuma down by the docks.
Chef Mao: We've prepared her order, so could you please go deliver the food to her? I've even made her extra large portions to celebrate the festival.
Chef Mao: There's also the others who work down by the docks... <color=#00E1FFFF>Wrench Wang, Hammer Li, Guanhai, and Zhihua</color>.
Chef Mao: They're regular patrons here and always look after our business. They seem to still be busy with work down by the docks, even though it's time for the festival.
Chef Mao: I would like to prepare some food to give them, but I'm afraid that we're simply too busy and won't have the chance to leave the restaurant...
Chef Mao: If you could, Traveler, please help me ask them what they would like to eat, and I'll whip up whatever they request.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Chef Mao: Thanks a lot, Traveler. Just come back here and let me know once you've asked them.

## Talk 3

Atsuko: I wonder why my order from Wanmin Restaurant hasn't arrived yet...
Traveler: Here's your order. Enjoy!
Atsuko: Oh, thank you so much! I'd thought that it would still take a while longer before it arrived.
Atsuko: All the festivities for Lantern Rite have been making me feel a little homesick... But I certainly won't be returning to Inazuma any time soon.
Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 4

Atsuko: I wonder why my order from Wanmin Restaurant hasn't arrived yet...
Traveler: Here's your order. Enjoy!
Atsuko: You're here at last. I've been waiting for a while... Still, I'm grateful that you're still making deliveries during the festival period.
Atsuko: All the festivities for Lantern Rite have been making me feel a little homesick... But I certainly won't be returning to Inazuma any time soon.
Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 5

Chef Mao: Did you deliver the food?
Traveler: Yes, we did.
Chef Mao: Great, I knew that I could count on you! Did you also happen to ask Wrench Wang, Guanhai, and Zhihua what they would like to eat?
Traveler: Wrench Wang and Hammer Li would like to have Bamboo Shoot Soup.
Chef Mao: Oh? These two have rather similar tastes, though Bamboo Shoot Soup will take some time to make. I'll have to start preparing it early.
Traveler: Guanhai would like to have Squirrel Fish.
Chef Mao: No problem, that dish is one of my specialties.
Traveler: Zhihua would like to have Lotus Flower Crisp.
Chef Mao: Huh, I never would have guessed that Zhihua would have a liking for pastries and the like. Making Lotus Flower Crisp is straightforward enough, no problem.
Chef Mao: Thanks for going and asking them what they'd like to eat. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. Now, I should get started on all those dishes.
Traveler: Won't you be hanging any Xiao Lanterns?
Chef Mao: Hah! We don't have time for that now, I've got more dishes to make and Xiangling has just gone out on another delivery...
Chef Mao: The two of us can barely keep up with the orders as it is. There's no way we'd have any time for hanging lanterns.
Traveler: I can take care of it for you.
Chef Mao: Yâ€”You'd really do that? I'll leave the lantern to you then. I was just starting to worry that the restaurant doesn't look festive enough without any lanterns.
Traveler: I'll make a Xiao Lantern for you.

## Talk 6

Chef Mao: This Xiao Lantern looks great! I'll be sure to write a wish on it shortly. Once Xiangling gets back, we can release the lantern together as father and daughter.
Chef Mao: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, take these as a token of my appreciation.
