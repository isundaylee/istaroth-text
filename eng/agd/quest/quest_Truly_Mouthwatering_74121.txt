# Truly Mouthwatering!


## Talk 1

Paimon: Those two are pretty strange...

## Talk 2

Unknown Role (None): No, that can't be it...
Unknown Role (None): ...How do you even manage to bury yourself like that?
Unknown Role (None): The latest beauty fad and a very weird attitude... But why did he have to scream and shout then?
Unknown Role (None): They are obviously not taking a walk.
Unknown Role (None): Almost ate Henri's head or the roast chicken!
Unknown Role (None): The skin is grilled to perfection, fragrant and crispy! The sizzling fat inside is releasing a thousand aromatic compounds that speak of tenderness that melts in the mouth! It looks delicious!
Unknown Role (None): Did he shout so that people other than us could hear him? Speaking of such people, they are probably...
Unknown Role (None): Henri is afraid of asking for our help because he is scared of the walker duo. So the reason why the walker duo makes Henri scared is...
Unknown Role (None): ...They were the ones who buried Henri.
Unknown Role (None): I see. Henri wanted to lure the crabs with the roast chicken.
Unknown Role (None): I see. Henri tried to bury the roast chicken with his shovel but ended up getting buried by crabs.
Unknown Role (None): A machine with an unclear purpose. Seems like it's no longer functioning. Is it related to the situation here?
Unknown Role (None): The barrel that the walker duo put around Henri's chest before he was buried.
Unknown Role (None): Almost ate Henri's head or the roast chicken!
Unknown Role (None): The chicken is crispy on the outside and gives out an irresistible oily aroma. Yum yum!
Unknown Role (None): Under such circumstances, the barrel prevents the sand from applying pressure to the chest so that Henri would not be suffocated. Which is to say, the walker duo did not want to kill him. So their true intention was...
Unknown Role (None): But Henri was buried, so he couldn't eat it. Though it feels kinda weird, the roast chicken was placed in front of him because...?
Unknown Role (None): They mentioned "lesson" before leaving. Seems like they wanted to teach Henri a "lesson" by burying him in the sand and letting him see the roast chicken that he couldn't reach. But why?
Unknown Role (None): ...Judging from the clues from the scene, the reason could only be this.
Unknown Role (None): Yes, I see. The walker duo wanted to use Henri to attract crabs.
Unknown Role (None): If it were Paimon, she might've fallen for that.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hello!
Hunter: ...
Turner: ...
Paimon: Hey! Don't leave Paimon in this awkward silence!
Hunter: ...Hello.
Turner: What a beautiful day.
Traveler: About the person over there...
Hunter: What person?
Turner: I don't know the person you're talking about.
Hunter: We're just...
Turner: Taking a walk.
Hunter: Yes, that's right. We are just taking a walk. A walk, taken by us, two totally ordinary people.
Turner: What a beautiful day and what a wonderful thing walking is! Don't you think?
Hunter: Taking a walk is totally normal. I'm sure you understand.
Paimon: Uh... What are you guys even talking about?
Paimon: Did you hear someone calling for help? A man is buried in the ground over there and almost got eaten by crabs!
Hunter: What? Something like that happened where we take walks?
Turner: On such a beautiful day?
Hunter: If he gets eaten by crabs...
Turner: That'll be really funny. Uh, I mean, a real pity.
Hunter: Shame, we won't let this happen. I mean, we can't let this happen.
Turner: If we run into something like this during our walk, we will not be bystanders. I mean, if.
Traveler: What are you guys doing here?
Hunter: Taking a walk.
Turner: Like we said, taking a walk.
Paimon: You really didn't notice anything weird?
Hunter: No, none at all.
Turner: Yeah, none at all. Except that the two of you are interrupting our walk.
Hunter: Taking walks is... very personal. We do not like being interrupted.
Turner: We suggest that you find a good place for walks. The Fountain of Lucine, for instance, is a pretty good place.
Hunter: This is where we take walks. I mean, where we feel the nature.
Turner: That's why we don't want to be interrupted. Goodbye.

## Talk 4

Hunter: Hello.
Turner: We are taking a walk.
Hunter: And we hope that you will not interrupt our walk.

## Talk 5

Henri: ...Don't doubt me! I buried myself with my very own hands! This is the latest beauty trend!
Paimon: #Uh... Traveler, any thoughts?

## Talk 6

Turner: Hmph...
Henri: *sigh* I have done noth— I... This is the latest beauty trend...
Paimon: Waah! When did you...
Hunter: We are taking a walk. Taking walks... is a form of exercise.
Turner: Exercise involves movement. Movement is what brought us here.
Traveler: Did you do this?
Hunter: So what if...
Turner: #Oh, Hunter, I remember now. Take a good look at him.
Hunter: ...
Hunter: That's the person he told us not to mess with.
Turner: Right, right.
Paimon: What are you whispering about?
Hunter: Nothing. We are just taking a walk.
Turner: That's right. We are just taking a walk. If there's nothing else, we'll...
Hunter: Keep walking and walk to other places.
Henri: Wait, don't you have to do anything scary to me anymore?
Turner: The lesson has been learned, if you know what I mean.
Traveler: What lesson?
Turner: Nothing. I mean, roast chicken is dangerous. It invites trouble. See it as a valuable lesson. Let's go.
Hunter: But, roast chicken is... Debord...
Turner: Forget the roast chicken! We should continue our walk.
Black Screen Text: "We'll ask Sonny to treat us to roast chicken next time."
So says Turner as he walks away with Hunter.
Henri: Thank you! Thank you so much! I knew you'd understand!
Paimon: #Seems it is exactly like what Traveler said... Let's help Henri out!
Paimon: But digging you out is a really exhausting job! So Paimon will take the roast chicken as payment!
Henri: Huh? Ugh... Alright, fine!
Black Screen Text: It takes you a while to help Henri out of the sands and take the barrel off him.
Black Screen Text: You start enjoying the delicious roast chicken with Paimon.
Henri seems as if he is about to drool, but he holds back the desire to have a share to keep his promise and maintain his dignity.
However, seeing Henri trying really hard to look unaffected, Paimon offers to share the roast chicken with Henri.
The chicken is crispy on the outside and gives out an irresistible oily aroma. Yum yum!

## Talk 7

Henri: ...What? So they didn't intend to kill me at all!
Henri: *sigh* You guys are really observant. That's right. I was the one who broke the machine!
Paimon: But why did you break the machine?
Henri: Hmph, why indeed! Because...
Henri: A long time ago, I lived a poor and miserable life. I was really depressed. Then, I met a guy who gave me a healthy drink that lifted my spirits.
Henri: He was really kind to me. So I wanted to pay him back for his kindness. One day, I had my chance. He introduced me to some very rich people and asked me to help them.
Henri: All I did was menial work, such as collecting mechanical parts that belonged to the Fontaine Research Institute. The rich people paid me a pretty sum for those chores.
Paimon: Whoa, sounds pretty awesome.
Henri: Right? This time, they asked me to find this strange machine, take the core out, and deliver the core to them. I can both repay my bro and make some money. I've gotta give my all!
Henri: But, those terrible people... Perhaps they hated seeing me working hard to change my life for the better. They interfered with my work and warned me against delivering the— umm, precision components to my employers!
Henri: But I wouldn't let them win! I took the job, and protested against their behavior!
Henri: And as a result, like you said, I was taught a lesson...
Paimon: Oh... Poor you... But is this job of yours really so well-paid?
Henri: Of course. This is one of the reasons why I didn't want to tell you why I'm protesting. However, since you saved my life...
Traveler: Not as much as saving your life, I mean...
Henri: ...I also thought that since you two are really observant, I might as well just tell you the truth. You can see it as a collaboration.
Henri: Such strange machines have been deployed above ground and underwater. It's easy to spot such machines — they all produce a peculiar light around them.
Henri: Handle it for me and bring me the specific core inside it. There should be *seven* in total. After it's done, we'll split the earnings fifty-fifty. Deal?
Traveler: Sounds good.
Paimon: Hmmm, but what do these machines do?
Henri: They destroy the environment. These machines are evil stuff.
Paimon: Destroy how?
Henri: How am I going to know? I'm not a member of the Fontaine Research Institute. Anomalies have already occurred, so it has to be hazardous to the environment!
Paimon: Well... That sounds reasonable. Every time we see any supernatural environment during our adventure, there's bound to be some trouble that we have to deal with...
Paimon: #Traveler, why don't we help Henri?
Henri: Haha, great! It's settled then! *Bring me seven cores*, let's become rich together!
Traveler: What do these machines do?
Traveler: I take 70% of the earnings and 20% must be paid in advance.
Henri: Ugh, fine. But I really can't give it to you in advance. I'm still waiting for everything to be done so that I can get paid!
Paimon: Hmmm, but what do these machines do?

## Talk 8

Henri: Freedom! Ahhh, the sweet taste of freedom! Though not as satisfying as roast chicken is, freedom sure is sweet!
Paimon: ...So, what does the board that you are holding stand for?
Henri: Hm? Oh, this. It represents protest, of course.
Traveler: Against what?
Henri: Hmm... How should I put this... Th—They are the ones who buried me. They did it to stop me from working hard, which is why I want to protest!
Paimon: Wait, why do they want you to stop working hard?
Henri: ...
Henri: Can you keep a secret?
Paimon: Of course! Your secrets are safe with Paimon!
Henri: Then yours are safe with me, too. But I'm afraid I can't tell.
Paimon: Hey! Are you making fun of Paimon!?
Traveler: Let's talk about something else, then...
Paimon: Okay... What's with the barrel you were wearing? Is that a form of protest as well?
Henri: Huh? That I don't know... Before they buried me, they put this barrel on me — a deed born of their twisted tastes, I'll wager.
Paimon: And why did you end up buried by them?
Henri: Because they are terrible, terrible people! They just grabbed me for no reason at all and buried me in the sand! They wanted me dead!
Traveler: No reason at all, huh? Really?
Henri: O—Of course! Didn't you see? I was literally buried in the sand!
Henri: If they didn't want me dead, why else would they do it?
Paimon: #Hmmm... That makes sense... Traveler, what do you think?
