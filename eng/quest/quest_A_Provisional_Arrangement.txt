# A Provisional Arrangement

Huai'an: We've got to repair those stairs quickly...
Traveler: You the innkeeper?
Huai'an: I am. What can I do for you?
Paimon: Some guy downstairs asked us to give this package to you.
Huai'an: Oh, this must be a package that a guest sent to me. Why didn't Zhen Qiang bring it up himself?
Huai'an: Still had goods to pick up, did he? Ha, I bet he was just too lazy to go up and down the elevator...
Huai'an: I'm really sorry. You're a guest of ours, and the stairs just had to be broken at this time. I'm finding a way to fix it as we speak.
Huai'an: And to think that we made you take the trouble to bring this package up for me. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.
Huai'an: This was originally for Zhen Qiang, but since he made you deliver the package for him, then the pay is yours by right.
Huai'an: Well then, I must be going to get the preparations for repairs going. Feel free to have a look around the inn. If there's anything you need, you can look for me at any time.
