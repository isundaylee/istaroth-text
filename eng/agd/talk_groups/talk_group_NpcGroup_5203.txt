Lanoire: It's too bad Cater isn't here! If he was, he could enjoy this with us too!
Earnshaw: Even if Cater was here, you still wouldn't be allowed to drink any more Fonta today.
Lanoire: Awww... But Cater said, you have to share with others to be even more happy!
Earnshaw: I'm sure Cater also said not to have too much sugar and to brush your teeth after eating.
Lanoire: Oh... He did mention that...

Traveler: Cake?
Lanoire: Oh, I was just wondering what flavor of cake I should make for Cater's birthday!
Lanoire: ...Because now that I think about it, Cater always gives me food, but I don't know what he likes to eat.
Lanoire: Does he like Bulle Fruit? Or Sunsettia? Actually, since he's that color, maybe he likes Mint?
Lanoire: #But, more importantly, I've gotta find Cater. Wait for me to grow up, Mr. Traveler, and we'll go look for him together.
