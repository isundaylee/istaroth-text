Fusilier: This should all be written up and reported back to the Institute...

Traveler: What do you have to report?
Fusilier: Changes in the local hydrological environment, the way those meka operate in the wild, and... some residual Arkhium energy flow.
Fusilier: I think these energy flows are just remnants from the explosion. Some shattered Arkhium crystals were washed down here, but it's not like there's anything serious going on.
Fusilier: But just to be on the safe side, I'll compile a report and send it back to the Institute.
Fusilier: ...But I don't want to set foot in the Fontaine Research Institute ever again, if I can help it.

Traveler: Your thoughts on the Fontaine Research Institute...
Fusilier: I have no opinion or views on the Fontaine Research Institute now.

Fusilier: I'm tired now though, and happy with ordinary data collection work.
Fusilier: I have absolutely no aptitude for research.

Traveler: Who says you don't?
Fusilier: Edwin, he... Edwin Eastinghouse said it himself.
Fusilier: He was my superior, and the one who decided if I had any aptitude or not!

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Fusilier: I... I don't want to go back to the Fontaine Research Institute. But you gotta have somewhere to stay, right?
Fusilier: I can't go beg for a place to stay in Lumidouce Harbor, and I don't want to stay at The Rusty Rudder. So... the Institute helped me get in touch with Chaussivert, who is letting me stay on his ship for a while.
Fusilier: It's only temporary. I'll be outta here as soon as I find somewhere proper to live.

Traveler: Are you used to being here yet?
Fusilier: ...It's great. Staying on the ship means that at least no one's gonna suddenly turn up and cause me trouble.
Fusilier: However, apart from the Institute I don't think anyone else would contact me.
Fusilier: I just hope that every night from now on will be quiet and undisturbed.

Traveler: About Chaussivert and Lemarcq...
Fusilier: When I'm staying on the ship, they go to another cabin and don't bother me.
Fusilier: I always bring some snacks and drinks as gifts when I come... I don't like drinking alcohol, and don't like seeing other people drunk.
Fusilier: But, speaking of alcohol... I haven't seen a single bottle on board this ship. I asked Lemarcq, who just said that everything's already been drunk.
Fusilier: But with Chaussivert around, will the wine racks on this ship really stay empty? It's strange...
