Traveler: Tell me about the lift...
Grosley: It stops at 4 different levels. Level 1 is the main aquabus station hall, and the highest one leads straight to the Palais Mermonia.
Grosley: We are presently at Level 2. Before us is the Clementine Line, which links Romaritime Harbor with the main station. The third level, for its part, is the Navia Line, which leads to Erinnyes.
Grosley: A lot of travelers get the floors mixed up, so be careful now.
