Traveler: What kind of arrangements?
"Tilla": Ho! What else could our business be? Making Mora! Getting some perks! And lining our pockets! In any case, one shouldn't waste their life doing nothing.
"Tilla": Hehe, if you're interested, I'd be honored. Once I've drafted up an agreement, I'll pick a suitable time to visit you.
"Tilla": I think this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
