# Missing title (4056892191)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh, the projection is actually at the center of the stage.
Paimon: What are those two doing? One seems to be talking and the other is sitting on the ground.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon knows! She must have been telling the person sitting on the ground a story before they went to bed. That's the kind of picture this is!
Traveler: Do Fatui listen to bedtime stories too?
Paimon: You never know.
Paimon: Agafya, Persikov has ordered us to perform some signal reception tests. Looks like all four of us have to go... Chevka will probably get mad at me.
Paimon: Come on, Yakov, orders are orders, Chevka isn't going to blame you for them!
Paimon: ...You know what, if you're that scared, I'll go with you to talk to Chevka, alright?
Paimon: Huh, so she wasn't telling a story after all...
Paimon: But this snippet just kinda comes outta nowhere. We can't tell what's going on at all...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Seriously? That conch just floated up from inside the well...
Traveler: Well, it is being affected by the Mirage...
Paimon: #That's pretty amazing. Ooh, look, {NICKNAME}! Someone's bending over... Ah!
Paimon: #Don't move, {NICKNAME}, behind you...!
Traveler: Uhh, should I be very concerned...?
Paimon: Oh, wait, no. It's just the image projected from the conch. It just appeared behind you so suddenly...
Paimon: Two signal testing sets...
Paimon: You know, I honestly thought that he was in serious trouble this time. Who knew this was just about being assigned slightly more annoying work! So yeah, that was a relief.
Paimon: Hah! You should have seen how afraid he was of getting scolded by you. It was almost like watching a little brother cower at the thought of his older brother scolding him. Y'know... do you think he's just afraid of disappointing us?
Paimon: I mean, we're just squad-mates... but it does sometimes feel like we're family as well...
Paimon: Family, huh...
Paimon: Um, Paimon gets the feeling that we just eavesdropped on something we really shouldn't have...
Paimon: To be honest, these Fatui don't seem all that bad...
Traveler: This isn't the time for pranks, Paimon!
Traveler: There was probably a pocket of air inside the shell...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, looks like those two people are lying on the ground... Are they stargazing?
Paimon: To be honest, this image seems a bit weird...
Paimon: Yakov, what did the commander say to you that's got you so down?
Paimon: Well, the waves were really choppy, so I slipped and fell while carrying the device. Fortunately, I was quick enough to save it...
Paimon: But the commander still gave me an earful and ordered our squad to do signal reception tests. I mean, ugh, that's the toughest job around...
Paimon: Oh come on, don't feel so down. We've done this stuff a hundred times before. Hey, chin up! Go get yourself something to eat!
Paimon: They're pointing towards something high up. Are they looking for something to eat?
Paimon: Wait, is this conch crooked somehow?
