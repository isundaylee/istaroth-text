# The Seeker of a Meteor Shower


## Talk 1

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Have you packed all your things? Make sure you've brought the onigiri and rice cakes your mother prepared.
Yoimiya: Don't worry, I have them all! They're going to last me days!
Yoimiya: Take care of yourselves while I'm out, and make sure you remind Mom to take her medicine on time.
Yoimiya: If running the store gets a bit too much, take some time off and wait for me to return.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, Yoimiya, your mother and I got so worried when we heard that you were going so far abroad.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: We've never left the country, so we don't know how outlanders might view us Inazumans, or if they'd even be willing to speak to us...
Yoimiya: Oh, relax! Outlanders are friendly and warm!
Yoimiya: Look at Thoma from the Yashiro Commission. He's originally from Mondstadt, but everyone thinks he's a top-tier guy!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: A mop-tier? What mop? Oh, do you mean the broken one at home? I just fixed it today, actually.
Yoimiya: No, I said "top," not "mop"! You know, Thoma even sent us some wine from his homeland not too long ago.
Paimon: We haven't heard this kind of friendly banter in a while, huh?
Yoimiya: Oh, hey you two! It's been a long time, hasn't it?
Traveler: You're as peppy as ever.
Yoimiya: Hehe, I'm excited because I'm going on a trip soon!
Yoimiya: Many things have changed. Lots of outlanders have come to Inazuma, and lots of Inazumans have gone out as well.
Yoimiya: You two have been adventuring all over Teyvat, so you might not be able to understand, but for us, this is a long-awaited chance to go out and fulfill our dreams!
Paimon: That's right, the Sakoku Decree is gone.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ah, I remember you two. You're Yoimiya's friends, yes?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Word of your incredible accomplishments has spread throughout Inazuma. My daughter's a big fan of yours — she said she'd love to be like you two.
Yoimiya: Hehe, c'mon, Dad... Who's never dreamed of becoming a hero?
Traveler: You've done some heroic feats yourself.
Yoimiya: Aw, thanks, but I'm just your average artisan. The quiet life suits me better.
Yoimiya: But if an opportunity presents itself, why not try to show your stuff, right?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Alright, did you two come over today to order some fireworks?
Yoimiya: Oh! Sorry, sorry, I got carried away.
Yoimiya: While I'm gone, Dad's in charge of making fireworks. You've seen how skilled he is, so there's nothing to worry about.
Paimon: Oh, no, we aren't here to do business or anything. We just happened to be passing by!
Yoimiya: Oh, so we're all here with time to spare. What a treat!
Yoimiya: In that case, let's chat some more! I'm not in a rush, anyway.
Paimon: Sure! So, where are you planning to go?
Yoimiya: No clue!
Paimon: Huh?
Yoimiya: Hahaha! I say that, but I do have a travel goal: to see Teyvat's grandest meteor shower.
Yoimiya: But I don't know when or where it'll happen, so I figured I can search while I travel.
Paimon: ...That's it? No details? Nothing?
Yoimiya: Not right now, since this meteor shower was originally something like a family legend.
Yoimiya: A long time ago, the Naganoharas were inspired to create new fireworks after watching such a meteor shower.
Yoimiya: Dad says that inspiration is a combination of what you see and what you know. Different people can see the same thing but have different thoughts.
Yoimiya: Inazuma today is completely different from how it was in the past. If I can see this meteor shower, I'm sure I'll be able to come up with a new kind of firework.
Traveler: Meteors and fireworks...
Yoimiya: I know, right? Of course, my main reason is that I want to go and look outside Inazuma, hehe.
Paimon: No need to be shy about it! You gotta play hard when you get the chance!
Yoimiya: You know, you're right, Paimon! Is it just me, or have you gotten wiser since we first met?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon loves being friends with you since you say such nice things!
Traveler: Since you're going out to play regardless...
Yoimiya: Sumeru... I've heard of it. It has a ton of trees, a super impressive school, and a massive desert!
Traveler: There's also a division of the school that specializes in studying the stars.
Paimon: Yep, and everyone there is really smart, so Paimon's sure you'll get some answers from them about the meteor shower!
Yoimiya: Really? But, won't research people make fun of me or something if I ask them about a legend?
Paimon: We won't know if something's real or not unless we ask! Don't worry, we've got solid connections in there!
Paimon: #Well, {M#he}{F#she} does, anyway...
Yoimiya: Wouldn't I be taking up your time, though? I doubt this was in your schedule...
Traveler: It's fine. This way, your parents can be at ease.
Paimon: Exactly! Relax, Yoimiya. You've helped us plenty of times before.
Yoimiya: Haha, alright! Then I accept your offer! Let's have some fun in Sumeru!
Yoimiya: Dad, you can have more peace of mind now that I'm traveling with them, right?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Hm? Ah, yes, your mother and I will be much more at ease.
Yoimiya: Remember, you two also need to take care of yourselves! I'll be back soon.
Yoimiya: Okay, let's head to Ritou and catch a boat there.
Traveler: I'll be your guide.
Traveler: Why not make Sumeru your first stop?
Traveler: They do have some similarities.

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: You board a passenger ship bound for Port Ormos, enjoying the lovely ocean views along the way.
Yoimiya: Yoimiya listens with rapt attention as you tell her of the events following the Vision Hunt Decree and of your various adventures in Sumeru.
Yoimiya: The long voyage ends before you know it...
Yoimiya: Wow, so this is Sumeru?
Yoimiya: That tree's huge... Is the port built on top of it?
Yoimiya: And this place is amazing! It's way bigger than Ritou's port! There are also a lot more stores here.
Paimon: Oh, there's more cool stuff for you to see, don't you worry!
Traveler: Port Ormos also took my breath away when I first arrived.
Yoimiya: This place is awesome! I had heard people describe it, but nothing beats seeing a place for yourself...
Yoimiya: If I hadn't seen the port with my own eyes, I could never have imagined such a place.
Yoimiya: So, the school you were talking about... the Akademiya? Is it here?
Paimon: Nope. We have to head north from here and follow the river to reach Sumeru City.
Yoimiya: Sumeru City, huh... I guess it's even more impressive than here?
Traveler: They each have their own highlights.
Yoimiya: Looking forward to it! Heehee, I'm so excited!
Yoimiya: Whatever the case, why don't we go to Sumeru City?
Yoimiya: Oh, I'm so excited that I don't even know what I should be doing anymore!
Paimon: The important thing about going on a trip is to enjoy yourself! You don't have to think so hard.
Traveler: How about we walk around here with you?
Yoimiya: I'm just worried that if we don't get down to business soon, I'll take up too much of your time.
Yoimiya: Hehe, but if you insist... then let's look around!
Traveler: The city has an even bigger tree.
Yoimiya: Even bigger!? Oh, I wonder if it's as grand as Sangonomiya Shrine...
Traveler: It's a land of neverending theses.
Yoimiya: The...ses? Um, I don't know much about them, but they sound like something that's a cause for serious anxiety.
Traveler: Welcome to Sumeru.

## Talk 3

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Stay safe and have fun!

## Talk 4

Fayez: Welcome to Acara Crafts! Feel free to have a look around.
Yoimiya: Wow, what are these? They're so cute!
Fayez: This is our current best-seller, the Aranara Carving.
Fayez: Their designs are based on the fairy tales that circulate amongst children, so they're very popular with them.
Fayez: Miss, are you from Inazuma? This would be a great gift for you to bring back home.
Yoimiya: Ooh, I know about Aranara! You two told me about them on the ship. I didn't think they'd be so cute! No wonder the kids like 'em.
Yoimiya: Ooh, they're all so pretty. Lemme take a better look...
Paimon: Paimon knew Yoimiya would like this kind of thing.
Paimon: But even she might have a hard time seeing a real Aranara...
Traveler: They don't like being disturbed.
Paimon: Yeah... Sorry Yoimiya, but we need to keep our promise to the Aranara.
Paimon: That said, Paimon doesn't think Yoimiya would mind too much.
Paimon: Her world's already chock-full of imaginary creatures.
Yoimiya: I think I'll get this one... ooh! That one, and the other two that you showed me earlier.
Paimon: Eh? You're buying that many?
Yoimiya: Yep! I'm going to give them out to Saika and the others. They're going to love them! Oh, and these carvings can also be used as prizes in matches against the Arataki Gang.
Yoimiya: They'd also look great lined up by the window. Think about it — you wake up, and the first thing you see are these adorable critters.
Yoimiya: Wouldn't they brighten up your entire day?
Traveler: Let me cover some of the cost.
Yoimiya: Hehe, okay, thanks! In that case, you take your pick, too.
Traveler: I'll go with this one.
Paimon: ...For some reason, Paimon thinks it kinda looks like you, Yoimiya.
Yoimiya: Now that you mention it, it kinda does!
Yoimiya: "Hello, Nara Paimon. My name is Aramiya!" Plip-plod, plip-plod.
Yoimiya: Is that how they talk? Hope I remembered correctly, hehe.
Paimon: That was really good! Wow, great memory. We only talked about Aranara that one time on the boat.
Yoimiya: That's because they're so interesting! I'm pretty good at remembering those kinds of things.
Traveler: Could you please package these up for Aramiya?
Fayez: Of course. Thank you for your patronage!
Fayez: You all are an entertaining bunch. I hope you enjoy your time here in Sumeru!
Traveler: They start your day on the right foot.
Traveler: That's why we told her they're from fairy tales.

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: Wow, this market is even busier than the one in Port Ormos.
Paimon: This is Treasures Street. Up from here is the Akademiya... Oh! And in that tree trunk is the Grand Bazaar. They're both pretty special places.
Yoimiya: I just saw a group of people come down, and they were all wearing the same outfit. Is that the Akademiya's uniform?
Paimon: That's right. They also wear hats with different designs, depending on which Darshan they're in.
Paimon: For example, we'll be looking for someone from Rtawahist. They know a lot about stars and stuff.
Yoimiya: Does this mean that you need uniforms like those to get in and out of the Akademiya?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon doesn't think so...
Traveler: Is something worrying you, Yoimiya?
Yoimiya: Um, won't we stick out if we go in like this?
Paimon: So even you get shy, huh?
Yoimiya: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's pretend you're an Akademiya student, hard at work.
Yoimiya: Then in comes a bunch of outlanders in strange clothes who gawk and run around everywhere...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon kinda gets what you mean.
Traveler: We'll be a bit distracting, won't we?
Yoimiya: I don't think we have to be too self-conscious, but it's still something to keep in mind.
Yoimiya: Why don't we look around here first? I've been wanting to see the "Zubayr Theater," anyway.
Yoimiya: As for the Akademiya... let's go once I get myself a set of Sumeru-style clothes.
Paimon: Alright, but Paimon thinks you're overthinking it.
Traveler: We'll find you a good tailor later.
Paimon: Nilou might have some good recommendations!
Yoimiya: Hehe, sounds good. If we can watch a performance of hers while we're at it, that'd be even better!
Yoimiya: Alright, I'll be looking around here. I'm leaving the meteor shower inquiry to you two. Thanks a lot.
Paimon: No problem! We'll be right back.
Traveler: We might even attract the matra's attention.

## Talk 6

Paimon: We said we were gonna find someone from Rtawahist, but now that Paimon thinks about it, no one really fits the bill...

## Talk 7

Yoimiya: Thanks so much! If it weren't for your help, I would've gotten lost already.
Avin: It's no problem. I'll be heading home, then.
Yoimiya: Just a minute, wait! This is for you.
Yoimiya: This is an Aranara Carving I bought in Port Ormos. I heard it's very popular with kids, so here, have one.
Avin: It's alright, I didn't do much, really...
Yoimiya: It's fine, take it! C'mon, just look at its big, happy smile!
Yoimiya: You can display it at home or hang it on your wheelchair. It'll cheer you up.
Yoimiya: That might sound silly to you... Like, why do you have to be happy just because it is?
Yoimiya: But that's the magic of a smile. If you don't believe me, try it. Look at it a few times every day, and you'll understand.
Avin: ...Actually, I feel like I already do. You love talking, and you love smiling, too.
Avin: I just don't understand why you're so... positive. I've never met anyone like you before.
Avin: Sorry, I'm not very good with words. But since you say so, I'll accept your gift.
Yoimiya: Want me to take you home?
Avin: It's okay, I can head back myself.
Black Screen Text: The child in the wheelchair leaves.
Yoimiya: Oh, great timing, you two!
Paimon: Who was that kid?
Yoimiya: Oh, her? Her name is Avin. I saw that she was looking quite forlorn, so I wanted to make sure she wasn't feeling left out or alone.
Yoimiya: She was pretty shy at first, but I explained that I just arrived in Sumeru and had gotten lost, so I needed someone to help guide me...
Yoimiya: She agreed and we made our way back here.
Yoimiya: There were so many paths here, and they're all twisty-turny and up and down... It's hard navigating through them all.
Traveler: Did she tell you what's on her mind?
Yoimiya: No, she didn't want to talk about that, and I didn't ask. I get the feeling that it'll bring up some unhappy memories.
Yoimiya: But if I had to guess, it's probably because she hasn't been able to explore the city for quite some time...
Yoimiya: All she said was that she's sick and doesn't know when she'll get better.
Yoimiya: Whenever we passed by busy crowds, she kept turning her head and taking in all the things around her. At first, I thought she was afraid that someone might bump into us...
Yoimiya: But when I caught a glimpse in her eyes, I only saw yearning, and a deep sense of loss.
Paimon: It's hard to not be down when something like that happens to you.
Yoimiya: At first, she didn't really want to say anything to me at all — she just gave me yes and no answers.
Yoimiya: But what I really saw was just another child, and asked all the same things everyone else did, about rugs, spices, cooking, and the differences between here and home.
Yoimiya: Eventually, I think I earned her trust. Hehe, there were many things that she liked in the city after all.
Yoimiya: I say that, but honestly, you two probably caught the majority of what she said.
Traveler: She had already relaxed her guard around you.
Yoimiya: Gotta start somewhere. Oh, by the way, did you guys learn anything about the meteor shower?
Paimon: You bet we did, big time! You're in luck, Yoimiya — you'll be able to see the meteor shower from Sumeru!
Yoimiya: Really!? Haha, that's great! If I had gone looking for it myself, I'm sure I would've missed it.
Traveler: Well, not necessarily.
Yoimiya: Huh? What do you mean?
Traveler: Meteor showers appear in response to people's wishes.
Yoimiya: They respond to wishes? Huh. I've never heard that one before...
Yoimiya: So it's not that you wish upon shooting stars, but that wishes summon them?
Yoimiya: Hehe, in that case, I was born ready! Don't you worry!
Paimon: Are you talking about how you want to use the meteor shower as inspiration for fireworks?
Yoimiya: That's why I'm here, but I wouldn't call that my wish. I don't think that alone will call the stars down for us, right?
Paimon: Uh, yeah, that makes sense.
Paimon: (Wow, she's adding her own spin onto this...)
Yoimiya: If that's the case, then we'll have to "practice" wishing a little.
Yoimiya: Can you two come with me? Let me put my thoughts together, and tell me if you understand.
Yoimiya: As for what my wish is... Hehe, it's a secret for now.
Traveler: How about a change of scenery?
Paimon: Yeah, and we'll take the opportunity to show you some views you've definitely never seen before!
Yoimiya: More places to see? Alright, let's go!
Traveler: Let's go someplace that better fits the mood.

## Talk 8

Paimon: So, what we need to do is to make Yoimiya believe that the meteor shower is really happening, and be super convincing at how we sell it.
Traveler: Complete some challenges, and then reap the rewards.
Paimon: Hmm... If Paimon wanted to go see a meteor shower, the things Paimon would focus on the most would be...
Traveler: The start time...
Paimon: Yes, exactly! We'll say we're trying to figure these two things out, but we'll actually be bringing Yoimiya around to see the sights and enjoy local food!
Paimon: ...Well, easier said than done. We can't be too strict with our pretext, but we can't be sloppy with it either, or she'll see through it.
Paimon: It'd be best if we could take a unique approach to making it fantastical, just like a real fairy tale. Hmm, this is gonna be hard...
Traveler: This reminds me of the Plane of Euthymia...
Paimon: Ooh, that's right. Um, don't people also talk about wishing on a shooting star?
Paimon: If we used wishes as the center of our story...
Traveler: A meteor shower is something summoned by people's wishes.
Paimon: Woah, that sounds great! Alright then, we need a specific wishing spot, or else the sky would be full of meteor showers.
Traveler: We need a certain device to find this location.
Paimon: And then while we're supposedly finding or making this device, we'll go around and have fun and eat good food!
Paimon: Heehee, this is shaping up to be the perfect plot!
Paimon: After all, the device can be anything and the location can be wherever. As long as we get Yoimiya to enter the dream at night, things will be fine.
Traveler: You're getting ever smarter.
Paimon: This isn't about being smart, it's about being a good duo! The idea was yours, anyway. Paimon just knows what you wanna say!
Paimon: Alright, alright, let's go. Yoimiya's probably sick of waiting for us.
Traveler: Your brain always works so well when food comes up.
Paimon: There's nothing wrong with that! You should know Paimon pretty well by now.
Traveler: Just like how Rtawahist requires their observational instruments.
Traveler: When stars symbolizing wishes appeared in the sky.
Traveler: ...And the perfect vantage point.

Yoimiya: I won't go too far, and don't worry about me getting bored. I'm an expert at finding ways to pass time!
