Shatha: Hello there. It's getting late, so I suggest that you return home to rest.

## Talk

Traveler: What about you?
Shatha: Me? Well, this might be the first time you've seen me on the night shift, so let me fill you in.
Shatha: Previously, we had a series of incidents in which Village Keepers were kidnapped, so the village head has added a few additional people to our patrols. Guess who's one of the lucky people?

## Talk

Traveler: Ah, I get it.
Shatha: And it's good that you do. Take care of yourself now. You can't be sure what will happen to you at night.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about those kidnappings...
Shatha: I heard that they had something to do with the Akademiya... Hmph, even when I was working in the city as a mercenary in the Corps of Thirty, I had already seen right through them.
Shatha: Those wretched scholars are even more disgusting than those Specters that blow up before disappearing. There's no end to their corrupt schemes.
Shatha: Not that those idiots who think that "King Deshret has risen" or some nonsense like that are any better.
Shatha: I can't believe I worked with some of those idiots back when I was a mercenary.
