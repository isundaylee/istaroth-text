Yanfei: #Perfect timing, Traveler! Lemme make some space for you... There! Look, isn't that an amazing view? I can never get tired of it.
Traveler: Do you have time off for the festival?
Yanfei: Yep! I got a letter from my dad — he said all is well with him and mom on their travels, and wished me and Granny a Happy Lantern Rite.
Yanfei: So typical of my dad. He wrote the exact same thing last year — it's like his go-to Lantern Rite greeting!
Yanfei: But hey, I guess he doesn't overthink these things, and that's where I get my carefree side from, too. Look at me, I've taken a few days vacation just so I can enjoy the view.
Yanfei: Oh, this reminds me — I should mention you when I write back! When you meet interesting new people, you've gotta share it with your family.
Traveler: Are you off work today?
