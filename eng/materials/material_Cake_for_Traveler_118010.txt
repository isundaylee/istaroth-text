# Cake for Traveler

A gift given to a very special someone on a very special day.

Here's to you, who listens to the song of the ocean tides with a tranquil heart.
Wishing you a joyous journey in this great big world.

"Every week, the recommended dishes get updated. Every month, the moon sends down new blessings â€” but wow, it's going to be almost nine thousand more hours before we can celebrate this day again! Just like Leisurely Otters are always accompanied by their seashells, Paimon will always be by your side!"
