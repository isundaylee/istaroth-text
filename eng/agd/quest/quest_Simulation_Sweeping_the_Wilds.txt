# Simulation: Sweeping the Wilds

Alberre: My, are you so eager to begin work already?
Alberre: If you don't mind me saying so, I do think that this plan won't go anywhere. Might as well go over to Lepaute Horlogerie to have some fun, eh?
Paimon: Whoa, is that your honesty coming out to play?
Alberre: Shh! Pipe down now, pipe down! If someone hears us, they might take me for a hostile spy!
Alberre: Haha, let's leave this topic at that, shall we? I mean, I just work here, so let's talk work.
Alberre: Let me state first that this data collection project will be divided into two parts. One will be run by Arbon, and the other by me.
Alberre: On my side, we wish to model the might of a Champion Duelist, and so we will need you to complete some feats of combat prowess.
Alberre: We have found some places where monsters often gather and planted data collection devices in the vicinity, so you need only go forth and clear those creatures out.
Alberre: I have already marked the exact locations on your map. As for any other things of note, they have been written into this manual here, which you can peruse at your leisure.
Alberre: So, do you have any questions?
Traveler: No.
Alberre: Well, in that case, I hope the data gathering session goes like clockwork.
