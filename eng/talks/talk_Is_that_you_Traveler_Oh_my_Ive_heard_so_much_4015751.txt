# Talk Dialog

Langqing: #Is that you, Traveler? Oh my! I've heard so much about you from Fangfang.
Traveler: You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
Langqing: Ah, right! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Langqing. Fangfang is Wanwen Bookhouse's Jifang. She's my wife, you see. She was the one who told me about this event.
Langqing: I don't know much about rock 'n' roll, but Fangfang says that we should support the latest cultural trends, so here I am.
Langqing: I brought some free cultural products as well. They got snapped up in a heartbeat! Ah, if only I'd known, I'd have brought more.
Langqing: She also asked me to thank you for the invitation. Had she not been so busy, she would have come down here herself, I'm sure of it.
Langqing: I hope you'll enjoy yourself here too.
Traveler: See you.
Langqing: Indeed. See you around.
