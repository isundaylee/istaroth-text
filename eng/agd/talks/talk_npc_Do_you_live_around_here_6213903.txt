Traveler: Do you live around here?
Zhi: Yes. Many people my age have gone to Liyue Harbor to work or settle down. I, however, have decided to stay here.
Zhi: I guess I was born with the nose of the mountain people. I just can't get used to the sea-salt tinge and the flavors of a city by the shore.
Zhi: What's more, the older folks in the village can't quite walk well anymore, so I have to help them pick herbs.
