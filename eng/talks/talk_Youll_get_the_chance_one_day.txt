Traveler: You'll get the chance one day.
Shani: Perhaps.
Shani: Part of me thinks that the misconceptions of our history and belief were built up over so many years that it's become difficult to change... But another part of me wishes for a change to happen.
Shani: ...Heh, let's not dwell on such heavy topics.
Shani: Let me give you some good news. Due to the previous incident, the village head has arranged a night watch at the Village Keepers' dwelling.
Shani: They have helped Aaru Village, after all. It's only right that the village also does its part to ensure their safety.
