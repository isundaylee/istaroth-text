# Sister Victoria's Vexation


## Talk 1

Victoria: I sure hope Sister Barbara is okay...
Traveler: What's happened to Barbara?
Victoria: Sister Barbara said that she was going out to pick some herbs earlier, but I'm afraid that she has yet to return.
Victoria: Hmm... Perhaps I should report the matter to the Knights of Favonius...
Traveler: I'll go search for Barbara.
Victoria: You? Well, I guess as the Honorary Knight, you may very well be a good fit for the task...
Victoria: Not to mention it would save me the trouble of reporting the matter to the Knights...
Victoria: Alright, I'll leave it to you. Before Sister Barbara departed, she said that she was headed to Wolvendom to pick some herbs.
Victoria: You could start by looking for her there.
