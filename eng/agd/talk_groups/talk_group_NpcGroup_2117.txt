Traveler: As I thought, your branding is a sham...
Hypermarket: Th—This... I can't lose my branding just because of you...
Hypermarket: Wait! Do you need food? It doesn't matter who you are, surely you have some needs!
Hypermarket: Here, take these Matsutake Meat Rolls. See, I do have something you need here with me!

Traveler: So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.'
Hypermarket: B—But... I said 'essentials'! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
Hypermarket: Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.'
