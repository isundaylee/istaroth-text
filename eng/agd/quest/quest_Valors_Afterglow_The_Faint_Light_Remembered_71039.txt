# Valor's Afterglow: The Faint Light Remembered


## Talk 1

Jinwu: ...
Traveler: Hey there, Jinwu!
Jinwu: ...!?
Paimon: Yikes! Y—You scared me!
Jinwu: S—Sorry. Anyway, um, if you're looking for Zhiqiong... she left.
Traveler: Where'd she go?
Jinwu: I don't know... I was distracted for just a few moments, and that was it — she was gone.
Jinwu: I had a talk with her... but she insisted on leaving. I doubt I could have cajoled or browbeat her, or even beat her into staying.
Jinwu: *sigh* I just hope she knows what she's doing.
Jinwu: I really do hope so...
Jinwu: Ugh, right, I have to tell Muning, and get him to organize a search party for that kid!
Traveler: We'll go to Muning.
Paimon: Ugh, that Zhiqiong, she's gone again! Let's get back to the surface and look for Muning, quickly!
Traveler: Relax a little.
Traveler: How was she doing when she left?
Jinwu: ...
Jinwu: Khedive did a check-up, and he said that it didn't look too promising...
Traveler: Are you doing fine?

## Talk 2

Muning: Hmm? Zhiqiong's not with you? Word's come down from the Ministry.
Muning: On account of the invaluable help that her maps have brought to the Huishan Hall, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has decided to make an exception for her and... Let me see, invite her to be formally accepted as a consultant and guide.
Muning: Congratulations to her are in order — it seems that all that running around wasn't for naught.
Traveler: She left.
Muning: Left? What do you mean? Do you mean she left first? But the Millelith didn't tell me of anyone leaving The Chasm...
Traveler: Zhiqiong left the team.
Muning: Eh? Uh...
Muning: Wait! Wait!
Muning: Hang on a moment, you mean she left the exploration team?
Muning: As in, Zhiqiong left the team?
Paimon: Yes! Which part of that didn't you get?
Muning: ...I get it. I will put a search and rescue party together immediately. If she is still in The Chasm, we should be able to find her.
Muning: She might just be doing something harebrained again, or perhaps she left for another reason... But regardless, we must find her.
Muning: In her current condition, working away from the team is simply far too reckless...
Traveler: Need my help?
Muning: No, I don't reckon so... I suppose it's about time I stepped in as well.
Traveler: I'll be there if you need me.
Paimon: Paimon too! We can't just leave our junior adventurer behind!
Paimon: We'll look out while on the road as well. Who knows, maybe we'll bump into her somehow!
Traveler: About Zhiqiong...
Muning: She's a restless one, but whatever the case, we are still friends. I might not be the friendliest person around, but I don't simply forget friendships just like that.
Muning: She's always talking about some big adventurer's dream or something, and she's actually been injured quite seriously several times before. Nearly bit it on at least one occasion, too. And here I thought she'd settled down for a bit...
Muning: I'd hoped that she'd have forgotten those unrealistic dreams of hers already. Roald... Stanley... It's not all wine and roses with them, you know!
Muning: *sigh* But I never expected... To be honest, I was starting to wonder if asking you to come to The Chasm was the right decision... If we hadn't, she might not have had a fire lit under her again...
Traveler: Her efforts did produce some results in the end.
Muning: Results...? I think that's a bit too utilitarian. We are very grateful for the maps that she drew of large swathes of The Chasm, yes...
Muning: But should intangible, illusory things like "dreams" and pursuing them really come before one's life?
Muning: I just can't understand it, nor can I imagine anyone really plunging into danger over things like that.
Muning: As such, please leave the search for her to me... Uh, more accurately, just leave it to the Millelith search party.
Traveler: It is her choice, you know.
Muning: Choice, you say... Excuses! She's going there to die, don't you realize that!?
Muning: ...*cough* Sorry, I spoke a little harshly there. Still... couldn't she just exercise a little more patience in the face of things that we mortals cannot change!?
Muning: In twenty or thirty years... maybe even ten, we might have safer underground equipment! Then, she wouldn't have to worry about having to go on expeditions to make underground maps.
Muning: But she's not willing to wait for any of these things, not at all! No, she just has to finish an entire life's work while she's still so young!
Muning: It's folly, I say, and as a friend, I can't just leave her be.
