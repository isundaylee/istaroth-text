Remnant Records: III: What's with these records?
Remnant Records: III: Why don't I remember writing all this?
Remnant Records: III: The place is giving me headaches. This is very strange... I'm probably under the influence of something.
Remnant Records: III: I felt like I was waking from a nightmare. I'm very agitated, and I'm losing track of things that happened recently.
Remnant Records: III: I'd better erase all records and leave, just in case.
Remnant Records: III: Wait, if I'm destroying the records anyway, why am I still writing this...
Remnant Records: III: ...
Paimon: ...Could it be that he just ran away?
Traveler: He might have been met with something frightening.
Paimon: But we didn't see anything scary after activating the device. Why's that?
Paimon: And he destroyed most of the records too. It's almost as if he was covering something up...
Traveler: Maybe people see different things, depending on their state of mind.
Paimon: That's lame.
Paimon: Well, he was the one leaving us the records and providing helpful information...
Paimon: But he's still pretty irresponsible, so Paimon's gonna call him something dumb, like... "The Deserting Dumbo"!
Traveler: Anyway, we've figured this mystery out.
Paimon: That's true. The whole story is actually quite simple, huh?
Paimon: As for the device buried in the seashore, it's not all that dangerous, and it should stop working soon.
Paimon: #Well, since we don't see something like it every day, Traveler, do you wanna try another challenge?
Paimon: We should enjoy the Mirage for as long as you wish! The cooking ingredients can wait.
Traveler: He was influenced by the device.
