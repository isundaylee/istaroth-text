Traveler: Project applications?
Nargess: Mm-hmm, everyone knows that to ensure good funding, you have to get your application approved by the Akademiya. With an approved project and Mora, you can hire more students.
Nargess: With students working for you and stable funding from the Akademiya, your bright future will very much be secured.
Nargess: But I don't think it's really worth it. Just think about the terrible competition you'll face. It's too much trouble to get your application approved.
Nargess: And I heard that the Akademiya has given all its funding to some secret projects lately. So no one can really get a single Mora out of their applications. What a waste of time!
