Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Juza: I'd be the Alcor's Chief Mate. I'm in charge of the lads when Captain Beidou isn't around.
Juza: I used to be a dockworker, just muddling along without a clue about what I was living for. If it weren't for Captain Beidou's invitation, I'd still be tightening screws in some miserable corner...
Juza: Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
Juza: I know you've got your own business to attend to, Traveler, but the crew all miss you. We'll always have a seat reserved for you if it ever strikes your fancy, just so you know!
