Nathan: Why, I never! To think there'd be an outlander like me here.
Nathan: This place really is the top pick if you're here to travel. Take good care of yourself, now. The situation here is very unstable.

## Talk

Traveler: Ah, so you're an outlander as well?
Nathan: I'm from Mondstadt. My travels brought me to Inazuma.
Nathan: I've witnessed the tyranny of the Shogunate and the sufferings of its people. Such things would have never been condoned in my hometown, Mondstadt.
Nathan: That's why I joined up with the Sangonomiya resistance and pledged to fight for freedom.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Nathan: Farewell, Traveler, and may the Anemo Archon protect you.

Traveler: How's the situation right now?
Nathan: Though I'm part of the resistance, if I'm to be frank about the situation, both sides have their strengths.
Nathan: The Shogunate is better trained, organized, and equipped. However, the Sangonomiya troops have unwavering morale and determination, and the people are extremely united.
Nathan: Don't underestimate the will of the people. Even though the resistance can muster fewer troops and is outmatched in equipment on the battlefield, we still believe that we have a fighting chance.

## Talk

Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Nathan: Me? Ehh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I a knight.
Nathan: If you've been to Mondstadt, you'd know that we lead a very laid back lifestyle.
Nathan: Personally, I can't accept the Shogunate's ways of stripping others of their freedom. That's the reason why I'm so concerned about the current situation.
Nathan: Still, it's not like I've made a huge difference by joining the Sangonomiya faction either. I just try to help out as much as I can, haha.

Nathan: Why, I never! To think there'd be an outlander like me here.
Nathan: I mean, we've got a ceasefire going on at the moment, but this is still no place for an outlander. Be on your guard.

Nathan: That's why I joined up with the Sangonomiya resistance and pledged to fight for freedom.
Nathan: I never thought that the resistance, which was disadvantaged in every way, could actually bring the Shogunate to the negotiating table, and even abolish the Vision Hunt Decree. Now that's a cause for celebration!
Nathan: I guess that's the power of freedom for you, haha!

## Talk

Traveler: So, what's your story?
Nathan: Me? Eh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I one of the Knights.
