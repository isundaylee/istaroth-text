Traveler: About the Book of Revealing...
Canotila: #...So scary! Terrifying! If it wasn't for Mr. Traveler, I don't know what would've happened to me.
Canotila: But why? Why would monsters appear in such a beautiful place? Is it really that...
Canotila: Nope! Not gonna keep thinking about that. It wasn't easy for me to forge a life for myself here.
Canotila: If you find another page, or want to meditate... The book hasn't moved. But please, be careful.
