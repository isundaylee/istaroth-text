Traveler: Sunsettia?
Bolai: Tsk, look, I know they're not much to look at, but these here Sunsettias hold a profound and mysterious secret...
Bolai: ...If you were to try one, then you would know: they're much sweeter than most other Sunsettias.
Bolai: In fact, you can take these ones. Then you'll see I'm telling the truth...

Bolai: Oi! Shhh! Keep your voice down!

## Talk

Traveler: What are you selling?
Bolai: *low voice* You're here to view the goods, are you? Hehehe... Good stuff, good stuff...

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you acting so shady...
Bolai: *low voice* I thought you were in the know... What's with all these questions?
Bolai: *low voice* Discretion is key in this line of work...
Bolai: *low voice* Come with me...
Bolai: *low voice* Fresh sunsettias! Market rates, guaranteed...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Bolai: *whispering* You're leaving? At least give me a few words of encouragement if you're not buying...

## Talk

Bolai: Shush! Keep your voice down. Now, what can I get you?
Bolai: Oh, it's you! Let's get down to business then, what can I get you?

## Talk

Traveler: ...These are all just everyday items, no?
Bolai: *low voice* You got that right! I sell everyday items. What else would I be selling?
Bolai: Haven't you heard the saying, "silence is golden"? Well, if silence is golden, quietness has to be silver at least?
Bolai: *whispering* So when you're doing business, you've got to talk in whispers so the Mora keeps rolling in!
Bolai: *whispering* But you youngsters wouldn't understand, you're easily led astray by wacky ideas...

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Bolai: Ah, to think that the rumors of his passing would turn out to be true...
Bolai: Traveler. I hear that you came here from Mondstadt... In that case, I suppose you can feel the difference between our two nations now, yes?
Bolai: In Liyue, even bit players such as myself have received Rex Lapis' grace in some fashion or another.
Bolai: It was my honor to have been able to provide the Silk Flowers for his Rite of Parting.
Bolai: I am no Qixing, and I don't possess a Vision, so that was the only way I could've been of help there...
Bolai: *sigh* Let's not speak of it. I still have a business to run, and I can't run it with this frown on my face all the time, now can I?
