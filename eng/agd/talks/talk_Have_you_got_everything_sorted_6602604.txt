Coyopa: Have you got everything sorted?
Coa: Of course. I may not much like paperwork, but I'll manage â€” through gritted teeth, if I must.
Coyopa: Impressive. The losses and casualties from the war, not to mention the resources needed for reconstruction... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
Coa: *sigh* It's all done now. Let these records gather dust in the Speaker's Chamber. It's time for Natlan to welcome a new dawn.
Coyopa: Well said!
Coyopa: Although, seeing as everything's over... There's something I've been meaning to ask...
Coa: Huh? What is it? Don't be shy.
Coyopa: Those... fragments in the sky. What are they?
Coa: Oh! You're curious about those? I'd like to know as well.
Coa: How about we ask the Pyro Archon the next time we go for a drink?
