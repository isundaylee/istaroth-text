Xianyun: This realm offers pleasing scenery, a state of quietude, and excellent amenities. Very suitable for those who wish to study the art of mechanics in peace.
Xianyun: Were you perchance inspired by one's own abode?

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Xianyun: It brims with adeptal energy, the views are expansive... Yes, it is most to one's liking.
Xianyun: Speaking of adeptal energy... mortals cannot wield the power of Sub-Space Creation with which this abode was made. Whence did you procure this treasure?
Traveler: It was a gift from Madame Ping.
Xianyun: Ah, I see.
Xianyun: Streetward Rambler has always been fond of natural scenery, and often laments its transient nature, for the most pleasant sights tend to disappear with the change of seasons...
Xianyun: Small wonder, then, that she utilized the power of Sub-Space Creation to preserve her favorite sights within this teapot.
Xianyun: Yet it is you, through your furnishing endeavors, who have transformed this sub-space into the most homely of lodgings.
Xianyun: The next time one feels reticent to seek sustenance in the outdoors... perhaps one shall invite oneself over for dinner.
Traveler: You're always welcome.
Xianyun: Oh? You accept the idea with such alacrity...
Xianyun: Then it is settled. One looks forward to your cooking.
Traveler: I'm not always in the mood to cook...
Xianyun: Well then, since one presumed to issue one's own invitation, you may leave the cooking to one's new and improved Supreme Cuisine Machine.
Xianyun: We can eat anything that you desire. Whatever your imagination can conjure, one's machine can surely cook.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Xianyun: Oh? Most appealing. One does have a formidable aptitude for conversation.
Xianyun: However, one is currently preoccupied with a technical conundrum of great importance... We may need to postpone any idle colloquy for later.
Traveler: What sort of technical conundrum is this?
Xianyun: One once developed a supreme housekeeping machine to perform domestic chores such as sweeping and tidying.
Xianyun: To enhance its functionality, one added a sound response module so that it could be operated with voice commands.
Xianyun: However, the module is flawed. For instance, if one is too far away from the machine, it cannot detect the audio signal, and thus cannot be remotely operated...
Xianyun: ...Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this problem?
Traveler: Just yell a little louder?
Xianyun: Hmm... A viable solution, technically speaking, although a little inelegant.
Xianyun: However... yes... Your suggestion has pointed one towards yet another solution. One simply needs to fashion... a sound amplification machine.
Xianyun: With just a little adeptal energy, such a device could amplify sounds from hundreds of miles away, then pass the relevant commands to other audio-activated mechanisms... One shall have full command over one's contraptions without the need to move a muscle. Glorious!
Traveler: Adeptal energy makes everything so much easier...
Xianyun: ...Very well, we may consider this conundrum resolved. Now, back to our conversation.
Xianyun: When you said that you wanted to have a "chat," did you mean that you would like for one to tell you a story?
Traveler: Yup! I'll make us some tea.
Xianyun: Oh, you are a good child. Yes, with some fine tea to soothe the throat, one shall be able to talk far more fluidly.
Xianyun: Nevertheless... Ahem, one ought to refrain from sharing certain stories with you until having sought permission from some old friends.
Xianyun: The girls whom you already know quite well, for instance... *sigh* To utter but a word about their childhoods is to hazard their faces scrunching up as if they had bitten into a sour lemon...
Xianyun: Truly, one is most at ease when speaking with you. Still... you have spoken little of the things you and Paimon have experience in the past.
Traveler: Uhh, I just remembered that I've got something to do...
Xianyun: Hmph... The ruse is quite unnecessary. If there are things you do not wish to speak of, so be it — one shall enquire no further.
Xianyun: Go. We may pick up this conversation again when you feel more comfortable telling your story. Whatever you share, one vows to never tell a soul.
Traveler: Wait here a sec, I'll go get that tea!
Traveler: Yup! I'm sure you have some cool stories.
Xianyun: No, not "some"... All of one's stories should qualify as "cool."
Traveler: Is there any problem that mechanics can't solve?

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Xianyun: No, in fact, nothing in particular... Mortals are wont to rush from one endeavor to the next, but this is because their lifespan is short. They fear being left behind by their peers if they waste but a little of the time they have.
Xianyun: One... has never felt that kind of distress.
Xianyun: By nature, adepti are not part of the human world. For us, centuries can pass by in a flash. Not to mention that one prefers to focus single mindedly on the study of mechanisms, and tends to not to be distracted by worldly attachments.
Xianyun: Except, perhaps... Hmm, yes... The exception would be one's disciples... One cares for them as if they were one's own children.
Traveler: Then, uh... Why don't we just... chill out and relax?
Xianyun: Hehe... Now that is another of one's areas of expertise.
Xianyun: Very well. In that case, allow one to share with you some rather novel means of relaxation.
Traveler: You mean... there's an art to it?
Xianyun: There is indeed. One has quite the compilation of methods right here. Behold:
Xianyun: "Play mahjong with strangers," "Go to Mt. Hulao to knock on some amber"... Whenever one feels in need of relaxation, one simply draws at random from this collection.
Traveler: Sounds like an odd lottery you have going there...
Xianyun: And what, pray tell, is wrong with a little oddity in service of relaxation and fun?
Xianyun: And of course, if you have other suggestions on novel ways to relax, one is all ears.
Traveler: For today... I just want to zone out.
Xianyun: Hmm, there is certainly merit to simply letting the mind wander freely. In idleness, we often find sparks of inspiration that might otherwise go unnoticed.
Xianyun: Still, one is at something of a loss regarding where to best partake in such an activity within this teapot...
Xianyun: You can change the scenery here at will to suit your mood, correct? Then perhaps... could you craft a likeness of Jueyun Karst?
Xianyun: ...No, on second thought, save yourself the trouble. Let us pay a visit to the real Jueyun Karst. Would you care to soar the skies by one's side? One could easily make that happen with one's mastery over wind and cloud.
Traveler: Sounds good to me.
Xianyun: Then it is decided. One needs just a moment to make a plan and retrieve a mechanism or two, and then we shall be on our way!
Traveler: For today... I just want to not think about anything.
Traveler: I've already done quite a few of these things.
Xianyun: Oh? Would you care to share your thoughts on the experience? One is quite curious.

Traveler: Good morning, Xianyun.
Xianyun: Good morning. I see you are a fellow early riser.
Xianyun: Is this because a hero's work never ends? Or are you simply hungry for breakfast? In either case, be sure to wrap up warm. We don't want you catching a cold.

Traveler: Good night, Xianyun.

Xianyun: Oh? What a quiet and tranquil spot, and it's modeled after a human village...
Xianyun: A perfect place to sit and meditate...
Xianyun: How did you... Hmph, clearly you somehow found out that one has been tinkering away with one's mechanisms and getting no sleep during the nights...

## Talk 7

Xianyun: You brought me all the way out here just to show me the food stalls? Well, this was most unnecessary. These recipes look quite elementary — one could just as easily make them in the comfort of one's own home.
