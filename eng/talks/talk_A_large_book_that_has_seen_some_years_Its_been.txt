Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): (A large book that has seen some years. It's been flipped through by the rough fingers of the desert folk countless times... There are some new notes scrawled across its pages. Messy though the notes might be, they still adhere to a certain logic.)
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)
