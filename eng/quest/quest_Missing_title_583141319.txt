Traveler: About fishing...
Uncle Tian: Fishing, you say... Well, it's certainly not a tool to hide my identity. I really do enjoy fishing.
Uncle Tian: After a life of struggle and strife, fishing is how I quiet down and clear my thoughts.
Uncle Tian: To be honest, I'm not even all that concerned about the value of my catches anymore... On the other hand, you seem quite concerned about that, don't you?
Uncle Tian: Haha, come now, of course I can see it. Here, you can take today's catch.
