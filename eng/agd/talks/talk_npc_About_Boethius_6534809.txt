Goldoni: ...No, forget what I said before. I did not mean to be partisan about our Harmosts.
Goldoni: Regardless, even amongst the empire's outstanding subjects, Dominus Boethius stands tall as the most representative of its spirit.
Goldoni: His loyalty and passion are undoubtedly worthy of our imitation and respect.
