Marla: There you are, dear Marvin.
Marvin: Oh, Marla! I can't turn my back on you, not when you're inviting me to Weinlesefest!
Marla: No matter what your father thinks of us, my love... is like wine made from Mist Flowers...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: No. I mean that, my love will turn into burning liquor to warm you for a thousand â€” nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the bitter north wind that follows the west wind...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so chilly...
Marvin: No. I mean that, I don't want you out of my sight, not even for a moment. I want to turn into a full season of Mondstadt's wind, always by your side...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!
