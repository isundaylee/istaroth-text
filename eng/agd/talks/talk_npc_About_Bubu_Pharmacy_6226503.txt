Traveler: About Bubu Pharmacy...
Xuanfu: Bubu Pharmacy can be said to be the best infirmary in Liyue.
Xuanfu: Dr. Baizhu's skills are impeccable, his pharmacy is packed with rare herbs, and the young girl in charge of getting the herbs is extremely nimble.
Xuanfu: If I could attain just a tenth of their skill, I would have no regrets in this life.
