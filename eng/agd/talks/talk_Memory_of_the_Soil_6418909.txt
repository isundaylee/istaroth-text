Traveler: Memory of the Soil?
Aranakula: Uh-huh, not like stones, soil is soft like cloud, and turns into all shapes.
Aranakula: #Aranakula is going to make a Nara Traveler with the garden soil, so Nara Traveler is always with the Viparyas.
Aranakula: They will be happy, too.
Aranakula: #And Nara Varuna will know how Nara Traveler looks like, when Nara Varuna comes back.
