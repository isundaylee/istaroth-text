# Missing title (2601603191)

Traveler: About those unsettling omens I keep seeing...
Grace: No matter what the cause may be, all we can do is pray.
Grace: I had some adventurers help me collect some Cecilia buds to give everyone...
Grace: These flowers grow on top of cliffs, whisked by the Mondstadt winds...
Grace: Perhaps these flowers that emanate the essence of Barbatos can bring some peace of mind to everyone.
Grace: Here, please take some. May Barbatos shine upon Mondstadt.
