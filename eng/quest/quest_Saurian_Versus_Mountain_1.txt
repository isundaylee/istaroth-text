# Saurian Versus Mountain


## Talk 1

Tlatem: Good boy, good boy! Eaten your fill today? Ready to train?
Qica: Raar, oroo, rrooh!
Tlatem: Pretty energetic today, aren't we? Awesome! Let's do this!
Traveler: Yeah, let's do this!
Tlatem: Huh? Oh, hello there! We're doing some more mountain climbing training right now.
Qica: Rroo! Wrroo!
Qica: Wrooo, rrooh...
Traveler: How's the training coming along?
Tlatem: Well... we're "making progress." Qica's made it up a lot further this time.
Tlatem: It's just that Qica's not very familiar with how you climb mountains, and...
Tlatem: Could you demonstrate for us again, by the way?
Traveler: Sure I can.
Tlatem: Thank you so much! I'm sure I'll be able to catch your movements this time.
Tlatem: You keep your eyes peeled too, alright, Qica?
Qica: Roar!
Tlatem: We're counting on you!
Tlatem: So what we'll do is time you while you climb.
Qica: Wroo, roooh...
Traveler: Watch closely this time, alright?
Tlatem: Of course! Qica and I won't miss a thing this time!
Traveler: Looks like he's recovering nicely.
Tlatem: That's right. Mom says I'm getting real good at caring for him.
Tlatem: Qica's improved loads. He can climb way higher than he could last time.
Tlatem: It's just that Qica's not very familiar with how you climb mountains, and...

## Talk 2

Tlatem: You're amazing! You're just about as fast as Mayta!
Traveler: I did make a few errors...
Tlatem: Heh, you're plenty fast already. Qica and I can't compare at all.
Tlatem: *sigh* We'll be training for a long time before we can match you, I'd say...
Qica: Wroo, roooh...
Traveler: You can do it, Qica!
Qica: Wroo!? Hroo, Rrooh...
Tlatem: That's a good boy, Qica. Remember what Uncle Yawar said? We'll get stronger as long as we keep working hard!
Qica: Roar...
Tlatem: Anyway, thanks a lot for your help. Here, have this fruit!
Tlatem: Qica just picked it up — and you know, he's moving way faster than he used to!
Tlatem: Hehe, I'm sure he's gotten this good because he's had you to look to as an example!
Qica: Wroo, rrooh!
Tlatem: Alright then, we're going to head back and look for Mayta. He should be back at the tribe settlement right now...
Traveler: I believe in you two.
Traveler: It wasn't a perfect run...

## Talk 3

Tlatem: Wow, you're awesome! I still couldn't quite catch what you were doing...
Tlatem: *sigh* We'll be training for a long time before we can match you, I'd say...
Qica: Wroo, roooh...
Traveler: You can do it, Qica!
Qica: Oroo!? Hroo, Rrooh...
Tlatem: That's a good boy, Qica. Remember what Uncle Yawar said? We'll get stronger as long as we keep working hard!
Qica: Roar...
Tlatem: Anyway, thanks a lot for your help. Here, have these fruits!
Tlatem: Qica just picked it up — and you know, he's moving way faster than he used to!
Tlatem: Hehe, I'm sure he's gotten this good because he's had you to look to as an example!
Qica: Wroo, rrooh!
Tlatem: Alright then, we're going to head back and look for Mayta. He should be back at the tribe settlement right now...
Traveler: I believe in you two.
