# Archon's Rival


## Talk 1

Paimon: Albedo!
Albedo: You're back.
Paimon: Haha! We've been working hard on the sword, you know? Check it out!
Traveler: Have a look.
Albedo: Hmm. Indeed.
Albedo: It is as I thought â€” this sword grows stronger as you use it in battle.
Paimon: I thought that only applied to people.
Albedo: And that's precisely what makes it special.
Albedo: Ah yes, I should mention a more important matter first.
Albedo: I've investigated the area nearby, and I've discovered some unusual signs.
Paimon: It's not more thieves, is it?
Traveler: But aren't we the real thieves here?
Paimon: That's true...
Albedo: I believe that these strange traces require investigation.
Albedo: Whether it be thieves or something else, we shall investigate, and we shall find out.
Traveler: That's probably not how the Treasure Hoarders see things...

## Talk 2

Albedo: The Fatui? And they chose to attack us within the Treasure Hoarders' camp... Did they follow us here?
Paimon: But why would they do that?
Paimon: Did you go rile them up while we weren't looking?
Albedo: Did you?
Traveler: Why, I never!
Paimon: Um, maybe it's something we all did, then...
Albedo: I think the Fatui are looking for this sword.
Paimon: Eh!? Weren't you keeping this sword super secret? How did they know it existed?
Albedo: Perhaps they caught sight of you using it on the mountain.
Albedo: If their eyes are any good, they'll definitely have seen how this sword stands out from the rest.
Paimon: They really want everything, don't they?
Albedo: Not quite, no.
Traveler: I remember hearing more about their activities recently too...
Albedo: The Fatui are collecting things related to the archons. This, I believe, is known to you.
Paimon: Huh. Now that you mention it, we did hear Master Diluc say that.
Albedo: Durin is the sworn enemy of the Anemo Archon, and had power comparable to his.
Albedo: To say that it could rival the archons, or was related to them... Neither is an overstatement.
Traveler: No wonder they've set their sights on this sword.
Paimon: So that's how it is...
Albedo: I made a new discovery while sketching nearby.
Albedo: There's an area up ahead that's quite remarkable. Its ley lines flow differently from any other.
Albedo: Nearby monsters have been attracted to it and have fallen under its influence. As a result, their constitutions have come to far surpass others of the same kind.
Paimon: That seems convenient.
Paimon: Well, we're here to help this sword grow, aren't we? Might as well go try it out on those monsters!
Albedo: Precisely my intention. Oh, and do remember to observe how various enemies affect this sword differently while you're at it, please.
Traveler: I wouldn't do something like that.

## Talk 3

Paimon: So, how did it feel?
Traveler: The sword's power has increased.
Albedo: I have a hypothesis concerning this.
Albedo: Each time this sword absorbs power from the bodies of fallen enemies, it will resonate with Durin's remains, hidden somewhere on this mountain.
Paimon: Holy moly, that sounds amazing!
Albedo: If my theory proves correct, this could mean that all the monsters here may be resonating with Durin's body.
Traveler: But why would they do that?
Albedo: I fear this may have to do with the origin of these monsters' powers.
Albedo: Durin is no ordinary beast. Even though it is long dead, the entire mountain is still held in thrall by its corpse.
Albedo: The dragon's mysterious power... may itself be a form of curse.
Albedo: We still don't have enough information. If we wish to understand more, more data is required. This is where you come in.
Paimon: Guess story-time's become work-time...
Albedo: I have some research work that needs settling, so we will have to work separately for now. Let's meet up again near the broken bridge.
Traveler: There are different responses... but there is an identical flow of energy.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Lots of human activity here, that's for sure.
Paimon: Looks like more than one person, too.
Traveler: Certainly seems like Treasure Hoarders.
Paimon: So they have a camp here... Hmph! Here to steal, just as usual.
Albedo: It would be rather convenient to rob adventurers who come up here, yes.
Paimon: It's survival of the fittest here on this mountain, huh?
Paimon: All that stealing though, and still every last one of them's still poor as dirt...
Traveler: I wonder if we should feel sorry for them...
Paimon: Hmph! Anyone who calls us thieves gets no pity from Paimon!
???: Who's that? Who're these sniveling sneaks snooping around our camp?
Paimon: Argh, we're busted!
Traveler: Perhaps this is their fate?
