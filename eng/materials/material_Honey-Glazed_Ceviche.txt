# Honey-Glazed Ceviche

Ororon's specialty. "This is to honor my elders." And without further ado, the fish slices were served up, glistening with juicy deliciousness. From the sweet, delicate flavor, you can tell that the sauce most likely contains honey of the highest caliber, the gathering of which must have required a great deal of thought and effort. It's not often that you get to witness such displays of filial respect.
