# Talk Dialog

Helka: Ready to tangle with the giant crab?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: Nod-Krai is also home to crabs, but they look very different. Hmm. I should take a few more photos — for all I know, Maisie might like Fontainian crabs better.
Helka: But then again, I wonder... Is the appearance of a species like this a result of the hot spring, or is it the Tyrant's presence that caused the springs to boil?
Traveler: Tell me a bit about Nod-Krai...
Helka: If I had to describe it, I'd go with "a dangerous yet lively place"? It's been leaning toward the former in recent days, though.
Helka: Before I left, the Fatui had moved a lot of construction materials in. Word was that a Harbinger — or Harbingers — were present, too. As for what they intend, I couldn't say.
Helka: I've heard bad things about the situation to the north as well. The Abyss's influence has been expanding... Katya even warned me not to return via the northern paths.
Traveler: Give me a moment.
