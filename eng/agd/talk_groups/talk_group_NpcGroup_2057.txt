Yicheng: Hello, do you *RUMBLE*
Yicheng: Ugh, my stomach is making an awful racket again. I was saying, do you need any *RUMBLE*
Traveler: Uh, you were saying?
Yicheng: *sigh* My stomach acts up like this every time I'm hungry. Rumble this and rumble that, and it's really loud, too. I can't even hear the sound of my own voice.
Yicheng: Although *RUMBLE* went to Bubu Pharmacy to get myself checked, but the doctor said that I was not sick, just hungry â€” so there's no cure for my *GROWL*
Yicheng: The doctor said that I just needed to eat full meals, but I... I've always had a bigger *GRUMBLE* than most. If I were to eat my fill every time, I'd burn a hole right through my wallet.
Yicheng: Jiayi tells me that if my main meals don't fill me up yet, I should buy a little something to fill in the gaps in between so it doesn't affect my work.
Yicheng: "Fill in the gaps," he says, but I've got a long list of dishes I'd like to eat, and I'm not sure which is best for filling my stomach.
Yicheng: Traveler, you're experienced in the outdoor life. Surely you know what foods fill your stomach best?
Yicheng: Could you help me pick the most filling and delicious dish from my list?
Traveler: What would you like to eat this time?
Yicheng: Oh, there's plenty... Let me think...

Traveler: What was that noise?
Yicheng: Oh, it's just... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: My tummy rumbling... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: Because... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: I'm always hungry, so it always... *LOUD RUMBLING* rumbles... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Traveler: ...Are you sure you're okay?
Yicheng: I'm fine... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: Apart from the fact that the... *LOUD RUMBLING* rumbling is so loud...
Yicheng: That it drowns out my... *LOUD RUMBLING* voice...
Yicheng: Everything else is... *LOUD RUMBLING* fine...
Traveler: Should I run and get you a bite to eat!?
Yicheng: That would be amazing!
Yicheng: Right now, I could go for a *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: And I could murder a *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: Also, I've got a real craving for *LOUD RUMBLING* with a side of *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: ...That should do it. Thank you so much!
