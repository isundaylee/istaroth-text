Traveler: About Kaedehara Kazuha...
Little Yue: Eh? That name sure sounds familiar... Oh, right, you mean that red-garbed guy from abroad!
Little Yue: He always sits by himself saying some real complicated stuff... But I've heard Uncle Liushi say that this guy can tell the weather as well as he can!
Little Yue: He even played me a tune once on a leaf. I never even knew that was possible!
Little Yue: So... I guess he's a good guy!

Traveler: The Cygnus Fleet?
Little Yue: It's my very own fleet! It's just me right now, but one day, it'll grow into something big!
Little Yue: My Ma and Pa were both sailors in the fleet, but they were returned to the sea during a voyage, so Captain Beidou took me in...
Little Yue: We have a saying here, it says "the new surpasses the old." Captain Beidou is the one who raised me, my fleet mustn't be an embarrassment to her!
Little Yue: I've always wanted to be a sailor myself, but the Captain's forbidden me to go out to sea, saying that it's too dangerous. So this time, I've secretly stowed aboard...
Little Yue: I got an earful from Uncle Juza, but I got to go out to sea, and that makes me a sailor now!

Traveler: Do tell me about the Chief Mate.
Little Yue: Uncle Juza's real huge, and he looks scary, but he's a great guy!
Little Yue: ...Well, and his ears aren't all too good either.
Little Yue: He always mishears what we say. Says it's our fault we're always saying things only insects can hear.
Little Yue: Funny thing is, though, that he only gets like this on land.
Little Yue: It's so noisy out at sea with the crashing waves and all, but somehow he hears us just fine out there. It's really weird...

Traveler: So, about the crew...
Little Yue: Well, Uncle Liushi loves to sing from the crow's nest. At first, no one knew who was doing that. Almost thought it was a ghost!
Little Yue: Then there's Aunt Furong. Sometimes, when she's alone, she says the Captain's name over and over, and her face is all red...
Little Yue: Oh yeah, and there's Aunt Yinxing, who really loves animals. You can't take pets on board, so she raises a few fish in her cups...
Little Yue: ...So there was this one time when Uncle Sea Drake got dead drunk, and he drank her fish with his grog. Till today, she has no clue how they went missing...
