Traveler: What happened?
Afsoon: Don't even bring that up. I can't stand that captain. Every time he comes to unload his cargo, it takes several times longer than any other ship.
Afsoon: He keeps saying that tea is fragile cargo that must be handled delicately, and that it naturally takes more time.
Afsoon: If taking so much time is really on the up and up, then why did he feel the need to secretly hand out some tea to the port officials? Hmph...
Afsoon: Next time, I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind!
