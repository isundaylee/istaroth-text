Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Gorou: Yeah! I heard from Tubby the Butler Bird that she can change the terrain to whatever you want.
Gorou: So, could you build a really tall mountain? The steeper the better â€” I want it to be a tough climb.
Gorou: Then, let's you and I have a race to the top!
Traveler: No problem.
Gorou: Wow, you didn't take much persuading! Thank you!
Gorou: I used to go mountain climbing with my resistance comrades all the time. It was a great way to test our physical limits while also having some fun together... I have so many treasured memories.
Gorou: But something tells me that the chance to climb a mountain with you would become the happiest memory of them all.
Gorou: In fact, I would love to share every happy moment with you.
Traveler: I understand.
Gorou: Hah, you're too kind! Alright... how about we find a relatively safe mountain trail and see who makes it to the top the fastest? Are you up to the challenge!?
Gorou: The loser has to treat the winner to a three-course meal... and at least one of the courses has to be dessert...
Traveler: I... just want to touch your tail...
Gorou: Uh? What a weird request...
Gorou: But, fine... if you win, of course!
Gorou: I... Fine, I'll allow it. But only if you win.
Gorou: For the sake of my tail, I will give it everything I got! If you're serious about winning this, you're gonna have your work cut out for you!
Gorou: Right! We should probably warm up first...
Traveler: I want to use your tail as a pillow when I go to sleep...
Gorou: What!? My tail... as a pillow...
Traveler: Gorou, I also want to thank you.
