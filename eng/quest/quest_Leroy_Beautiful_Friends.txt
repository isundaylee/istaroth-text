Molli: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, it seems like Mr. Leroy doesn't live here anymore! Have you seen him?
Paimon: (Hey, do we want to tell the truth?)
Traveler: We ran into him.
Molli: So you did see him! Did you tell him the snacks were delicious?
Traveler: We did.
Molli: #I knew Mr. Traveler was trustworthy! You're the best. I brought some Bulle Fruit over — have some with me!
Black Screen Text: Molli sighs, and waves goodbye, and just as she is about to leave...
Black Screen Text: The door opens, and Autumn and Athos walk out.
Morticia: So it was your voices we heard outside. Is there still something you want?
Traveler: We were just passing by.
Athos: Really? Small world. Autumn and I were just leaving.
Traveler: And Benoit?
Athos: Oh, he's already gone somewhere else. A place that we'll only be going after a few more decades. I don't think you will be seeing him anytime soon.
Athos: Though that's hard to say. Which will come first, tomorrow or an untimely end? Who knows?
Athos: Ah, and isn't this the little rascal who's always looking for him?
Morticia: ...
Molli: Hi, Lady!
Morticia: ...You look just like me. And you even have lavender eyes...
Molli: L—Lady, can I help you...?
Morticia: How old are you?
Molli: I'm nine!
Morticia: What are your parents' names?
Molli: Uh... Are you okay, Lady?
Athos: Your expression... Is something wrong with the kid? ... Wait, this can't be a coincidence, can it?
Morticia: Are you adopted? Tell me.
Molli: #...Mr. Traveler, do you know this lady? What is she doing...
Athos: Who asks questions like that? Allow me.
Athos: Young miss, I remember you're very close with our Dad, right?
Molli: Yeah! Mr. Leroy treats me really well. Mr. Son-in-Law, does he not live here anymore?
Athos: That's right, he's gone somewhere very far away and won't be coming back again.
Athos: What does our Dad usually talk with you about? Can you tell me? When I go back, I can tell him how much you miss him.
Molli: Mr. Leroy always treats me to snacks, lets me pet Nana, and tells me my eyes are pretty!
Athos: Anything else?
Molli: He often tells me to say hi to my Mama and Papa for him, but they really don't like that...
Molli: Papa gets really angry and says that Mr. Leroy is a bad person, and that he's "blackmailing" them.
Molli: Though they've forbidden me from coming here, I made an agreement with Mr. Leroy, so I sneak over. Please don't tell Papa, Mister!
Morticia: That's just like him. He won't stop squeezing until he's wrung the last drop of value out.
Athos: ...That bastard. ...Sorry. We were talking about something else just now.
Molli: M—Mister, Lady, is there anything else? If not, then I—I'll just go home now.
Morticia: ...Do your mother and father love you?
Molli: They're the best parents in the whole wide world.
Morticia: ...
Morticia: That's good, then.
Molli: I'm going home now! Bye, Lady! Bye, Mister!
Morticia: Goodbye.
Traveler: Is this really okay?
Morticia: I have imagined this scene time and time again... But nothing is better than knowing that she's happy. That's enough for me.
Morticia: I... I'm not my father. I don't want to cause trouble for her current family.
Athos: I don't mean to be that guy, but didn't you buy a music box for her? Are you not going to give it to her now?
Morticia: ...
Morticia: No, there's no need. She... doesn't look like she lacks for things like that.
Morticia: I'll think of ways to keep visiting her in the future. Whatever she needs, I'll find a way.
Morticia: ...I'll give the music box to someone else. After all, I spent a lot of time and effort picking it out.
Morticia: Excuse me, little white-haired girl... Do you like gifts?
Paimon: Do you mean Paimon? Wait, you want to give this to Paimon?
Morticia: Yes, I do. It's a gift, so please, enjoy it. I hope it will still have some bit of value to you.
Morticia: Sorry, Athos, but I think we'll need to stay in the Court of Fontaine a bit longer.
Athos: Don't worry, it's all the same to me. Let's go.
Black Screen Text: You watch the two of them walk away, leaving this street behind — thus does the story of the Leroy family draw to an end.
Traveler: You don't plan on telling her?
Traveler: How's Benoit?
Athos: This world is full of inequity, extreme poverty, and excessive greed. The punishment that the laws of Fontaine fail to mete out, we shall execute in their stead.
Athos: I mean to say, he has gone to where he belongs.
Traveler: We forgot.
Molli: Oh, really? That's a pity. I guess I'll never get a chance to let Mr. Leroy know. As for the Bulle Fruit I brought over... I guess I should just give it to you.
Traveler: Haven't bumped into him.
Molli: Oh, that's a pity. I suppose I'll never get to see Mr. Leroy again, huh.
Molli: I brought some Bulle Fruit over, and was planning on giving them to him if I saw him... but since he doesn't live here anymore, why don't you take them?
Molli: But no matter what, I think I'll always remember Mr. Leroy! Bye bye!

Molli: #Mr. Traveler and Ms. Paimon! Are you guys here to talk to Mr. Leroy?
Traveler: Is Benoit at home?
Molli: He isn't here. Father said Mr. Leroy will never live here again — he's gone to live underground.
Traveler: In the Fleuve Cendre?
Paimon: Is it the same Fleuve Cendre we went to before?
Molli: If so, then no, not that place. Father said he's gone much deeper underground.
Molli: The Steambird said that Mr. Leroy fell from a very high place while climbing a mountain, and went tumbling down.
Molli: Though to be honest, I don't really know how having a bad fall and moving are connected...
Molli: By the way, I saw Mr. Leroy's son-in-law! And there was a very nice lady too.
Molli: The lady really liked me, and she has the same eyes as I do! Our eyes are both lavender.
Molli: She even asked me where I lived, and said she'd come see me if she had time, and be my good friend! I guess everyone in the Leroy family is a good person!
Molli: *sigh* I even brought some Bulle Fruit over for Mr. Leroy, but since he isn't there...
Molli: Can I give it to you, instead?
Paimon: Thank you, Molli!
Molli: Don't mention it! Mama and Papa always say we should be generous with our friends.
Molli: I did another good thing today! I'm going to go back and write it in my diary, yay!
Black Screen Text: As you watch the happy Molli leave that street behind, the story of the Leroy family draws to an end.
Traveler: We were just passing by.
Molli: I was just thinking if I should tell you that Mr. Leroy moved.
Molli: Father said Mr. Leroy will never live here again, and that he's gone to live underground.
