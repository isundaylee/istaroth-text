# Neko Is a Cat: Wooden Shelf


## Talk 1

Neko: Another quiet day today...
Neko: Ah, arrived, have you? I slept most well last night after you cleaned the shrine... meow, meow...
Neko: Those two people in green came by for a stroll yesterday as well.
Neko: That said, no other humans besides them came to pay their respects here. Very strange...
Neko: But when those two green humans came by, they seemed quite interested in that wooden rack there, meow.
Neko: I recall Hibiki calling the rack itself a "Prayer Rack," and these small wooden blocks "Prayer Plaques." It just so happened that many people frequented this shrine on the account of this wooden rack.
Neko: Hmm... Does this mean that humans love wood? It is true that many visitors would go to that wooden rack to hang small wooden blocks after offering up some Mora.
Traveler: I—I don't think it's because they love the wood...
Neko: Is that so? Then... did they do it because they dislike wood? ...To punish the wood, perhaps?
Traveler: The wood is really not the important part...
Neko: ...Whatever the case may be, the rack is now in a sorry state and has been left wanting for more wooden blocks.
Neko: Though I cannot claim to understand the relationship between humans and wood, a shrine must have these all the same.
Neko: It must be the ruination of the rack and the shrine running out of wood that no one comes by anymore.
Neko: As such, I must ask another thing of you — to fix that wooden rack.
Traveler: Well, leave that to us.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, we should have some leftover material from when we fixed that Offering Box, right?
Neko: Of such things, I cannot be sure... Why do you humans love wood so much, anyway?
Paimon: Uh, you know what, never mind... Paimon remembers that we have some spares. Let's look around a bit.
Neko: Whatever the case may be, I shall leave the matter of the wooden shelf to you. This shrine will not take care of itself, after all, meow.
Neko: Once that box and shelf are both fixed, the number of humans coming here should swell.
Traveler: How long has this thing been in disrepair?
Neko: Very long. It fell apart before the box did, and the box fell into ruin ages ago.
Paimon: So you don't know at all, do you...
Neko: Hah. I do not particularly follow how many times the sun rises or sets.
Paimon: Well, we should have some stuff left over from when we were fixing that Offering Box, right?
Neko: Of such things, I cannot be sure... Why do you humans love wood so much, anyway?
Paimon: Uh, you know what, never mind... Paimon remembers that we have some spares. Let's look around a bit.
Neko: Whatever the case may be, I shall leave the matter of the wooden shelf to you. This shrine will not take care of itself, after all, meow.
Traveler: It has nothing to do with the material, per se...

## Talk 2

Taisuke: That Prayer Rack looks like it's been kaput for a very long time...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Taisuke: Oh, hello there, Traveler. Miss Etsuko and I are currently investigating the area around this shrine.
Taisuke: Even though the various shrine facilities have long fallen into ruin... It does have them all nonetheless.
Taisuke: People from the nearby villages must have all come to this place to pay respects. I suppose that its ruin must have something to do with the abandoned Koseki Village...

## Talk 3

Neko: Meow, meow, meow... That wooden shelf...
Traveler: I've fixed it.
Neko: Oho! Have you indeed? Ah, this shrine looks yet more the part now! Meow, meow!
Neko: Now then, go and tell those two green humans that the shelf has been fixed, and that they can now hang wooden blocks on it. And while they are at it, they can bring some other people to come and pay respects and stuff the box with Mora.
Traveler: Not going to tell them yourself?
Neko: No! Th—That green, tall human is very scary. H—He can read the hearts of cats... My guise is no match for his keen eyes! Meow, meow!
Neko: Not to mention how he gets far too excited each time he talks to me... Meow, meow...

## Talk 4

Taisuke: Hello there, Traveler. What can I do for you?
Traveler: The Prayer Rack's been fixed.
Taisuke: It is? You fixed it? You're a kind soul, aren't you...
Traveler: I was commissioned by the provisional head priestess.
Taisuke: L—Lady Neko commissioned you to do it?
Taisuke: Has she noticed our actions, then?
Traveler: I wouldn't totally say so...
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko! Let's go over to where the Prayer Rack is!
Etsuko: First the Offering Box, now the Prayer Rack...
Etsuko: This provisional head priestess really is serious about repairing the shrine, huh...
Etsuko: But the inhabitants around these parts all migrated long ago.
Etsuko: In short, no one on this island's coming to pay respects at this shrine but us.
Taisuke: What are you trying to say, Miss Etsuko?
Etsuko: ...Has that provisional head priestess realized this yet? What motive does it have for repairing that shrine?
Etsuko: ...Never mind, maybe I'm just letting my suspicion get the better of me. We can go over to that Prayer Rack, no problem.
Etsuko: But I'd call remaining on guard the right option.
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko, Lady Neko is just a cat...
Traveler: You could say that...

## Talk 5

Etsuko: You did a beautiful job repairing this Prayer Rack.
Traveler: Thank you.
Etsuko: But the Prayer Plaques... You can't see what they say at all. How long has it been since...
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko! I found a few wooden planks nearby, and I, ah, carved us a few Prayer Plaques.
Taisuke: Since this Prayer Rack's been repaired, it needs some Prayer Plaques hung on it, after all.
Taisuke: Do you have any wishes, Miss Etsuko? I can draw them out for you.
Etsuko: Hanging a Prayer Plaque up at this shrine...
Etsuko: Hehe, what an interesting thought. Pass me one of those plaques, I'll handle the drawing myself.
Paimon: Well, looks like they're preparing to put some Prayer Plaques up, huh?
Paimon: Let's go tell Neko. It'll be pleased for sure!
Traveler: I just know a few tricks.

## Talk 6

Neko: I have espied those two green humans preparing to hang up Prayer Plaques. You are indeed a reliable pair.
Neko: Well, once they're done, I am sure that they will inform other humans, and that those will visit this shrine.
Neko: Meow, meow, meow... It seems that besides "cleanup" and fixing that box, this rack, too, is very important.
Neko: Good, very good. Meow meow meow! At this rate, the shrine will surely be restored to liveliness.
Traveler: Why do you want to restore the shrine, anyway?
Neko: Unya, meow... Why, indeed... I am the provisional head priestess, after all. It is my duty to care for the shrine, to have many people pay respects here, to make this shrine a lively place.
Neko: Also, Hibiki would be most grieved should she return and find this shrine all broken-down.
Neko: Meow, meow, but with your aid, it shall surely return to its former glory in no time at all.
Neko: I might still require your help from time to time, meow. Don't you decline when the time comes, now.

## Talk 7

Neko: Go tell those two green humans that the shelf has been fixed, and that they can now hang their little wooden blocks on it.
Neko: Meow, meow... If they could tell more people of the repairs made, perhaps still more people might come...

Etsuko: My wish, huh... Well then, let's go with "I wish to live comfortably." How about that?

### Additional Talk 2

Taisuke: Hmm, what should I write? Something about becoming a successful adventurer, perhaps?

### Additional Talk 3

Neko: I might still require your help after some time, meow. Don't you decline when the time comes, now, meow.

### Additional Talk 4

Etsuko: Hi. Need any help?
Traveler: What are you two doing?
Etsuko: Investigating this shrine's surroundings... Well, that's Taisuke's idea, anyway.
Etsuko: As far as I'm concerned, this is just an opportunity to slack off for a moment.
