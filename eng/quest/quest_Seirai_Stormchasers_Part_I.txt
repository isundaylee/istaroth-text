# Seirai Stormchasers: Part I


## Talk 1

Neko: Hmm. Well done, well done indeed. I acknowledge your efforts.
Neko: This should be the first step on the shrine's return to its former bustling state — you are also free to offer Mora yourself, should it please you.
Neko: As we agreed, then. I shall instruct you in the sealing of those rocks.
Neko: This island plays host to four such stones. Hibiki once said that they were meant to seal a bird of most prodigious size.
Traveler: A bird of... prodigious size?
Neko: Hibiki said that that bird's strength was a truly frightening thing, capable of singeing the fur off all the cats on this island.
Neko: This shrine, too, was built to subdue it, so I heard from her.
Neko: Hmm... Meow... The exact details escape me, and it is a mighty shame that Hibiki is not here, or you could ask her directly.
Neko: Yet I still recall the sealing methods for the... meow, four stones. You must... Hmm... Meow, meow...
Neko: Hibiki said that the key is to use the ropes on the rock, and the piece of paper...
Paimon: Ropes? Paper?
Neko: The paper on the sticks by the rock's side must become the same as the paper on the rock itself...
Traveler: Clear as mud.
Neko: You seem confused. Perhaps your comprehension is lacking also... Paper with paper, and rock. Did you get that?
Paimon: What is this, some weird game of rock-paper-scissors?
Neko: Rock-paper-scissors? I fail to understand...
Neko: Mmm... If your comprehension fails you here... Have you any of those wooden planks left? I will carve an image of what needs to be done.
Traveler: S—Sure...
Neko: Now, surely, you understand. This is how one seals the rocks, and where they are.
Neko: Go now, and quickly. The shrine's maintenance yet requires my attention.
Neko: Hah, now that the Offering Box has been repaired, the shrine shall soon return to its former thriving glory...
Traveler: Again, you're really good with those claws...
Neko: Small beans it was, really.
Neko: Visit the shrine after some days. Once it grows busy around these parts once more, I am certain that more humans will come to pay their respects.
Neko: I may yet require your aid again then.
Neko: Hibiki would be most gratified to see this shrine become lively again. Hmm, well, and that Domeki fellow, too... Meow...
Traveler: Such a detailed carving...
Traveler: I—I see...

## Talk 2

Taisuke: Hmm, so this Warding Stone is actually divided into an upper and lower section, and it can be rotated...
Taisuke: If we rotate it correctly, something might happen...
Etsuko: Uh huh. And what is this "correct rotation"?
Traveler: I've figured it out.
Etsuko: Oh? You're back. We were just starting to wonder where you'd gone.
Taisuke: Wait? Seal? Th—This Warding Stone needs to be sealed, you say?
Etsuko: Huh. A talking cat, you say... Guarding an abandoned shrine?
Etsuko: And that cat told you how to seal the Warding Stones?
Etsuko: That's... just incredible... Maybe the Guild's rated this commission's difficulty a little too low.
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko, this isn't the time to worry about Guild evaluations...
Taisuke: Look! The words on this wooden plank seem to have been made using claws!
Taisuke: This... is just incredible. Is that cat named Neko still at that shrine?
Taisuke: Will I need to bring any greeting gifts when I go there to pay respects?
Taisuke: You know, like fish, cat food, things like that...?
Etsuko: Taisuke, please. We need to seal the Warding Stone first. Guild commission, remember?
Taisuke: Right... Right! I'm sorry...
Etsuko: Alright then, let's figure out how we're supposed to do this sealing business.
Etsuko: But according to this wooden plank, it isn't going to be that easy.

## Talk 3

Etsuko: Sealing this Warding Stone isn't going to be that simple...
Etsuko: And I'm also quite concerned about one other thing.
Etsuko: Since what we're doing is "sealing" this Warding Stone to calm the storm...
Etsuko: That means that someone must've unsealed the stones in general at some point in the past.
Etsuko: Whoever that is, they're responsible for this storm on Seirai Island.
Etsuko: But who would... and why would anyone do something like that?
Etsuko: This is really troublesome. Definitely doesn't sound like something I want to get mixed up in...
Etsuko: Perhaps it might be better to report back to the Guild and request that they send some extra people to investigate.

## Talk 4

Katheryne: Hello there, Adventurer. Have your recent adventures been going smoothly?
Traveler: You could say so.
Katheryne: I would expect no less of you. Keep that up, and I'm sure you'll be a most excellent adventurer.
Katheryne: Speaking of which, the Guild is currently looking for adventurers to explore Seirai Island. Would you be interested?
Traveler: Seirai Island?
Katheryne: Yes. It is an island to the south of Narukami Island, with some parts of the island being subject to constant wild storms that have impeded the Guild's exploration work thus far.
Katheryne: While we have sent two adventurers, Miss Etsuko and Mr. Taisuke, to remain on Seirai Island and investigate a way to calm the storm...
Katheryne: I'm afraid that they haven't come up with any leads thus far...
Katheryne: If you're interested, go to Seirai Island and have a look. It has also been said that the island is full of buried treasure.
Katheryne: That said, please be careful while you explore Seirai Island.
Katheryne: After all, we have yet to determine the cause of those storms.
Traveler: There's no commission I can't complete!

## Talk 5

Etsuko: I'll need this book... and this one... and this one...
Etsuko: Ah! Hello there. You're... an adventurer? Hmm. Am I right to say that you're here to investigate this island?
Traveler: That is the case.
Etsuko: I see... In that case, you can explore the periphery of this island a bit.
Etsuko: But don't wander too close to the center of this island as you please. The storms there are not to be trifled with.
Traveler: Is there no way to solve this issue?
Etsuko: Not for now... Actually, I haven't even figured out the cause of these storms yet.
Etsuko: That fellow Taisuke keeps insisting that the storm must have been the work of the Archon, meant to block ordinary people from violating a sacred site.
Etsuko: I didn't believe a word of it at first, but then we discovered some very strange stone structures in the area.
Etsuko: Taisuke read in a text he found that these structures are known as "Warding Stones."
Etsuko: And according to the legends, these stone structures really are ritual implements that can be used to seal certain things.
Etsuko: Unfortunately, the stone structures we found were all busted up, and not one looks like it's been repaired in who knows how many years...
Etsuko: *sigh* We lack the clues we need to solve this mystery. How very frustrating... But since it's work, I suppose we've just got to give it a go.
Traveler: Where did you find them?
Etsuko: Not far. Taisuke's been there the whole time investigating. I just came back to help him grab some books. If you want to go have a look, I can just take you there.
Etsuko: The quicker we solve the mystery behind that Warding Stone, the sooner we can report back to the Guild.
Etsuko: Just... hold on a moment while I bundle this stuff up...
Etsuko: Alright, that's that. Let's go!
Traveler: Are there only storms over there?
Etsuko: Yes. Strange, isn't it? It's almost like... something's drawn a boundary for the storms.
Traveler: You could say that.

## Talk 6

Taisuke: This seal... No, no...
Etsuko: Taisuke, I brought the resources that you asked for.
Taisuke: That's odd. This architecture doesn't fit...
Etsuko: Hey, Taisuke!
Taisuke: Ah!? E—Etsuko, come on, you don't have to be so loud. You almost gave me a heart attack! I mean, you didn't, of course, but haven't you ever considered that the racket you were making might attract monsters?
Etsuko: Yeah, yeah! Look, I called for you several times already, and you didn't respond at all!
Etsuko: Well then. Guess who's got all the resources you asked for? And guess who's brought a little help from the Guild to boot?
Traveler: Why hello there.
Taisuke: Oh... Oh! Pleased to meet you, yes, nice to meet you indeed! My name is Taisuke, and I'm an adventurer with Inazuma's Adventurers' Guild...
Etsuko: Yes, yes, very nice. We're all adventurers here, no need for the whole song-and-dance.
Taisuke: Oh, don't say that! We should at least exercise some basic courtesy.
Taisuke: We busy ourselves out in the wild so often. It's only right that we maintain a good attitude and outlook during our down-time.
Etsuko: You... Ugh, never mind...
Taisuke: I've told you that many times, haven't I? A good attitude starts with treating people with politeness...
Etsuko: Okay, enough already. How are your Warding Stone studies going?
Taisuke: Basically, we've made zero progress. All we've found is some strange tracks.
Traveler: Well, that was quick.
Etsuko: No progress, huh... We've been here for quite a while now. If we don't make some headway soon, we should probably ask the Guild for additional help.
Taisuke: A—Additional help? Wouldn't that be the same as admitting that we're not up to the task?
Etsuko: Taisuke, I believe I've said this before. We're professionals. Taking commissions is work.
Etsuko: Our goal is to finish our work, not prove ourselves.
Etsuko: If we screw up while trying to prove ourselves, we'd lose more than we'd gain.
Traveler: That's professional ethics for you...
Etsuko: Thanks, but I wouldn't claim to speak for anyone else.
Etsuko: Some Guild members say that I've got no spirit... Others say that I just work for the sake of working.
Etsuko: But whether they like it or not, I've got the highest commission completion efficiency in the Guild.
Traveler: So, what's your reason for being an adventurer, then?
Etsuko: Work. Mora. That's it, really.
Traveler: Simple goals, I see...
Etsuko: Well, maybe it's because my goals are so simple that the Guild tends to send me out to complete commissions more often than most.
Etsuko: Heh, but it seems like I won't be able to clear this one solo.
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko... Please keep your spirits up. The Guild did give us this commission, after all.
Etsuko: I'm already giving it my 100%... It's just too much to ask for me to give my 120%.
Etsuko: Well, whatever. Tell us about those strange tracks.
Taisuke: They're a cat's tracks. They go from this Warding Stone's side and stretch all the way out.
Etsuko: I remember you mentioning that they belonged to a cat... That doesn't sound like it would have anything to do with this Warding Stone.
Taisuke: Well, but we could still follow these tracks to have a look...
Etsuko: Yes, yes, they are quite strange. But I'd say that we should focus on the Warding Stone.
Etsuko: Once we've worked out how it functions, we can go follow those tracks.
Taisuke: Miss Etsuko... Are you just unwilling to walk any further, by any chance?
Etsuko: No, I'm being rigorous. Let's start already.
Paimon: Looks like they're determined to look into that Warding Stone first...
Paimon: Still, Paimon's quite concerned about those cat tracks.
Paimon: Since they appeared just beside the Warding Stone, maybe they really do have something to do with it.
Paimon: Let's follow them and see what we can find!
Traveler: An honor to make your acquaintance.

## Talk 7

Taisuke: The books do say that Warding Stones are implements for sealing rituals.
Taisuke: However, the form and shape of this one doesn't quite match up with what we find in the text...

## Talk 8

Etsuko: Well, that's this Warding Stone squared away, right?
Taisuke: And yet the storm hasn't abated at all...
Traveler: Looks like we've got to seal all four of them.
Etsuko: That seems to be case.
Etsuko: Well, that Neko's already marked all four Warding Stone locations on the wooden plank, right?
Traveler: Indeed. Let's go.
Etsuko: Yup, let's do this.
Taisuke: Could I at least go visit the shrine and see Neko...?
Etsuko: You can do that once the storm's gone. Come on!
Taisuke: Oh... Okay then...

## Talk 9

Etsuko: *sigh* It really stinks, not being able to find any leads...

## Talk 10

Neko: I really have maintained this shrine well...

## Talk 11

Taisuke: A talking cat, huh... I sure would love to go see it myself...
Taisuke: O—Oh, hello there. Miss Etsuko's always done things like that, so don't think too much of it.
Taisuke: She doesn't look very serious... but she's actually a very skilled adventurer. There isn't a commission that she hasn't seen through to perfection.
Taisuke: She claims that this is because she's never taken up any commission that she didn't think she could clear...
Taisuke: But in my view, having such sound judgment is quite the skill in and of itself.

## Talk 12

Neko: Haah... At last, human guests.
Paimon: Th—That cat... It's t—talking!
Neko: Ho. Does the sight of me frighten you so?
Paimon: P—Paimon's just never seen a talking animal before...
Neko: Most rude of you. Are you not a talking animal also?
Paimon: Paimon isn't an animal!
Traveler: Hey, hey, calm down...
Paimon: Hmph!
Paimon: Actually, hmm, we have met quite a few talking animals, haven't we?
Traveler: We met a talking dragon, yes.
Paimon: Eh? Dragons count as "animals"? Paimon feels like they belong in a higher class than that...
Paimon: But well, Dvalin does talk...
Paimon: Well, whatever the case, this is the first time Paimon's met a talking cat...
Neko: Such wanton yammering! I am no "talking cat."
Neko: This is the Asase Shrine, and I am Neko, the provisional head priestess.
Neko: Other felines address me as "Her Ladyship, the Provisional Head Priestess." But since our fates are twined, you may dispense with such formality.
Traveler: Do other cats talk too?
Neko: Surely. You just comprehend them not.
Neko: But you are no fools, certainly, considering that you knew to follow mine instruction.
Neko: Most boring things would be if you were as dull as those other two humans, picking and scratching at rocks as they do.
Paimon: Rocks, huh... Oh, you mean the Warding Stone from before?
Neko: I know not what they are named. It is a pile of rocks with a rope tied across it, no?
Traveler: So you were the one who asked those cats to...
Neko: I did indeed call upon some felines to frolic there. Consider it a test of your intellect.
Neko: Hibiki unsealed these rocks a good, long time ago. It has much to do with those...
Neko: ...Those purple, tingling, hair-raising, ill-meaning things.
Paimon: Purple, tingly things... Do you mean Electro?
Paimon: Well, Electro really is running amok here on Seirai Island, that's for sure...
Neko: I can instruct you in the manner of operating those rocks. But in exchange...
Traveler: Want our help, do you?
Neko: Ah, there it is again, your superb comprehension. Mine eyes did not judge you poorly, human.
Neko: Provisional head priestess of the Asase Shrine I may be, but there are some tasks that mine paws lack skill in.
Neko: For instance, the shrine suffers from a dearth of incense. Were Hibiki to see it in such a sorry state, she would surely be grieved.
Neko: Much thought did I give it before realizing that if the shrine's Offering Box were to be fixed, people would come to deposit Mora there, thus reviving the shrine.
Traveler: It's not quite that simple...
Neko: Mora is stuffed into the Offering Box. When it was yet whole, many people would come to stuff Mora into it, thus making the shrine most busy indeed.
Neko: Once the box was damaged, no one came to put Mora in, and thus did the shrine fall silent...
Neko: It thus stands to reason, then, that should this box be repaired, people will return to offer Mora, and the shrine shall be revivified. Is that not so?
Paimon: It's hard to fault that reasoning... But at the same time, something doesn't fit...
Neko: Whatever the case may be, I remember that people always came to maintain the Offering Box, which was why the shrine thrived and the incense within burned well.
Neko: The human in charge of those repairs lived in the village over there, but he hasn't come in a good long time...
Neko: Indeed, after that huge, huge storm, Hibiki, Domeki, and the others never returned, either.
Neko: Whatever the case may be, I now fully understand that so long as the Offering Box is repaired, the shrine can be restored to its former glory.
Neko: As such, you shall help me to repair the box, and I will teach you the way to seal those stones.
Paimon: Do you really know how to work with those Warding Stones?
Neko: Hah, naturally. Many a time have I seen Hibiki seal them... and unseal them, too.
Neko: There should be no problem at all.
Traveler: Should?
Neko: Meow, meow, meow?
Paimon: Seriously!? You're playing dumb about something like this!?
Paimon: But if we wanna fix the box, we're going to need a lot of materials.
Paimon: You know, like wooden planks, nails, ropes... Do we have that sort of stuff here at the shrine?
Neko: I have maintained this shrine exceedingly well. No such detritus exists here.
Paimon: But those are exactly the things we're gonna need!
Traveler: Well then, where can we find these materials?
Neko: I am a cat. Where would I obtain knowledge of such things?
Traveler: Where did the person in charge of maintenance live?
Paimon: That's right! The person in charge of maintenance must've kept some spare supplies. We can go have a look...
Neko: Mmm, that is a fair point you make. Bring forth your map — I shall mark the location out for you.
Paimon: Wow, she really marked it out...
Traveler: Huh, so that's how you make marks — with your claws...
Neko: But of course.
Neko: There. I have given you the general location you require.
Neko: I shall leave the box repairs to... you... Meow...
Traveler: Those are some flexible claws you've got.
Traveler: Well, I'd pass for a dab hand at repairs.
Traveler: So those cat footprints were your doing...
Traveler: Didn't we meet a talking snake?
Paimon: Oh! You mean that snake named Changsheng?
Paimon: Was that really not a "herb"?

## Talk 13

Neko: The repairs... please... Meow, meow...
Traveler: Why'd you stop speaking...
Neko: Speaking your language is... tiring... Meow...
Traveler: I'll get the box fixed, don't worry.
Neko: This matter is in your hands, meow meow...

## Talk 14

Treasure Hoarder: Agh! No more, please! We yield, we yield!
Traveler: What were you doing over here?
Treasure Hoarder: We... We were just trying our luck, doing a little digging, you know?
Traveler: Tell me the truth.
Treasure Hoarder: Wait! Please! We'll talk, we'll talk!
Treasure Hoarder: We heard from some people that there was treasure to be had here on Seirai Island, and that the island itself wasn't all that populated...
Treasure Hoarder: So we decided to come over and see what we could find.
Treasure Hoarder: But... But we really haven't found anything! This village doesn't look like it's been tended for archon-knows how many years, either...
Treasure Hoarder: Forget treasure, we were hard-pressed to find a plank of wood that wasn't broken around here!
Paimon: Eh? All the wood's ruined? Th—Then how are we supposed to find repair materials?
Traveler: Do you have a camp?
Treasure Hoarder: W—Well, yes we do. But what do you plan to—
Traveler: Does that camp have nails, wooden planks, and rope in it?
Treasure Hoarder: Err, yes, it does...
Treasure Hoarder: Pl—Please, just tell us what you want! There's no need to speak in code!
Treasure Hoarder: You've beaten us, so whether you want Mora or treasure, it's all yours!
Treasure Hoarder: J—Just please, spare our lives...
Traveler: Actually, those things are exactly what I want.
Treasure Hoarder: Huh? Then... Well, then please, just go to our camp and take whatever you need.
Traveler: And what are you going to do?
Treasure Hoarder: We... We've got other things to attend to, so let's part ways here!
Treasure Hoarder: Come on lads, let's go! Move it!
Traveler: Three... two...
