# A Lamenter at Fate's End


## Talk 1

Eide: Did it go in here? Hmm... Well, let's head in.

## Talk 2

Eide: What a ghastly place... Has it always existed? I swear I've never noticed it before...
Traveler: Look...
Eide: Huh. It looks like they're... worshiping. Sometimes walking, sometimes kneeling in worship... And it appears to be in earnest.
Eide: I've never seen anything like this in all my life. What in the world does this place conceal?
Eide: Oh, there's only one way to find out.
Traveler: (The air here, and this creepy scene... it's eerily familiar...)
Traveler: What are those hilichurls doing?

## Talk 3

Fortune Lector (???): Halt, humans. Fate has not granted you the right to enter this place...
Traveler: (An Abyss Herald? No, he doesn't look like someone from the Abyss Order...)
Fortune Lector (???): Hmm, do you insist on an audience?
Fortune Lector (???): ...Very well, then I grant you the trial of destiny.

## Talk 4

Eide: Who was that? He was... he was...
Traveler: Terrifying?
Eide: ...He was a perfect being. I'm in awe.
Traveler: ...Huh?
Eide: He had the most wondrous aura, a perilous yet beautiful power... Truly mesmerizing.
Eide: And yet you were able to defeat him. Your strength is greater than I had imagined. Hehe...
Traveler: You have unconventional tastes.
Eide: Let's continue on. I find myself growing more curious by the second... and more excited.
Traveler: I just have lots of combat experience.
Traveler: I've seen similar characters before.

## Talk 5

Eide: I think... we've made it to the end...
Traveler: What is that thing!?
Traveler: (Wrapped in chains, hanging in midair, emanating a sinister aura... There's no mistaking it. It's just like the Defiled Statue!)
Traveler: (So it does have something to do with the Abyss Order. And these worshiping hilichurls remind me a little too much of the Grand Thief...)
Traveler: Eide, this place is bad news. We've got to go!
Eide: ...
Traveler: Eide?
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): ...O dear creature, why do you bow down? For fear of the unknown? Or for a power that you covet?
Traveler: (Whose voice is that? It must be coming from right inside my head... Can't Eide hear it?)
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): ...O dear creature, why do you bow down? For I am no god... I am but a "Sinner."
Traveler: (A "Sinner"...?)
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): You are like a flower born in sin yet pure, spotless... I know your fate well.
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): You need no longer hold back your resentment, nor accept the countless lies.
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): Go forth, become a transcendent one, rise beyond the fate bestowed upon you...
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): And I shall shed a tear at the end of time... as I gaze back upon your life.
Traveler: (...Who in the world are you? What do these words mean?)
Craft (Voice Inside the Head): ...
Traveler: (The voice... it's gone...)
Traveler: !!!
Traveler: ...Eide?
Eide: *pant* *pant* ...What just happened?
Eide: When I saw that thing, my heart was instantly at peace... I—I was overcome by a sense of awe... or joy, perhaps.
Traveler: Are you alright now?
Eide: I am... I feel good, in fact... I—I feel better than I did before I came in here. How peculiar...
Traveler: Something's not right about this place. We need to get out of here.
Eide: Oh, i—is that so? Alright, as you wish.
Black Screen Text: You leave the ominous cave and return to Eide's house.

## Talk 6

Eide: Caribert! Oh, thank goodness. He's still okay.
Traveler: Don't we still need to go to the Statue of The Seven?
Eide: I... I have a strange feeling that what just happened was meant to be.
Eide: For this to happen right at the moment when I was dreading worshiping at a Statue of The Seven... it's as if fate was calling to me.
Eide: You say that I bowed before that thing, so perhaps... it might be just as effective?
Traveler: That sounds like a ridiculous idea...
Eide: I have to try. No matter what. ...You said it yourself: I have to exhaust all options.
Black Screen Text: Another dose of medicine is administered to the hilichurl...
Eide: Caribert...?
Caribert: ...
Caribert: ...P—Papa...?
Eide: *gasp* ...Caribert! Oh, my goodness, it worked! It's a miracle!!! Oh, Caribert, my dear son...
Traveler: I can't believe it...
Eide: You see!? It worked! Caribert can speak again!
Caribert: Where's... Mama?
Eide: Mama is... Caribert, look at me. Do you know who I am?
Caribert: Of course... You're Papa.
Eide: Hahahaha... Yes! Haha... Salvation, sweet salvation... Yes, this is what this feeling is...
Eide: How do you feel, Caribert? Are you fully awake now?
Caribert: Yes... it feels like I just woke up from a long, long sleep. I dreamed that I was hiding in a little room. I didn't dare go out the whole time, and I didn't want to either...
Caribert: Wait...
Caribert: My body! What happened to me? Is this... is this me?
Caribert: Papa... What's happened to me!?
Eide: ...
Eide: ...Don't panic, son. It's just... while you were sleeping, we went into a fairytale world.
Eide: There's no more Khaenri'ah here, no more home — but do you know what that means? No more red sky... no more end of the world.
Eide: In this world, you have to be a little monster... but you get to stay with Papa forever.
Caribert: Am I... dead?
Eide: No, no, of course not! Look, Caribert... you still have Mama's scarf on your arm. That means she's watching over you, protecting you. So how could you be dead?
Caribert: Really...?
Eide: Yes, really! You've only just woken up, and this must all be very confusing for you. Just rest here for now... Things will get better.
Eide: Oh, and um... you have to promise me something...
Eide: Never take off your mask.
Eide: Understand? Whatever happens, you mustn't take it off...
Caribert: Okay, Papa... I won't, I promise...
Black Screen Text: Father and son talk for a long while. Eide seems like a changed man after his religious experience...
Eide: Not since that day have I been so glad as I am now... I can't believe this is really happening...
Traveler: Yeah...
Eide: Hmph, I knew that placing my hope in The Seven was a waste of time... I even worshiped at one of their statues like a common fool. Never before have I humiliated myself like that...
Eide: Once a murderer, always a murderer... I was naive to think that the gods who conspired against us would ever offer redemption.
Eide: But the god we saw in that cave... Now that was a truly mighty god! Nothing like one of The Seven!
Eide: That wondrous power... It was truly enchanting... Surely, that must have been the reason I bowed down?
Eide: Hmm, now then... after one beseeches a god, and the god responds by answering their prayers, should they, um... do something to show their devotion?
Eide: Piety is hardly my area of expertise... but surely I should honor the god that has honored my wishes.
Traveler: But Eide... that was not a god.
Eide: A "Sinner"? Don't be absurd. You don't know a single thing about him... how dare you utter such blasphemy?
Eide: You and I have both witnessed his divine power. When have The Seven worked a miracle like this before? Never... He is a god mightier than they! And yet you would call him a "Sinner"? Preposterous!
Eide: No matter... Believe what you will. You cannot shake my faith.
Eide: I am going to pay my respects — with or without you.
Traveler: You...
Traveler: (Eide's experience has deeply affected him... Not that he was particularly stable to begin with, but this... religious fervor is something else...)
Traveler: (I guess I'd better catch up with him anyway. There are monsters everywhere... I can't stand by and let him fall into their hands.)
Traveler: Fine, go ahead.
Traveler: That was... a "Sinner."
Traveler: It's unbelievable.
Traveler: I'm stunned.
Traveler: But if you insist...
Traveler: Why are we back here?
