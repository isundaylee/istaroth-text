Hanayama Kaoru: Hey, the flower blossoms today are as beautiful as always!

## Talk

Traveler: Are you still tending to the flowers?
Hanayama Kaoru: Yea, I actually want to go find more types of flower seeds, so I can plant even more kinds of flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: By the way, do you know someone named Xavier?
Hanayama Kaoru: He's a really weird person. He saw the flowers I planted and got really excited. He ran up to me to ask if he could... what did he call it? I think it was something called "filming"?
Hanayama Kaoru: There was someone that looked like he was from the Shogun's Army with him. I got a little scared and asked what he wanted...
Hanayama Kaoru: He said that he wanted to have that Shogunate Samurai stand in middle of the flower field, swing his sword, and... uh, make some kind of "swashbuckler flick."
Hanayama Kaoru: I refused his request in the end, because I didn't want the flowers to be trampled... Man, what a weird person...

## Talk

Traveler: Is the flower-planting going well?
Hanayama Kaoru: It's going pretty well, but something feels to be missing. The flowers don't seem to be blossoming as fully as before. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: *sigh* I guess the Mikage Furnace did have some sort of effect on the soil surrounding it after all...
Hanayama Kaoru: I've heard that there's someone named Vahid who sells specialty fertilizer in Ritou. It's said to be a local specialty from Sumeru.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'd grown quite interested in those fertilizers, so I got some people to ask around for me.
Hanayama Kaoru: But I've heard them say that the store owner... Vahid, I think his name is — whenever he introduces those fertilizers, all he does is repeat the same lines over and over. He never says anything about the details of how it works, either.
Hanayama Kaoru: That just doesn't seem... How should I say this? It just doesn't seem very reliable, you know?

## Talk

Traveler: Please be careful.
Hanayama Kaoru: Thanks. It's a good thing there are no monsters nearby.
Hanayama Kaoru: Even though there are no monsters about... I did see a strange person when I was out picking flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: He just sat there staring into space, sword in hand, and he seemed to be mumbling about something...
Hanayama Kaoru: I was a little startled, so I just peeked from a distance before leaving.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm not sure if he's still there, but he felt dangerous. Best I stay away from him...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanayama Kaoru: See you around. Remember to come and take a look at the flowers when you get a chance.
