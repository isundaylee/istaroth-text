# Strange Stone Chronicle


## Talk 1

Paimon: Puca, why are you here again?
Paimon: There shouldn't be any more monsters nearby, but who knows what other dangers there might be...
Paimon: Anyway, you shouldn't go running off on your own!
Puca: #I didn't run off, Paimon and {NICKNAME}... I'm just looking for my token...
Paimon: Huh? You lost your token?
Puca: Yup... It should be somewhere around that place I usually pick rocks from...
Paimon: Hmm... You might've dropped it when you got trapped there before.
Puca: *sniff* Yeah, you might be right... I was too scared to care about anything else at that time...
Puca: It's still a little scary to think about, but my token's very important... I have to find it, I just have to...
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks it'll be too dangerous if Puca goes there on her own. In that case...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, why don't we take a trip back there and help Puca find her token? Puca, just go home and wait for us!
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Puca: #Thank you, {NICKNAME} and Paimon! I'll be good and wait for you at home.
Traveler: I've been wanting to explore that place anyway.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Puca, we're back! We found your token.
Black Screen Text: You give the token to Puca.
Puca: Ohh, yes, this is the one! Thank you so much!
Paimon: We also found something else while we were looking for your token...
Paimon: It's an ore we've never seen before. We thought it might be valuable, so we brought it back!
Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, you often pick up pretty stones around this area, right? Have you seen any stones like this before?
Puca: Let me see... It really is pretty! But it's not precious at all... it's just an ordinary stone...
Puca: It's true that you won't find anything like this in other places, but they're everywhere in nearby ore veins!
Paimon: Aw, so it's just an ordinary rock! Paimon thought it looked super valuable...
Paimon: Seems like we can't use it for anything else. Let's just find a place to dump it...
Traveler: But if you can't find the ore elsewhere...
Paimon: Oh, you mean we could make a fortune if we took it elsewhere and sold it?
Paimon: #You do have a point! People don't normally go mining in a Melusine village, which means they've probably never seen anything like this... Great thinking, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: C'mon, let's take this stone to the Court of Fontaine and show the merchants!
Puca: If there's anything else you'd like to know about ores, come find me anytime...
Puca: Though I don't run a gemstone workshop like my sister and don't know much about appraisals or processing...
Puca: Compared to precious gems, I prefer collecting all kinds of unique rocks...
Puca: I guess you can say I know the local ore veins pretty well!
Paimon: Hehe, gotcha!
Traveler: But if it's unique to this region...

## Talk 3

Puca: My token is really important... I have to find it...

## Talk 4

Chesil: Welcome, welcome. Our store offers the most extensive selection of precious gems in the entire Court of Fontaine. We also have a wide range of craft goods on sale.
Chesil: Anything catch your eye? If not, I would be delighted to meet any other demands!
Traveler: We've got some mysterious ore here...
Paimon: Yup! Since you have such an extensive inventory, you should know its value, right?
Chesil: Oh? So you're here to trade ore?
Chesil: Then you've come to the right person! We offer some of the best and fairest prices in Fontaine.
Chesil: Let's see what you have here...
Black Screen Text: You show Chesil the strange ore you found earlier.
Chesil: Whoa... Even I've never seen anything like this before...
Chesil: The unique sheen and smooth texture... Ooh, this is no doubt a rare variety!
Chesil: Pardon me for asking, but what exactly is this?
Traveler: No idea.
Chesil: Is that why you're here for an appraisal?
Chesil: It's such a shame you only brought one chunk of ore...
Chesil: If only we had a steady supply... We could forge accessories that would take Fontaine by storm.
Paimon: (Puca mentioned these stones were everywhere near the ore veins. Maybe we should ask her...)
Traveler: We actually have a lot more of this ore.
Chesil: Really? That's wonderful!
Chesil: Anyway, in addition to the ore you brought, I'm willing to purchase more ore from you to make a batch of new products.
Chesil: I'm willing to put down an advance payment to show my sincerity â€” as long as you bring more ore the next time you visit.
Chesil: What do you think? I'd say it's a pretty fair deal.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon thinks so too! It's a deal!
Chesil: Perfect! Here's your payment...
Chesil: I wonder how the accessories made from this ore will turn out... Haha, can't say I'm not looking forward to it!
Chesil: I'll be here, waiting for your good news.
Traveler: The source is a trade secret.
Chesil: Oh, naturally, of course...
Chesil: Though as long as you have a reliable way of getting them, it's fine.
Traveler: You can find them around Elynas.
Paimon: Hey! Why did you just tell him?
Chesil: You got it from Elynas, huh? Yeah, people wouldn't normally go prospecting there...
Traveler: Uh, it's a "Paimonial Rock"!
Paimon: Hey, don't give it weird names!
Traveler: It's Dazzling Crystalline Gold.
Paimon: Whoa! Did you just come up with that on the spot?
Chesil: What an impressive name! No wonder it looks so unique.

## Talk 5

Puca: Hey there, it's you again!
Puca: Is there anything you'd like to know about ore? You can ask me anything!
Puca: Even though I might not have an answer...
Traveler: About precious gems...
Puca: There's lots of beautiful and sparkly stones in the ore veins nearby, but they're nowhere as good as real gemstones...
Puca: If I were better at finding real gemstones, maybe I could open my own gemstone workshop, just like Sluasi!
Traveler: About the uses of ore...
Puca: Huh? I've never thought about that before... I only collect stones because they're pretty...
Traveler: I don't have any more questions.
Puca: Hehe, thanks for coming to play with me!
