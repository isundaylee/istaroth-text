Traveler: Waiting?
Cui'er: I am waiting for my lover. His name is Chaoxi, and he is a brilliant sailor.
Cui'er: Mr. Chao always tells stories of his adventures. The last time, he talked about a duel with a giant sea creature, and before that, he told us about the time he destroyed a pirate crew by himself...
Cui'er: His stories truly are spellbinding. I only wish I were there to experience those magnificent events alongside him...
Cui'er: Regardless, we have made a pact, that when next we meet, he will take me away from here...
Cui'er: Though waiting like this is torment, my heart is already set on him, and so I will continue waiting...
