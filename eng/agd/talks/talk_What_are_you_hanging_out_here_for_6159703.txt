Traveler: What are you hanging out here for?
Jill: Can you see Mr. Guard over there?
Jill: Me and Will wanna go and play with Ms. Edith at Windrise...
Jill: But Mr. Guard keeps following us and we can't get rid of him. I'm a bit scared, he looks like a bad guy.
Jill: That's why we ended up here, because we're trying to run away from him.
