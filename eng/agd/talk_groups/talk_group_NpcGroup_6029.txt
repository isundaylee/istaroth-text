Camac: My friend, could I borrow you for just a moment to ask you a question?

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy at the moment...
Camac: Hey, it's not that kind of question!
Camac: Just purely out of curiosity, are you a fan of carrots?

## Talk

Traveler: Hmm, I've got other matters to attend to at the moment...
Camac: Oh, no worries. See you around.

Traveler: They're alright. Very nutritious.
Camac: Aha, I knew it! There are still people out there who appreciate the miracle that is the humble carrot.
Camac: Whenever anyone asks me how I keep my eyes so sharp, I always tell them to eat carrots.
Camac: But most of them just shake their heads and say something like, even if the only alternative was drinking the Masters of the Night-Wind's potions, they'd still choose the latter.
Camac: I don't think they taste that bad though...
Camac: My friend, I'm very touched to hear you say that. I sometimes wonder if there's a god of carrots out there somewhere... If there is, he'll surely be looking out for you.

Traveler: I find them questionable. They taste like soil...
Camac: O—Oh...
Camac: Sorry, I look a bit disappointed, don't I? Don't mind me, it's not your fault.
Camac: As a competition referee, I respect everyone's right to love or hate carrots as they so choose.
Camac: I just didn't expect that there were so many people out there who hated them so vehemently. Almost eight or nine out of ten, if you'd believe it...
Camac: I can't say for sure that my good eyesight is all down to my love for carrots, but surely a vegetable that's such a lovely color must be doing something right... right?

Traveler: Can't judge a book by its cover...
Camac: Ah, now that you mention it... There's definitely some people who look cute enough, but are real difficult to get along with...
Camac: Err, I'm not talking about anyone specifically, alright?
Camac: *cough* Anyway, back to food... What do people who aren't fond of carrots generally eat? Meat?
