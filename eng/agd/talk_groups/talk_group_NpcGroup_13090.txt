Grand Rook Sennichi: What the? That Oni is really strong! And he's full of righteous words... How can there be such people in this world?
Traveler: We're here to teach you a lesson!
Grand Rook Sennichi: What's the matter? Don't look down on me! If you can't knock that guy down a peg or two, you're definitely no match for me!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Grand Rook Sennichi: The Grandmaster? Why do you ask?
Grand Rook Sennichi: You should never mess with him! You can't win him in a debate, and you probably can't defeat him in beetle fighting either.
Paimon: "Probably" can't defeat him? Huh, you're sounding a little less arrogant than before. Looks like Bull-Chucker taught you a little lesson!
Grand Rook Sennichi: How could you say that? I lost to him, fair and square. I would never be that sore loser who refuses to admit defeat!
Grand Rook Sennichi: I, Grand Rook Sennichi, was outshone by the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King. Even if he wanted me to change my title from "Grand" to "Puny," I'd have no objection at all!
Grand Rook Sennichi: And since you're his friends, maybe you can put the Grandmaster in a tough spot in a way I never thought of...
Paimon: Hehe, that was a very clever thing to say! You don't seem like one of those bone-headed bad guys.
Grand Rook Sennichi: That's what the Grandmaster taught me.
Grand Rook Sennichi: I used to go unnoticed, just a punk who got into fights with other people, looking down on this and that...
Grand Rook Sennichi: The Grandmaster introduced me to this kid's game. He told me that pride and ruthlessness isn't enough. If I can't even win in beetle fighting, it'd mean that I'm less than a child.
Grand Rook Sennichi: So for a long time, I've been using beetle fighting as a way to prove myself.
Grand Rook Sennichi: However, you and the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King showed up. It made me wonder if I had been a little impetuous, and misunderstood the true meaning behind beetle fighting...
Paimon: Well, you should think long and hard about that! It's one thing to prove yourself, but it's also important to enjoy the game.
Traveler: Goodbye!
Grand Rook Sennichi: Eh... Let's settle this next time!
