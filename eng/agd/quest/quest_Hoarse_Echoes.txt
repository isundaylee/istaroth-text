# Hoarse Echoes


## Talk 1

Paimon: The tracks end at this cliff... Could the Tepetlisaur have climbed up the mountain?
Paimon: Let's head up there and see.

## Talk 2

Cheven: Here we are. Nice house, right? Gimme a sec, I'll go knock.
Cheven: Tlazolli, open up! They're here!
Cheven: ...Tlazolli? Are you home? Open the door!
Cheven: That's strange... Huh, the door's locked, but she shouldn't be out at this time of day.
Cheven: Hey, Nechca? Nechca? It's me, Cheven. Open up, please.
Traveler: (No response...)
Cheven: Still, I told Tlazolli we were coming... Maybe she had to take Nechca out to get some medicine?
Paimon: Hey, what's that over there? Looks like a Tepetlisaur nest.
Cheven: That's right. Tlazolli has a Tepetlisaur companion. If I remember right, its name is... Iengu?
Cheven: When she was still in the forging business, she'd often have Iengu help with some digging work.
Cheven: But since Nechca fell ill, she hasn't let it dig much recently...
Cheven: Wait a minute. What the...? This place is a mess! Iengu's nowhere to be seen, either.
Paimon: Whoa, look at all these broken boxes! Something terrible must have happened...
Traveler: Let's take a closer look.
Traveler: You stay here, Cheven.
Cheven: Oh... Alright! I'll just... find a place to hide for now!
Cheven: How is it that every single time Imix tells me not to go someplace dangerous, I end up running into danger? It's like her words have some sort of power over me... Maybe it's the Wayob's doing.
Traveler: Need me to break down the door?
Paimon: What if something happened to the two of them? What if Nechca got worse again...
Cheven: Let's not overthink things. They were doing just fine the last time I was here. Nechca was sleeping soundly in her room.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh, there really is a Tepetlisaur up here. Might not be Tlazolli's companion, though...
Traveler: At least it doesn't seem to be in any danger.
Paimon: Huh... Paimon still doesn't see any sign of Tlazolli...
Cheven: #Hey, Traveler! Paimon!
Paimon: That's Cheven's voice!
Traveler: Looks like there's someone next to her.
Cheven: Come down, quick! Tlazolli's here!
Paimon: Huh? We just got up here, and Tlazolli's back already? What a coincidence...
Traveler: Either way, let's get down there.
Paimon: Huh? Why's the Tepetlisaur coming along — Whoa, hey, hey, don't run, you'll hit us!
Black Screen Text: You descend the mountain with the Tepetlisaur...
Tlazolli: Iengu, come here... Are you being naughty again?
Iengu: Roar...
Tlazolli: That's a good Saurian. You must be hungry. Sorry... I'll whip up something for you later.
Tlazolli: Alright, run along and play now. I'll come along in a sec.
Iengu: Roar!
Tlazolli: Sorry, you two. I was waiting for you at home when Nechca... Well, she snuck out and ran off by herself.
Tlazolli: She said she just wanted to pick some flowers for our guests.
Tlazolli: But, she ended up getting lost along the way... Luckily, I managed to find her before long.
Traveler: Is she alright?
Paimon: Yeah, Cheven told us she was just starting to get better...
Tlazolli: She's still very weak. The shock and the cold wind certainly didn't help, so she ended up with a slight fever. I gave her some medicine, and now she's in bed.
Tlazolli: But, it's nothing a good night's rest can't fix.
Tlazolli: That said, she won't be able to meet you today. I'm sorry you came all this way for nothing.
Paimon: Don't worry about it! We know she's still recovering. Cheven told us how serious her illness was.
Paimon: Her health definitely comes first! We were just dropping by to check on her.
Traveler: Is she all better now?
Tlazolli: ...Well, she can at least speak to me and go about her day normally.
Tlazolli: That's already more than I could ask for...
Cheven: Hey, cheer up! This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Cheven: We do appreciate that she tried to welcome us with flowers. Anyway, Tlazolli, about the thing I was telling you before...
Traveler: The gift!
Paimon: Yeah! What did you get us?
Tlazolli: Well, it's a Blazegem Inscription. I made it from the purest ore, so it's almost completely resistant to erosion.
Tlazolli: The techniques used to make it are all rooted in Ancient Name forging.
Traveler: So, it's like a simplified version of an Ancient Name?
Tlazolli: Heh, don't say that, or the Wayob might smite me. The process just uses a few of the same techniques and materials.
Tlazolli: When I first made one, I didn't think it could serve any practical purpose, apart from the erosion resistance and the general aesthetic.
Tlazolli: But, then Cheven suggested using these crystals to make a special kind of "ornament"...
Cheven: "Blazegem Inscriptions made by an Ancient Name artisan, engraved with words that never fade."
Cheven: Quite the sales pitch, don't you think?
Paimon: Wow, that description really does make it seem special...
Traveler: You've got a good eye for business...
Cheven: Haha, Tlazolli's Blazegem Inscriptions really are special, though.
Cheven: Word of mouth isn't always reliable. As information gets passed along, it becomes incomplete, forgotten, and, sometimes... even distorted.
Cheven: But the words inscribed on these crystals will stand the test of time. The inscription will never deteriorate, and the meaning will never get twisted.
Cheven: It's the perfect gift for a dear friend or significant other. You could even pass it down to younger generations!
Traveler: You're really pushing the sales pitch.
Paimon: #Paimon's interested! Let's buy one, Traveler! We can engrave our names onto it!
Paimon: #Then, once we find your sister, we can get her to add her name, as well.
Paimon: That way, our names will be together forever, hehe.
Traveler: Looks like Paimon's already been hooked...
Cheven: You deserve it! You saved me and Nechca's birthday present. It's the least I can do to repay you.
Tlazolli: Cheven, I thought I told you—
Cheven: Don't you start acting shy too, Tlazolli! It's a great gift! I know how much work goes into one of your Blazegem Inscriptions.
Tlazolli: Well, then... Thank you both. I'll have it ready as soon as possible. Then, I'll have you do the inscription yourself.
Tlazolli: Nechca should be well by then. She'll be very excited to meet you.
Traveler: Good things are better with company...
Paimon: Whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't even know how expensive that would be. You sure we have enough travel funds?
Paimon: Hold on... this isn't part of some scheme to make us spend all our Mora, right Cheven?
Cheven: You never know... You do look like you have some savings to spare...
Paimon: #No! Don't listen to that, Traveler! You'll end up losing all your Mora!
Cheven: Haha! In any case, it's up to you.
Iengu: Roar!
Paimon: Oh no, it's the Tepetlisaur again! Quick, someone stop it! Paimon doesn't wanna get run over again!
Traveler: Whoa! There, there!
Iengu: Roar...
Cheven: Also, if you don't mind, Tlazolli, I'd like you to help me repair my Blazegem Inscription.
Cheven: I dropped it when I was attacked earlier. The rope and clasp both snapped, so I haven't been wearing it.
Cheven: I tried to fix it myself, but I just couldn't get it to stay. Could you help?
Tlazolli: Just leave it to me. I'll make it as good as new.
Tlazolli: ...Thank you, Cheven... for going all that way, and—
Cheven: It was nothing. We all just want Nechca to get better.
Tlazolli: ...You're right.
Tlazolli: Iengu! Behave yourself! I'll feed you in just a second!
Tlazolli: #I'll have Cheven contact you once everything's ready, Traveler.
Tlazolli: Maybe we'll even line it up with Nechca's birthday. We could even have a little party.
Paimon: That sounds great! We'll look forward to all the good food, and we'll make sure we're ready to eat!
Paimon: Anyway, see you around, Tlazolli!
Traveler: See you.
Tlazolli: Look after yourselves!
Tlazolli: Nechca... is going to be so happy to meet you.
Traveler: I hope Nechca gets better soon.
Traveler: Might as well buy a few more as gifts...
Traveler: That sounds a little too precious...
Traveler: You're very persuasive...
Paimon: #Yeah, let's get one! We can engrave our names onto it. Then, once we find your sister, she can add her name, as well!
Traveler: No wonder you run your own store...
Traveler: Alright! Let's hear it!
Traveler: Sounds like she's doing well enough to run off on her own, too.
Tlazolli: Yes, and to run away from eating her vegetables. She's a fast one, that's for sure.
Tlazolli: She jumps over the chairs, hides under the table... then runs all around the house. I can hardly catch her.
Tlazolli: Seeing how she is now... That's already enough. I really couldn't ask for more...
Traveler: Yeah, quite a coincidence...
Paimon: Well, guess this means we should head back down.
Traveler: Seems like it got up there on its own...?
