Traveler: Budget?
Shatir: Yeah, the budgets.
Shatir: Sadly, even great things like knowledge can be thwarted by money.
Shatir: The Akademiya has been spending more and more budgets on classified research over the past years.
Shatir: Instead of maintaining a financial black hole, they should fund more practical disciplines like archaeology.
Shatir: With a lack of self-reflection on history, we would get a short end in real life sooner or later.
Shatir: Next time I apply for funding, I must get Vikram to join me!
