Traveler: About the medical history...
Khayyam: Medical history? Medical history...
Khayyam: Oh! You saw it? My medical history?
Khayyam: Haha... You saw it, huh... You saw it.
Khayyam: They said I would forget everything in the end. I would forget everything I learned in my life, forget my best friend... everyone and everything.
Khayyam: When that day comes, I will lose my memory, my everything, my sense of being alive. Then I'll forget why I exist. I am destined to be like that... sooner or later...
Khayyam: So until then, at least until then... I want to do what I want. Just stay in the place I want to die in.
Khayyam: Forgetting cannot stop my steps, and neither can Siman...
