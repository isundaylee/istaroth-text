# A Wangshan Walk to Remember


## Talk 1

Wen the Fourth: (No... How can you take those antiques out without maintaining them!? What if...)
Huang the Third: (Hey, you don't get it... If I did that, and people saw that the paint was new, would they still be willing to come play... I mean, come train!? The sense of history is... whatchamacallit... Hey!)
Huang the Third: (...And anyway, the two of us don't have that much spare cash...)

## Talk 2

Huang the Third: Simply incredible! This way next, please.

## Talk 3

Huang the Third: #Not bad! Your skill is truly extraordinary, {M#Young Hero}{F#Young Heroine}!

Huang the Third: Behold the Plumwatcher Piles, passed down by Grand Master Guhua!
Huang the Third: It was upon these stones that Grand Master Guhua practiced back in the day, diligently cultivating the technique to become a true master! Over there, the ancient trees were also planted by our founder's hand...
Paimon: Wow, they're all at crazy angles, and some are even broken in half...
Traveler: It's probably due to years of disrepair and neglect...
Huang the Third: Ahem... Of course not! It's merely to increase the difficulty of the training, nothing more! After all, there won't be neat stone piles to step on in a real battle, will there?
Paimon: Nobody would step on one of these things in a real fight either!
Huang the Third: #...In any case! For the first trial, I ask that you step on the stone piles in the order I specify within the allotted time, {NICKNAME}. Show me what you've got!
Traveler: Heh, piece of cake!
Huang the Third: #Alright then. You're up, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: This is so troublesome...
Paimon: #C'mon, {NICKNAME}, you've got this! If you wanna get the treasure... Ahem, Paimon means, if you wanna pass the trial, you've gotta be willing to put in the effort!

## Talk 5

Huang the Third: Behold the Plumwatcher Piles, passed down by Grand Master Guhua himself!
Huang the Third: It was upon these stones that Grand Master Guhua practiced back in the day, diligently cultivating the technique to become a true master! Over there, the ancient trees were also planted by our founder's hand...
Paimon: Wow, they're all at crazy angles, and some are even broken in half...
Traveler: It's probably due to years of disrepair and neglect...
Huang the Third: Ahem... Of course not! It's merely to increase the difficulty of the training, nothing more! After all, there won't be neat stone piles to step on in a real battle, will there?

Huang the Third: #Alright then. You're up, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: This is so troublesome...
Paimon: #C'mon, {NICKNAME}, you've got this! If you wanna get the treasure... Ahem, Paimon means, if you wanna pass the trial, you've gotta be willing to put in the effort!

## Talk 6

Huang the Third: Okay! Almost there, one last step!

## Talk 7

Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}, what are you doing?

## Talk 8

Huang the Third: #Not bad, that's exactly it! You truly are wise and farsighted beyond ordinary folk, {M#Young Hero}{F#Young Heroine}, and you have superb skill, too!

## Talk 9

Huang the Third: Behold! This is the arsenal of Wangshan Hall! Spears, swords, halberds... Anything you can think of, you'll find it here!
Paimon: Anything and everything?
Huang the Third: Ah. As ever, this is such a wondrous sight! Although only a few shields and spears remain, I'm sure the grand scenes of the past are already flashing before your eyes!

## Talk 10

Huang the Third: I'm not sure what delicacy you've prepared, but I'll just wait over here!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Um, Huang the Third... The way you're walking...
Huang the Third: Haha! How embarrassing! Anyway, this is the Guhua Clan's secret movement technique — Soaring Swallow! Forgive me for not showing it to you earlier, but it's a rule of our clan...
Paimon: Um, Paimon just wanted to ask... You're shaking like a leaf all of a sudden. Are you not feeling well? Or do you just need a break...

## Talk 12

Huang the Third: Behold, the lifeblood of our clan for a millennium — Wangshan Hall!
Traveler: Wow!
Huang the Third: When Grand Master Guhua founded our clan, this was a place of untold majesty where great heroes from all over gathered in merriment and endless song...
Huang the Third: Even the realm of the adepti pales in comparison to Wangshan Hall!
Paimon: Hmm... Speaking of which, what does the name mean anyway?
Huang the Third: Haha, I'll tell you! Legend has it that when Grand Master Guhua wandered the world, his sword terrified all bandits, and the countryside boasted of being as peaceful as the city...
Huang the Third: The mountain thieves were as frightened of Guhua as they were of tigers. The tiger is king over the beasts, and thus did the locals under the grand master's protection call this place Wangshan Hall out of respect for his supremacy over the mountains.
Traveler: Oh, I see!
Huang the Third: Ahem... Anyway, for a thousand years since then, the Guhua Clan has tirelessly honed its martial arts techniques here...
Traveler: Ooh!
Huang the Third: Come! I'll show you around. Follow me around this Guhua Sword-Honing Stone...
Paimon: #({NICKNAME}, {NICKNAME}, keep your eyes peeled! Maybe we'll find some clues concerning the treasures!)
Traveler: (Honed this place into the ground, more like...)
Traveler: Wouldn't it have been called something like Mighty Tiger Mountain then?
Paimon: That's super weird! Wangshan Hall sounds way cooler!
Traveler: (Is this really it? It looks like it's seen better days...)

## Talk 13

Huang the Third: #What do you think? If you've seen enough of this place, shall I bring you to the next spot, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Sure, let's go.
Traveler: Not so fast. I'd like to get a closer look around...

## Talk 14

Paimon: Huh? There seems to be a censer here.
Huang the Third: Haha, good eye! The memorial tablet of our ancestral founder, Guhua, is enshrined here!
Huang the Third: Our grand master traveled the world, and the only reason the clan has lasted a thousand years is because the world admires his virtue and remembers him with gratitude.
Huang the Third: This tablet is here to remind future generations of our clan to never forget the teachings of our ancestors... To help those in need and bring peace to the people.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Huh? Why is this locked?
Huang the Third: Haha, this is the Arcane Archive, where all the ancient mysteries and secrets of the Guhua Clan are hidden, so only our own disciples are allowed within.
Paimon: Is that so... This is as far as we go, then!
Huang the Third: Alright! That concludes the tour of Wangshan Hall!
Paimon: Huh? It's over already? What about the treasures?
Huang the Third: Haha, treasure isn't something you just randomly find! You know, in all these centuries, many a disciple has sought out the grand master's treasures, but none have succeeded...
Paimon: Oh... In that case, let's take another look around nearby!
Huang the Third: Not so fast! If you wish to continue exploring our clan's secrets, you must follow its rules with a show of good faith.
Huang the Third: Take Grand Master Guhua for example — in his time, disciples who wished to master spear and sword also had to pay tuition...
Paimon: Huh!? But we're not disciples!
Traveler: What she said!
Paimon: Paimon's never heard of the Guhua Clan cheating people of their Mora either!
Huang the Third: That's... We're not cheating people of anything! Ahem... We don't need Mora, exactly, but rules are rules! In Grand Master Guhua's time, it wasn't Mora he accepted, but rice and salted meat...
Paimon: Huh? So, you want food, not money?
Huang the Third: Well... *sigh* Fine, if you don't have Mora, you can just make me something to eat! That's what our predecessors did. As a great hero, surely that's within your means?
Huang the Third: #After all, we value a helping hand in times of need. It's all up to you, as long as it's from the heart. I have no intention of extorting you, {NICKNAME} — I just wouldn't want you to have a guilty conscience!
Traveler: I certainly am a great hero of our times...
Paimon: #No, {NICKNAME}! Don't let him get to you!
Paimon: Hmph, you just want something to eat, don't you!? We'll make you something to eat!
Paimon: #({NICKNAME}, {NICKNAME}! Paimon has an idea!)
Traveler: (Oh? What is it?)
Paimon: (Hehe... You'll see! Follow Paimon's lead!)
Traveler: And if my conscience is clear?
Huang the Third: You, you...
Traveler: We agreed there'd be no fee!

## Talk 16

Paimon: Hmph! Didn't he say "The Guhua Clan used to accept rice and salted meat"? Then why don't we fulfill his wish, and make him some salted meat?
Black Screen Text: Seemingly fired up by the thought, the usually-lazy Paimon begins to set up a campfire all by herself...
Paimon: It's supposed to be a salted dish, so it doesn't really matter how much salt we actually cover this thing with, right?
Paimon: Anyway, let's grill it first...
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon feels a little bad, ruining perfectly good food... No, no, it's too late to feel bad about it now! And either way, it's all that guy's fault!
Paimon: #Now it's time to add the salt! Hehe, Paimon will leave that to you, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: This might be a bit too much...
Paimon: Wh—What do you mean? Hey, if anyone's going a bit too far, wouldn't it be that guy? He tricked us into coming here with the promise of treasure, and even wanted us to cook for him for free!
Paimon: #Someone like that has to be taught a lesson! If he doesn't learn that what he's doing is wrong, he will just continue to scam other people once we leave this place! Isn't that right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: (Add a small pinch of salt.)
Paimon: There's no need to be stingy! You can add more, like this—
Traveler: (Add two pinches of salt.)
Paimon: Yep, now that's more like it! Keep going!
Traveler: (Add two pinches of salt.)
Traveler: (Add three pinches of salt.)
Traveler: (Add four pinches of salt!)
Paimon: Forget it, doing it like this takes too long... Why don't we just dump all the rest of the stuff in?
Traveler: Alright, you're the boss...
Paimon: Woohoo! It's done! This is Paimon's specialty salted meat dish!
Traveler: Truly mouthwatering!
Paimon: Choke-full of karma!
Paimon: Anyway, let's bring this to Huang the Third right away!
Traveler: I could have sworn I also saw something strange get added in...
Paimon: Eh, it was probably nothing!
Traveler: Then let's dump everything in!
Traveler: (Add a "proper amount" of salt!)
Traveler: (Add four pinches of salt!)
Traveler: (Add three pinches of salt.)
Traveler: (Add a small pinch of salt.)

## Talk 17

Paimon: Huang the Third! We're back!
Huang the Third: #Oh! You sure work quickly, {NICKNAME}! In just the blink of an eye, you've already prepared such a sumptuous dish!
Traveler: Haha, it's nothing!
Traveler: I suppose you could call it a "sumptuous dish"...

## Talk 18

Black Screen Text: Huang the Third takes a bite out of Paimon's special salted meat dish...

Black Screen Text: Huang the Third takes a bite out of Paimon's special salted meat dish...
Before his muscles have finished masticating the first mouthful, he has already pushed the plate of meat aside, and made a mad dash to the nearby pond, where he ingurgitates several large gulps of water...
Huang the Third: ...Erk! Wh—What's this!?
Traveler: Nice moves!
Paimon: That's... That's right! No wonder they call you the Cloudpiercing Arrow, Huang the Third! We could barely keep up...
Paimon: Wait, that's not the point! This is our specially-made salted meat dish, our "helping hand in times of need"! This came from our hearts, just as you asked!
Huang the Third: You...!
Traveler: Save it, I knew what you were up to from the start.
Paimon: Hmph, that's right! And Paimon bets all that talk about the treasures was just to bum a free meal! Do you really think you can outrun the Millelith?
Huang the Third: Hold on a moment! Don't get the Millelith involved, please! I'm a martial artist and a proper, senior member of the Guhua Clan! If a man my age went to jail for scamming tourists, I'd never outlive the shame of it!
Paimon: If you had any shame, you wouldn't have scammed anyone at all!
Huang the Third: Besides, I wasn't lying... There may not be "12 Secret Chambers" in Wangshan Hall, but the relic really does exist! We modern disciples just don't know where it is.
Paimon: What's the difference? Hmph! We're gonna tell the Millelith that you're a mean old man who's deliberately swindling tourists, cheating them out of their food, and... and...
Huang the Third: Okay, okay! I've received a lot of tourists in my time here, but hardly any as honest as you two...
Huang the Third: How about this, to repay you for not reporting me to the authorities, I'll make an exception. I'll give you the key to the library. There are countless secret martial arts books in there. Surely they also count as "treasures"?
Black Screen Text: Huang the Third produces a big set of keys...
Paimon: Uh, and these keys are...?
Huang the Third: They're all the same, they're all spare keys to the library.
Paimon: Why do you have so many spares?
Huang the Third: Haha, at my age, I'm afraid I'll lose them. Here, take this one.
Traveler: But if you lost one, wouldn't you lose them all?
Paimon: That's right... Wait a minute, we were just threatening to report you. Why are you suddenly giving us something so important?
Traveler: True, especially if they're the genuine secret texts of the Guhua Clan...
Huang the Third: ...To be honest, the tourists from before paid in Mora, which I used to maintain the things buried here.
Huang the Third: Not that there's much left of the Guhua Clan now... The only ones left here who still have any desire to return and keep things running are a few of us old folks.
Huang the Third: It's just a shame. At our age, we have the will, but not the strength... You two saw how run-down the place is. The most we can do now is keep the dust at bay.
Huang the Third: Haha. If Grand Master Guhua were still around, I'm sure he'd laugh at our powerlessness.
Paimon: Huang the Third...
Huang the Third: But the Guhua Clan's thousand-year legacy can't just be buried along with us old folks, can it? I can tell that you're good people... and good people are hard to come by these days.
Huang the Third: Your willingness to humor an old fool like me brought some life back into this place... The way I see it, better these books be entrusted to you than left to rot in this place.
Traveler: I see.
Huang the Third: Haha... Anyway, that's enough of this sentimental talk. Let's just say I'm giving the key to you so you won't report me.
Huang the Third: #{NICKNAME}... No, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}, you may stay here as long as you like. As for the books in the library... Take any that catch your eye.
Huang the Third: Help yourself, alright?
Traveler: Fine...
Traveler: Aren't you worried we might actually be bad people?
Traveler: You were planning to pull a fast one on us as if we were ordinary tourists, weren't you?
Traveler: Um, you're welcome?
Paimon: Hehe, this is our "helping hand in times of need"! This came from our hearts, just as you asked!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Huang the Third: Such extraordinary technique! You moved like a swallow in flight, with not a droplet of water staining your wings. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!
Traveler: Heh, it was nothing!
Paimon: Hmm... Does using a wind glider count as a technique?
Huang the Third: Haha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.
Huang the Third: I ask you this: When a wandering hero strides out and brings bandits and thieves alike to justice, was it their skill that deserves credit, or their sword's?
Paimon: Uh... The hero's skill, of course!
Huang the Third: Correct! Even the sharpest blade is ineffective in the hands of one who knows not how to wield it.
Huang the Third: #It is by this same reasoning that {NICKNAME} could use {M#his}{F#her} wind glider so superbly. This is the kind of mastery we strive for in Guhua martial arts!
Paimon: Hmm, that does make sense. But it also doesn't make sense at all...
Huang the Third: #With that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, {NICKNAME}! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!
Traveler: I won't lose!
Paimon: That's right, and Paimon will be cheering you on!
Traveler: I almost fell...

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: #Whoa, {NICKNAME}, are you okay?
Traveler: *sniff* I fell because I wasn't looking...
Huang the Third: Such extraordinary technique! You moved with remarkable finesse, like a swallow in flight. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!
Traveler: ???
Paimon: #Huh? What are you talking about? {NICKNAME} fell right into the water! Good thing {M#he}{F#she} can swim...
Huang the Third: Haha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: You see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.
Huang the Third: But how could a few stone piles gauge the limits of your extraordinary technique? Doubtless, you intentionally went off the beaten path and dropped into the water to display your true skill...
Huang the Third: You fell exactly above the array's core, and as you swam back ashore, you perfectly undid said array. Others may not understand these profundities, but how could it ever escape me, the Cloudpiercing Arrow?
Traveler: You are wise indeed!
Paimon: Eh... Are you two being serious?
Huang the Third: #With that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, {NICKNAME}! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!
Traveler: I won't lose!
Paimon: No, but you didn't win either!
Traveler: Are you for real?
Traveler: It's all because these poles are too dang slippery!
Paimon: Come on, be careful! *sigh* It's a good thing there's only water under these poles... Had it been solid ground, you probably would have gotten hurt.

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Woah, time's up already...
Traveler: *sniff* We were so close...
Huang the Third: Such extraordinary technique! You moved like a swallow in flight, with not a droplet of water staining your wings. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!
Traveler: ???
Paimon: Wait! How the heck did you come to that conclusion!? It wasn't completed at all!
Huang the Third: Haha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: You see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.
Huang the Third: #Let me ask you a question. Did your companion lose {M#his}{F#her} footing and fall into the water?
Paimon: Well... No...
Huang the Third: #And that is where the secret lies! If the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the wooden piles, then it would have been a piece of cake with {NICKNAME}'s agility.
Huang the Third: But the great do not allow themselves to be bound by rules!
Huang the Third: #Just clearing the first few wooden piles was enough to prove {NICKNAME}'s skill, and standing firm afterward demonstrated uncompromising will! An admirable combination of integrity and skill, indeed!
Traveler: Exactly!
Paimon: Eh... Are you two being serious?
Huang the Third: #With that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, {NICKNAME}! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!
Traveler: Haha! Defeat is impossible!
Paimon: No, but you didn't win either!
Traveler: Just staying out of the water is considered a success?

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Hey! Why are you just standing there?
Traveler: I, er, got distracted...
Paimon: Oh, come on, how could you get distracted at a time like this?
Huang the Third: Excellent! Only a true hero like you could have immediately seen through the true essence of this trial!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Traveler: ???
Huang the Third: #If the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the stone piles, then I'm sure {NICKNAME}'s agility would have made short work of it.
Huang the Third: #But {NICKNAME} stood still on the spot. Now, why is that?
Paimon: #Uh... Because {M#he}{F#she} was distracted...?
Huang the Third: Haha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.
Huang the Third: You see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.
Huang the Third: #As our predecessors once said, the prudent should foresee danger and take precautions. This is exactly what they meant! And {NICKNAME} would rather give up on the trial than betray this principle. Truly admirable!
Traveler: You are wise indeed!
Paimon: Eh... Are you two being serious?
Huang the Third: #With that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, {NICKNAME}! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!
Traveler: I won't lose!
Paimon: You didn't even try!
Traveler: Are you for real?
Traveler: It's, uh, just really high up...
Paimon: You say that, but Paimon doesn't think you've ever been scared of heights before...
Huang the Third: Excellent! Only a true hero like you could have immediately seen through the true essence of this trial!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Traveler: ???
Huang the Third: #If the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the stone piles, then I'm sure {NICKNAME}'s agility would have made short work of it.
Huang the Third: #But {NICKNAME} stood still on the spot. Now, why is that?
Paimon: #Uh... Because {M#he}{F#she} was afraid...?

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: #Whoa, {NICKNAME}, are you okay?
Traveler: *sniff* I fell because I wasn't looking...
Huang the Third: Excellent! Who knew you could hold your breath underwater for so long and still seem so alive after being fished out... No, you're completely fine! A true hero indeed!
Traveler: ???
Paimon: #What do you mean, holding {M#his}{F#her} breath underwater!? {M#He}{F#She} clearly swallowed a ton of water down there!
Huang the Third: Haha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.
Huang the Third: I ask you this: When a wandering hero strides out and brings bandits and thieves alike to justice, was it their skill that deserves credit, or their sword's?
Paimon: Uh... The hero's skill, of course... Wait! What has that go to do with anything?
Huang the Third: Everything! Everyone knows that holding your breath in the open air is part of the basics while holding your breath underwater is the supreme technique!
Huang the Third: #As they say, the form of martial arts is fluid, and anything can be a sword. Even flowers and leaves can harm others. {NICKNAME}'s mastery, therefore, is truly admirable!
Traveler: Exactly!
Paimon: Uh... Nothing you said seems to have any connection with that...
Huang the Third: You see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.
Huang the Third: Since you've displayed an extraordinary ability to hold your breath, you've been tested sufficiently and sufficient!
Paimon: This makes no sense at all!
Huang the Third: #With that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, {NICKNAME}! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!
Traveler: I won't lose!
Paimon: What are you so happy about!?
Traveler: I have no idea myself...
Traveler: Well, now I can say I've definitely drunk enough!
Paimon: Hey, that's not something to be proud of! You could've gotten hurt there! Seriously, take better care of yourself!

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: Woohoo! That means we've successfully cleared the stage, right?
Traveler: It was a piece of cake!
Huang the Third: A—Amazing! You effortlessly defeated all the targets with outstanding speed and accuracy! Even among our disciples, few can ever hope to rival you!
Huang the Third: Are you the master of another clan, here on some secret visit?
Traveler: Indeed. I'm, in truth, the master of the Paimon Clan...
Paimon: ?
Huang the Third: Oh! You're the Pai... Uh... So you're the master of another clan! It is an honor to meet you, an honor indeed!
Paimon: #What in the world... That's enough nonsense, {NICKNAME}! Identifying targets is child's play to combat veterans like us!
Huang the Third: #Hahaha! I would expect nothing less from someone as skilled as you, {NICKNAME}!
Huang the Third: Anyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!
Paimon: Hehe! Wangshan Hall's treasures, here we come!
Traveler: ...Huh?
Paimon: Nah... Identifying targets is just child's play to combat veterans like us!
Traveler: What a chore... There shouldn't be anything else after this, right?

### Additional Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa, we accidentally hit one of those dummies in blue!
Paimon: There goes the stage, and the treasure with it...
Traveler: That didn't count! Again!
Huang the Third: A—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: #The dummies in blue {NICKNAME} just hit were the spies hiding among us!
Paimon: Hmm... How could you tell?
Huang the Third: Haha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside. How could they be distinguished by appearance alone?
Huang the Third: #Yet, {NICKNAME} saw through their appearance and peered into their very nature! Such perception truly is the pinnacle of skill!
Traveler: Exactly!
Paimon: #Wait! Just wait! Dummies don't have a "nature"! And you, {NICKNAME}! Stop looking so smug! It was just an accident, wasn't it!?
Huang the Third: Anyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!
Paimon: Th—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!
Traveler: Are you even listening to yourself right now...
Traveler: It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!

### Additional Talk 8

Paimon: Whoa, we accidentally hit one of those dummies in blue!
Paimon: We also didn't manage to hit all the ones in red... There goes the stage, and also the treasure...
Traveler: That didn't count! Again!
Huang the Third: A—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: #The dummies in blue {NICKNAME} just hit were the impostors hiding among us! And the dummies in red that were spared? They were our undercover agents!
Paimon: Hmm... and how could you tell?
Huang the Third: Haha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside. How could they be distinguished by appearance alone?
Huang the Third: #Yet, {NICKNAME} saw through their appearance and peered into their very nature! Such perception truly is the pinnacle of skill!
Traveler: Exactly!
Paimon: #Wait! Just wait! Dummies don't have a "nature"! And you, {NICKNAME}! Stop looking so smug! It was just an accident, wasn't it!?
Huang the Third: Anyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!
Paimon: Th—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!
Traveler: Are you even listening to yourself right now...
Traveler: It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!

### Additional Talk 9

Paimon: Woah, time's up...
Paimon: There goes the stage, and the treasure with it...
Traveler: That didn't count! Again!
Huang the Third: A—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: #The dummies in red that {NICKNAME} just spared were our undercover agents! Hitting them by accident would be no different from hitting ourselves on the head!
Paimon: U—Undercover agents? How could you tell?
Huang the Third: Haha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside. How could they be distinguished by appearance alone?
Huang the Third: #Yet, {NICKNAME} saw through their appearance and peered into their very nature! Such perception truly is the pinnacle of skill!
Traveler: Exactly!
Paimon: #Wait! Just wait! Dummies don't have a nature! And you, {NICKNAME}! Stop looking so smug! You just failed to finish them off, right?
Huang the Third: Anyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!
Paimon: Th—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!
Traveler: Are you even listening to yourself right now...
Traveler: It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!

### Additional Talk 10

Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! Why are you just standing there?
Paimon: There goes the stage, and the treasure with it...
Traveler: I lost concentration for a sec, that's all...
Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't know you could zone out even at a time like this...
Huang the Third: Excellent! I've never met someone so understanding and righteous in all my life! I truly admire you!
Paimon: #Wait! There's nothing to admire about that! {NICKNAME} just stood there on the spot!
Huang the Third: Haha! You fail to see beyond the surface of things!
Paimon: ...Huh?
Huang the Third: #{NICKNAME}'s skill is more than enough to instantly take down all those dummies in red. But that is not the Way.
Huang the Third: Some swords in this world take life, and some give it. Taking life is easy, and giving it, hard. And the greatest principle in martial arts is to not kill!
Huang the Third: #While they may be dummies made of bamboo, they still symbolize living beings. {NICKNAME}'s compassion and decision to feign distraction just to protect the innocent, even at the cost of failing the trial... It's truly admirable!
Traveler: Heh!
Paimon: #What the heck is this nonsense... Hey, {NICKNAME}! Stop looking so smug! You were just distracted, weren't you!?
Huang the Third: Anyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!
Paimon: Th—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!
Traveler: Well, I really was distracted...
Huang the Third: Haha! There's no need for humility! I'm fully capable of distinguishing your true intent!
Traveler: Huh? What did you just say?
Paimon: Hey! Stop messing with Paimon!
Traveler: I have no idea which ones I'm supposed to hit...
Paimon: Uh... Well, you do have a point... How are we supposed to know which ones to hit between all the dummies of different colors...

Wen the Fourth: ...
Traveler: Tell me about the trials...
Wen the Fourth: Outsiders who seek to enter Wangshan Hall must pass two trials. This rule has existed since ancient times.
Wen the Fourth: However... Forget it, if my senior thinks it's all right, then I have nothing to say about it. Anyway, there's nothing to worry about. <color=#00E1FFFF>Anyone can pass</color> the trials as they are right now.
Traveler: Huh? What do you mean?
Wen the Fourth: ...You will understand soon enough. Go on, don't let me keep you. My senior is waiting.
Traveler: We'll be on our way then. Goodbye!
Wen the Fourth: Go on, my senior is waiting.

Wen the Fourth: ...Skilled.
Traveler: Huh?
Wen the Fourth: I said you're skilled.
Wen the Fourth: But you need more practice if you seek to further yourself.
Wen the Fourth: I saw the way you moved just now. I won't comment on the details, but it was pretty good overall. I'm certain it will become a great weapon in your arsenal if you work hard on it.
Wen the Fourth: Hah... I may say that, but even now, it far surpasses anything my senior is capable of.
Traveler: Thanks for the compliment.

### Additional Talk 13

Wen the Fourth: ...
Traveler: You seem hesitant to say something...
Wen the Fourth: Forget it... If my senior thinks it's all right, then I have nothing to say about it. So don't ask me.
Wen the Fourth: I never expected our clan to end up in such a state... Yet there is nothing that can be done...
Traveler: Hey! So what do you think about my skill!?

### Additional Talk 14

Wen the Fourth: If you have anything to ask about the Guhua Clan... Feel free to ask me. As for what my senior said... Don't believe everything he says.
Traveler: Tell me about Wangshan Hall...
Wen the Fourth: Wangshan Hall is the main house of the Guhua Clan and where Grand Master Guhua attained enlightenment.
Wen the Fourth: Now, it is in ruins and unusable... Besides my senior and I, no one else remains to guard this place.
Wen the Fourth: Even our current Master merely visits occasionally.
Traveler: So, what's the clan's history...
Wen the Fourth: The Guhua Clan was once known as the Guhua Brotherhood. We looked up to the chivalry of Grand Master Guhua and traveled the world with our swords and spears... Our mastery of both was known to all.
Wen the Fourth: Sigh... But as time passed, the clan's glory was no more...
Traveler: Mastery over spear and sword?
Wen the Fourth: Exactly. The Guhua Clan has three ultimate techniques — Light Piercer, Rain Cutter, and Life Ender. The three were known as the Three Guhua Greats.
Wen the Fourth: Life Ender is a unique fusion of sword and spear, and it is why the Guhua Clan is known to have mastery over both.
Wen the Fourth: It is said that Life Ender could slice wind, split waves, and destroy mountains. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to witness it for myself.
Wen the Fourth: Later on, during the time of the 11th Master... Yingmin, the one known as the Piercing Blade, felt that these techniques were too difficult to master and unsuitable for widespread study. Slight modifications were made to develop a new set of entry-level techniques...
Wen the Fourth: And the outcome of that was... Few were willing to give up the easily attainable for hard work, and fewer and fewer were willing to meditate and spend decades on the original teachings of Grand Master Guhua...
Wen the Fourth: As time flashed by, our three ultimate techniques gradually became legendary, yet their power was ever-weakening. Our clan's vigor wound up declining and faith in it was lost... A shame. A shame, indeed...
Traveler: I see...
Traveler: Tell me about the Guhua Clan...
Wen the Fourth: Grand Master Guhua was our founder, but not the clan's first master.
Wen the Fourth: The grand master was a wandering hero who brought peace and justice to the people while traveling the world. He never intended to start a clan. This place wasn't always known as Wangshan Hall, instead being known as the "Lingmeng Chamber."
Wen the Fourth: After the grand master passed away, Boxuan... better known as Master Baixuan, who once received his favor, established the Guhua Brotherhood in his name and called himself a disciple of Guhua to carry on the grand master's legacy.
Traveler: So they were a self-proclaimed disciple?
Wen the Fourth: Indeed. The grand master never took one.
Wen the Fourth: Unfortunately, the glory of the clan faded with time. We, disciples of future generations, failed the clan. Now, we no longer seek to restore the clan's glory, merely to uphold justice and live up to the grand master's name.
Traveler: And that's why the disciples of the Guhua Clan are spread all over Liyue?
Wen the Fourth: Exactly. After all, there are places in the world where the sun doesn't shine, and we cannot leave everything to Rex Lapis.
Wen the Fourth: But... My only consolation is a promising junior — Xingqiu. If he can restore our former glory... Then we of the older generation can die without regrets.
Traveler: I want to take a look at Wangshan Hall.
Wen the Fourth: ...Forgive me for not accompanying you. Farewell.

### Additional Talk 15

Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: #And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see {NICKNAME}'s performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around in exchange for making you a meal? And I should be pleased about that? Were I a few years younger, I would slay you in one smack...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!
