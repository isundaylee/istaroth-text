## Talk 1

Sefana: *sigh* Is this... the corrosive power of the dark remnants?
Sefana: Such terrible strength... I can't do anything against it no matter how hard I try...
Sorush: It has been some time, Sefana.
Sefana: Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
Sefana: The Sunyata Flowers are saved... Ah, I've been waiting for so long, and hope has finally arrived!
Sefana: You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
Sorush: Don't get so worked up, Sefana! I will help you rescue the Sunyata Flowers, fret not!
Sorush: #This is my Yasnapati, {NICKNAME}, and {M#his}{F#her} companion, Paimon.
Sorush: We have already extinguished the Sign of Apaosha, and have rescued flower ponds from dark corrosion. Leave the ponds under your charge to us.
Paimon: Well, that sure was straightforward! Given what Sefana calls you, you two sure seem like you have a close relationship!
Sorush: Close? I would not say so... though we did spend some time together and share some experiences...
Sefana: Hmm, while I'm not sure why you're speaking a little differently, Sorush, I'll have you two know that she took great care of me in the past!
Sefana: She said before the Sunyata Flower... "I shall be Simurgh's equal"... They encouraged me more than any teachings might.
Sefana: From that day on, I have believed that her will was most commendable.
Sefana: That's why I decided to follow the human custom of addressing one's elders when it comes to her, to show my respect!
Paimon: That sure gets Paimon thinking. Ah, she can see it now...
Sorush: St—Stop mentioning things from so long ago!
Traveler: Let's take a quick gander back to our original topic...
Sefana: Right, Sister. Does your Yasnapati not understand much about the Sunyata Flowers? Perhaps I can introduce them, on behalf of the elders...
Sefana: There was a Pari who once sang thus—
Sefana: "This coalescence of color is the miraculous sign of the flowing spring of life"...
Sefana: "Linger here with me, dance and sing with me, let us weave lasting joy"...
Sefana: ...And I've forgotten the rest.
Sefana: I've spent too long trying to clear the defilement that remains in this place. The exhaustion is clouding my mind...
Paimon: Don't push yourself too much! It doesn't matter if you can't remember some quotations. Just say stuff in a more relaxed way!
Sefana: Well then, let me think... Though the Sunyata Flowers are not the most precious thing within the Vourukasha Oasis, they are exceedingly dear companions to our people.
Sefana: Many Pari spend time with those flowers after they've finished their work for the day.
Sefana: It would be like a human growing up alongside those creatures that go "Meow-meow" and "Woof-woof"...
Traveler: You mean cats and dogs?
Paimon: Huh, so that's how it is. Y'know, if Paimon had one of those as a pet for a while, and it got sick, Paimon would be really sad too.
Paimon: Never mind what might happen if it was Paimon's only friend...
Paimon: Paimon understands your urgency now, Sefana. The health of the Sunyata Flowers is definitely important!
Sorush: Hmm... The importance of the Sunyata Flowers is far beyond such. You're still not all that good at analogies, Sefana.
Paimon: Don't worry, we got the message. Since this is a serious issue, and Sorush is being so proactive, let's get going right away!
Traveler: Time to save some pretty flowers!
Sorush: Just wait here for us, Sefana.
Sorush: #{NICKNAME} and I shall rid the Sunyata Flowers of the remaining defilement that plagues them shortly.
Sefana: Th—Thank you all very much!
Sefana: Not only have I troubled Sister Sorush, but also our great Yasnapati... and on our first meeting too... I must prepare some gifts for you in return...
Traveler: Time to save the Pari's pets!
Traveler: So, as for the Sunyata Flowers...

## Talk 2

Paimon: We're back, Sefana!
Sorush: The Sunyata Flowers have been purged of their defilement. You need not worry any longer.
Sefana: That's wonderful, Sister Sorush! You've always been so reliable.
Sefana: #And you too, great Yasnapati {NICKNAME}! I have prepared a gift for you...
Sefana: I picked up some shiny objects while caring for the Sunyata Flowers. I have heard that humans and their meow-meows and woof-woofs love them...
Paimon: Would that be... Mora? Paimon wouldn't mind some if that were the case!
Sefana: What gift could I get you, Sister Sorush?
Sorush: How shallow, Sefana! What I did was out of a commitment to my great work. I require not your tokens of gratitude. You should instead focus on keeping yourself and the Sunyata Flowers in good shape.
Paimon: Sorush means to say that you don't have to feel in debt and... should take good care of yourself? She does sound like a big sister now...
Traveler: Showing love and care doesn't seem to be Sorush's strong suit...
Sorush: Nonsense! I was merely cautioning Sefana not to fail in her duty.
Sorush: To use an analogy that humans can understand, both Sunyata Flowers and Pari hail from the dewdrops of the Harvisptokhm. And that makes us family.
Sorush: The Pari who watch over the Sunyata Flowers are exposed to the constant encroachment of the defilement, so they must be wary of any bodily harm it may incur.
Sorush: Despite Sefana's failings, she has guarded the Sunyata Flowers for a long time, and I shan't simply write her off.
Traveler: "Family"...
Paimon: Whatever the case, you do care about your junior, huh... Maybe there really is a gentle side to you, Sorush!
Sefana: Gentle? Yes, I agree! Although Sister Sorush always says terrible things, she often helps me solve my problems too. She is a caring senior!
Sorush: Preposterous... Such absurd diction is forbidden from now on!
Sorush: And that's all. We still have to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha. Now, enough with the chit-chat. It's time we parted ways with Sefana.
Sorush: Once I carry out the great work of eliminating the power of darkness, the Vourukasha Oasis will recover its pure and pristine hues.
Sefana: Ah, are you leaving now? Then... I wish you the best of luck.
Sefana: #I will wait for you, Sister Sorush, great Yasnapati {NICKNAME}, and the Pale Companion!
Sefana: Next time we meet, I'll tell many, many stories about Sister Sorush to the great Yasnapati and the Pale Companion. Do hear them out!
Sorush: Hmph... I doubt if there will be a "next time." But if you do get to tell my stories, feel free to share anything you know, as it will help flesh out my Yasnapati's record of my great undertakings.
Traveler: In that sense, they are very important, indeed...
Traveler: Maybe she was once very nice to Sefana...

## Talk 3

Sefana: The power of darkness hasn't been fully stopped... But all flower ponds have been purified and regained vitality...
Sefana: What is happening? Is someone helping me?
Sefana: If it's true, maybe the Harvisptokhm has graced me and these ponds with her blessings... How fortunate we are!
Sorush: It has been some time, Sefana.
Sefana: Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
Sefana: You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
Sorush: #Calm down. My comings and goings are not the point. What is important is that I and my Yasnapati, {NICKNAME}, have come to inform you that we've made up for your failings.
Sorush: I pursue the great task of extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha, and along the way, I eliminated this dark corrosion and rescued all our flower ponds. But remember, Sefana, this was on account of your failings!
Sefana: S—So it is all thanks to you, Sister Sorush!
Sefana: I... I am sorry...
Sefana: I cannot thank you enough... I've always had butterflies in my stomach this whole time, and now I can finally breathe easy!
Paimon: Huh, so Sefana calls Sorush "Sister"... But don't you think this big sister is too strict? Ugh, she's so unlovable...
Sorush: Such immaturity! It is the duty of one senior to give pointers to their juniors. How can I speak softly to them in the face of such errors?
Sefana: That... That's right! Sister Sorush has always taken good care of me...
Sefana: The words Sister Sorush said before the Sunyata Flower... "I shall be Simurgh's equal"... They encouraged me more than any teachings might.
Sefana: From that day on, I have believed that her will was most commendable.
Sefana: That's why I decided to follow the human custom of addressing one's elders when it comes to her, to show my respect!
Paimon: What a gentle Pari you are... Paimon can't imagine Sorush getting lectured by another Pari and still calling her "Sister" after that...
Sorush: P—Preposterous!
Traveler: Let's get back on topic, please.
Sefana: Right, Sister. Does your Yasnapati not understand much about the Sunyata Flowers? Perhaps I can introduce them, on behalf of the elders...
Sefana: There was a Pari who once sang thus—
Sefana: "This coalescence of color is the miraculous sign of the flowing spring of life"...
Sefana: "Linger here with me, dance and sing with me, let us weave lasting joy"...
Sefana: ...And I've forgotten the rest.

Paimon: Never mind what might happen if it was Paimon's only friend...
Paimon: Paimon understands now, Sefana. The health of the Sunyata Flowers is definitely important! Our efforts were not in vain!
Sorush: What a shallow, coarse analogy. The importance of the Sunyata Flowers is far beyond such. Your choice of words still requires some work, Sefana.
Sefana: Speaking of, not only have I troubled Sister Sorush, but also our great Yasnapati... and on our first meeting too... I must prepare some gifts for you in return...
Sefana: I picked up some shiny objects while caring for the Sunyata Flowers. I have heard that humans and their meow-meows and woof-woofs love them...
Paimon: Would that be... Mora? Paimon wouldn't mind some if that were the case!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: We're back, Sefana!
Sorush: All the Sunyata Flowers have been revitalized. Fear no more, Sefana.
Sefana: That's wonderful, Sister Sorush! You've always been so reliable all these years.
Sefana: #And you too, great Yasnapati {NICKNAME}! I have prepared a gift for you...
Sefana: I picked up some shiny objects while caring for the Sunyata Flowers. I have heard that humans and their meow-meows and woof-woofs love them...
Paimon: Would that be... Mora? Paimon wouldn't mind some if that were the case!
Sefana: What gift could I get you, Sister Sorush?
Sorush: There's no need, Sefana. Just take care of yourself and the Sunyata Flowers.
Paimon: That's surprisingly nice, and Sorush sounds like a big sister, too... You two do have a close relationship!
Traveler: Are you scared that Sefana may share a story or two about your past...
Sorush: I'm not trying to hide anything! I just genuinely want Sefana to take better care of herself!
Sorush: After all, to use an analogy that humans can understand, both Sunyata Flowers and Pari hail from the dewdrops of the Harvisptokhm. And that makes us family.
Sorush: The Pari who take care of the Sunyata Flowers are under the constant encroachment of the defilement, which is a great burden to bear.
Sorush: Sefana is a tough soul, always shouldering the responsibility on her own. And she's also been respectful to me too. It's only natural that I want to take care of her.
Traveler: "Family"...
Paimon: A caring Sorush, huh — Paimon didn't expect to see this gentle side of you!
Sefana: Gentle? Yes, I agree! Sister Sorush often helps me solve my problems. She is a caring senior!
Sorush: You should refrain from using this absurd way of wording things!
Sorush: Ahem! Anyway, the threats to the Sunyata Flowers have been eliminated! I will pay you and these flowers a visit again someday, Sefana.
Sorush: One day, the embers of the darkness shall be no more, and the pure and pristine colors shall return to the Vourukasha Oasis!
Sefana: Ah, you've got other things to do? Then... best of luck to you!
Sefana: I will always wait here for you, Sister Sorush, the great Yasnapati, and the Pale Companion!
Sefana: Next time we meet, please allow me to share my experiences with Sister Sorush. There are so many interesting stories that I'd love to share!
Sorush: That won't be necessary!
Traveler: In that sense, they are very important, indeed...
Traveler: Ahh, do share a few embarrassing incidents of hers!

### Additional Talk 2

Sefana: Before I knew it, the power of darkness had been eliminated... and the ponds had been revitalized...
Sefana: What happened? Was it because of the rain?
Sefana: If that's the case, it means the Harvisptokhm has graced me and these ponds with her blessings... How fortunate we are!
Sorush: It has been some time, Sefana.
Sefana: Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
Sefana: You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
Sorush: You need to calm down, Sefana!
Sorush: #This is my Yasnapati, {NICKNAME}, and {M#his}{F#her} companion, Paimon. We came to visit you and we've brought some good news.
Sorush: We have extinguished the Sign of Apaosha and rescued all Sunyata Flowers from the clutches of the dark corrosion. They have been revitalized. You can rest assured now!
Sefana: S—So it is all thanks to you, Sister Sorush!
Sefana: I cannot thank you enough... I can finally breathe easy. I'm so touched!
Paimon: Well, that sure was straightforward! Given what Sefana calls you, you two sure seem like you have a close relationship!

### Additional Talk 3

Sefana: Sister Sorush must know how to revitalize Sunyata Flowers.
Sefana: What a relief! Thank you so much!
