# Talk Dialog

Ganyu: Thank goodness Liyue is still safe and sound...
Traveler: Ganyu, this gift envelope is for you.
Ganyu: #It's lovely! Thank you, Traveler!
Ganyu: It's all thanks to you that we managed to get through this crisis.
Traveler: It was a group effort.
Ganyu: Phew... In any case, I'm glad everyone is safe.
Ganyu: Speaking of which, how are you holding up? Any tiredness or pain?
Traveler: I'm doing fine, thank you.
Ganyu: I'm glad... When Keqing and I heard that Director Hu had to carry you to Bubu Pharmacy — that you were unconscious — we rushed over there immediately.
Ganyu: Thankfully, Baizhu reassured us it was just exhaustion. It was a huge relief.
Ganyu: Still, you should be careful. If you feel unwell over the next few days, come find me, and I'll take you to see Cloud Retainer.
Ganyu: She may not be known for her skill in medicine, but the adepti are knowledgeable and resourceful in all kinds of fields, so I'm sure she can help!
Traveler: See you.
Ganyu: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. See you later!
