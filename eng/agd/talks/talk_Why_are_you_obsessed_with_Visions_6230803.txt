Traveler: Why are you obsessed with Visions?
Little Liu: 'Cause I want one for myself!
Little Liu: With a Vision you can get money and status. If I had enough money, mom and dad could come back to the village 'cause they wouldn't need to work in Liyue Harbor anymore.
Little Liu: I told my friends about Visions, and now they all want one too.
