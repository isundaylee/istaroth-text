Traveler: Good poem.
Zhuoying: Hahaha, it is indeed, and as blunt as liquor itself...
Zhuoying: Sadly, however, this poem comes from a heartbreaking old story... *sigh* It hardly even counts as a poem.
Zhuoying: Just like me, I hardly even count as a sailor anymore. I'm just a lush lingering between bottles of liqour.
Zhuoying: Ah, enough of that. Bottoms up!
