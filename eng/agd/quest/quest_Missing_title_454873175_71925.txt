# Missing title (454873175)

Traveler: Good luck, you can do it.
Dongdong: Thanks! You're one of the few people in the village to encourage me!
Dongdong: All the other villagers say I'll never become a big hero like my dad, because I don't drink my milk...
Dongdong: But who says heroes have to drink milk? That stuff tastes so weird.
Dongdong: Still, it'd be a shame to let it all go to waste... Why don't you take it instead?
Dongdong: Just don't tell anyone, okay!
