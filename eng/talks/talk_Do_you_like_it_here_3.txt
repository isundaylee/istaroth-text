Traveler: Do you like it here?
Xinyan: Yeah! There's enough space and freedom â€” what a great rehearsal venue!
Traveler: Can I watch you rehearse?
Xinyan: Uhh... If it's alright, I'd rather perform for you after I practice up.
Xinyan: That'll give you the best listenin' experience.
Xinyan: But thanks for your cheers! I'll do my best!
Xinyan: Oh, right! After each rehearsal, I make sure to tidy up after myself.
Xinyan: Don't worry, I'll have this place like new!
Traveler: Thanks for liking it here...
Xinyan: Hey, what are you sayin'?
Xinyan: If anything, I ought to be the one thanking YOU! Inviting me to your house, not tellin' me what I can and can't do.
