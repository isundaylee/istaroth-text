# Talk Dialog

Traveler: And you are...?
Aclla: I'm a vet who specializes in treating Saurians. A pleasure to meet you!
Aclla: Haha, it may sound cool, but I really just give baby Saurians their meds and talk to them. At most, I could be considered a medical intern.
Aclla: For seriously injured Saurians, it's best if you see a professional Sauro-vet.
Aclla: Like Ifa, from the Flower-Feather Clan! If you give him a call, he'll rush right on over!
Aclla: Of course, I've got some pretty neat talents too! You know how Yumkasaurs usually don't like being around people? Well, they don't mind me!
Aclla: Sometimes, little Saurians look unwell, but they're actually just in a bad mood... So, spending time with them can be an excellent form of "treatment," you know!
