Mysterious Message: "I heard that last time, the Association dug up the witch Citlali's divination tools out in the wilderness? Just where'd they put them... if we get too close, will the curse spread to us too?"
Association Reply: "Dear Researcher, please, do not add fuel to the fire! Such groundless folk rumors must not be taken seriously!"
Association Reply: "The existence of Citlali's curse is still a matter of great contention. And if you think about it, even if it did exist, it probably wouldn't spread beyond the Masters of the Night-Wind too easily, right?"
Another Person's Message: "I've heard Citlali isn't that scary at all. In fact, she's pretty easy to approach despite her station."
A Third Person's Message: "...Pyro Archon protect us. That casual attitude is her waiting for new victims. The second you actually show disrespect or fail to fear her, you're toast."
Association Reply: "...Aren't these 'divination tools' just a few liquor bottles? We've sent someone to return them to her."
Mysterious Message: "You're done for. Isn't that the same as criticizing her in public for getting drunk and littering?"
Association Reply: "I think she'll probably just scratch her head and say 'Hey, I don't recall any signs saying I can't throw away empty bottles here.'"
