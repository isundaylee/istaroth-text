Apoxpalon: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Apoxpalon: Sorry, I only really pay attention to what's going on with the customers who come to me for weapons, and that's not something I'm at liberty to share with you.

## Talk

Apoxpalon: Things in this world are often a mixture of fortune and woes.

## Talk

Traveler: And why do you say that?
Apoxpalon: Let me give you a practical example. Say that on a certain date, a long time ago, ta-da! You were born into the Children of Echoes.
Apoxpalon: Good news — the lands of the tribe are rich in valued minerals. Everyone can make a living by mining stones. Between making jewelry, forging weapons, and conducting business with other peoples, there's tons of fun to be had.
Apoxpalon: The bad news, of course, is that this land also produces nothing but stones. If you want anything else, you'll have to trade for it... using stones.
Apoxpalon: What do you think? Simple and easy to understand, right?

Traveler: Goodbye.
Apoxpalon: See you! This rule also applies to meetings and farewells!

## Talk

Traveler: Indeed it does.
Apoxpalon: Yep, that's exactly how it is. My work is like that, too.
Apoxpalon: Good news — I am quite skilled at making weapons. Not only can I produce enough for the people of my tribe, I can also trade my products with the other tribes for goods.
Apoxpalon: The bad news, of course, is that I am absolutely useless when it comes to cutting gems and making jewelry.
Apoxpalon: Anyway, so I've also presented both good and bad news to my clients. The good news: the quality of my equipment is always guaranteed!
Apoxpalon: The bad news: No haggling!

## Talk

Traveler: That's for sure.
Apoxpalon: Yep, that's exactly how it is. My work is like that, too.
Apoxpalon: The bad news, of course, is that I am absolutely useless when it comes to cutting gems and making jewelry!
Apoxpalon: But the good news — the best of all in fact — is that I have quite the knack for making weapons!
Apoxpalon: As you know, the Abyss is a tough adversary indeed. I only hope that my weapons can be used to deliver a mighty blow against it.
Apoxpalon: Of course, it would be even better if they could bring their own owners back with them... *sigh*...
Apoxpalon: Do you know Batz? That hothead... Rushed off brandishing a sword he'd barely used to save a Saurian trapped in a mine, and we haven't heard a word from him since...

Apoxpalon: As you know, the Abyss is a tough adversary indeed. I only hope that my weapons were used to deliver a mighty blow against it.
Apoxpalon: Of course, it would've been better if they could've brought their owners back with them... *sigh*...
Apoxpalon: Do you know Batz? That hothead... Rushed off brandishing a sword he'd barely used to save a Saurian trapped in a mine, and we haven't heard a word from him since...
Apoxpalon: It's been so long, I can't help but think he's met his end down there. If only he could see what Natlan's like now...
