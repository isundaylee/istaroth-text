Traveler: Does it come with benefits?
Atiyah: Oh, lots!
Atiyah: First, this is one of the few ways you can get out of Aaru Village.
Atiyah: Get out of this desolate dump, and the world will be your oyster! Every young and ambitious soul longs to see the world, no?
Atiyah: And we might all be people of the desert, sure, but you can bet that we know how to wrangle Mora off those tree-dwellers!
Atiyah: Those from the Akademiya have the fattest wallets. They never quibble over prices or delay payments.
Atiyah: You just need to take one of their commissions, and you'll be set!
Atiyah: You won't find a better Mora-making venture anywhere else!
