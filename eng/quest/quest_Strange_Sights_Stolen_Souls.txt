# Strange Sights, Stolen Souls


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hi Katheryne, it's us! Any new commissions?
Katheryne: As a matter of fact, there's one that looks perfect for you two.
Katheryne: Uncle Dai is one of the foremen at Huishan Hall over in Liyue Harbor. He's hoping the Adventurers' Guild can spare some manpower.
Paimon: What is it we have to do exactly?
Katheryne: I believe you'll be looking for workers.
Paimon: Ooh, looking for people? Awesome, we're good at that!
Katheryne: I have no reason to doubt your abilities.
Katheryne: I'm sure the details can be worked out face to face. If you're willing to accept this commission, head over to the dock and talk to Uncle Dai.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey! Are you Uncle Dai?
Uncle Dai: I am indeed.
Uncle Dai: Ahh, now then, you must be the adventurers assigned by the Guild.
Paimon: Huh? How could you tell!?
Uncle Dai: By the clothes on your back and the look on your face. Experienced adventurers at that, I'll wager.
Paimon: Right again! You're pretty perceptive!
Uncle Dai: Hahaha. In this trade, you need a sharp eye for people, not just rocks. Uncle Dai can see what you're made of from a long way off.
Uncle Dai: Alright, my assistant should be arriving soon so let's just wait here a moment.
Paimon: Whoa whoa, that's why we're here! Now there's someone else taking a cut?
Uncle Dai: Well, to tell you the truth, this is a very difficult matter. Too much for adventurers alone to handle, I fear...
Paimon: Hmph! So there is someone else!
Paimon: Do you think we're not up to the job?
Traveler: Steady, Paimon...
Uncle Dai: It just occurred to me that you don't have all the facts. The incident in question happened in a mine, and it's a little out of the ordinary, to say the least. Mines are dangerous places, as I'm sure you're aware. As such, I've enlisted an industry expert to cover all contingencies.
Uncle Dai: Last time I checked, adventurers weren't experts in ore appraisal or geological analysis. With a professional by your side, everything should run smoothly.
Uncle Dai: Besides, this guy is the best in his field. No matter the rock, he'll tell you its value to the nearest Mora at a glance.
Uncle Dai: I'd go as far to say that there's not a soul in Teyvat that knows rocks better than him. I'd be a fool to not enlist an expert of his caliber!
Paimon: You're a fool if you think you found Teyvat's number one rock expert!
Uncle Dai: Oh? And why might that be?
Paimon: Because Teyvat's number one rock expert happens to be a friend of ours...
Traveler: You must be talking about...
Traveler: (Perfect, I was planning to ask him a few questions.)
Paimon: Haha~ Didn't expect that, did you! Wait here, we'll go fetch him.
Traveler: Paimon, you're getting competitive again...

## Talk 3

Iron Tongue Tian: In our last tale, Rex Lapis...
Paimon: Zhongli! There you are!
Zhongli: Oh!
Zhongli: Here for a few tales? I didn't know you two were connoisseurs.
Paimon: Oh, no no! We're here for you! Um... do you have time?
Zhongli: Ah... something I'm rarely short of.
Traveler: We've accepted a commission...
Paimon: We need someone who understands geology and ore.
Zhongli: Hmm... someone who understands geology and ore...
Paimon: Ugh... Take a look around! Is there anyone in Teyvat more qualified?
Paimon: The requester claims to have enlisted Teyvat's number one rock expert, but Paimon doesn't believe a word of it. Nobody understands rocks better than you!
Zhongli: You appear to have taken his claim quite personally on my behalf.
Paimon: Oh, no no... it's just... Uncle Dai doesn't know what he's talking about!
Paimon: Paimon just wants to... enlighten him...
Zhongli: Hahaha, I see. Well then, it will be my pleasure to accompany you.
Paimon: Really!?
Zhongli: But I should inform you that despite my expertise... I cannot necessarily claim to be a leading authority.
Zhongli: We are at all times adrift in a sea of learning — new knowledge should be welcomed with open arms. Still, I imagine I will be of help to you in this endeavor. If we do encounter an expert, I look forward to broadening my own understandings.
Paimon: Ugh... stop being so modest, Zhongli.
Paimon: Well, we got him! Let's head back to Uncle Dai!
Traveler: We have a special task...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Uncle Dai! We're back!
Uncle Dai: Oh! And this must be the friend you spoke of?
Paimon: Yup! Paimon doesn't know who your rock expert is, but he's got nothing on our guy!
Zhongli: Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Still, I do have a claim to some experience in this field.
Uncle Dai: Uh-huh, so you say. Wait till my guy gets here, then we'll see.
Uncle Dai: It's no use me singing his praises. You'll have to see for yourselves.
Kun Jun: Uh... is this the place?
Uncle Dai: Aha! Speak of the devil! Allow me to introduce my assistant, Kun Jun.
Uncle Dai: Young Kun, these are two adventurers assigned to us. And as for this gentleman...
Kun Jun: Hm...?
Zhongli: ...
Traveler: This is Zhongli, a consultant from the funeral parlor.
Uncle Dai: Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant... Mr. Zhongli! I've heard about you. They say you're a man of great knowledge and many talents. I had no idea I'd be meeting you in person today.
Kun Jun: I... I'm sure I recognize you... Have we met at the parlor? Wait, I've never been to the parlor...
Paimon: Uncle Dai, aren't you going to test them?
Traveler: So that's what you were planning.
Uncle Dai: Huh? I... I wouldn't know where to start...
Paimon: Then they can figure out a way to test each other! If Zhongli wins, he's the assistant. If Zhongli loses, uh... N—Never mind, Zhongli won't lose!
Kun Jun: A contest? Why, it would be my pleasure!
Zhongli: I admire your enthusiasm, good sir.
Kun Jun: Haha! I must say, you certainly have the look of an industry expert about you. It'll be interesting to see which one of us wins.
Paimon: Stop talking the talk and start walking the walk!
Kun Jun: I'm just saying it like I see it, haha... Which is incidentally the only skill I have worth talking about.
Zhongli: So you're an appraiser, Mr. Kun Jun?
Kun Jun: Well, no... actually I've already forgotten what I'm in Liyue Harbor for... I was standing by the side of the road one day when Uncle Dai called me over.
Kun Jun: He saw me holding a rock and asked me a few questions. He seemed incredibly excited, even followed me for a while. We arranged to meet here.
Paimon: Huh? How could you forget something like that?
Uncle Dai: I saw him on my way over to Liyue Harbor, poring over rocks and muttering to himself. He looked to be very familiar with them.
Uncle Dai: I asked him a few questions out of curiosity. To my surprise, he knew more than me, an old mining foreman! In any case, he didn't have any pressing matters, and agreed to help me.
Paimon: So... do you have a poor memory?
Kun Jun: Not exactly... Anyway, if it's rocks you need help with, I can most certainly lend a hand.
Kun Jun: Mr. Zhongli, what do you make of this rock?
Zhongli: Hmm...
Zhongli: A glossy exterior, with a fissure that could only have been left in the wake of a volcanic eruption. If I'm not mistaken, this is a rough gem from another nation.
Kun Jun: Ah... a keen eye!
Zhongli: It's no ordinary rough gem. Fragile surface layer, black veining... My intuition tells me that there's high-quality crystal ore inside.
Kun Jun: Remarkable. This rock does indeed hail from the vicinity of a volcano. I came across it in a market and snapped it straight up. The seller thought it was some leftover industrial remnant. They had no inkling of the treasure that lay within.
Traveler: Isn't Crystal Ore found everywhere?
Kun Jun: Purity and geological rarity alone aren't enough to make a treasure. Some of the most precious crystals contain deposits of water or sand.
Kun Jun: In the moment of its formation, the crystal hidden within this stone shell captured a pocket of water. For water to be hidden in its depths, like a moon concealed within a mountain, reflecting shafts of daylight that make it through... Now that's a rare treasure.
Paimon: Such a detailed description, almost like he saw it with his own two eyes...
Paimon: Say... you're not trying to hoodwink us are you? After all, we haven't even seen what's inside yet!
Zhongli: Everything he said is true.
Zhongli: Most crystals are born in high-temperature environments. Heat and water aren't natural bedfellows of course, which is why crystals with water deposits are so sought-after. Moreover, this particular crystal contains mountain lake water. A rare find indeed.
Paimon: Well if Zhongli says so, it must be true...
Kun Jun: I've yet to encounter anyone with a judgment as shrewd as yours, Mr. Zhongli. How did you know exactly what lay within?
Zhongli: I've seen many such stones in my time, I recognized it immediately. I hope you didn't mind me flaunting my experience, Mr. Kun Jun?
Kun Jun: Of course not! I feel I've met a kindred spirit here today. I hope you will accept my friendship.
Kun Jun: Uncle Dai, it would be a mistake for Mr. Zhongli not to join us! Trust me when I say that his level of expertise is unrivaled in the trade. You won't come across another of his caliber in your lifetime.
Uncle Dai: Very well, there is strength in numbers after all! Everyone, follow me to The Chasm. There are men counting on you to find them.
Traveler: What makes this one so special?
