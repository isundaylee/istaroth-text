Cai Xun: Tell me more about the Millelith.
Cai Xun: "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
Cai Xun: The Millelith are under the Liyue Qixing's command. You could say we're the city's public security officers.
Cai Xun: We're here to handle minor matters such as theft and other disturbances of the peace. We also stand ready as Liyue's firm shield in the case of a monster attack.
Cai Xun: Never hesitate to call on us if you need assistance of any kind.
