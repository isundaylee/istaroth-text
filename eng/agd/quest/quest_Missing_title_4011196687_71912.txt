# Missing title (4011196687)

Traveler: What's the actual probability of finding jade?
Shitou: Well, that's the million Mora question isn't it? But seriously, it would ruin the game if I knew the probability in every case. A game of probability is nowhere near as exciting as a game of chance!
Shitou: And hey — even if there's no jade inside, who's to say you won't find something else instead?
Shitou: I kid you not, just the other day a big business owner comes in here, opens a stone, and sure, no jade, but there's a good few chunks of ore in there. Not good enough for him of course, he gives them right back to me without a second look. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the generosity, I've just got nowhere to store them.
Shitou: So how about you take them? My investment in your future, shall we say — and if you ever want to return the favor, you know where to find my store... hahaha...
