# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Ororon: If that's what you want, I'd be happy to.
Ororon: You're better off choosing the topic, though. I usually only talk about a few things.
Traveler: Like... growing vegetables?
Ororon: Exactly.
Ororon: Pretty amazing... It's like you know me already.
Traveler: Doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, does it?
Ororon: Oh, of course not.
Ororon: You're like a wild animal that seeks out human contact in a gentle way. No one's gonna turn that down.
Ororon: ...Sorry for comparing you to an animal. That came out wrong.
Ororon: What I meant to say is, you're friendly and approachable. You make it easy for people to let their guard down.
Ororon: Of course, I can tell your soul is more mature than your appearance suggests.
Ororon: There's a wealth of wisdom and experience behind your youthful appearance. If you were a fruit, you'd be... a tender one. The pick of the crop. Um...
Ororon: It's kind of hard to explain. All I'm trying to say is, I think you're great â€” the kind of person that everyone likes.
Traveler: It's the first time I've heard it put like that...
Ororon: Oh, did I say something weird?
Ororon: Sorry. That's kind of who I am.
Ororon: But, you don't seem to mind. So, I'll just keep being myself, okay?
Traveler: I'll take that as a compliment.
Ororon: You should! You're in a good place. Some people grow older without the "growing wiser" part.
Ororon: ...I hope I don't turn out like that.
Ororon: When you think about it... At least I can grow my own vegetables and hunt, so I'll never go hungry, right?
