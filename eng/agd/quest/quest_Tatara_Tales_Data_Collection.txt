# Tatara Tales: Data Collection


## Talk 1

Xavier: Ah, such perfect timing, Traveler! The data has almost all been gathered, and it is now time to retrieve our beacons!
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Xavier: That I shall, that I shall. Best to be quick, and sneaky too. Don't let those Fatui spot you!
Traveler: How do you know?
Xavier: These beacons always come with very detailed instruction manuals.
Xavier: These describe various different circumstances and the amount of time required for data-gathering in each circumstance.
Xavier: As for unknown forms of energy like Tatarigami, I will simply consider them to require the longest duration. Either way, the task of retrieving those beacons falls to you.

## Talk 2

Xavier: If we are able to acquire this data, then this should make our job a lot easier.

## Talk 3

Xavier: How did it go? Do you have all our beacons?
Traveler: Got them all right here.
Xavier: Bravo! Now, just give me a moment while I modify this device.
Xavier: I must say, the Fatui have been acting more and more strangely recently. They seem to be gathering around the core of the furnace.
Xavier: Hopefully, they aren't hatching some other dastardly plot. Or should I say, trying to do something that we won't be able to mitigate...

## Talk 4

Xavier: Now, all we need to do is wait for our beacons to collect enough data.
Xavier: Once we have that data on hand, I will make a few tweaks to this device accordingly.
Xavier: Once all is ready, let us put a decisive end to this incident.
