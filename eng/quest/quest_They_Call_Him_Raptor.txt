# They Call Him Raptor


## Talk 1

Amber: This is Springvale. There must be some clues about Raptor 'round here.
Amber: The Sister from the Cathedral put some secret Anemo markings on the artifact he took.
Paimon: Use your <color=#00E1FFFF>Elemental Sight</color> and keep your eyes peeled for clues.

## Talk 2

Amber: Hmm... a strip of cloth with Anemo markings on.
Amber: Looking at the design and the way it's woven, there's a good chance it came from a wind glider.
Paimon: Wow, Outriders have to be textile experts now!? It's a harder job than Paimon thought.
Amber: If this really belongs to Raptor, it must mean his wind glider is broken.
Amber: It appears that the elemental markings point this way.
Paimon: Huh. Well... D'you think he ran off ahead?
Amber: There's only one way to find out!
Amber: #C'mon {NICKNAME}, we should keep following the markings.
Paimon: Ooh, what's that? Looks like something's going on up ahead...
Amber: It sounds like there's a battle going on — could that be Raptor?
Amber: Quick, let's keep going!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hmm... How do we know if this was left by Raptor or an Anemo Slime?
Amber: Anemo Slimes are airborne creatures. They don't leave marks on the ground, unless someone stomped on one to take-off.
Paimon: Wait... Are you telling me people actually do that?
Amber: Either way, let's make a mental note of these markings. They're very clear.
Amber: It appears that the elemental markings point this way.
Paimon: Huh. Well... D'you think he ran off ahead?
Amber: There's only one way to find out!
Amber: #C'mon {NICKNAME}, we should keep following the markings.
Paimon: Ooh, what's that? Looks like something's going on up ahead...
Amber: It sounds like there's a battle going on — could that be Raptor?
Amber: Quick, let's keep going!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, look where we are...
Traveler: There are no more elemental markings ahead.
Amber: The elemental power on the artifact must have worn off.
Amber: Raptor must have realized the markings would give away his position, and sent his minions to slow us down.
Amber: That way, when the effect wears off, he can make his escape.
Amber: He won't get away with this! After him!
