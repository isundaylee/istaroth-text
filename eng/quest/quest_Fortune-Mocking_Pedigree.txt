# Fortune-Mocking Pedigree


## Talk 1

Eide: Halt! What do you think you're doing!?
Traveler: Agh!
Eide: This place is not whatever you think it is... Nor should you be poking your nose into my business! Begone!
Traveler: Whoa, whoa... Just calm down.
Eide: Your travel companion? ...You mean the one that was keeping watch by your side last night?
Eide: Your companion departed for the forest early this morning. That much I saw with my own eyes.
Traveler: (I thought so... Still, I don't know if I can trust this person's word just yet.)
Traveler: So you mean to say that...
Eide: What business is that of yours? All you need to know is that I claimed this place first — and what I do here is none of your concern.
Eide: Do I make myself quite clear? Leave!
Traveler: ...
Traveler: (There's something strange about this person. I need to find out what he's hiding...)
Eide: Well? What are you waiting for?
Traveler: I don't think I'll have much luck trying to find my companion in the woods...
Eide: *sigh* If you must... Suit yourself.
Eide: I've been observing you, and you don't look like a Forest Ranger, nor someone from the Akademiya.
Eide: Still, I'm warning you, no funny business. Promise me that, and you can do as you please.
Traveler: I'm no villain.
Eide: Okay, fine, whatever... Move aside. I'm heading in.
Traveler: May I join you?
Eide: You...
Eide: *sigh* Oh, go on then, have it your way. I knew I wasn't going to be able to hide this anyway. Just come in.
Eide: But no overreacting to anything you see in here, okay? You understand me?
Traveler: Relax. I've been around, it takes a lot to faze me.
Eide: Come on, then.
Traveler: Got it.
Traveler: I was out here all night. I'm cold.
Traveler: Nor will I pretend to be a saint.
Traveler: I think I'm better off waiting here for them to come back.
Traveler: You were nearby last night?
Traveler: I'm only here to look for my traveling companion.
Traveler: You startled me!

## Talk 2

Caribert: ...
Traveler: A hilichurl?
Eide: Mind your own business. Don't worry, he isn't aggressive...
Eide: ...How could he be. He was too young for anything like that.
Eide: So don't you lay a finger on him. Just find yourself a corner to rest if you're tired or cold.
Traveler: You're... from Khaenri'ah, aren't you?
Eide: Huh?
Eide: You know Khaenri'ah... Who are you, exactly? And how do you know I'm from Khaenri'ah?
Traveler: I'm just a traveler.
Traveler: Your clothes...
Eide: ...
Eide: Do you worship a god, Traveler?
Traveler: I follow no god. In fact, I count some of them as my foes.
Eide: ...Sounds like you've had an eventful life. Alright, well... my name is Eide. And you are correct — I was once Khaenri'ahn.
Eide: I apologize for my earlier hostility. But you must understand... As far as I'm concerned, humans who do not worship The Seven are nigh extinct...
Eide: ...And all who place faith in the gods are my enemies.
Traveler: That sounds a little too black-and-white.
Eide: ...That may be, but the fact is that chances to talk to people like yourself have been few and far between since the cataclysm.
Eide: This wretched curse of immortality... Who knows how long I must continue to suffer like this?
Traveler: What is the curse of immortality, exactly?
Eide: The curse? Huh, it was a little gift given to the people of Khaenri'ah by those vile gods...
Eide: We lost our home, our loved ones, everything... The agony of the cataclysm itself was already too much to bear... but then came the curse, robbing us any chance of release.
Eide: All we can do is watch helplessly as our souls erode and our bodies decay.
Traveler: (So Eide is just like Dain, someone who bears the curse of immortality.)
Traveler: So why did some people turn into hilichurls...
Eide: Because although Khaenri'ah began with a single bloodline, it was a home to others, too...
Eide: Any who forsook their gods and came to Khaenri'ah were welcomed as our fellow citizens.
Eide: When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality...
Eide: But those whose ancestry belonged to the domains of other gods were punished with the curse of the wilderness as they fled, turning them into monsters.
Traveler: So... who is this hilichurl to you?
Eide: He is Caribert... my illegitimate son.
Eide: *sigh* How times have changed. I can say that out loud with no consequence now, but... it was once a matter of unspeakable shame.
Eide: I was a noble of Khaenri'ah by blood... but I resented the life that my family had arranged for me.
Eide: Then one day, I met a beautiful woman amongst the people. Her roots were in Mondstadt... but that mattered not to me. It was love at first sight.
Eide: ...Caribert faced great hardship from the very moment of his birth, all due to my selfish desires... and I was never able to be there by his side for any of it.
Eide: ...After all that, he turned into a hilichurl right before my very eyes.
Eide: I always owed him much, and now... at least I can finally be close to him.
Traveler: ...What happened to his mother?
Eide: She was...
Eide: ...*sigh* We were separated. I do not wish to dwell on it.
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Eide: ...It could be worse. I suffer the pain of loss because I once had everything I could wish for.
Eide: And now... now that I have lost almost everything, the little that remains I see with new clarity.
Eide: If nothing else... At least I still have Caribert.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: What do you plan to do now?
Eide: Ah, yes, that reminds me. I only returned here to check on Caribert, but I do have other things I wish to do... You may come with me, if you're so inclined.
Traveler: What were you planning to do around here?
Traveler: I know this must cause you great pain.
Traveler: ...While you were afflicted by this curse instead?
Traveler: I take it that's how you've survived for so long?
Traveler: Spoken like a true Khaenri'ahn.
Traveler: I follow no god. Though I count some of them as my friends.
Traveler: Your eyes...
Traveler: I've met others from Khaenri'ah.
Traveler: Why do you keep a hilichurl at home?

## Talk 3

Eide: We're here. Let's begin...
Eide: Wait a moment... Hey, what was that? ...Caribert?
Traveler: What!?
Eide: Oh no... He must have left while we were too busy preparing the medicine to notice...
Eide: Come on! We have to catch up with him!
Traveler: He left the house?

## Talk 4

Caribert: ...

## Talk 5

Hajjan: The ecological issues in this area require further observation and analysis...
Fateh: You scholars and your big words... You know what would really impress me? Fixing the humidity in this forest...
Fateh: My whole family's having a hard time with this climate... Seriously, all my old injuries are acting up.

## Talk 6

Eide: Over here.
Traveler: A Crafting Bench?
Eide: I'm sure you're wondering why I brought Caribert here, to Sumeru.
Eide: Well, it's because he needs a medicine that can only be made here...
Eide: One which will help him to recover his clarity of mind.
Traveler: Recover his clarity of mind?
Traveler: (When we were in The Chasm, Dain said that the curse could not be undone... Is recovery really possible?)
Eide: I do not hope to break the curse. I am well aware of my powerlessness against the punishment of the gods.
Eide: But it's said that this medicine is imbued with the power of Sumeru's God of Wisdom, and can awaken the mind from a state of deep stupor... It has been used in the past to treat cases of mania.
Eide: I believe that it might just work...
Traveler: Where did you hear of this?
Eide: ...I read about it in a book from the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah. It was banned, since this medicine requires the power of The Seven to work.
Eide: In my youth, I—I disliked the life of nobility, and craved excitement. I was leafing through some forbidden texts and happened upon it.
Traveler: You know, there must've been a reason it was banned...
Eide: ...What other choice do I have? What exactly would you have me do?
Eide: The gods have already punished us! What does one more sin matter now?
Traveler: Alright, don't get too worked up...
Eide: Never mind, as long as you understand... I—I'm sorry, I struggle to take control of my mood sometimes... Perhaps a consequence of having lived too long.
Eide: As it happens, I am in dire need of some help to make this medicine.
Eide: My hands don't have the dexterity they once did. I fear that they may be decaying from within... all thanks to this curse of immortality.
Eide: Okay, to start with, take this ingredient...
Traveler: A mushroom?
Eide: Also, do you have any of Sumeru's regional specialties on hand? I believe they're called... *Kalpalata Lotuses* and *Sumeru Roses*.
Traveler: I've never seen a mushroom of this kind before...
Traveler: I understand. No matter what, you have to try.
Traveler: It sounds dangerous...
Traveler: What are you going to use this for?

## Talk 7

Statue of The Seven: ...
Traveler: Leave

## Talk 8

Traveler: I've picked some before, yes.
Eide: Wonderful. I—In that case, we have everything we need.

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: Eide carefully waters his field...
Eide: I need you to stand guard here for a while. Whatever you do, don't let any Forest Rangers approach the house. Understand?
Traveler: Of course...
Eide: Good. I'll be back soon, the fertilizer won't take but a moment to make.
Black Screen Text: You wait in the field for Eide to return. After a while...
Traveler: (Monsters! And so many of them... It looks like they're coming for this field...)
Traveler: (Does watering the field somehow attract monsters? Hmm, better fend them off.)
Traveler: Your secret is safe with me.

## Talk 10

Traveler: No, but I can go out and get some.
Eide: Could you really? Much obliged.

## Talk 11

Eide: This is the method for making the medicine. You just need to follow the steps.

## Talk 12

Eide: Is it done? Splendid, let me see...
Eide: Hmm. In all honesty, I do not know what the end product is supposed to look like. The banned book didn't feature any illustrations...
Eide: ...Well, the moment has finally arrived... Curses.
Traveler: Excuse me?
Eide: No, no. We need to perform one final step to complete the medicine.
Eide: I said before that this medicine relies on the power of the God of Wisdom for its restorative effects...
Eide: Which means... we must pay a visit to a Statue of The Seven.
Traveler: Ouch... that can't be easy for someone from Khaenri'ah...
Traveler: (Since he needs the God of Wisdom's power, should I get Nahida to help?)
Traveler: (...Forget it. Eide hates the gods — it could complicate things. I'll just do it his way.)
Eide: Let's go. Bring the medicine with you.
Traveler: I understand your reluctance.
Traveler: Is it time to give Caribert the medicine?

## Talk 13

Eide: Look at this statue... How can I bow before this thing...
Eide: God of Wisdom. Look at me.
Eide: I will utter no prayer, nor will I sing your praises.
Eide: You and your kind destroyed my home, wrought unfathomable suffering on my compatriots... Yet here I stand before you.
Eide: You cannot mock me more than fate itself already has.
Eide: God of Wisdom, I seek not to disavow myself of the sinful blood that flows through my veins. I wish only to beseech you to have pity upon a young and unfortunate soul.
Eide: My son, Caribert... He was turned into a monster before he had the chance to witness anything beautiful in this world... This is no fate for a child.
Eide: ...
Eide: If everything the gods have done was in order to have the impious people of Khaenri'ah bow their heads...
Eide: Then... I bow to you now.
Eide: I have given up all I ever stood for...
Eide: All I ask for is a tiny miracle. For Caribert to see this world once more.
Eide: Please, god... I beg of you.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: (I may not know the whole truth behind the cataclysm, but the people of Khaenri'ah have truly suffered...)
Traveler: (Why could Khaenri'ah and The Seven not coexist in peace?)
Eide: I have made quite enough of a fool of myself for one day. Let's go.
Traveler: Things will get better.
Eide: ...Hm.

## Talk 14

Craft: Earth and water, wind and fire, craft for me what I desire.

## Talk 15

Eide: Caribert?
Caribert: ...
Traveler: (The hilichurl seems almost lifeless. Its reactions to everything are incredibly weak...)
Eide: Well, we've prepared the medicine. We might as well try it.
Black Screen Text: With your help, Eide feeds the newly made medicine to the hilichurl.
Eide: Caribert? It's me... It's your father. Caribert?
Traveler: Anything?
Eide: Caribert... Please, say something.
Caribert: ...
Eide: I'm sorry I couldn't be at your side when you were born... and that I failed to reach you and mama in time when you both were suffering...
Eide: But I'm here now. Papa's been by your side all these years. I've never left you. Not once.
Eide: Are you still angry with me, Caribert?
Eide: I know you're awake now... Do you not want to talk to me?
Eide: I'm so sorry, Caribert. Forgive me, please! Say something. Anything!
Eide: Please... please...
Traveler: Eide, stop...
Eide: Aah!
Eide: Gods above! What more do you want from me!?
Eide: You took everything from here, and I still bowed to you!
Eide: I'd give you my very life if only you cared to take it! But you won't even let me die!
Eide: ...I knew it. I should never have trusted anything that had to do with the gods. I was just deluding myself...
Eide: The gods of this world have never stood with humanity... Not even for a moment!
Traveler: Calm down, Eide.
Eide: Other reasons... What do you mean?
Traveler: Such as... who knows, perhaps the dosage was too low.
Eide: Huh... you really think so...?
Traveler: You have to exhaust all options...
Eide: Give up? No, no. Never! ...Yes, you're right. I cannot let myself wallow in despair.
Eide: Even if I must stay here with him for... fifty years? A hundred? What difference does it make? I do not lack for time...
Traveler: That's the spirit.
Traveler: (To have infinite time, yet no hope... can only be called torture.)
Eide: Let's go. We'll make another dose.
Eide: The most crucial ingredient in this medicine is the unusual mushroom, which makes things complicated... but not impossible.
Traveler: Where did you get those mushrooms from, anyway?
Eide: I grow them. In that field.
Traveler: Wait, in a field? Like a crop?
Eide: ...The details don't matter, right? Curb your curiosity and just do as I instruct — if you truly wish to help me, that is how you can do it.
Traveler: ...
Eide: There is a waterfall near the statue I prayed at. I need you to collect some water from there around two in the afternoon.
Eide: I'll be here watching Caribert. Once you're back, I will make some fertilizer for the mushrooms.
Traveler: Got it.
Eide: Good. Then please head over when the time comes.
Black Screen Text: Time passes quickly. Before you know it, it is two in the afternoon...
Traveler: Fine.
Traveler: I'll keep helping you.
Traveler: Unless you are ready to give up on Caribert...
Traveler: Or maybe it takes a full course of treatment.
Traveler: There might be other reasons it didn't work.
Traveler: It didn't work.

## Talk 16

Eide: Please fetch the water. I'll be waiting here.

## Talk 17

Eide: Ah, you're back. Caribert's condition is stable...
Eide: By which I mean... he still isn't responding.
Eide: Anyway. Give me the water.

## Talk 18

Eide: What happened? Was it monsters?
Eide: Thank goodness you were here. I couldn't have taken them on all by myself... I'd have to hide and wait until they were gone.
Eide: Oh yes — I've got the fertilizer. The effects can take some time to kick in, so let's get on with it.
Black Screen Text: Eide spreads the fertilizer evenly. Before long, the elemental energy within starts to take effect...
Eide: Next, we pick the mushrooms and repeat the same steps as before to make another dose. I trust you still remember the method?

## Talk 19

Eide: *sigh* I suppose I will soon have to visit the Statue of The Seven once more...

## Talk 20

Eide: Without your help, goodness knows how long this would take me...
Eide: Thank you.

## Talk 21

Eide: ...
Traveler: Eide, the medicine's ready.
Eide: Oh! Uh, sorry, I just... After resting in this field for a while, my thoughts began to wander...
Eide: I have been so very weary, for many years... if only I could fall asleep here in this field, and never wake up again...
Traveler: But though the curse denies you even this...
Eide: Hehe, I do indeed, that's why it was just a fleeting thought... Thank you for your help once again. Now for the final step... Back to the Statue of The Seven.
Traveler: You still have Caribert.
Traveler: Hey, stop daydreaming...
