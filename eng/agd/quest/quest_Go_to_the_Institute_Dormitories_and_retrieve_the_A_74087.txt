# Go to the Institute Dormitories and retrieve the Anchor


## Talk 1

Chronie: Is this where researchers spent their downtime? Is this even humane? Has the Fontaine Research Institute ever considered making renovating this place a priority?
Nacker: ...There should be a Survey Anchor here. Just like Ms. Chronie implied, this place needs renovation, and the power supply here is very limited... Or perhaps I should say, there's a complete shortage.
Nacker: #While I'm answering Ms. Chronie's questions, I'll leave the job of recovering the Survey Anchor to you, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Nacker: Compared to some other areas, the dormitories weren't impacted as much by the explosion.
Chronie: Dormitories? But I don't see even one bed here, so how do the researchers get any rest? It's not like they can sleep in chairs, right?
Nacker: Ms. Chronie, your idea of "resting" is very different from that of the researchers.
Nacker: When a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute says they need rest, they only want a quick break for their brain.
Nacker: Then, they would usually come here, play piano, read, and have a drink or two if necessary.
Chronie: Uh, but wouldn't sleeping provide more rest for the brain?
Nacker: You may be correct, but... To our researchers, sleeping is a waste of time in the first place.
Chronie: Sleeping is a waste of time? No, it is essential for rest!
Nacker: Sleeping completely cuts your train of thought short, and that's just not acceptable for our research work.
Traveler: (Keep listening...)
Chronie: Are you being serious? If you don't sleep, the only thing that'll be cut short is your life!
Nacker: Not necessarily. The institute boasts an excellent health care system that guarantees researchers' health and well-being.
Chronie: But that's still no reason to not sleep!
Chronie: Also, if researchers are here to give their brains a break, wouldn't that break their thought process from research, anyway?
Nacker: Not necessarily. It only seems like they're taking a break when actually, they're still pondering different academic subjects subconsciously.
Nacker: It's akin to a vast ocean that, while appearing calm on the surface, still has a strong undercurrent beneath.
Nacker: Sometimes, the undercurrents below are much stronger than the towering waves above.
Chronie: I get it. You mean when researchers of the Fontaine Research Institute are on a project, they must keep working and are not allowed to rest, right?
Nacker: That is not completely fair to say. If they truly need sleep, they're free to go back home and do just that.
Chronie: So, it is fairer to say that as long as researchers of the Fontaine Research Institute are inside the Institute, they must keep working and are not allowed to rest.
Nacker: Your rhetoric is simply astound, Ms. Chronie.
Traveler: (Quit listening...)
