## Talk 1

Komaki: You're back. Is there something I can do for you?
Traveler: Please help me tell my fortune!
Paimon: #Paimon also wants to know what sort of luck {NICKNAME}'ll have today!
Komaki: Hmm... From the pattern of the Spiritherbs' leaves... You will have good fortune.
Komaki: You will find that fortune at the highest point in Watatsumi Island, in an ancient place dedicated to the gods.
Paimon: Hmm... How come Paimon can't see any of that?
Komaki: Hehe, this is what they call the wisdom of the local old folks.
Paimon: It sounds like you're just trying to bluff Paimon...

## Talk 2

Komaki: Oh, youngsters, how do you do?
Traveler: Please help me tell my fortune!
Paimon: Hehe, what's our luck gonna be like today, hmm~?
Komaki: The Spiritherbs say that... you will have ill fortune.
Komaki: You will have an ill-fated and unexpected encounter in a cave in the south of Watatsumi Island — a hive of scum and villainy.
Paimon: Eh, it's bad luck! Uh, we should probably avoid that sort of place, huh?
Komaki: Hehe. However...
Komaki: Overcoming ill fate may yet bring you an unexpected boon.
Paimon: A boon...? You mean treasure? Is it gonna be treasure?
Komaki: I did not say that...
Paimon: Oh...
Komaki: But I did not say it wouldn't be that, either.
Paimon: Oh, come on, Granny, why do you have to be like that?

## Talk 3

Komaki: Hehe. Good luck cannot be rushed, and what's more, even Spiritherbs need rest.
Komaki: Still, I'd like to thank you for coming by to say hello to an old lady. May you have safe travels.

## Talk 4

Komaki: Oh, youngsters, how do you do?
Traveler: Please help me tell my fortune!
Paimon: Hehe, what's our luck gonna be like today, hmm~?
Komaki: The Spiritherbs say that... you will have good luck.
Komaki: A gentle Electro Seelie will guide your path near the deep pool in the center of Watatsumi Island, just below the Sangonomiya Shrine.
Paimon: Wow!
Komaki: It should be true. These divinations have always been very accurate.
Paimon: Mmm, the more you say that, the more Paimon's getting suspicious...
Traveler: Don't mind Paimon, Granny.
Komaki: Hehe, it's alright, it's alright. You're still young...
Paimon: #Wait a minute, what are you trying to say, {NICKNAME}?

## Talk 5

Komaki: Oh, youngsters, how do you do?
Traveler: Please help me tell my fortune!
Paimon: Paimon wants to know what today will be like too!
Komaki: Hmm. The Spiritherbs say that this will be an ill-fated day.
Komaki: The ruined shrine in the east is shrouded in an ominous aura...
Paimon: Uhh, that sounds kinda scary...
Komaki: However...
Komaki: Those who boldly go forth and conquer such omens will receive their just reward.
Traveler: This seems quite similar to what you said before...
Komaki: Ah, isn't life like that? New experiences always cloak themselves in familiar-seeming days.

## Talk 6

Komaki: Oh, youngsters, how do you do?
Traveler: Please help me tell my fortune!
Paimon: Hmm, is it gonna be good luck this time, Paimon wonders?
Komaki: Oh dear, the Spiritherbs' light is rather weak at the moment. It seems they shall need some rest...
Komaki: All the same, I can help you perform another divination.
Komaki: Hmm. The twinkling of the Spiritherbs say that you shall have good fortune.
Komaki: In the ruins to the northeast, in the ancient city that stands alone amidst the sea, a lingering spirit of mourning will light the way.
Komaki: However...
Komaki: You must open for her a great gate and return her to her nest of sweet slumber before the fated reward can be yours.
Paimon: That was so confusing... Something something ancient city, something nest?
Komaki: Haha, it's alright. I will remain here. If you cannot figure it out, you can feel free to ask me anytime.
Paimon: Hey! Is she calling Paimon stupid?
