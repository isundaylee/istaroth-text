# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Zhongli: That would be my pleasure. What would you like to discuss?
Traveler: I want to hear you talk about the past.
Zhongli: The past... Then let us find a free day to take our time and talk.
Zhongli: A millennium's worth of stories cannot be told in one moment.
Zhongli: If you wish to be comfortable while listening, we'll need a pot of fine tea, two quality chairs, and a pleasing courtyard.
Traveler: We need to prepare a courtyard?
Zhongli: Haha, don't trouble yourself. This place will do just fine. We can sit down and take our time chatting.
Traveler: I want to better understand you.
Zhongli: Hm... So you're interested in my past.
Zhongli: I have many stories to tell.
Zhongli: What fills an ordinary person with intrigue is but an aspect of daily life for me.
Zhongli: This topic is a bit unexpected... I don't know where to start.
Traveler: Anything about you is fine.
Zhongli: My story is long and will take up a significant amount of your time.
Zhongli: But should you be willing to listen, we can talk over cups of tea.
