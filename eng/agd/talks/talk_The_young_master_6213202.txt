Traveler: The "young master"?
Xi the Maid: That young man whose lips are never far from the words "betting on uncut stones" is the young master of our house.
Xi the Maid: The current master and the young master argued till they were red in the face just before they parted. But not a few moments after the young master left, the master sent me after him with some traveling expenses.
Xi the Maid: Our lady seemed quite unworried, saying that the young master would surely return.
Xi the Maid: Well, he did a similar thing once, when he was younger.
