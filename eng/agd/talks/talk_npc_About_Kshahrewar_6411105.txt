Traveler: About Kshahrewar...
Araby: Kshahrewar encompasses many sub-genres. Architecture is just one of them.
Araby: If I studied architecture, I could explain how the lighthouse works to you... Unfortunately, I didn't.
Araby: Oh, speaking of architecture, go to northern Sumeru City and see the Palace of Alcazarzaray if you're interested.
Araby: The Palace is the masterpiece of Mr. Kaveh, who graduated from Kshahrewar with honors. It's magnificent and exquisite.
Araby: It's said to be commissioned by a filthy rich merchant, but I have no clue who that is, so I've got nothing more to tell you.
