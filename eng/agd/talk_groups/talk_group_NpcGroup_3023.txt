Yuzu: Hello! I heard from Furuya Noboru that you're an adventurer from afar. Oh, I'm so jealous... If only I could go on an adventure as well...
Yuzu: Oh well... If it isn't too much trouble, could you tell me some stories about the outside world?

Traveler: You could take on some commissions from the Adventurers' Guild.
Yuzu: You think I've never gone there before? Don't judge me by my age! I've completed the assignments from the guild at least once, twice... or three times!
Yuzu: But because of the Sakoku Decree, they were all exclusively local assignments...
Yuzu: I once told one of the higher-ups in the guild about this, but he just kicked the can down the road, making excuses like "there are many treasures in Inazuma too" and such.
Yuzu: When I kept pushing, he just referred me to the Shogunate instead of the Guild.
Yuzu: Hmph, this stupid Sakoku Decree has caused us, the adventurers of Inazuma, to be confined to such a limited space! I doubt that even the Almighty Shogun can pay the toll for getting in the way of my future adventuring career!
Yuzu: ...Ah, Electro Archon have mercy. Electro Archon have mercy. You didn't hear me say anything at all...

Traveler: Furuya Noboru's intel is actually pretty good.
Yuzu: About him... if it weren't for me pushing hard on the issues about the Sakoku Decree, I wouldn't even have realized that he was a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
Yuzu: But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
Yuzu: He is not a bad fellow. But if only he could help me get out of Inazuma...

Yuzu: He's not a bad person, but I just wish he'd let me go off to more places for adventure. I mean, we can't leave the country, sure, but couldn't we at least go to some mysterious place like Tsurumi Island?
Yuzu: It was covered in fog before, so I get that it wasn't allowed. But now that the fog's gone, he should just let us go!
Yuzu: But he's always like, "oh, new people should learn from the basics" this, and "don't just go after short-term gains recklessly" that...
Yuzu: He's so droll!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yuzu: Bye! And by the way, could you bring me along in secret when you leave Inazuma?

Traveler: I didn't hear anything.
Yuzu: Wah... Thank you...
Yuzu: *sigh* I wish I was a traveler like you. I want to go to the neighboring Liyue or even Mondstadt...
Yuzu: I heard that the people in Mondstadt are carefree and live as they please. When will I be able to experience something like that...

## Talk 5

Yuzu: Hello! I heard from Furuya Noboru that you're an adventurer from afar.
Yuzu: I mean, I'm getting ready for something of an overseas adventure myself, you know?
Yuzu: So, uh... If it isn't too much trouble, could you tell me some stories about your journeys?

Traveler: You'll need a sword.
Yuzu: Eh? Does it really have to be a sword? I would have thought that a knife might be easier to use when surviving out in the wild.
Yuzu: Oh, you mean mining? Hmm, that's true. An experienced adventurer should always bring materials with which to repair their tools!
Yuzu: Looks like I'll need to make a trip to the blacksmith. Hold on, let me write this down on my list...

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: You need to fish for a Paimon.
Yuzu: Eh? What's a Paimon?
Yuzu: Oh, you mean a guide... Hmm, that might be tough. Inazuma's been closed for so long, I haven't had the opportunity to make any friends from other lands...
Yuzu: I doubt the people at the Adventurers' Guild will be much help there either. Why, I was just spinning my wheels here this entire time, and if it were up to them, I would keep doing that!
Yuzu: But now that I'm free, I'm going to get prepped, and then I'll take my first step toward being a great adventurer!

Yuzu: But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
Yuzu: He is not a bad fellow. But he's been of little help when it comes to heading overseas.

Traveler: You might need to prepare a boat armed with a cannon.
Yuzu: Oh, is that how it is? I get it, then!
Yuzu: Huh... You're such a nice person...
Yuzu: Looks like I still have a lot more to prepare. I wish I could go to Liyue across the sea or perhaps Mondstadt, even further away, sometime soon...
Yuzu: I've heard that the people in Mondstadt are carefree and live as they please. When will I be able to experience something like that...
