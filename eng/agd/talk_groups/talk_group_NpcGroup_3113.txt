Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

Ikuhara Gai: This is a military camp, what's there that isn't noteworthy?
Ikuhara Gai: Still, it's been relatively peaceful around these parts lately â€” no real flare ups and all. I hope it stays that way...

Ikuhara Gai: *sigh* Just look at this. How can you make a great sword from this scrap? This is an utter waste of my Ikuhara Art forging techniques!

## Talk

Traveler: What's the Ikuhara Art?
Ikuhara Gai: The Ikuhara Art is a newly-founded forging style. Our founder... Well, you're looking at him!
Ikuhara Gai: I used to be a swordsmith at Tatarasuna. Then an accident occurred at the Mikage Furnace. Many of my colleagues have since left.
Ikuhara Gai: I don't want to leave yet. That's why I joined the Shogun's Army stationed here. I can serve the Shogunate while observing the situation in Tatarasuna.
Ikuhara Gai: After all, the best sword-forging material, Jade Steel, is produced here in Tatarasuna... If you don't have good materials to use as a basis, then no amount of skill will make it easy for you to forge the finest blades.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ikuhara Gai: Goodbye. I'd better go find some proper materials.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you really have to use Jade Steel from Tatarasuna?
Ikuhara Gai: Hey, are you listening to yourself? ...Forget it, you're an outlander. You wouldn't understand.
Ikuhara Gai: The reason why swords from Inazuma are so famous is because of Jade Steel. Swords forged it are tough and durable, yet extremely sharp.
Ikuhara Gai: Many samurai and swordsmen in our history made their names using weapons forged from Jade Steel.
Ikuhara Gai: Someday, I will use the finest Jade Steel and the forging techniques of the Ikuhara Art to create the best sword in the world!

Traveler: I hope you succeed.
Ikuhara Gai: Thank you for your kind words. I won't give up.
Ikuhara Gai: Recently, I collected some decent ores. There were some leftovers, so if you need them, feel free to take them.
