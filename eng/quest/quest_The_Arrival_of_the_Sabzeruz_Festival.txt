# The Arrival of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Kimiya: This is divine wisdom...

## Talk 2

Vihar: Atten-tion! Any more requests, young soldiers?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ooh, they're selling food over that way! Let's go take a look!

## Talk 4

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 5

Paimon: So... where to next?

## Talk 6

Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

## Talk 7

Phaki: Farris! Farris!
Vihar: Alright soldiers, now that you have your Yalda Candies, don't forget your loyalty to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Dismissed!
Phaki: Yes, Knight Farris!
Paimon: What's going on? Is this a play?
Dunyarzad: Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is another Sabzeruz Festival icon, and one immensely popular with children.
Vihar: Haha, it's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can meet the Knight of Flowers.
Vihar: Oh, do you want some Yalda Candies? I happen to have some boxes readied here. Take a look and pick whichever one you want.
Paimon: Uhh, what's to pick? Don't these boxes all look the same?
Vihar: Haha, it's not that simple. Each box contains a random flavor — it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include Lavender Melon, Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
Paimon: Ooh, how interesting!
Vihar: ...And there's also Lizard Tail and Onikabuto.
Paimon: Ugh! Why do those flavors even exist!?
Paimon: Hmm... Traveler, help Paimon pick one. Paimon wants to eat the Sunsettia flavor!
Vihar: Great. These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
Traveler: Number one.
Traveler: It's definitely number one.
Vihar: Ah, excellently chosen! Number four is indeed Sunsettia.
Paimon: Haha, Paimon bet you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
Traveler: Just now... Did I really mean to choose number four?
Paimon: Huh? Are you saying that you instinctively chose the right box?
Paimon: Hmm, but now that you mention it... Paimon also had the feeling you'd choose the right one... Is that kinda like what you felt?
Traveler: Why do I keep having this sense of déjà vu...?
Paimon: Maybe we didn't sleep very well last night, or maybe we slept too much.
Traveler: I'm sorry, Dunyarzad, but I need to leave for a moment.
Dunyarzad: Oh, sure.
Paimon: Huh? Where are you going? You're just gonna walk off like that?
Traveler: What a strange feeling...
Traveler: It felt like... my body just subconsciously reached for it?
Traveler: Let me give it a little thought...
Traveler: Number two.
Traveler: It's definitely number two.
Traveler: Number three.
Traveler: It's definitely number three.
Traveler: Number four.
Traveler: It's definitely number four.
Vihar: Ah, excellently chosen! Number four is indeed Sunsettia.
Paimon: Haha, Paimon bet you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
Traveler: That just now... I don't think that was luck.
Traveler: I don't know why, but I knew it must have been number four.
Paimon: Huh? How's that possible? It's obviously random...
Traveler: Number five.
Traveler: It's definitely number five.

## Talk 8

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

## Talk 9

Paimon: A feeling of... déjà vu?
Paimon: Paimon knows what that is! It's when you feel like you've already experienced whatever is going on...
Paimon: In that case, Paimon also felt something like that today... But that's just our brains playing tricks on us, isn't it?
Paimon: So, why'd you run here in such a hurry?
Traveler: I want to do something I normally never would.
Paimon: So that's it! You're intentionally doing things you usually wouldn't, and seeing if you still get that same feeling of déjà vu...
Lambad: Welcome, you two! Are you here for lunch? What would you like to eat?
Traveler: One Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake, please.
Lambad: Got it. You don't look like you're from these parts, but I gotta say, you've got good taste. I'll give this order to the kitchen.
Paimon: Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake! Isn't it that... that burned thing that didn't look tasty at all?
Paimon: Oh... Paimon understands what you're trying to do now... You'd never normally order something like this...
Black Screen Text: After some time, the Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake is served...
Paimon: That... thing... Are you really gonna eat it?
Paimon: Isn't this... going a bit too far...
Traveler: Here goes!
Paimon: H—How was it? The look on your face is telling Paimon that it tasted awful...
Traveler: No... It actually tasted really good.
Paimon: Then, you mean...
Traveler: This flavor...
Paimon: That's impossible! We were just talking about how gross it looked...
Paimon: ...So would this be a case of taste bud déjà vu?
Traveler: I couldn't get rid of it after all.
Paimon: Paimon also gets the impression that we've been here many times, even though we aren't regulars.
Paimon: Umm... How about... we go out again and try something else.
Traveler: Looks like I tried this before.
Traveler: I've definitely eaten this before.
Traveler: I want to see if I can get rid of this déjà vu.

## Talk 10

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 11

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 12

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Hey, Dunyarzad is sitting by herself on that bench over there...
Paimon: What a coincidence, Dunyarzad! We meet again! Uh, why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Dunyarzad: Oh, I ran into some kidnappers just now, but thankfully, Dehya came to my rescue. I started to feel unwell after that, so I sat down here.
Paimon: Kidnappers? Oh my goodness! Are you hurt?
Dunyarzad: I'm okay. Dehya's arm got scratched, but it isn't serious.
Paimon: Phew... That's a big relief. But Dunyarzad, you seem a little down today... It's the Sabzeruz Festival, and you've been looking forward to it so much.
Dunyarzad: Not at all. I've always been like this. Excessive physical exertion or strong emotions tend to aggravate my illness.
Dunyarzad: Besides, no matter how amazing today may be, it is but a single day. After however many more days, my time will come to an end.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't quite follow you, and Paimon feels like something's really got you down right now...
Traveler: I'm so sorry for leaving you behind earlier.
Dunyarzad: It really is fine. I don't mind.
Traveler: I just experienced a number of strange events...
Dunyarzad: Huh? Did something happen?
Paimon: Dunyarzad... have you ever felt déjà vu? You know... Like when you've already experienced something that's happening right now?
Dunyarzad: Déjà vu? No, but my days have been the same for years now. Even if I were feeling déjà vu, I suppose I would already be used to it.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees... Then, is it only the two of us...?
Dunyarzad: It's almost time.
Paimon: Huh? Time for what?
Dunyarzad: Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz is about to begin. Let's go.
Traveler: Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?

## Talk 14

Azar: ...With your lack of intellectual credentials, I do not believe you are qualified to debate with me. What you should be doing is finding workers to tear down this ridiculous eyesore.
Azar: When we return, have the Scribe draft an ordinance before the next Jnagarbha Day that prohibits public art performances. We will announce it to the public later via the Akasha.
Setaria: Understood. I will inform him when I return.
Azar: ...
Azar: The Sabzeruz Festival... Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content.
Paimon: Nilou, are you okay?
Nilou: Oh, Dunyarzad, the Grand Sage ordered us to stop the performance...
Dunyarzad: It's okay. There's nothing we can do about it.
Nilou: But you've been really looking forward to this. I don't want you to have any regrets...
Dunyarzad: It truly is unfortunate, but I don't wanna cause trouble for anyone. Didn't the Grand Sage say that he might investigate the organizers?
Nilou: True, but... *sigh* Well, okay, we'll just have to try again next year, hehe...
Dunyarzad: The next festival... I probably won't be around by then.
Nilou: Wait... What did you just say?
Dunyarzad: No, nothing. I'll be heading back to rest. Thank you for your help, everyone.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe what those heartless geezers did!
Traveler: It's a real shame.
Paimon: Did Dunyarzad already go back? We should also return and get some sleep.
Black Screen Text: The Sabzeruz Festival was forced to come to an unfortunately abrupt end...
Traveler: For some reason, I felt like this outcome was inevitable.

## Talk 15

Paimon: So in the end, you still couldn't figure out what that déjà vu feeling was all about?
Paimon: Hmm... Maybe it really was because of exhaustion...
Traveler: I'm feeling pretty groggy...
Paimon: Same here! That's why Paimon stopped thinking about it halfway through the day.
Paimon: Then how about we settle in and get a good night's sleep. For now, we can chalk things up to exhaustion... We can do more thinking tomorrow!
Paimon: *beep*
Khajeh: ...Observing a modest drop in the output of Jnana Energy, but values still remain within normal parameters.
Azar: Continue to monitor for variances in the data, and find the cause as soon as possible.
Traveler: I hadn't thought about it, but my head does feel very heavy.

## Talk 16

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: *yawn* Oh! We're gonna be late. It's all because you wouldn't get out of bed!
Paimon: We should go meet Dunyarzad right away!
