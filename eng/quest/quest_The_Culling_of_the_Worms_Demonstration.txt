# The Culling of the Worms: Demonstration

Vinayak: Did you see that, Shriya? Our Wenutslayer Cannon is a game changer!
Vinayak: I wish all the supervisors who listened to our thesis defense could come and see this. This would cure them of their antiquated views!
Shriya: So it really did go off without a hitch... I thought it was going to end up like Experimental Device No. 3...
Vinayak: Ahem... Only from our failures do we learn to succeed. I'm no longer who I used to be.
Paimon: How many accidents happened that year...? Well, anyway, this experiment was a success, and that's all that matters!
Vinayak: Yeah, while the ball is rolling, maybe we should try it somewhere else!
Vinayak: Eyewitness reports say that there are Wenut in this area numbering in the double-digits at the very least!
Paimon: Whoa... double digits!? You're not gonna pick them off one by one, are you? That would take a really long time!
Vinayak: Huh? What's the matter? If it's the maintenance of the Wenutslayer Cannon you're concerned about, you don't have to worry...
Paimon: Wait, wait, wait! It would take a long time to repeat this process over and over again. Even if the machine doesn't break down, we will!
Shriya: Vinayak, not everyone can be jolted back to life after just smelling machine oil.
Vinayak: Really? Looks like wetware performance will have to be considered next time...
Shriya: Anyway, let's call it a day. With data from this full run and samples collected after the battle, I am one step closer to solving this puzzle.
Traveler: What puzzle?
Shriya: Why the Wenut are behaving violently, abnormal environmental parameters... If we can figure that out, we might be able to get to the bottom of this mess.
Shriya: Please give me one more day to do some research. By this time tomorrow, we should have the results.
