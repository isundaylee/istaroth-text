## Talk 2

Paimon: Hehe, Sweet Madame really is delicious.
Paimon: Paimon really gets why this Wolfgang guy misses it!
Paimon: Poor guy, trapped in here without any chance of having Sweet Madame just one last time...
Traveler: This notebook is very, very old...
Paimon: #Yeah, but... Do you remember how we crossed through something like a lake on an island to reach another island on the other side, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: The buildings on the island inside the lake do look way more complete than the ones outside it.
Paimon: The buildings on the current island look like ruins in comparison...
Traveler: The buildings within the lake might be...
Paimon: That's very likely! The buildings on the island inside might just be the original form of the ruins outside!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you think...
Traveler: That the island within the lake is the island as it once looked?
Paimon: Yeah!
Paimon: Also, look... We can save this guy if we find where that secret chamber used to be, can't we?
Traveler: It's only gonna work within the confines of the Mirage...
Paimon: Yeah, but... Even if it's all fake, and this adventurer doesn't even exist... Shouldn't we at least try to save him? His fate was so sad...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}...
Traveler: Well yes, I suppose you're right.
Paimon: #Hehe! Paimon knew you'd agree, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Let's have a look at the island that's inside the lake.
Traveler: Let's go have a look, then...
Paimon: Yup, let's try to save this Wolfgang guy, shall we?
Traveler: That won't change what happened in reality...
Traveler: The buildings within the lake reflect their original appearance...
Traveler: This happened a long time ago, Paimon...

## Talk 4

Leave Message: Let's leave a few words here, he should be able to see 'em!
Leave Message: Let's go back to the island outside the lake. Maybe the notes might already be gone!

## Talk 5

Etchings: (These etchings are old. They have been written as such...)
Etchings: "The wind is very strong here, so I'm not going to use a notebook."
Etchings: "Haha, to think that I'd find a Sweet Madame here — and still warm, too! It's practically a miracle."
Etchings: "I don't know who left that Sweet Madame there or how they knew that I wanted to have some. It's all very strange... But I'm very thankful all the same."
Etchings: "Thank you, person who left the etchings behind! Your Sweet Madame was the best I've ever tasted."
Etchings: "And thank you. I do know that Dragonspine is very dangerous... and I know my limits as well. But I must go."
Etchings: "Who knows, a sign that says 'here be traps' might be all that shall be left of my journey to Dragonspine."
Etchings: "But if someone else can avoid that danger and get further than I did, that to me would be something even more precious than a Sweet Madame."
Etchings: "Thank you, whoever you are who left those etchings. But we adventurers exist precisely because of perils like Dragonspine."
Etchings: "Dearest Regards, Wolfgang."

Unknown NPC (25854): (These etchings are fresh...)
Unknown NPC (25854): (They speak of how this place is a perilous secret chamber...)

## Talk 9

Paimon: The door opened! Whew, that was kinda tricky.
Paimon: #Huh, looks like Wolfgang hasn't written any notes here yet, {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: So he hasn't been here...
Paimon: We did open the chamber for him back then... This means he won't get stuck now, right?
Traveler: Well, if that device can be triggered multiple times...
Paimon: Wait, then... Um, why don't we leave him a message?
Paimon: Let's try etching our message into someplace obvious. We'll tell him how to decipher the mechanism!
Traveler: Even if we did solve it once...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey, it looks like he got out of that secret chamber after all! ... And he... credited his sharp eyes for his escape!? C'mon, we left the clue in such an obvious spot!
Paimon: Also, how many notebooks does this guy carry around!?
Paimon: *sigh* He didn't go back after getting out of that chamber. He actually wants to continue adventuring...
Traveler: Well, it's because he believes he resolved the crisis.
Paimon: That's... That's true. The secret chamber that would trap him forever has now become an obstacle that he easily overcame...
Paimon: That said, the mountain ruins that he mentioned can't be seen in the island outside the lake at all.
Traveler: It's been a really long time since, Paimon...
Paimon: Did it collapse and then fall into the sea, then? Paimon's pretty sure that we saw some similar buildings outside in the ocean...
Paimon: Let's explore the nearby sea regions when we've got the time!
Traveler: He did escape the secret chamber, you know.

## Talk 11

Leave Message: This place should be eye-catching enough!
Leave Message: Let's hope Wolfgang does see it, and doesn't go running around the secret chambers in these ruins anymore...
Leave Message: Let's go back and have a look. Maybe his notes might have changed this time, too!

## Talk 13

Paimon: What the... This guy's saying some pretty glib stuff, huh?
Paimon: This is bad. We've got to get to Dragonspine and...
Traveler: Paimon, what we change in the Mirage will not change the past...
Paimon: Ah... Right, that's true. Wolfgang is only "here" at all because the Golden Apple Archipelago is under the effects of that device...
Paimon: That's why Paimon thought that he was rescued... But in the end, he really was just stuck in that very first secret chamber, wasn't he...
Paimon: But still, this Wolfgang is really... annoying! We helped him so much, but he still thinks that it would be nice if he could "pave the way" for others...
Paimon: Couldn't he at least value his life a little more?
Traveler: Everybody's looking for that something...
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon gets it!
Paimon: Still, if only they could have come to better ends. You know, like returning to Mondstadt, becoming great adventurers, maybe going to the tavern to play with cats, eat Sweet Madame to their heart's content...
Paimon: Why doesn't it ever end well for them?
Traveler: Well, it's only because people like him exist...
Traveler: Wolfgang will never make it to Dragonspine...

## Talk 14

Unknown NPC (25853): (These etchings are old...)
Unknown NPC (25853): (They describe how one may light the torches up in the right order...)

## Talk 15

Paimon: This notebook... Oh, it's "Wolfgang."
Traveler: Oh, joy. Stuck again, is he?
Paimon: I guess some people need some punishment before they'll learn anything...
Paimon: #These underwater buildings... They should be the mountain ruins that we saw on the island on the other side of the lake. Let's go inside again to make sure, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Didn't learn his lesson, I suppose?

## Talk 16

Etchings: (These etchings are old. They have been written as such...)
Etchings: "The wind is very strong here, so I'm not going to use a notebook."
Etchings: "The sunrise here is beautiful indeed. It fills my heart with satisfaction to have braved many dangers to get here."
Etchings: "I wonder if anyone will come after me to see these same sights."
Etchings: "Now that I've cleared this particular trial... Next stop, Dragonspine!"
Etchings: "This truly is a lovely place. The only thing it's missing is some Sweet Madame..."
Etchings: "Wolfgang."

## Talk 17

Leave Message: Paimon really hopes that Wolfgang can give that notion of going to Dragonspine a rest...
Leave Message: Let's go to the ruins we were at previously once we get out through the lake. Maybe we'll find some sign of him changing his mind!

## Talk 18

Unknown NPC (25855): (These etchings are fresh...)
Unknown NPC (25855): "Do not go to Dragonspine. It is a perilous place..."

## Talk 19

Paimon: Ooh, so there weren't any notes here because he carved a message on the pillar. Huh, so he made it all the way here.
Paimon: Where does his confidence come from, though... If we hadn't helped him out, he'd still be stuck in the secret chamber!
Paimon: He's pretty much gonna be Chilled Meat if he goes to Dragonspine!
Traveler: That's a little overboard...
Paimon: Eh? U—Um, Paimon just means that he'd be in deep trouble if he went to Dragonspine.
Paimon: We need to tell him not to go, and quick!
Traveler: Well, let's leave him another message, shall we...
Paimon: Right, that's right! Paimon thought so too... And y'know what, let's leave him some Sweet Madame this time too!
Paimon: Maybe he'll start missing the warmth of Mondstadt once he's had a bite, and he'll give up on going to Dragonspine!
Traveler: The Sweet Madame's gonna spoil, you know.
Paimon: Eh, come on, it's the thought that counts. Right?
Traveler: Well, he's going to get in trouble for sure.
Paimon: Exactly! Dragonspine's super cold and is filled with hilichurls... Not to mention The Great Snowboar King!

## Talk 20

Message: Should we really leave the message here? Shouldn't we look for a place closer to the door?

## Talk 21

Unknown NPC (25853): (These etchings are fresh...)
Unknown NPC (25853): (They describe how one may light the torches up in the right order...)

## Talk 22

Paimon: Well, he didn't go in again. That's a relief.
Paimon: Still, his annoyingly arrogant attitude is really ticking Paimon off!
Traveler: He really does sound like he's getting more and more full of himself...
Paimon: That said, the highland ruins he mentioned should be near the submerged ruins...
Paimon: Let's go have a look. Honestly, who knows if he was able to climb that high up safely...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Message: He should have gone into the secret chamber by the time he sees this message. Paimon thinks it won't be of that much use here...

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Wolfgang hasn't left his notebook here either. Looks like he hasn't arrived yet.
Paimon: Let's leave him some hints on how to open this secret chamber again, shall we?
Traveler: This solution...
Paimon: Oh yeah, that's true. If Wolfgang can't make use of the elements...
Paimon: Then the solution's useless to him. What should we do...
Traveler: How about we just make him not enter this place at all?
Paimon: Ooh, that's right! We can just leave a hint outside saying that there's a secret chamber here.
Paimon: Then he won't come in, and he won't get trapped in these ruins!
Paimon: C'mon, let's do it, quick!
Traveler: Let's leave a message outside the door.
Traveler: Without the use of elemental powers...

### Additional Talk 3

Leave Message: Let's leave our message here — and a Sweet Madame too!
