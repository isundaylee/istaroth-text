# Aqueous Tidemarks


## Talk 1

Virgil: #I must say, the weather today is simply wonderful! You are quite the {M#dashing young gentleman}{F#beautiful young lady}! Virgil, at your service.
Traveler: #A pleasure to make your acquaintance. {NICKNAME} at your service.
Paimon: Uh, um, a pleasure! Paimon's Paimon! And is at your service, too!
Virgil: Ah, such elegant names! Welcome to the Court of Fontaine, it is truly an honor to meet the two of you here.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon can't stand much more of this...
Traveler: How did you know we're not from Fontaine?
Virgil: Hmph, with a glance, it is obvious that you're unciv—
Paimon: Uh-huh?
Virgil: ...That you're unsatisfied with being bathed in the soft lights of the city, but feel the call of the wild, which will never be illuminated by bright city lights! Yes, just like the heroes in the operas!
Paimon: #Yeah, that's totally true! {NICKNAME} is an adventurer too, ad astra abyssosque and all that jazz!
Virgil: Ha, I knew it. Those of the Adventurers' Guild are beggarly...
Paimon: Beggarly?
Virgil: ...Courageous warriors begging with all their heart to unlock the deepest mysteries of the world! They wake with their eyes to the stars above, and sleep with their back to the abyss below! Where there is an unknown Domain, there is an adventurer who simply must explore it! Bravery bursting beyond the brim!
Virgil: I could not help but notice how your gaze is focused on many things. Perhaps you wish to study our sublime arts, our intricate clockwork meka, or our advanced civic culture!
Traveler: Ah! Truly, the decorations adorning your magnificent city are sublime!
Paimon: A—Amazing! Paimon didn't even notice the decorations... but Paimon did notice that Fontaine has a ton of delicious foods that she's never seen anywhere else!
Virgil: Not bad, isn't it? We have a long and glorious tradition of gourmet culture in Fontaine! Naturally, the two of you must often take your meals in the great outdoors, and thus are unfortunately limited in your ability to sample the breadth of Fontaine's superb cuisine? Unable to experience the luxurious richness that is leisurely afternoon tea with a few pastries?
Traveler: You don't look that rich...
Virgil: You should know, my dear friend, that true wealth is never flaunted in something as shallow as outward appearances.
Paimon: #Hey! {NICKNAME}, let's get back on topic! Paimon thinks that Virgil has a commission for us...
Virgil: Most excellent! My two exceptional friends, have you heard of the "Liliacruces Treasure"?
Paimon: Nope! Haven't heard of it...
Virgil: Then please, allow me to explain. This is a legend of a lost treasure that has been passed down in Fontaine for centuries.
Virgil: Once, there was a secret society called the "Liliacruces Forum" that was able to attract a great many of the rich and influential. Though they humbly called themselves a "forum," their actual plan was to overthrow Fontaine itself.
Virgil: In the end, their conspiracy was exposed, and the pi... *cough* the distinguished members of the Forum engaged in a thrilling battle with the Maison Gardiennage, but were ultimately defeated in the climactic showdown!
Virgil: However, my dear friends, you must know that they were once the richest and most famous of all Fontaine, and they must have gathered a tremendous amount of wealth.
Paimon: Yeah! They definitely did, and they must have a huge treasure vault somewhere...
Paimon: And when you open it, WHOA! It's overflowing with nothing but gold, shining like the sun!
Virgil: Correct! They wished to overthrow our beautiful Fontaine, and to do so, they must have amassed a fortune so vast that they could literally be said to have "more money than Morax." However, this wealth was never found.
Paimon: Hehe... So that means that as long as we can find the Liliacruces treasure, we'll also be filthy rich!
Virgil: Excellent deduction, my dear Paimon! With that fortune, and control of Sinthe...
Virgil: *cough* Anyway, after a lengthy investigation, I have discovered the location of the Liliacruces Forum's headquarters. It can be found amidst the underwater ruins outside the city.
Paimon: Really...?
Virgil: #What do you think? My dear Paimon, {NICKNAME}, I hereby sincerely extend an invitation to both of you to become my partners, and dive beneath the waves to search for the lost treasure.
Paimon: Hm... Even though Fontaine's water is different from elsewhere, Paimon can never forget how she was drowning before being rescued by you...
Traveler: Never fear, I am here!
Paimon: Yeah! You'll save Paimon again for sure!
Virgil: If that's settled, please allow me to prepare diving equipment for the two of you... Hmm, I should have the correct sizes...
Traveler: There's no need.
Virgil: #Ah, yes, I remember. Vision holders may dive freely in our waters. But if it's you, dear {NICKNAME}...
Virgil: #...Of course, I do not doubt your abilities. {NICKNAME} is a famed adventurer, and {M#he}{F#she} must be very aware of {M#his}{F#her} limits.
Virgil: But it just so happens that I do not share the same capabilities, so I will have to rely on our homegrown technology to keep myself alive.
Virgil: Be that as it may, shall we begin?
Traveler: I've had more of a chance to sample cuisine than you'd think...
Paimon: #Hey! {NICKNAME}, let's get back on topic! Paimon thinks that Virgil has a commission for us...
Traveler: I'm listening.
Traveler: Ah! Clockwork meka are exquisitely and intricately designed!
Traveler: Ah! The civic culture of your citizenry is simply divine!
Traveler: Meh, it's okay, I guess.
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}, and my companion is called Paimon.
Paimon: Hello, Virgil!

## Talk 2

Virgil: Brilliant! Now we can continue further into the institute's depths. As expected of a seasoned adventurer!
Paimon: Eh? Aren't we investigating the Forum? So is it a forum, or an institute?
Virgil: Haha, sorry, I misspoke!
Virgil: And forgive me for asking this out of the blue, but did either of you ever run into anyone who was looking for me? Or did you tell anyone else about our encounter?
Paimon: Eh? Hmm... Paimon doesn't think so!
Paimon: What's wrong, Virgil? Do you owe someone a ton of Mora?
Virgil: Hahaha, no, of course not... It just occurred to me that I should let you know that there are many greedy goons who are also after the Liliacruces Forum's secret treasure.
Virgil: They're very different from us. They're willing to do anything to achieve their goals, so I've always refused to work with them. As I know the most about the treasure's whereabouts, they have me in their sights.
Virgil: I've spent a long time hiding from their prying eyes and looking for partners I can trust. It is my luck to have finally met you two, my dearest friends.
Paimon: Huh... So that's what's going on.
Virgil: In any case, I'm just relieved to hear that you never told anyone else about me. Phew! I just know I picked the right people to be my partners! Only your best friends can be relied on to keep your secrets.
Paimon: Yep! Don't worry, Virgil, we won't tell anyone else about you.
Virgil: ...Hahaha. I have complete confidence that you will never ever tell another soul about me.
Virgil: Let's go! The treasure's waiting for us.
Paimon: Yep yep! Here we come, treasure!

## Talk 3

Virgil: How will we open that door and proceed onward...
Paimon: Ooh, so this is the "Forum" you were talking about! There are so many books everywhere — they must really have been dedicated to studying and conducting research...
Paimon: Paimon would never have guessed that they were a secret society plotting to overthrow the government of Fontaine!
Virgil: As the saying goes, dear Paimon, "Knowledge is power." This is especially true for the Liliacruces Forum.
Virgil: You should understand that with great knowledge comes great power. And once great power is yours to command... There will only be one path left to you.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't think that logic really holds water, but you're the local, not Paimon, so Paimon'll trust you know what you're talking about and leave it at that!
Paimon: They seem to have been researching some amazing things, though. And we've already seen plenty of stuff that obviously isn't from here on the way...

## Talk 4

Virgil: #Good heavens, {NICKNAME}, you certainly have a way with these Meka.
Paimon: Phew! We must be getting close to the treasure. After all, we've already run into the guards!
Virgil: Though Fontaine's achievements are as numerous and dazzling as the stars in the sky, the clockwork meka are undoubtedly the most exquisite of them all! Though, perhaps I shouldn't overpraise. One of the most exquisite.
Virgil: You must have traveled via aquabus when you visited the Court, correct? Tell me you've seen the intricate Steambird as well. In Fontaine, even blacksmithing is done by Meka!
Virgil: Why, the Maison Gardiennage didn't even have to lift a finger to beat me up. They just sent out some Gardemeks! It hurt so much, there was no choice but to submit...
Traveler: Beat you up?
Virgil: I mean, beat up the bad guys! Why would they ever beat me up?
Paimon: Whoa! If Meka are already so advanced, then surely the people of Fontaine don't need to do anything for themselves anymore, and can just leave everything to machines!
Virgil: Hahaha, that's a good one, my dear friend, you're just adorable! It's a lot cheaper to hire a human than buy a clockwork meka. Or to put it another way, no one and nothing can infringe on a Fontaine citizen's right to work!

## Talk 5

Virgil: According to my research, this should be the treasure vault of the Liliacruces Forum. The riches we seek should be within.
Paimon: Whoa! A treasure vault...?
Traveler: But this doesn't look like a vault at all...
Paimon: Paimon thought the vault would be full of glittering, golden Mora, as dazzling as the sun...
Virgil: You should know, my dear friends, that just as the truly wealthy do not flaunt it in anything as shallow as appearances, real treasure...
Paimon: Ohh, Paimon knows what you're about to say— "the real treasure was the friends we made along the way!"
Virgil: Uh, I was about to say that the real treasure is not so easily revealed, but you're also exactly right, Paimon. I have to say, I could have never come up with something so wise and philosophical!
Virgil: Regardless, the purpose of our expedition is to uncover the treasure the institute has hidden away for centuries. And I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the treasure is hidden in this room, so let's hurry up and get in there and find it!
Paimon: Uh, are you sure? Paimon doesn't see anything in there besides a few broken ruin mechanisms...
Virgil: Your words wound me, my friend. We're partners who are seeking the institute's long-lost treasure together. Do you really doubt me?
Traveler: Okay, so is this a forum, or an institute?
Virgil: #Ah, about that... Let's just say that different records refer to it differently! But my dear {NICKNAME}, the name isn't the important thing— we should keep our eyes on the prize!
Virgil: What we are talking about isn't merely a matter of hundreds of thousands or even millions of Mora... but a vast secret trove of hundreds of millions of Mora, sleeping within the vault!
Paimon: H—Hundreds of millions of Mora!?
Virgil: And there are other priceless items in the vault, too! Like, uh... There's the all-powerful Liliacruces Holy Sword, which can pierce through armor and destroy the soul itself! A magical item powerful beyond compare!
Paimon: Wh—Whoa, Paimon had no idea! And it's all in this vault!?
Virgil: Precisely! And if you ask me, every moment that we spend bantering here increases the risk of us being beaten to the treasure by all sorts of scrupleless ruffians who will stop at nothing to steal it!
Paimon: We can't let that happen! It's our treasure...
Virgil: #See, you get me! Then in that case, {NICKNAME} and Paimon, please go forth and recover the treasure. I'll make sure to watch the rear!
Traveler: Treasure, here we come!
Paimon: Yep yep! Here we come, treasure!
Virgil: Don't worry, I won't let anyone get through! Oh, and please let me know when you find the treasure!
Traveler: ...Let's just go. What's the worst that could happen?
Paimon: #What are you saying, {NICKNAME}! I—If we don't beat the bad guys to the treasure, they might try to take it from us, or force us to split it with them...
Traveler: I'm not worried about that.
Paimon: Hm... Paimon understands, you're worried the vault might be protected by some sort of mechanisms, right? Yeah, there're always traps at the end...
Traveler: Virgil...
Virgil: #Wh—What's wrong, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: ...Don't do anything that I wouldn't do.
Traveler: I'll leave the rear to you.
Traveler: Where's the treasure?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh? What's that sound...
Paimon: Virgil! What's going on...
Virgil: I'm so very sorry, I made a terrible mistake. It was only during our expedition that I realized this wasn't the former grounds of the Liliacruces Forum, but rather the ruins of the Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Virgil: There's no treasure here, but there are lots of experiments on machinery and energy. And now, my dearest friends, another experiment is about to begin.
Virgil: As for treasures, it would be wrong to say there aren't any at all here... As seasoned adventurers, I'm sure you've accumulated quite a bit of Mora and other precious items over the course of your journey?
Virgil: I will return after the conclusion of the experiment to collect the "treasures" you are sure to leave behind. Ah, and don't you worry, my friends— I'll be sure to put them to good use.
Paimon: Virgil! You... You lied to us!
Traveler: I'm not surprised at all.
Virgil: So you knew, and still decided to step into my trap? You're the kind of person I despise the most. So arrogant and disdainful! You blasted fools all treat me like an idiot! Even a couple of foreign hillb—
Virgil: ...Hmph, whatever. According to the records here, this machine is a "special" Ruin Grader. No matter how good you are, even if you can handle Ruin Guards, you're still only made of flesh and bone.
Virgil: As to what makes it "special," I'll leave you to find out in your own good time. Goodbye, my dear "partners."
Paimon: #Ugh, {NICKNAME}, get ready!
Traveler: I figured he was going to do something like this.

## Talk 7

Unknown NPC (20762): Missing text (2037015602)

## Talk 8

Virgil: Let me see... Hmph, so this is actually the "Institute of Natural Philosophy"? Looks like the wrong place after all...
Virgil: Ho, so there were things like this hidden here, how fascinating... I can use it against Sonny and the others...
Virgil: Should be able to make use of this laboratory... Take care of things first...

## Talk 9

Traveler: These things are pretty annoying...
Paimon: #Really? You think so? I seem to remember you handling it just fine back then, {NICKNAME}...

## Talk 10

Virgil: Well, knowing their extensive resources, it couldn't have been too hard for them to get their hands on these kinds of things. After all, this is the fabulously wealthy Liliacruces Forum we're talking about here!
Paimon: Hmm, but we've also explored a lot of domains and seen more than our fair share of cool things during our adventures.
Virgil: Is that so? Then I presume you've also found a lot of treasure?
Traveler: You presume correctly.
Virgil: How fascinating. I mean, what a terrific achievement. I expected nothing less from the two of you.
Paimon: It's too bad that this place is completely flooded. It really feels like a lot happened here, and they made a lot of important discoveries...
Virgil: The water levels of Fontaine have risen before. And according to the folks at the Fontaine Research Institute, they will rise again in the future. Perhaps one day, all of Fontaine will disappear beneath the waves.
Traveler: Enough to cover our travel expenses.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Wait, let me prepare first.
Virgil: Very well. But please allow me to remind you to make it quick. Treasure hates waiting.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Waaah! That'd be terrible... All that delicious food, drowned and lost forever...

## Talk 13

Paimon: Anyway, let's hope nothing like that will happen in the future!
Virgil: The future? Who cares about that? I'll be dead long before then, so why should I worry about the people alive then? What do the people and Fontaine of the future have to do with me?
Virgil: I would pay my respects to my family and friends. After all, they raised me, and have done many things for me. But have the people of the future done anything for you, for me? So what do we owe them? Isn't that right?
Traveler: ...
Virgil: ...Ahem, that's what I might have said about the issue of flooding if I lacked both patriotism and a sense of civic responsibility! Pretty abominable!
Virgil: Anyway, sorry for digressing. There should be a way to open the door below. Let's take a look around to see if there are any clues or keys.
Virgil: I'll also try to see if I can find anything in the associated files, my dear friends.
Traveler: That's pretty extreme...

## Talk 14

Traveler: Yes, please lead the way.
Virgil: Your wish is my command. Please, follow me. Our destination is not far from the Court of Fontaine...

## Talk 15

Traveler: Paimon, why don't you show him that trick of yours again...
Paimon: Beep! Construct! Beep!
Virgil: Hahaha, how fascinating! In any case, though, I think everyone would agree that humans and machines are not the same.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Though... All the places we've been have their own charm, too. It's not like Fontaine is just better than everywhere else, right?
Virgil: My friend, surely you cannot be serious? How can there be any place in Teyvat that's better than Fontaine?
Paimon: Ah, Paimon was just trying to say that other places are also really special, too! Virgil, have you ever set foot outside of Fontaine?
Virgil: My dearest Paimon, you should know that there's an old saying in Fontaine: "All waters lead to Fontaine."
Virgil: It's not the people of Fontaine who should go out and see the world, but all the world who should come and witness Fontaine's glory. Don't get it backwards.
Paimon: Do people really say that?
Virgil: Of course they do! Anyway, my friends, why don't we keep going? The treasure's still waiting for us deep inside these ruins!
Paimon: #Yeah! Let's go, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 17

Virgil: Ugh, how can I...
Virgil: #Hm? What's wrong, {NICKNAME}? Hurry up and go find the treasure.

## Talk 18

Paimon: Ugh... Paimon sure hopes this ruin thing isn't going to suddenly stand up...
Traveler: It's just a Ruin Grader. We can handle it...
Paimon: Paimon's not worried about you being strong enough. Paimon's just scared that you'll break the treasure in the middle of the fight!
Traveler: We don't even know if there's a treasure here to break.
Paimon: There has to be! There... is, right?

## Talk 19

Paimon: Oh, we were there for the rising water level crisis, too...
Virgil: Oh, then you two know what I'm talking about. It's unfortunate, but at least it all worked out in the end.
Paimon: Yeah, just thinking about it still gives Paimon the shivers. People were adrift in the water, and if help had come any later...

## Talk 20

Paimon: This machine... Why does it look kind of... familiar...?
Traveler: I think we've seen it before...
Paimon: Well, since this order brought all kinds of mechanisms from other nations to this place, this is probably something they hauled over from some distant ruin as well.
Paimon: Wah! Paimon just had a really scary thought... Wh—What if the so-called "treasure" is just their research findings, and has nothing to do with piles of Mora at all...?
Traveler: Knowledge has value, too.
Paimon: #Yeah, you're right, {NICKNAME}... but Paimon still wants Mora!
Paimon: If we had hundreds of millions of Mora, we could build a pretty house and invite all our friends over, just eating great food and having fun day after day!
Traveler: Doesn't ring a bell...

## Talk 21

Virgil: How will we open that door and proceed onward...
Paimon: Ooh, so this is the "Forum" you were talking about! There are so many books everywhere — they must really have been dedicated to studying and conducting research...
Paimon: Paimon would never have guessed that they were a secret society plotting to overthrow the government of Fontaine!
Virgil: As the saying goes, dear Paimon, "Knowledge is power." This is especially true for the Liliacruces Forum.
Virgil: You should understand that with great knowledge comes great power. And once great power is yours to command... There will only be one path left to you.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't think that logic really holds water, but you're the local, not Paimon, so Paimon'll trust you know what you're talking about and leave it at that!
Paimon: They seem to have been researching some amazing things, though. And we've already seen plenty of stuff that obviously isn't from here on the way...

## Talk 22

Traveler: Last time we saw them was in the deserts of Sumeru.

## Talk 23

Paimon: Wow, it looks so heavy, and so hot and stuffy...
Virgil: Actually, you can place Mist Flowers wrapped in cloth inside to lower the temperature! As for the weight, well, just put it underwater.
Virgil: There's no time for delay! Let's go, my friends!

## Talk 24

Paimon: But now that you mention it, this Liliacruces Forum really did a lot of research, didn't they? We saw so many Kameras along the way...
Paimon: They were probably used to record the results of their experiments, right? And there's also a notebook here too, let's see...
Paimon: Yep, yep...
Paimon: It's hard to make out a lot of the words... It says, "When... something goes out of control, break... something else, something something, so damage can be controlled..."

## Talk 25

Paimon: There's a glass wall here, and it seems like there's a bunch of water behind it...
Traveler: Look, there are cracks in the glass.
Paimon: Ack! That looks dangerous! If the glass suddenly breaks, who knows where we'll get swept off to...
Paimon: Let's find the treasure quickly, and get the heck out of here!

## Talk 26

Traveler: Wait, let me prepare first.
Virgil: Very well. But please allow me to remind you to make it quick. Treasure hates waiting.

## Talk 27

Virgil: Well? Are you ready?

## Talk 28

Virgil: #Good heavens, {NICKNAME}, you certainly have a way with these Meka.
Paimon: Phew! We must be getting close to the treasure. After all, we've already run into the guards!
Virgil: Though Fontaine's achievements are as numerous and dazzling as the stars in the sky, the clockwork meka are undoubtedly the most exquisite of them all! Though, perhaps I shouldn't overpraise. One of the most exquisite.
Virgil: You must have traveled via aquabus when you visited the Court, correct? Tell me you've seen the intricate Steambird as well. In Fontaine, even blacksmithing is done by Meka!
Virgil: Why, the Maison Gardiennage didn't even have to lift a finger to beat me up. They just sent out some Gardemeks! It hurt so much, there was no choice but to submit...
Traveler: Beat you up?
Virgil: I mean, beat up the bad guys! Why would they ever beat me up?
Paimon: Whoa! If Meka are already so advanced, then surely the people of Fontaine don't need to do anything for themselves anymore, and can just leave everything to machines!
Virgil: Hahaha, that's a good one, my dear friend, you're just adorable! It's a lot cheaper to hire a human than buy a clockwork meka. Or to put it another way, no one and nothing can infringe on a Fontaine citizen's right to work!

## Talk 29

Traveler: Yes, please lead the way.
Virgil: Your wish is my command. Please, follow me. Our destination is not far from the Court of Fontaine...
