# Bamboo Shoot Soup

A soup dish that's been stewed for a good long while. The meat and ham have been diced into small pieces, and the soup has been kept on low heat till it turned milky white. The process has brought out the distinct flavors of both kinds of meat, making for an especially tasty soup.
