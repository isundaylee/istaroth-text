Yougui: I wish there were fewer steps... I really want to get them to our customers quickly.

## Talk

Traveler: Steps?
Yougui: The elevation differences in Yilong Wharf are too great, and the water-powered lift is only used to transport large items. It doesn't run often, either.
Yougui: Sometimes we just have to take the stairs when we get a job that needs delivering quickly.
Yougui: The paths between the upper and lower wharf are designed to be long and winding. Stops them from being steep, but that's extra work for us.
Yougui: I've heard that the Communications Office is planning on building several small lifts... That will improve the situation, no doubt about it.

## Talk

Traveler: Are delivery timetables too tight?
Yougui: But we don't really have a say in this, and neither do our customers.
Yougui: Accidents on the job are very common, and we're often delayed by all kinds of things...
Yougui: Sometimes we're several days late, and if we were delivering precious ingredients, they'd be spoiled by then.
Yougui: We don't like to see it happen either, so we can only deliver as quickly as possible.
Yougui: But can you pin the blame on our fellow guards?
Yougui: No, you can't! Some jobs require traveling very long distances, across places that may not be safe.

## Talk

Traveler: You've got this!
Yougui: Right. I'll just suck it up. I can take a few more jobs!
