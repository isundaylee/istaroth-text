Traveler: You're...
Anchieta: The boss of Djembe Studios, at your service. I sell some old instruments.
Anchieta: Quite a few tourists who watch musical performances at Colomche Plaza come here to buy some â€” for my part, I always get them to try things out first, then come back the next day.
Anchieta: Many youngsters get caught up in the heat of the moment, buy an instrument, then wind up never playing it.
Anchieta: All the ones sold here hold some sentimental value to me, so I'd rather they not lie abandoned in someone's house.
Anchieta: As such, I prefer to give customers a chance to cool down and come back later. There's time aplenty, after all.
Anchieta: This store isn't going anywhere, and there's nothing wrong with just enjoying music.
