Traveler: No.
Little Liu: Aw, that sucks! Nobody remembers the adventurers who don't have Visions.
Little Liu: Wanna know why? 'Cause when you get a Vision you get to use elemental power, and you can use that to fight evil and become a legend!

Little Liu: In short, if you ain't got a Vision, you can forget your dreams of becoming a big hero.
