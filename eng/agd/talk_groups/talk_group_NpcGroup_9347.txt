Yelan: A safe house, huh... I'm not a fan of using safe houses that I haven't personally vetted and kitted out. But this is better than nothing.
Yelan: Exploring this domain is one heck of a big job. Even if I wanted to get it over and done with in one go... Looks like neither the rules of this place nor my stamina would allow it.
Yelan: You should conserve your energy too. Don't run yourself ragged, it's not worth it.

## Talk

Yelan: We've still got quite a few punishing battles ahead of us, don't we? You ready?
Yelan: If life gets too dull for too long, I start to feel numb inside. I need some excitement to make me feel alive.
Yelan: Why don't I roll the dice? If I like the numbers I roll, we'll keep going... Could be a fun way to liven things up around here.

## Talk

Yelan: There are real people and real events out there that are more incredible than anything you'll find in fiction. Shame no one'll ever be allowed to write a book about it.
Yelan: Curious? What if I told you that the things I'm referring to... no one'll ever be allowed to talk about, either?
Yelan: Hehe... Okay, we can chat about something that isn't top-secret information if you want... But we'll still have to go somewhere a little more private.
