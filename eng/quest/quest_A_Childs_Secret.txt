# A Child's Secret


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}... look over there!
Paimon: She's... all by herself, right?
Paimon: Because she's acting as if she's talking and laughing with somebody else... Uhhh! Paimon's creeped out...
Traveler: I had an imaginary friend too when I was a kid.
Paimon: #What? You mean you used to act like that too, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Uh... so is this... an invisible friend who hangs out with you sometimes? Or... do they just exist in your imagination?
Traveler: "Imaginary" means "in your imagination."
Paimon: Imaginary... imagination...
Paimon: ...Oh, you must mean "imagined friend," right? Why didn't you just say so!
Paimon: So, this "imaginary friend" of yours... When does Paimon get to meet them?
Traveler: We, uh, don't hang out anymore.
Paimon: Seriously? So imaginary friends just... disappear when you grow up?
Traveler: Exactly, yes.
Paimon: #Oh... Paimon was looking forward to meeting yours... Hey, don't suppose your {M#sister}{F#brother} has an imaginary friend, too?
Traveler: Sure they do.
Paimon: No way! You guys are so lucky...
Paimon: Because they have this game in Liyue — have you heard of it? It's a four player game, but it seems you guys could play it with just the two of you!
Venti: Traveler! Fancy meeting you here.
Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard! What are you doing here!
Venti: Haha, I'm here because Lisa has been making some exciting new contraptions.
Paimon: Why does the thought of Lisa's contraptions make Paimon so nervous...
Venti: Come now, that's no way to speak about the elegant Miss Lisa!
Venti: For this particular contraption, Lisa had to import some dangerous materials from Sumeru.
Paimon: D—Dangerous!?
Traveler: A monocle equipped with some sort of... detector?
Venti: That's right! Looks like a monocle, but actually it's called a nirnama detector.
Venti: Sadly, Lisa isn't able to use it herself, so I'm borrowing it for a while. ...And also, I'm testing it out for her, to see if it actually works.
Paimon: Huh? Why can't Lisa use it?
Venti: Hmm... Perhaps it's because she lacks a certain childlike sense of wonder? Or maybe there's some other reason for it.
Venti: If you want to know for sure, just ask her yourself sometime.
Paimon: So you can see them? Go on, tell us — what does this imaginary friend look like?
Venti: Haha... That would be telling.
Venti: Anyway, it's all yours now, Traveler. Take a look, see if you can see Nora's imaginary friend.
Paimon: Do you see 'em? Do you see 'em?
Traveler: Wow, it really works!
Venti: So, it does work for you too...
Paimon: Paimon wants to see~! ...Wait, but this gizmo isn't in Paimon's size.
Paimon: #Alright then, you'll have to be Paimon's eyes on the ground, {NICKNAME}! Let's go see what <color=#00E1FFFF>everyone's</color> imaginary friends look like.
Traveler: Yeah! Seems like they're best friends.
Traveler: Looks like a regular monocle to me.
Venti: I know, right? Apparently, though, it's called a nirnama detector.
Traveler: Tragically, yes.
Traveler: They're... invisible now.
Traveler: "In your imagination" means "imaginary."
Paimon: Imagination... imaginary...

## Talk 2

Venti: There it is. Behold, a floaty imaginary friend for floaty-headed Flora: A Bloatty Floatty!
Paimon: Wait, imaginary friends can be plants now!?
Flora: Hehehe, hi Traveler, hi Bard.
Traveler: Hi Flora. Can I ask a question?
Flora: Sure. How can I help?
Traveler: Who's your... friend?
Flora: Hmm? Oh, you mean Mr. Floatty? Most people can't see him.
Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We grew up together!
Paimon: (*grumble* No fair! Paimon hates feeling left out...)
Venti: Flora... Why exactly are you friends with a Bloatty Floatty?
Flora: What's wrong with it? I always wanted to be friends with a plant who could fly.
Paimon: Friends with a flying plant? Why?
Flora: Hehehe, because then when it's windy, you and your friend can fly off into the sky together! You gotta admit that's pretty cool.
Paimon: ...Isn't that called being blown away?
Flora: Hehehe, that's what some people like to call it.
Flora: I only found out this plant existed from an explorer who told me stories of his adventures.
Flora: I think his name was... Stanley!
Traveler: Oh, I know Stanley.
Flora: Stanley's an adventurer.
Flora: And you can tell he's an expert at it from the stories he tells! Hehehe.
Flora: "The amazing adventures of Stanley" are super famous in Mondstadt!
Flora: He's in the city at the moment. You should go ask him to tell you some of his stories.
Venti: That sounds like a fun idea for next time! But right now we have other things to attend to...
Traveler: Not someone I know.
Traveler: Are you two family, or...?
Flora: Hehehe, you mean me and Mr. Floatty?
Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We live together.
Flora: Say hello, Mr. Floatty! They can see you.
Traveler: Hi. Have you got a minute?

## Talk 3

Paimon: N—No way!
Venti: Well. That... is unexpected.
Paimon: Timmie's imaginary friend is a R—Ruin Guard!?
Traveler: Am I... seeing things...?
Paimon: Paimon's freaking out right now... That thing is sure to attack us!
Venti: Haha... What say you we postpone our conversation with Timmie for the time being?
Traveler: Paimon, it's time to say the line.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon has a favorite line?
Traveler: The one about exploring the area ahead of us later.
Paimon: Seriously? Oh, alright then...
Paimon: How about we explore the area ahead of us later?
Traveler: That line you love to say so much.
Traveler: I've heard of "guardian angels," but come on...

## Talk 4

Kaeya: The thing about wine is, you have to drink it at the tavern or you miss out on half the fun.
Diluc: Seems to me you'd find some way of keeping yourself amused even if you drank alone.
Kaeya: Haha, if I didn't know any better, I would say you're being deliberately uncivil.
Diluc: Just... drink responsibly on my premises, okay?
Kaeya: Oh? And if I did have one too many, what then? You'd throw me out along with the trash, is that it?
Diluc: "Throw you out"?
Kaeya: You know... the same way you threw out Father's legacy? You sold off his mansion — or maybe you've forgotten?
Diluc: I see no reason to cling to things that have outlived their purpose.
Kaeya: Is that so? Then I trust you were most swift indeed to part with a certain vase?
Diluc: Sorry, I have no recollection.
Reckless Pallad: That's odd. Master Diluc, I'm sure I saw such a vase in your home — a beautiful one, unmistakable, in fact...
Paimon: Seems our suspicions were right... Grown-ups don't appear to have imaginary friends.
Venti: Like I said — a lack of childlike wonder.
Traveler: Seems adults are the same everywhere.
Paimon: So people just stop dreaming when they grow up? Okay, well, Paimon for one never wants to grow up!
Venti: Hmm... This raises an interesting question: At what age, exactly, do people's imaginary friends disappear?
Venti: Let's... go and check.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Jean! What is Jean doing here?
Paimon: Is Master Jean Ellin's imaginary friend?
Traveler: Ellin is a conscientious child.
Paimon: So she's so determined to become a knight that she... Okay, that's kinda weird.
Ellin: Hmm? Oh, hello. What are you guys doing?
Paimon: Are you always training here?
Ellin: You bet. Today, I heard Stanley talking about his adventures. It was incredible! It got me really pumped up.
Ellin: I hope I can be as outstanding as him one day.
Venti: So that you can fight shoulder to shoulder with Master Jean?
Ellin: I—I mean, obviously I want to become a knight! ...And if I got to go on an adventure with Jean herself... Well, even better!
Paimon: Seems Ellin reeeally looks up to Jean.
Traveler: There's nothing wrong with that.
Ellin: Thanks!
Ellin: I was thinking, it's not every day I get to hang out with the Honorary Knight... Would you join me for some <color=#00E1FFFF>sword training</color>?
Traveler: I believe you'll succeed, Ellin.
Traveler: Ellin is really determined to become a knight.
Paimon: Yeah, she's so conscientious it's... terrifying!

## Talk 6

Ellin: Whew! Thank you. It's clear I still have a long way to go in my training.
Venti: So modest! I for one think you're quite the pro at this already.
Ellin: Well, I'm exhausted from training, so clearly my fitness needs some work. One day, though... I'll smash all the training dummies in Mondstadt...
Paimon: Ellin, Ellin, she's our girl! If she can't do it... um, hilichurl!
Ellin: Thanks... Shoot, I got so caught up here I forgot there's something I was supposed to do today!
Ellin: Ugh... But I'm so sore from training, I can hardly move...
Ellin: Honorary Knight, could you deliver a message to Jack for me?
Traveler: Who's Jack?
Ellin: He's a friend of mine. Recently started as an adventurer.
Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
Ellin: If I'm not mistaken, you should find him at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Temple of the Lion</color>. He's adventuring with Stanley today.
Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
Traveler: Temple of the Lion? Sure, I miss that place!
Ellin: Great! Thank you so much.
Traveler: Sure. Where can I find him?
Ellin: He's gone adventuring at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Temple of the Lion</color> with Stanley today.
Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
