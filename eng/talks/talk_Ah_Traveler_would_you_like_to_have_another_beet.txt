Contestant with Super OP Gear: #Ah, Traveler, would you like to have another beetle battle with me?
Traveler: Let's go, let's go!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Hehe! Who knows? I might discover a little trick, and I'll have you backed into a corner before you know it!
Traveler: Been busy lately, Yanfei?
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Oh, I'm fine, I'm good!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I mean, even legal experts don't have business to attend to every day, you know.
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Which is just as well. While my fellow disciples are having their reunion, I'm going to be spending all my annual leave!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I'll eat my fill, sleep my due, play to my heart's content â€” and then go back to my work refreshed and renewed.
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Now that's what they call a happy life!
Traveler: See you around, Yanfei!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Sure. Swing by when you're free and teach me this game, alright?
