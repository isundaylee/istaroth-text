Akram: You must know yourself as well as your enemy to win every battle, wouldn't you agree?

Traveler: What do you mean?
Akram: As you've seen, I'm a member of the Corps of Thirty. Naturally, we're responsible for keeping the peace in Sumeru City.
Akram: Theft, meanwhile, is the most common crime we see in the more crowded parts of the city.
Akram: How else can you catch a thief except by being familiar with how a thief thieves?
Akram: When my younger brother sees me occasionally — VERY occasionally, mind you! — simulate a theft in action, he always exposes my technique.
Akram: How am I supposed to improve that way!?

Traveler: See you.
Akram: Yeah, see you later.
