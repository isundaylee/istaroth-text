Cipac: Hello there! Looking for something to eat? You can grab a bite to have while you stroll through the market, or take it with you to watch a match â€” it's completely up to you!

## Talk

Traveler: I am indeed somewhat hungry.
Cipac: Hehe, here's the menu.

## Talk

Traveler: How's business been?
Cipac: Not bad, but not the best.
Cipac: After all, there's no matches on right this moment. Of course, we're busiest during the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, when everyone rushes over to the Stadium with a snack or drink in hand.
Cipac: And if you get hungry while you're watching a match, go find that young man Agemo.
Cipac: He's from the Scions of the Canopy, about... This tall. Agh, speaking of which, where's he gotten off to now?
Cipac: Anyway, he's quick on his feet, that one. Whatever you want, he'll bring you it exactly how it's meant to taste, be it piping hot or ice cold!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Cipac: Come again next time!
