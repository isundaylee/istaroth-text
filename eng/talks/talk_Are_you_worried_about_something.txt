Traveler: Are you worried about something?
Hirohiko: I'm a guard sent from the Yashiro Commission here to look after the event venue. Naturally, I'm worried about the safety of this place.
Hirohiko: Festivals and Fireworks Shows here are always popular and packed with people, but that means that problems and incidents can also arise quite easily.
Hirohiko: The Yashiro Commission needs to keep an eye on all sorts of things, from venue maintenance to fire hazard prevention with regard to flammable items.
Hirohiko: Erm... It's not that I don't like these types of events. I enjoy beautiful fireworks as well! It's just that it's very hard to manage events where there are so many people.
Hirohiko: It would honestly be a huge headache for the Yashiro Commission if our manager's wish came true and everyone in Teyvat came to Inazuma to watch the fireworks...
Hirohiko: All in all, though fun is important in any event, safety should still be our top priority.
