Madame Ping: Missing text (3136838874)
Traveler: My clothes are soaked through...
Madame Ping: I'm terribly sorry, children, how absent-minded of me. I had thought there was only a little water inside.
Madame Ping: At least this teapot is more or less clean now. There are a few final nooks and crannies to attend to, but all in good time.
Paimon: Granny, did you put the whole Bishui River in there or something!?
Madame Ping: Foolish child, I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing â€” wherever would the poor city folks draw their water from if I did that? No, I was careful to use only half of the river's water.
Madame Ping: Sorry for causing you a little spot of bother on this occasion. Please accept these as thanks for your help.
Madame Ping: Oh, and I mustn't forget to return the water from the teapot back to the river some time...
Traveler: Should be spick and span in there by now.
Madame Ping: Well, mostly. There are still a few nooks and crannies, mind you, that one shall have to get inside and clean out.
