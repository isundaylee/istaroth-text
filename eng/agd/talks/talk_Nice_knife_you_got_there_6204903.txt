Traveler: Nice knife you got there.
Dugu Shuo: Knife? You call this a knife? ...It's a sword, obviously!
Dugu Shuo: It's called the Dugu Longsword. The blacksmith made it specially for me.
Dugu Shuo: He also thought of a motto for me: "Longsword in hand and the world at my feet"!
Dugu Shuo: He even inscribed it on the sword for me to make sure I don't forget it. Such a great guy!
