# The Cloud-Padded Path to the Chiwang Repose


## Talk 1

Fujin: #Huh? {NICKNAME}, Paimon, and Lingyuan... Why did you all come here?
Paimon: Whoa, that's Fujin's voice! And it's... coming from down below?
Traveler: I'm a little worried about you.
Paimon: Yeah! We're all worried about your health, so we just came here without giving you a heads up — you did the same thing to us first, so Paimon thinks we're square now!
Fujin: Huh? Ah! Sorry! When I returned here to rest, I think I forgot to unlock the entrance...! I am so sorry. You came here to see me, but I made things harder for you instead...
Paimon: Oh, it wasn't much of a hassle! But why are you... uh, hiding in a puddle?
Fujin: Hmm, how should I put it...? Because I can't return to the form I prefer yet, and with you guys always seeing me in my Carp form, I can't help but feel a bit... embarrassed...
Traveler: You are aware that we've already seen it many, many times, right?
Fujin: Ahaha... But before, I could turn back into human form whenever I wanted, so I thought moving around as a Carp was just a matter of convenience. But now, all I have is this slick and slippery self, so I find it a bit...
Paimon: Whoa, that's a bit of a strange thing to be so insistent about... But anyway, all that matters is that you're okay!
Paimon: But Lingyuan said that your adeptal energy wasn't consumed, it was just dispersed around the mountains, forests, and rivers of Chenyu Vale, and that's why you've been weakened so much...
Paimon: So if we were to collect the scattered adeptal energy, just like when we were finding the Golden Carp in Yaodie Valley, then you'd get better, right?
Fujin: Yes... At least, in theory, that's correct, but...
Paimon: Right, right? So if we see similar Carp, we should just bring them back here! That way, you'll recover much faster!
Fujin: Th—That would be far too much trouble for you! My power is not yet that feeble. If I simply rest here for some time, it will be enough...
Traveler: It's not that much of a hassle...
Traveler: ...We'll just keep our eyes peeled if we run into any.
Fujin: Thank you, then. However, I really don't want to trouble you anymore on my behalf. You've already done so much for me.
Fujin: If the two of you should happen to find any more adeptal energy during your travels, please simply transfer it into the jade here.
Fujin: Though balance has been restored to the water and soil, if we can add more power to the Rainjade, we can ensure favorable weather and prosperous years to come.
Lingyuan: ...And what about you?
Fujin: Really now! I already told you, all I need to do is rest here for a bit!
Fujin: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, I really am quite grateful, and quite happy, that you came to visit me. This is the first time anyone has come here since Herblord left.
Fujin: And thank you as well, Lingyuan.
Lingyuan: I have done nothing worthy of your thanks.
Fujin: #Alright, enough of that! Then just think of it as me thanking you for bringing {NICKNAME} and Paimon here! Really, now...
Fujin: #And lastly... Let me say thank you once more, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. For all you have done.
Traveler: So there's no need to hide yourself, is there?
Traveler: Lingyuan is a little worried about you.
Lingyuan: I am not. I just...
Lingyuan: ...
Paimon: Yeah! Lingyuan's been so worried about your health that she can barely speak, so we just came here without giving you a heads up — but you did the same thing to us first, so Paimon thinks we're square now!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Speaking of which, this should be your abode, right, Fujin? It feels a bit different from the other adeptal abodes we've been in... How should Paimon put it... it feels more... pragmatic?
Paimon: There are no weird mechanisms or transparent floating bridges...
Fujin: I am very sorry... I was just too embarrassed before, and so never explained clearly.
Fujin: I cannot create new adeptal realms like the adepti of the south. "Carp's Rest" is no "abode." At best, it's just a "cave"...
Paimon: Cave, realm, whatever! They're all "abodes" where adepti live, aren't they? Still, we don't even know when you can turn back into your human form...
Lingyuan: All the power she accumulated has dispersed across this land. She will be unable to revert to human form for some time.
Lingyuan: I am the same way when I've exhausted my power. After Master died, the snow fell, melted, and then it fell once more after melting, and did so countless times before I could regain human form.
Paimon: Oh, so that's it... huh? Wait a sec, Lingyuan, you can turn into a person too!?
Fujin: Why, of course! There is much you two know not! Why, back then, on Mt. Yaojun, Lingyuan's looks were—
Lingyuan: Fujin. No need to speak of such things. It has nothing to do with the present topic.
Fujin: Eh? So, the whole thing about eating too many teacakes at the temple fair in human form, and crying to Herblord about brewing weight-loss tea...
Fujin: Or the incident where you accidentally drank the celebratory libations and hauled forest boars in to ask them "Who's prettier, me or Herblord?"... Ah! But I needn't speak of such things after all, do I?
Lingyuan: ...Fujin!
Paimon: Wow! After all that, Paimon's getting curious. What does your human form look like, Lingyuan? Would you be as blue as you are now? Or would you be... Uh, a slightly lighter shade?
Traveler: Now I'm curious too.
Lingyuan: I do not understand your curiosity. You are people too. If you are interested in human forms, just look at yourselves.
Fujin: #Hehe... Anyway, thank you, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. I never imagined the day would come when I would be able to talk to others like this...
Fujin: *cough*— As one has found oneself in such a joyous state of mind, one is willing to bestow protection upon you two for your journey, guaranteeing success and great fortune...
Paimon: ?
Fujin: ...Sorry, I got a bit carried away. I wanted to try being like those adepti, so I thought I'd try out a phrase or two...
Fujin: Anyway! I'll be staying here and praying for your journey to go smoothly.
Traveler: Lingyuan, could you turn human, just for a second?
Lingyuan: I refuse. Human bodies are weak. They lack fangs to rend and rip prey, and claws to hound and hunt enemies. I would not do such a thing unless commanded to by Fujin.
Fujin: ...Eh? R—Really? I—In that case, I think maybe we should just respect Lingyuan's wishes...?
Lingyuan: I do not have any wishes. If you have some, tell me so directly.

## Talk 3

Lingyuan: #{NICKNAME} and Paimon. You're here.
Paimon: Huh? Lingyuan? Why are you over here?
Lingyuan: Because I can't get in.
Paimon: Can't get in? Uh, where can't you get into?
Lingyuan: Carp's Rest. Where Fujin is resting.
Paimon: Carp's Rest... Oh! You mean the place Fujin dragged us off to way back when?
Lingyuan: It is an abode sealed by her adeptal energy. I don't have her adeptal energy. Thus, I cannot go to her.
Paimon: Huh? But you didn't mention anything before she went back to rest...
Lingyuan: It escaped my mind.
Traveler: Do you need help?
Lingyuan: The adeptal energy you possess is sufficient to open the gate of Carp's Rest. So yes, I need your help.
Paimon: Huh? Wait a sec, so you've been waiting here for us this whole time?
Lingyuan: I was not waiting for you. I was looking for a way into Carp's Rest.
Paimon: That seems like pretty much the same thing to... Uh, anyway, we're a bit worried about Fujin's condition too, so why don't we go see her together?
Lingyuan: Fine. Thank you both.
Lingyuan: Follow me.
Traveler: Bit late now, Bluey.
Paimon: Yeah, how could you forget something as important as that!? Really, now.
Lingyuan: It is because I am a slow-witted beast. Seeing her, I think of many things, and forget many things. It is my fault.
Lingyuan: The adeptal energy you possess is sufficient to open the gate of Carp's Rest. So yes, I need your help.

## Talk 4

Little Mao: Bluey, Bluey, you didn't tell me the ending to that story you were telling me last time!
Lingyuan: Yes. I remember. However, I've changed my mind.
Little Mao: "Changed your mind"? What's that supposed to mean?
Lingyuan: I'll leave the ending of the story... to you.
Little Mao: Ehhh!? C'mon, Bluey, that's cheating! You promised that you'd tell me a story if I told you one! How come I'm the one telling both stories now!?
Lingyuan: I'm just a simple-minded beast. I cannot think of a good ending.
Lingyuan: The ending I came up with was a bad ending. The story is also a bad story that wouldn't make anyone happy. So, I'll let you tell the ending of the story.
Little Mao: But that's still cheating!
Lingyuan: I do not deny that. As compensation, I can take you to see the hidden sights of Mt. Lingmeng.
Lingyuan: ...
Lingyuan: Don't make that face. I will give you special permission to... Sit on my back, for five minutes or so. Ten minutes will do, too.
Little Mao: In... In that case, then it's a deal! I'll think of an ending for the story...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh? Lingyuan, is that you?
Lingyuan: ...
Paimon: Ah, sorry! Are you hunting? Did we disturb you?
Lingyuan: I was not hunting. You did not disturb me either.
Paimon: Uh... Then were you just... spacing out? Like, thinking about tasty food and stuff?
Lingyuan: I wasn't thinking about you either. I was just thinking.
Paimon: Thinking... Hang on, wait! What did you mean by that first part!?
Lingyuan: #I am thinking about the question {NICKNAME} asked before.
Lingyuan: "If human activities are part of the laws of nature, how would you view humanity?"
Lingyuan: It has been too long since I last had contact with the humans constituting the settlement — I have not been there since Fujin and the snake left.
Paimon: Hey, you're making it sound like Little Mao doesn't count as a human!
Lingyuan: #Little Mao is a human that belongs to the settled humans, but is not a human who constitutes the settlement. You and {NICKNAME} "constitute" travel companions, but you do not "belong" to {NICKNAME}. That is the difference.
Traveler: You don't consider Little Mao a part of the social order?
Lingyuan: Not in full. Most human young are like this until they are completely absorbed by the order, just as it is in nature.
Lingyuan: It has been too long since I have been in contact with the humans who constitute the settlement. It could be because of hatred, fear, or maybe even both.
Traveler: Because they have encroached on the land that belongs to nature?
Lingyuan: I don't know.
Lingyuan: Or perhaps no obvious differences exist that separate "us" from "them," but I cannot be sure.
Lingyuan: The young of the humans walk with me. Similarly, a youngling of our kin walks with a human out of curiosity.
Paimon: Eh? A youngling of your kind?
Lingyuan: That child encountered a mortal in the mountains.
Lingyuan: So, I still cannot answer your question. I must continue to observe humanity.
Lingyuan: There are many things I do not understand. I will try to understand until I can answer your question, as I promised to.
Traveler: Because Fujin chose to sacrifice herself for them?
Traveler: I wouldn't be too sure...
Paimon: Hey! Don't say weird things like that!

## Talk 6

Little Mao: Listening to Mountain, it sounds like Fontaine's operas are pretty similar to ours!
Little Mao: Knights, magicians, brave warriors, and evil dragons, you kill me, I kill you, and in the end, everyone's dead!
Hautemontagne: What's important isn't the ending! It's the process — how you get there! Not every tragedy can be seen as a mere sequence of fight scenes!
Little Mao: Oh, oh! And the "Ray-more-young Golems" Mountain was just talking about sound really, really cool too! I wonder if they're bigger than Bluey?
Hautemontagne: Eh? Bluey?
Little Mao: Oh, right! I never told you about Bluey, did I... How about this? You tell me more about "Ray-more-young Golems," and I'll tell you about Bluey!

## Talk 7

Lingyuan: ...
Fujin: What's wrong, Lingyuan? You keep staring at me. Do I have food on my face or something?
Lingyuan: I was just thinking... No. It's nothing.
Lingyuan: Even if you and the snake both asked me to, I will never again take human form.
Fujin: Hehe. I haven't ever asked you to before, have I now?
Lingyuan: ...Forget it. Let's go. Or did you not clamor to see the present tea garden?

## Talk 8

Little Mao: Big Sis Fujin! Congratulations on returning to your former self!
Little Mao: Bluey already told me all about it! You really like tea, so I specially requested that Grandpa Lu make you a super-duper delicious teacake!
Fujin: That's right, I'm back, completely and totally back! Little Mao, thank you so much for preparing a teacake just for me, I'm so happy!
Little Mao: There's some for you two, too! We can all eat teacakes together and celebrate Fujin's recovery!
Traveler: (Take a piece of cake.)
Paimon: Hehe, thanks, Little Mao! Since there's so much left, Paimon will take two pieces!
Traveler: (Take two pieces of cake.)
Paimon: Hehe, thanks, Little Mao! Since that's the case, Paimon will take two... too? Waaah! There's only one piece left!
