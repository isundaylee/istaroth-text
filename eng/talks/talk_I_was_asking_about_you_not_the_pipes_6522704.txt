Traveler: I was asking about you, not the pipes.
Balent: Oh! I see... Thanks for your concern.
Balent: After that incident, I started studying some basic self-defense in my time off. So now, even if I run into trouble while I'm working, I should be able to escape at least.
Balent: There are some risks associated with working out here. It would be a good idea to include some fitness and self-defense skills in our staff training from now on.
