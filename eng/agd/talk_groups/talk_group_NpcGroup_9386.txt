Kachina: I wonder what'll happen if we keep going further in...

Kachina: Still, I just found one I really like! It's all about brave dragon-riding knights defeating a dark lord! There's nothing the hero and his dragon buddy can't do — they're amazing!
Kachina: I'm going to tell Ayo this story when I get back! I bet he'll love it so much, he'll do a little dance!
