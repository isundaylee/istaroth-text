Traveler: What are you waiting for?
Dana: An outcome that will decide my future!
Dana: ...It's my application to remain in school after graduation.
Dana: I heard the competition to join the Akademiya has been growing in intensity. People are giving recommendations to Ms. Kemia every day. I wonder if I still have a chance...
Dana: No, I must stay confident. Based on the results of my final paper, I still have quite the advantage.

Traveler: See you.
Dana: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, please let my application get approved...

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your results...
Dana: It was on Padisarah.
Dana: Do you know that there are very few plantations of Padisarah due to its harsh requirements for the environment?
Dana: If it's possible to develop a stabler variety, then it'll be able to greatly improve the efficiency of growing Padisarah.
Dana: I proposed quite an effective solution in my graduation paper. If I can stay in school and continue my research after graduation, I'm certain that I'll be able to make a bigger breakthrough.

Dana: By the way, these are the Padisarah I cultivated during my research.
Dana: Smells amazing, right? Please take them as a gift. I just hope all our wishes will come true.
