# Across the Sea


## Talk 1

Daipai: Be on your guard, Traveler. Now is no time for sightseeing.
Paimon: Oh, why's that? Has something happened?
Daipai: Yes. As unusual as this may sound, numerous eyewitness reports have confirmed an active Ruin Guard presence in this area, even though this is far beyond their normal area of activity.
Daipai: Sergeant sent someone to find out just where these ancient machines might have come from. It appears that they simply left their ruin and marched off all of a sudden, for no clear reason.
Paimon: So did somebody wake them up?
Daipai: As I say, the reason is still unclear. We have very little intelligence at present.
Daipai: Moreover... The ruin in question is of the especially spooky variety. Strange noises are often heard coming from within...
Daipai: As such, we are not permitted to investigate until the order comes through from headquarters.
Traveler: One can never be too cautious.
Daipai: In any case, the only sensible strategy in the meantime is to increase Millelith patrols. We must not let innocent civilians come to harm.
Paimon: That's a good point... Ruin Guards are probably pretty dangerous for regular folk...
Traveler: Is there any way I can help?
Daipai: Wow, uh... I'm very grateful indeed for the offer, but... it just wouldn't be worth the risk.
Paimon: #Oh, don't worry about that! {NICKNAME} here, {M#he}{F#she} beats up Ruin Guards for breakfast!
Traveler: I do know a little self-defense.
Daipai: Is that so...
Daipai: Well, if you're genuinely offering...
Daipai: I did see some Ruin Guard footprints on the <color=#00E1FFFF>hillside</color>, but since then I've been too busy warning passers-by to investigate myself...
Paimon: Footprints, eh? Interesting... We'll take the case!
Daipai: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail! On behalf of the Millelith, I salute you, Traveler. You have my gratitude. I will rendezvous with you once I have finished my patrol.
Traveler: Not to brag, but I could beat ten of you in a fight.
Daipai: Ahaha, the self-confidence of young people is an extraordinary thing...
Traveler: The Millelith... Always so inefficient.
Daipai: Sorry? Did you say something?
Paimon: ...Was that supposed to be your impression of Master Diluc talking about the Knights of Favonius?

## Talk 2

Teucer: Hey, you! Check this out, isn't it awesome!
Paimon: ...What is he wearing?
Teucer: I've never seen one this close before! Have you ever seen one?
Traveler: Yes, it's a powered-down Ruin Guard.
Teucer: Um, excuse me? His name is Mr. Cyclops, actually! What sorta dumb name is "Ruin Guard"?
Paimon: "Mr. Cyclops"? Aw, that's cute... Wait, what? Do people seriously call them that?
Teucer: Yep! My brother said so. And he's the best toy seller in the whole world! It's his job to sell this kinda stuff!
Teucer: Right now he's at the Institute for Toy Research in Liyue. That's where Mr. Cyclopses come from.
Teucer: It's always nice to meet someone else who likes toys. So tell me, where'd you get your toy from? Must be a pretty new kind, I've never seen one that can fly and talk before!
Traveler: Paimon is not a toy, neither are Ruin Guards...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon is not a toy!
Daipai: Greetings, have you found anythi— Oh, a child...? Wh—What's the situation here?
Paimon: We just, y'know, found him.
Daipai: Uh-uh, you shouldn't be out here, boy. There are killing machines in the area, it's extremely dangerous.
Teucer: "Killing machines"? You mean... ones that look like this?
Daipai: Precisely, and including this one. It's not moving now, but if it were to wake up, the consequences would be...
Teucer: You take that back! Mr. Cyclops is not a killing machine, he's one of the good guys!
Daipai: Um... "Mr. Cyclops"?
Teucer: We shouldn't be talking to this guy. If he's saying mean things about Mr. Cyclops, he's definitely a bad man.
Daipai: I—I'm just trying to help...
Traveler: I think you've lost him...
Daipai: Ugh, I've always been hopeless at dealing with children...
Paimon: Well then, why don't you get back to your normal job and leave us to do the babysitting?
Daipai: It seems I have no other choice... Very well, I will continue with my patrol. Please escort the child to somewhere safe, it's much too dangerous here.
Teucer: Hahahaha, the mighty Mr. Cyclops scared off the bad guys once again!
Traveler: What's your name, kid?
Teucer: My name's Teucer! I came all the way from Snezhnaya to look for my brother in Liyue. But I'm all on my own, and I don't know where to find him...
Paimon: You came all the way from Snezhnaya!?
Teucer: Oh, I think this is the part where I give you this... Here you go!
Paimon: What is it? Looks heavy...
Paimon: What the!?
Traveler: So much Mora!
Teucer: My brother said I should take it with me. He said, "Find a nice person to give this to, and they will take good care of Teucer."
Paimon: Your brother makes a good point... Still, it's hard to believe you made it all this way armed with nothing but a few bags of Mora...
Paimon: Your family must be super rich! Paimon never knew you could make so much Mora from selling toys.
Traveler: I will gladly take it!
Teucer: #Yay! Thanks, nice {M#guy}{F#lady}!
Teucer: Alright, now we gotta make a pinkie promise!
Teucer: You make a pinkie promise, you keep it all your life. You break a pinkie promise, I throw you on the ice. The cold will kill the pinkie that once betrayed your friend, the frost will freeze your tongue off so you never lie again.
Paimon: Wow... That one nursery rhyme kinda says all you need to know about Snezhnayan culture...
Paimon: Well, if we weren't your babysitters before, we sure as heck are now! ...But where should we look for your brother?
Traveler: Somewhere with close connections to Snezhnaya.
Paimon: Snezhnaya... Ooh, how about the <color=#00E1FFFF>Northland Bank</color>?
Teucer: Alright! Finally, now I get to see my brother!
Traveler: <color=#00E1FFFF>Northland Bank</color>?
Paimon: Great idea. Alright, off we go!
Traveler: I will gladly take it! (And give it to your brother when we find him...)
Traveler: So, so, so much Mora!
Traveler: Where are your family?
Traveler: Maybe let me handle this...
Traveler: Limited edition. Jealous much?
Paimon: Hey! Just 'cause you get to play with Paimon all the time does not mean that Paimon's a toy!
Traveler: Careful kid, these guys are tough.
Teucer: You bet! Mr. Cyclopses are crazy strong! No bad guys can escape from these guys, that's for sure.

## Talk 3

Ekaterina: That seems a little inappropriate, don't you think, sir? How can you—
Childe: Relax, once in a while can't hurt. It'll be fine!
Paimon: Huh? What's he doing here...
Teucer: Yay, my brother! I found you!
Childe: I know that voice... Why, if it isn't my little brother, Teucer! My goodness!
Childe: Haha... What a nice surprise, Teucer! I thought I would have to wait till I return home before seeing you again...
Childe: How are the others — sister Tonia and brother Anthon? Is everybody keeping well?
Teucer: They miss you a lot! Tonia prays for you every day at dinner...
Childe: ...Wait a second, what are you doing here in Liyue, Teucer? How have I not heard anything about this?
Teucer: Well... what happened was... I saw a boat that looked like it was selling toys, so obviously I thought you were on board...
Teucer: And then when I got off I just kept walking and walking... and then, I found a Mr. Cyclops!
Teucer: #Mr. Cyclops scared off a bad guy, and then I found this nice {M#guy}{F#lady} to help me come look for you...
Traveler: So Teucer's a stowaway!
Paimon: And also... Teucer is Childe's brother!?
Paimon: Cool! Suddenly, Paimon doesn't feel so bad about taking Teucer's money!
Childe: Teucer, what you did was extremely dangerous... I'm so happy to see you, really I am, but please... Promise me you won't do anything like this ever again...
Teucer: Okay, I promise... Please don't be mad at me...
Childe: I'm not mad at you. I just care about your safety, that's all.
Childe: If you hadn't met these nice people, things could have been a lot more dangerous for you, Teucer. I hope you said a big thank-you to them?
Teucer: Yep! I always remember my pleases and thank-yous.
Paimon: Oh, so you did notice we were here, you were just ignoring us. Gotcha.
Childe: Hahaha, forgive me, it's always family first where I'm from. Don't take it personally.
Childe: I know we've had our differences up to now, but... a few minor quibbles aside, we get on quite well, don't you think?
Traveler: Do you mean that, or are you just keeping up appearances?
Childe: Heh... Come on, you know I'm just a pawn in all of that. Just doing my part. As for who wins, who loses, and how each side deals with the consequences... I prefer to leave all that up to the ones playing the game.
Childe: I'm much more interested in who wins and who loses when it comes to our little sparring matches.
Paimon: Hmm... Sounds like you're ready to get your butt kicked again?
Childe: Hah! You're forgetting something about me — I, Tartaglia, spend every second getting stronger. Don't expect to have it quite so easy next time.
Traveler: I've also come a long way since then.
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you aren't gonna fight now are you?
Childe: Hahaha... Maybe not right now. Not while my kid brother is watching.
Teucer: #Why do you wanna fight the nice {M#guy}{F#lady}? Are you guys enemies?
Childe: #No, not at all! {NICKNAME}, allow me to formally express my sincerest gratitude for taking care of my darling brother. His safety matters very much to me.
Traveler: I'm still keeping my eye on you.
Paimon: ...Um, so anyway, Paimon has a question...
Paimon: Teucer said something about you being a toy seller... What's all that about? Aren't you supposed to be one of the Fatui's Harb—
Childe: Ahem! Um... Yes, about that...
Childe: Shh, look, I only told him that so that he'll look up to me. In the eyes of a child, working with toys must be the best job imaginable, right?
Childe: I don't want my family to have anything to do with the Fatui's... or should I say, Snezhnaya's... darker side.
Childe: The older ones already know that I serve the Tsaritsa. But Teucer is still so young, and in his eyes...
Childe: Ahem. As I was saying... I remain Snezhnaya's greatest expatriate toy seller, currently attached to the Liyue Branch of our Institute for Toy Research!
Teucer: That's right! My brother's the greatest! He's Mr. Cyclops' bestest friend!
Childe: Just humor me in front of Teucer, if you would be so kind...
Childe: Ah, yes. Ekaterina. I will deal with the issue of that outstanding payment right away.
Paimon: Hey! Slinking off, are we?
Ekaterina: But Master Childe, would it not be a little improper to ask you to deal with... debt collection?
Childe: A bet is a bet, isn't it? And if you lose a bet with an agent... Well, you might as well get a little exercise out of it.
Teucer: Are you going off to sell toys now?
Childe: #That's right! As much as I'd love to catch up a little longer, Teucer, duty calls! I'm sure {M#Mr. Nice Guy}{F#Ms. Nice Lady} here will be happy to keep you company while I'm out, though.
Paimon: Ugh, so we still need to keep babysitting for you?
Teucer: #Sure! I really like this {M#guy}{F#lady}, and anyway {M#he}{F#she} made a pinkie promise to take good care of me!
Childe: Ah! Well, it sounds like Teucer really likes you, and that you've already made a pinkie promise to take good care of him anyway.
Traveler: (They're ganging up on me...) ...Okay, sure.
Childe: Then I'm in your debt. Here, take this as Teucer's entertainment fund. I want him to have a good time while he's in Liyue, so take him anywhere he wants.
Childe: If need be, you may find me by the river near <color=#00E1FFFF>Qingxu Pool</color>. I'll see you both around!
Traveler: Okay, we'll do it. For Teucer.
Traveler: Concern for your family's well-being. That I can understand.
Traveler: Ready whenever you are.
Traveler: You've got a lot of nerve...
Traveler: ...Teucer is Childe's brother!?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's one down.
Paimon: Let's keep looking around. Maybe we'll find some more.

## Talk 5

Daipai: I must continue with my patrol now. Let's rendezvous shortly.
