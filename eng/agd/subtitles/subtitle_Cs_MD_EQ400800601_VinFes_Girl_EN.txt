Klee
Listen
The wind!
The Anemo God is coming!
Alright!
Take this
Crush it, and place it on the fracture
Listen, missy
Promise me
You'll live on
This is where you must stay
You are our only hope
Forgive me
Kaeya
Good
Very good
That's my boy
I will always be proud of you
After all the time we spent on it
The wine still isn't ready
May as well leave it for our son
"Razor"
What do you think of that name?
Ooh!
An adventurer's name
Yes
I like it
Raaazooor
Razor
Come on!
