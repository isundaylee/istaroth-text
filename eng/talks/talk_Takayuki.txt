Traveler: Takayuki...?
Ikeda Soushirou: Takayuki, of the Kujou Clan.
Ikeda Soushirou: I am a Kujou Clan retainer. Of course I remember every member of his family. Takayuki is a gifted boy with big aspirations. He'll be somebody one day, that's for sure.
Ikeda Soushirou: I don't know if his grades are still as good as before though, haha!
