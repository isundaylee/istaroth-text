# Custom Gift Envelope No. 5


## Talk 1

Noelle: Honorary Knight! I didn't expect to run into you here!
Traveler: Are you making gift envelopes?
Noelle: Yes! I finally got the chance to come here on vacation, and I wanted to bring a few gifts back for the Knights of Favonius.
Noelle: I heard that, during Lantern Rite, locals like to include one of these envelopes with their gifts.
Noelle: So, I wanted to follow their lead and make a few gift envelopes of my own. But, they're not looking too good...
Noelle: I want my gift envelopes to be beautiful! Can you show me how, Honorary Knight?
Traveler: Of course, leave it to me.

Noelle: Be sure to stop by the next Windblume Festival, okay?
Noelle: When that day comes, I'll make you a gift envelope just as beautiful as this one.
