# Open Your Heart to Me


## Talk 1

Paimon: #What could this groove be for...? C'mon, Traveler, let's follow {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} over there and have a look. Maybe there's something good waiting for us there!

## Talk 2

Ixlel (???): The sovereign ruler of the Land of Se{RUBY#[D]Chichen Uctokah}ven Flames extends salutations unto you, chosen one. May your path be one paved with flowers that shall never wither.
Paimon: That voice... Sounds like it came from this... big statue.
Traveler: Who are you?
Ixlel (Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L): Dragonlord Ix Uxul Tz'ib{RUBY#[D]Type-L Self-Regulating Overseer Array Integrated Processing Unit} Bolon Ch'ule-L is my name, aforetime the ruler of Chichen Uctokah.
Paimon: Ixu... What's your name now? Sure that's something you call yourself, and not some kind of mumbo-jumbo spell?
Paimon: Whatever, Paimon's gonna call you "Ixlel." That'll do. Not like she'll remember the rest anyway!
Ixlel: According to the sacred dest{RUBY#[D]K'uhul}ined path hath ye and those with ye... No, wait! What did you name me, you white, round, elemental floating object!?
Paimon: #And who are you calling a "white, round, elemental floating object"!? Paimon's the name, this is Traveler, and...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rraaar!
Traveler: #And this is {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Paimon: Also, you're the one who called yourself "Ix-whachamacallitagain-lel," or whatever, didn't you?
Ixlel: S—Such impertinence! This sacred name comes from the most glorious of rulers. How dare this white, round, elemental floating object speak thus, and vastly overstep its station!
Ixlel: #Noble Traveler! Forgive my blunt speech, but surely you grant your servant gross latitude, that it should address a sovereign ruler thusly!
Traveler: Paimon is not my servant.
Paimon: Hmph, that's right! We're the best of friends!
Ixlel: You... friends with an elemental floating object? A... unique choice, I must confess.
Ixlel: #In any case, do accept my apologies, noble Traveler. You have sojourned far to reach this place, and yet this all-too-humiliating form is all I can display before you.
Ixlel: Did this despicable statue not entrap me, I would surely have presented myself to you in a more elegant fashion, whether it be in a Dragonlord's form, or a mortal's guise...
Paimon: Wait, so you're stuck in there?
Ixlel: Hmph. And you have reason to think otherwise? Think me a mere talking statue, do you?
Paimon: But... this is the sorta place where "a mere talking statue" wouldn't be too out of place, don'cha think?
Ixlel: Gah. You insolent creature! I am the sovereign ruler of Chichen Uctokah, a great and glorious Dragonlord... You dare... You dare...!
Ixlel: If not for that most despised of betrayals, I would never have been trapped in this crude carving!
Ixlel: #B—But anyway! Noble Traveler, let me cut this long story short — I am in need of your aid.
Traveler: In what matter?
Ixlel: My heart was once ripped apart through betrayal, before being hidden in various devices. I would ask you to seek those shards for me. Once that is done...
Ixlel: Cut my chest open as you would peel Grainfruit leaves, and dig my heart out.
Paimon: Sure... Uh, wait a minute. You just said something super scary so casually...
Ixlel: Scary? You mean the Grainfruit? How chicken-hearted you are, elemental floating object...
Paimon: What? What are you talking about? Who'd be afraid of Grainfruit anyway? Paimon's talking about that last part, with the whole "dig out your heart" thing!
Ixlel: #Hmm? Is that not a more pedestrian thing than Grainfruit? Ah, Noble Traveler, do you not have your servants attend you as you partake in sacrifices?
Traveler: Why do you want your heart to be dug out?
Ixlel: For you are the noble one, the Chosen of Dragons. Apart from our lost colleagues in ruler{RUBY#[D]Ajaw}ship, you alone have the right to give unto me release befitting of my rank.
Ixlel: #If you are familiar with the ancient ways, O Noble Traveler, surely you must know that my hea{RUBY#[D]Clustered Storage Array}rt, created as it was in great antiquity, holds all the memories that were once mine.
Ixlel: The traitor — may his name be cast into the everlasting flames to burn for thirteen thousand years! — stole my authority, using memories to entrap me here.
Paimon: What? Can memories be used to restrain peopl— Err, Dragons?
Ixlel: Hmph. So ignorant are you that it is quite adorable, elemental floating object. Had my authority not been lost, I might yet have taken you in as a pet.
Ixlel: For mayfly-races, memories are naturally as sweet and lovely as Quenepa Berries, but for long-lived species, memories are naught but curses and shackles.
Paimon: That's... not easy to understand...
Ixlel: Whatever the case may be, it was this means by which that wretched renegade forced me to sing for his empire, and for his delusions — for he did not know how to operate this city.
Ixlel: His pitiful empire and his laughable delusions were both reduced to ash. Yet, here I remain still, imprisoned in this miserable effigy.
Paimon: Um, even if you say so, it still feels strange to find your heart, only to dig it out again...
Ixlel: Heh... Still you do not comprehend, you white, round, elemental floating object?
Ixlel: My life's thread is all but spun out. And even were that not so, my consciousness shall also be utterly depleted in thirty winters.
Ixlel: #My dignity permits me not to die enslaved or confined! Therefore, noble Traveler, I beg of you, grant me release.
Ixlel: I cannot destroy myself, but should you retrieve those fragments, I can pour what remains of my li{RUBY#[D]Energy}fe into them, restoring my broken heart to its original state.
Ixlel: This is a step of *self-protection*, and only by this may I not violate the dest{RUBY#[D]K'uhul}ined, sacred law.
Ixlel: After that, dig my heart out. It is this heart that binds me, that enslaves me, that has tormented me endlessly all these millennia.
Ixlel: It is the true heart of a Dragonlord, before which all of humanity's gems must shy away in shame. And it shall be your reward — what say you?
Traveler: I understand.
Ixlel: You have my thanks. Then, let me sing here, and wait for good tidings from you. Little else can I do now, I fear.
Ixlel: Please... find my heart, and grant me noble relief.
Traveler: Is there no other way?
Ixlel: Hehe... It seems you have yet to meet my colleagues of old.
Ixlel: Otherwise, they would have told you that destruction is our dest{RUBY#[D]K'uhul}ined path. There is no need for another, nor is it possible to find one.
Ixlel: Regardless, I will sing here and await your decision.
Traveler: For what reward?
Ixlel: Haha. Fret not. Once I am done speaking, you shall know your reward's value.
Traveler: Well said. Now then, Mini Pie, I must have words with thee...
Paimon: Hey, hey! Who's "Mini Pie," huh? Don't get ahead of yourself over some flattery, you hear?
Traveler: "Chosen one"? You mean me?
Ixlel (???): Indeed. Chosen of Dragons you are, and noble elect of mine also.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, Ixlel! We've found the bits and bobs you need!
Ixlel: Wh—Who do you name "Ixlel," you insolent whelp? I've told you, my name is...
Ixlel: #Alright, never mind! I tire of waiting to die! Come, noble Traveler, put ye these into my chest...
Ixlel: And then dig out my heart, and allow me to perish by your noble hands!
Ixlel: Rejoice thou also, O white, round, elemental floating object! For I shall bestow upon you too the honor of witnessing the passing of Chichen Uctokah's ruler!
Paimon: Whoa, don't get so excited about this stuff, would ya? Anyway, we just need to put these components in first, right?
Ixlel: Indeed, indeed! Come now, I shall open my heart to you. Take it out, and this task shall be done!
Paimon: Ugh, do you really have to put it that way?
Traveler: (Insert the components.)
Paimon: Uh, and then...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hehe, guess we just need to insert the key into the statue, just like before, right?
Paimon: Anyway, don't you think it's super quiet here? No strange mechanical monsters around the statue and stuff... This place is so different from other parts of Ochkanatlan...
Paimon: Whoa! Abyssal monsters! Why'd they just pop out all of a sudden!?

## Talk 5

Paimon: Um, Ixlel? You there?
Ixlel (Statue): (The will imprisoned within the statue has dissipated. Silence alone answers you.)
