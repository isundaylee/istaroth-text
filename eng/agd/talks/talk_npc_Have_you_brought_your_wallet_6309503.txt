Traveler: Have you... brought your wallet?
Robert: Huh, my wallet?
Robert: I do have my wallet with me. But I'm not in the habit of putting documents in my wallet. And I've already brought all the things that they need...
Robert: *sigh* I've been staying in Ritou for too long. I don't really have any more cash left. If I can't sell my goods in the city, I'll be in trouble...
Robert: There isn't much I can do with this small amount of money. I might as well go for a drink at Miss Ryouko's stall.
Robert: Miss Ryouko will be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
