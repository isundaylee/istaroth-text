# Missing title (2402418631)


## Talk 1

Traveler: (Let's try tossing some Raw Meat in...)

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh. Look, there's movement there in the water. Is the adeptus coming out?
Traveler: Seems like it's just a big fish...
Paimon: Shh... Look!
Traveler: Can the adeptus dive and swim?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Huh, this stone tablet seems to say that...
Paimon: As long as one throws Raw Meat into the river, we can summon old friends we haven't met in a while?
Traveler: Wait, you can read those inscriptions?
Paimon: Hey, don't you underestimate Paimon... You can just decipher it using the stuff you can already read!
Paimon: Like so â€” Paimon can only read the last two lines, so there's no way she's wrong about what it means!
Paimon: Anyway, let's just toss the Raw Meat in. Maybe an adeptus really will show up!
Traveler: Uh, it's probably more about throwing the food to memorialize a friend...
Paimon: Really? ...Well, Paimon thinks her interpretation is correct, too!
