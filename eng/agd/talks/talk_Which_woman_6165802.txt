Traveler: Which woman?
Davy: You'll probably run into her if you go to Springvale... She's my ex-wife, Myweiss. A bard, just like me.
Davy: I'm convinced the only reason I ever looked her way is because I bashed my head when Stormterror attacked!
Davy: Can you believe they used to call us Mr. and Mrs. Lovebard? It's so nauseating now that I think back on it.
Davy: But the worst thing of all is her original compositions...
Traveler: Tell me about her work.
Davy: Well. After the divorce, she started using her compositions as a way of stirring up controversy... Pfft. I, for one, do not consider anything she writes to be true poetry.
Davy: She will do whatever it takes to smear my name... and that's when she was the irresponsible one who never contributed to the home!
Davy: For example, we had a clear agreement that we would take it in turns to do the cooking and the housework. But every time I got back from a performance, she was never there. So I ended up cooking all the meals and doing all the housework myself!
Davy: At least I understand now â€” love is a big old hoax!
