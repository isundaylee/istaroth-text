# Speech and Etiquette


## Talk 1

Eula: That won't do! You've exposed your shortcomings.
Eula: No need to worry. Head back to the starting point and try again.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Uh... Paimon's confused... This girl's all "vengeance this" and "revenge that," but she doesn't seem the least bit angry...
Paimon: Still, Paimon has met bigger weirdos before...

## Talk 3

Eula: That won't do! You've exposed your shortcomings.
Eula: No need to worry. Head back to the starting point and try again.

## Talk 4

Eula: This is the Ley Line Monolith. Go ahead, activate it.
Eula: But be careful not to get launched into the air or frozen while fighting. That would be most unsightly.

## Talk 5

Eula: You failed this time, what a shame.
Eula: But not to worry, it's just training after all. Let's try again.

## Talk 6

Eula: Not bad. A lot better than I had anticipated, at least.
Paimon: *panting* Paimon almost didn't make it through! Whew, good thing we didn't get stuck.
Paimon: Um... so... are we "aristocrats" now?
Eula: Don't flatter yourselves. We've only just begun.
Eula: This scenario was relatively simple. In the face of a real battle, one would seldom have a chance to stop and evaluate the situation.
Eula: There's a Ley Line Monolith just up ahead that will attract nearby monsters.
Eula: True elegance is the ability to calmly yet swiftly make decisions in the heat of battle.
Traveler: Is this how you normally train?
Eula: My family set only the highest expectations for me, even as a child.
Eula: Let's proceed, shall we?
Traveler: No wonder you are so skilled...

## Talk 7

Eula: Well done. Your performance was most impressive.
Eula: And you managed to remain calm even in these grueling Dragonspine surroundings, haha. I'm starting to wonder if even I could have done the same.
Eula: Given such an outstanding performance, it seems there is little left for me to teach you.
Paimon: Like Paimon said, adventuring is our specialty!
Paimon: Hehe... So that's it for our training, right? Then let's get out of Dragonspine before Paimon turns into a popsicle! *shivers*
Eula: #Hold on. I was commending Traveler's performance just now. You, on the other hand, seem to have made no progress at all!
Paimon: What? You mean, Paimon was also part of the training!?
Eula: Yes, of course. You were frantically flying and dashing about throughout the entire thing. Not an elegant sight at all.
Eula: Did you even listen to anything I was trying to teach you?
Traveler: Maybe the weather is just too cold here.
Paimon: Yeah, that's it, it's too cold here. Bâ€”Besides, Paimon was paying attention to the Traveler.
Eula: Whatever the reason, not heeding my instructions... a cause for vengeance, perhaps...
Eula: *sigh* Now, drink this.
Paimon: Huh? What is it? *gasp* Are you trying to poison Paimon!?
Eula: Certainly not. It's warm milk.
Eula: Didn't you just say that you were freezing? Drink it and it'll help warm you up.
Paimon: Oh... uh... thank you! Um, are you... still planning on the whole vengeance thing?
Eula: If I wasn't, then why would I care about you being cold? If you turned into a Paimon popsicle, that would ruin my plans for vengeance now, wouldn't it...
Eula: So, "dear friend"... don't die on me out here.
Paimon: Ahh! Paimon knew something was off!
Traveler: Thank you for looking after Paimon.
Eula: All in the name of vengeance, no need to thank me.
Eula: Now then, given that your training is complete, it's time we return to Mondstadt. Our last step will be preparing a cordial gift to present to my uncle when you meet him.
Eula: I already have something in mind. Let's pay Sara a visit at Good Hunter.
Traveler: You're... strange.
Eula: Hehe, vengeance should know no bounds, you know...
Traveler: Maybe that's just Paimon's style?
Paimon: Hey, that's not true! Paimon was just focusing on you the whole time!

## Talk 8

Sara: Here, the Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut is ready to go! Be sure to eat it while it's hot, otherwise the flavor will be spoiled.
Sara: And by the way, don't worry too much when Eula says strange things. She's actually a very good person.
Paimon: Paimon's been meaning to ask... No one could stand the sight of Eula when she was trying to speak with the others in Mondstadt earlier.
Paimon: But she seemed to get along fine with you and Amber just now... what's up with that?
Sara: The people of Mondstadt don't take kindly to anyone bearing the Lawrence name.
Sara: They are unable to see past her family, therefore they don't actually see Eula for herself.
Sara: So no matter what Eula tries to do, it's seen as a wrongdoing. It essentially strips the meaning of anything she tries to accomplish.
Traveler: I think I understand now.
Paimon: How come you're able to see Eula differently then?
Sara: Well, when she joined the Knights of Favonius, it caused quite an uproar.
Sara: Many people signed a petition, demanding that the Knights reverse their decision.
Sara: At the same time, numerous members of the Lawrence Clan crowded the entrance of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters, clamoring for Eula to give an explanation.
Paimon: Whoa... so both sides were unhappy.
Sara: That's right. So, you can imagine how determined Eula must have been under such circumstances.
Sara: But thanks to Grand Master Varka and the unwavering attitudes of others in the Knights of Favonius, they were able to quell the unrest. Tensions still remain beneath the surface, I'm afraid.
Sara: In the eyes of the people, she's a stain on the Knights of Favonius... and in the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, she's a disgrace to her family.
Sara: But she simply fulfills her duty as a Knight, silently helping one person after another, myself included.
Sara: People like Eula should be approached with care and understanding. She could stand to be treated a little more fairly.
Traveler: It's good that you're able to understand her.
Sara: I believe a day will come when things will get better.
Paimon: Once everything's settled, we should go talk to Eula again. Paimon thinks we know how to communicate with her now.
Sara: I'm glad. I think that would make her very happy, though she might not ever admit it.
Sara: Take care. Please come again!
Traveler: If only there were more people like you.
Traveler: So that's what she meant when she said it was hard for "a bad person to try to be good."

## Talk 9

Randall: So it seems you've finally given up on the idea of finding more people to talk to.
Randall: Believe me, that's in everyone's best interest.

## Talk 10

Leno: Listen, I have no idea what she's trying to do... But trust me, you two should just keep away from her.

## Talk 11

Eula: It'll be difficult at first, but the key is to remain patient. Let's try again.
Eula: Remember, you must be elegant... Don't get knocked or launched into the air.

## Talk 12

Eula: Good luck! Just remember, don't get knocked or launched into the air. That would be most inelegant.

## Talk 13

Amber: Oh, hey Eula! I see you've met the Honorary Knight!
Paimon: We meet again, Amber! Seems we're just bound to run into you these days.
Amber: Well, I just got back and was thinking about grabbing a bite at Good Hunter. But now that you're here, why don't we all eat together?
Eula: Very well. It's been some time since we've last shared a meal together.
Eula: Come, take a seat. We can discuss my uncle's gift while we eat.
Sara: Yes, is there something else you'd like to order?
Eula: Could you please prepare a serving of my uncle's favorite, Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut? We'll take it as a gift to him later.
Sara: Coming right up! It'll take some time to prepare, I'll have it here at the counter once it's ready.
Eula: Hold on a moment. Is this Satisfying Salad also something that Amber ordered?
Sara: No, she didn't order it. But because she didn't order any vegetables, I thought I'd throw in a salad on the house. You know, to contrast all the meat dishes.
Eula: So... we clearly didn't order this, yet you prepared it without authorization... Hmph! Mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
Paimon: Uh... you're going to take revenge on her for giving us a free salad!?
Sara: Hmph, you should know me by now, that's the kind of villainous character I am!
Sara: Well then... please wait a moment while I get the dish for your uncle started.
Eula: Hmph, delicious unauthorized delicacies... Sara will pay for this.
Paimon: Why would you choose Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut as a gift for your uncle? Paimon's never even heard of that dish before...
Eula: This dish isn't actually on Good Hunter's menu. Only longstanding patrons such as my uncle would know about the dish. The old aristocrats seem to take a liking to it.
Amber: Because of the sour flavor of the sauerkraut, not too many people are fond of it these days. I guess it's become less popular over time.
Amber: Eula treated me to the dish once, and I couldn't even finish a bite. I've nicknamed it "Gebratenes Fleisch mit Vengeance" ever since. Yuck!
Eula: I never expected us to have such completely different tastes in food... If I weren't in such a good mood, I'd say that constitutes grounds for transgression...
Traveler: Huh, so even Amber doesn't escape your vengeance?
Eula: Of course not! It's hard to find someone in Mondstadt that attracts contempt as much as she does.
Amber: Haha, it's fine when you're just joking between us, but I'm afraid our Honorary Knight might misunderstand you.
Amber: Eula's always talking about vengeance, but that's just how she is. It's nothing you should take too seriously.
Eula: But I am serious! And I'll remember every transgression committed against me! Ugh, it's no wonder so many people dislike you!
Paimon: Paimon's starting to realize that Eula is actually a very good person.
Paimon: There's no need to be so awkward when you want to say something nice.
Eula: *sigh* Listen, you've never been labeled as a social pariah, have you?
Paimon: What... well... no...?
Eula: So that's why you wouldn't understand how hard it is for a bad person to try to be good. It's impossible for me, and I have no intention of acting like a good person.
Eula: Alright, no need to look so sullen... I'm just kidding. Come on, let's eat. The food is getting cold.
Amber: Ooh, I'm stuffed. I'll see Sara about the bill.
Eula: No need, I've left the Mora under the plate. If you try to settle it with her in person, she won't accept payment for the salad.
Eula: Don't underestimate my ability to exact revenge. Hah! Sara won't get the upper hand this time!
Eula: Alright, next you should pay my uncle a visit. He has a small camp at the top of the mountain near Springvale. He usually whiles his time away there when there's nothing else to do.
Paimon: Uh... Aren't you coming with us, Eula?
Eula: I'm afraid that wouldn't be very convenient for me. It'd be better if you two went alone.
Eula: Ah yes, please do remember to pick up the dish from Sara.
Amber: I still have more recon to do in the wilderness. Well, until next time!
Eula: Let's meet again. What an interesting bunch you are.
