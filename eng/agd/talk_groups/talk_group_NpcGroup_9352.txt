Dori: Let me guess what you need most right now... A medicinal drink that can restore your full strength in one sip? Or maybe a cream that can instantly heal your wounds?
Dori: How'd I do? All this and more available right here, right now. Buy in bulk for big discounts.
Dori: Don't let the price put you off. You're paying for all the hard work I and my private associates put in to bring these goods all the way from Sumeru.

Dori: What's that, you say? I could have sworn I just heard you invite me to go monster-fighting in this domain with you... Strange, I slept perfectly well last night. Why am I having auditory hallucinations?
Dori: Dori Sangemah Bay is just a straightforward businesswoman. So let me put it to you this way: Why would any businessperson take such a huge gamble on their own life unless there was, oh I dunno... a few dozen million Mora to be made?
Dori: Here's my counter-offer: A custom-made Domain-Delver's Survival Kit, just for you! Great value for your Mora, and available at a discounted price for a limited time only!

Dori: If there really was such a thing as a miracle potion that could cure all disease, I'm sure it would be auctioned off and sold for an astronomical price.
Dori: But in this fairytale, the fairy gives her magic potion to the prince for free. She has no business sense at all.
Dori: *sigh* If you want my opinion... Praying to a fairy isn't the answer. Better to go out and make some Mora.
