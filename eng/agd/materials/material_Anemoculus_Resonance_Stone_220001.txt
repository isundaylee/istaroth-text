# Anemoculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Mondstadt to search for nearby Anemoculi.
This man-made stone plate possesses a certain characteristic similar to that of the Anemo Statues of The Seven, giving it the power to resonate with Anemoculi.
Oculus Resonance Stones are crude imitations of the Statues of The Seven constructed by the ancients. But it is precisely this crudeness that makes them crave the power of elemental oculi, thus providing devout worshippers and adventurers alike a prime opportunity to collect oculi.
