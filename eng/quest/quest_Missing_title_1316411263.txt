# Missing title (1316411263)

Traveler: Sergeant?
Fengyan: It's just a title. All it means is that I had more of a knack than my comrades for unarmed combat, so I was tasked with teaching martial arts to the new recruits.
Fengyan: Your eyes... they remind me of a soldier I once trained. He was on track to take over from me...
Fengyan: ...Unfortunately, he died in a tragic accident. I had planned to personally present him with this flower on the day of his promotion to Sergeant, but I never had the chance...
Fengyan: Sorry, that was more than you needed to hear. Please, take the flower, I feel it'll make up for it all somehow.
