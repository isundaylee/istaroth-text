## Talk

Granny Chu: Oh... Is that a traveler I hear?
Granny Chu: Sorry, I was so busy listening to him talk that I didn't hear you come in.

## Talk

Traveler: I didn't hear anyone talking...
Granny Chu: Heh... Neither could I, in the beginning.
Granny Chu: But somehow, now that decades have gone by, and even though my hearing has steadily gotten worse over the years... finally, I have started to be able to hear him...
Granny Chu: It's so wonderful that the legend is true. It means I have not been waiting here in vain all these years.
Traveler: Who is he?
Granny Chu: My husband. A muscular man with bronze-colored skin...
Granny Chu: He was like a child when he proposed to me, though. He took it all so seriously, insisting that he wanted to grow old together with me. Heh.
Granny Chu: We grew up in the same village. It was a fishing village, and we made our living off the sea.
Granny Chu: We'd been married for four years when one day, we hit a terrible sea storm. He tied me to the battered boat to make sure I would stay afloat...
Granny Chu: I drifted all night and ended up here, where I crawled to safety. But my chance to honor our promise to grow old together was gone...
Traveler: What legend?
Granny Chu: If you close your eyes and listen carefully to a conch shell, you will hear the sound of the sea... You know about that, right?
Granny Chu: Well. I thought to myself, my husband never returned from the sea in the end... I wondered if he said any parting words for me...
Granny Chu: So I moved into this conch lodge, and have been waiting ever since...
Granny Chu: Waiting for the day I hear his voice between the crashing of the waves...

## Talk

Traveler: I have to go now.
Granny Chu: Always remember, the sea can be dangerous. Take care!
