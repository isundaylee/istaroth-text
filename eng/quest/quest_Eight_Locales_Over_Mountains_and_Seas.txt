# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey there, Ioroi!
Ioroi: Eeek! You saw through me? How did... Wait, no, this scent...
Ioroi: Ah, so it's you. It has been so long, I could not recognize your scent!
Paimon: And you haven't changed at all, Ioroi — still scared of humans and stuck in a stone!
Ioroi: Mmm!? What do you mean by that?
Traveler: Hope your seal can be lifted soon.
Ioroi: Bah, it is but a human seal! If I were but to try harder...
Traveler: *cough*
Ioroi: ...
Ioroi: #Well. Regardless, I see you have taken good care of the little ones. My little tanuki often say that they enjoy playing with their nice-smelling yellow-furred {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle}.
Traveler: #Yellow-furred {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle}...
Ioroi: And here I had thought that humans were all the same as that fellow who had us sealed — wicked and scary. But it seems that there are still some good eggs amongst you.
Traveler: Most people are alright.
Paimon: That's right. Most of the people we've met are good people! You got sealed because you stole that comb...
Ioroi: Hmph! And I've returned it! So if you ever meet that fellow who learned magic from Reizenbou, tell him to get me out of this stone!
Ioroi: Mmph! When you get down to it, everything is that sneaky kitsune's fault...
Paimon: (Ioroi really complains like some old geezer, huh?)
Traveler: (Well, he is quite old.)
Ioroi: Well then, neither your hands nor legs are made of stone, so you've been to many places, surely?
Paimon: Yup! We came right over the ocean, you know?
Black Screen Text: You tell Ioroi about your adventures in Mondstadt and Liyue.
Ioroi: ...So, there are so many lands abroad. Very impressive.
Ioroi: I have been subsisting off reports from the little tanuki all this while, and so do not know what the outside world is like.
Ioroi: Once upon a time, I stood at the summit of Mt. Yougou and saw a very, very high mountain on the other side of the ocean. It was possibly even taller than Mt. Yougou. I still wonder, even today, what that place was.
Traveler: Across the ocean, you say...
Paimon: That's gotta be Dragonspine, right?
Ioroi: Mmmm, Dragonspine? Just thinking about that name makes my tummy feel cold. Goodness knows why that fellow wants to go there...
Ioroi: ...
Ioroi: As I said earlier, you are fine folk, yes? So...
Paimon: Paimon can smell this request coming a mile away!
Ioroi: Mmm! Even like this, I am still the Hidden Protector of the Grove, defender of Chinju Forest, and thusly appointed by Her Excellency herself! If I was not sealed in stone, I would certainly use an eight-tatami large...
Traveler: Alright then. What do you need help with?
Ioroi: Though I cannot move on my own power, the little children can do so. As such, I would like to ask you to take the little tanuki out to train.
Ioroi: Take Kichiboushi with you. He has been quite eager to see you since the last time you played together — quite eager indeed!
Traveler: Well, we can do that...
Paimon: That's true. We can't understand what Kichiboushi says, so wouldn't traveling together be kinda tough?
Ioroi: Impossible. We tanuki understand human speech by nature. It is you humans who do not speak ours.
Paimon: What? Is that how it is?
Traveler: But as travel companions...
Traveler: We'd like to chat as we travel, you know?
Paimon: #Just like Paimon does with Traveler!
Ioroi: Mmph. Very well then. Now that I consider it, didn't someone once use our magic to make you some food?
Ioroi: Now, I may look like this, but making you a "meal" that can allow you to understand Kichiboushi's speech is hardly impossible nonetheless.
Paimon: Woo-hoo! Food!
Traveler: Is it gonna taste good, though...
Ioroi: Now, now, don't you underestimate my culinary prowess!
Black Screen Text: Although you can't be sure where Ioroi got it from...
You and Paimon have a feast that "looks very delicious" off Ioroi's stone tummy.
Paimon: Ooh, this is great!
Ioroi: Of course. I am Ioroi, you know — the very same who once made Sashimi Platters out of mud balls and tanuki fur to utterly deceive the Four Oni of Ogata!
Paimon: That's awesome, Ioroi! But so, what did you make the meal we just had out of?
Traveler: Some questions are best left unasked, Paimon.
Paimon: Huh?
Paimon: Well, forget it. Let's go find Kichiboushi and have a chat!
Traveler: One question, if you would...
Traveler: Well...
Paimon: #Ooh, Paimon knows what you mean, Traveler! Will there be treasure?
Ioroi: Treasure? Why, of course! I am the chief of five hundred and five bake-danuki, after all! Not a single one of Inazuma's treasures has ever escaped my sight.
Traveler: In that case, what do you need help with?
Paimon: That's right, we're super good at helping!
Traveler: From the direction you're referring to, that's probably Dragonspine.
Traveler: Why, thank you.
Traveler: Nice-smelling...
Traveler: #Also, it's not {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle}. It's {F#Big Sis}{M#Big Bro}.
Traveler: Paimon means that we hope that your seal will soon be lifted.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey there, Kichiboushi! Long time no see!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! White Fur, Yellow Fur.
Traveler: I guess "Yellow Fur" must be me?
Paimon: Who're you calling White Fur?
"Kichiboushi": Mm, very strong. Can understand.
Traveler: #I'm Traveler, and this is Paimon.
Paimon: And you'd better remember that!
"Kichiboushi": Squelch squelch Lavender Melon.
Paimon: What? Lavender Melon? And what's "squelch squelch" supposed to mean?
Paimon: Well, at least we can kinda-sorta communicate...
Traveler: "Kinda-sorta" is kinda-sorta right.
Paimon: #Whatever the case, Traveler, let's go back and see Ioroi again. We are taking Kichiboushi out on a long journey, after all.
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi! Yey!
Paimon: Yey!

## Talk 3

Ioroi: Mm! How goes it?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! See White Fur, Yellow Fur, very happy. Lavender Melon Kapow!
Traveler: Lavender Melon Kapow...
Ioroi: Hmm, quite the bright spark, aren't you?
"Kichiboushi": Kapow!
Traveler: So, what does Lavender Melon Kapow mean again...?
"Kichiboushi": Kapow is Kapow. Lavender Melon is Lavender Melon.
Ioroi: Well, it seems that communications have been established without any problems. Ah, mine "culinary" skills are as fine as ever!
Traveler: ...I suppose so?
Paimon: Nope, not at all! We can't understand a thing Kichiboushi's saying!
Paimon: Well, Ioroi, here's the thing...
Black Screen Text: You tell Ioroi how the attempted interactions are going...
Ioroi: Mmm, so that's how it is. Not to worry. It is because you are not yet used to Kichiboushi's aura.
Ioroi: Take it slow! The more used to his aura you are, the better you shall understand him!
Paimon: How slow are we talking about here?
Ioroi: Ah, hmm. Let me think about that...
Ioroi: Eh! Whatever the case, do not be in a rush!
"Kichiboushi": Rush no good.
Traveler: You don't know either, do you?
Ioroi: Hmph! I will have you know that I am Ioroi, the long-lived king of bake-danuki! I simply do not put such premiums on time as you humans do.
Paimon: (Even though he's spent most of his time sealed in that stone statue...)
Traveler: Then why can you speak to humans just fine, Ioroi?
Ioroi: Mmph! Such impertinence! Rather, you should ask why you humans may speak to us.
Ioroi: Having lived as long and become as powerful as I have, I have had at least some interactions with humanity.
Ioroi: A long, long time ago, I often spoke with tengu, kitsune, oni, youkai, and humans alike. And while human stories often concern themselves, at least half of them involve bake-danuki who transformed into humans.
Ioroi: Half of the remaining half are indeed about humans themselves, and the other half are about all the other youkai.
Ioroi: But even in this half, a good half concern we tanuki, who clad ourselves in the guise of the other youkai. Then half again of the tanuki tales are those concerning me.
Ioroi: Mmph, as such, you may see that I am the greatest of them all. Naturally, speaking to you young ones is no tall order at all.
Traveler: I get it. Five over sixteen to Ioroi, yes?
Ioroi: Mm? What's "Five Over Sixteen"? Is it something that one may eat?
"Kichiboushi": Sounds delicious. Want to eat.
Paimon: #Traveler's referring to the percentage of stories that you're involved in, Ioroi.
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi. Powerful!
Ioroi: Hah, why of course! You have much to learn from my powers, you do.
Paimon: Eh? Come to think of it, we're starting to get what Kichiboushi is saying, aren't we?
"Kichiboushi": White Fur smart.
Paimon: That might have been praise, but Paimon sure doesn't feel good about it.
Ioroi: Good, good. Then I leave this child in your hands. Take him to go see the world and train!
Ioroi: Why, when I was but a young tanuki, I too went on a pilgrimage to eighteen sites in Inazuma along the trail of the great bake-danuki Tsukumo, never once straying from the tanuki paths — only thus did I reach my present stature.
Paimon: Eh? Is that why you were sealed in stone?
"Kichiboushi": Mm-haha! Stone!
Ioroi: Eh!? You too, Kichiboushi...?
Paimon: Ahem! So, uh, back on topic! Where should we go first?
Traveler: There's that place Ioroi mentioned earlier...
Paimon: Uh-huh! Dragonspine it is, then!
Paimon: "If there's a mountain, we shall climb it" — ah, Paimon's been waiting for a chance to say something cool like that!
"Kichiboushi": Mountain, there!
Ioroi: Oooh, that sounds cold... Don't let your tummy get cold now, Kichiboushi. You'll catch a cold otherwise, and if you do, you won't be able to perform using your belly drum.
Ioroi: #Also, remember to eat properly and follow {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle} Yellow Fur like a good boy.
"Kichiboushi": #Understand! Following {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle} Yellow Fur!
Traveler: We'll take good care of Kichiboushi, don't worry.
Paimon: Pleased to meet you, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! No worry! Kichiboushi take care of you!
Paimon: Hmm, looks like we're not completely getting through to him...
Traveler: Don't you worry.
Traveler: #It's not {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle}. It's {F#Big Sis}{M#Big Bro}.
Traveler: How does Dragonspine sound?
Traveler: ..."Without any problems," he says...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Ioroi: Through the power of the bake-danuki meal made by mine own hands, you, too, may speak to the little tanuki. Go, try having a chat with Kichiboushi.
Traveler: We'll do that.
Ioroi: Go, then, go. I have all the time in the world to go nowhere, but it is not so with my little tanuki.
