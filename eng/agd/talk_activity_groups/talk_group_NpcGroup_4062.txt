## Talk

Najia: Hello. It isn't showtime right now, and it's messy around here. Please mind your head and feet.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Najia: I'm a prop engineer for Zubayr Theater. Other than designing and making props, I also maintain the venue.

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks for the notice!
Najia: You're welcome.

## Talk

Traveler: How's work?
Najia: Mr. Zubayr is very strict about every aspect of a performance, so I always worry that I'm not good enough...
Najia: Are the props attractive enough? Is every detail the best it can be? Do the mechanisms operate smoothly? I think hard about these things daily.
Najia: Sometimes, it's enough for me to get the urge to join Kshahrewar. Some Kshahrewar regulars are on good terms with me as well...
Najia: But then I'd give that up. It's not as if I was building a real palace or anything.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Najia: *sigh* I was halfway through working on my props when I realized that the stage needs maintenance again, and that we need to finish those safety checks before the next performance lest we put our actors at risk.

## Talk

Traveler: Rest assured.
Najia: If only I could be as open-minded as you are.
Najia: Maybe it all comes down to the fact that I'm so attached to this theater, and that I have certain demands on myself.
Najia: Anyway, thank you for comforting me. Here are some leftover rocks from what we made props with. They are quality rocks. Please take them.
