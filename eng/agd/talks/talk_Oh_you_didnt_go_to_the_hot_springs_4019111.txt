Thoma: Oh, you didn't go to the hot springs?
Traveler: You didn't either?
Thoma: Ah, well... A whole crowd of people have left already. I'll go a bit later with Shousei and a few others.
Thoma: Besides, we're a bit behind with our game. We need to catch up.
Traveler: But, your team is the biggest...
Thoma: Haha, I guess it's my fault for going overboard with the ideas. Kozou and the others can barely keep up.
Thoma: Sometimes delegating work is harder than doing it yourself... I wonder if this is how he feels, being the head of the clan.
Traveler: Well, don't work too hard...
Thoma: Of course! Right back at you!
