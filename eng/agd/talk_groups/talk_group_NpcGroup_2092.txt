Granny Shan: Smiling makes the world a more beautiful place! See any toys you like?

## Talk

Traveler: About the toys...
Granny Shan: Oh, children love them. Intricate things, they are.
Granny Shan: I've got toys for adults too, if you'd like.
Traveler: Adult toys...?
Granny Shan: Sorry, I should have been more specific. Some toys need adult supervision â€” kites for example.
Granny Shan: Come war and famine or the peace and prosperity we know today, happiness is always something worth striving for, don't you think?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Granny Shan: Goodbye! Take care now.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about Rex Lapis...
Granny Shan: Rex Lapis? I understand. Does your little one back home also want a Rex Lapis-themed toy?
Granny Shan: Have a look: dragon horn tops, stone dice, a dragon-shaped wooden sword, a kite with Rex Lapis' portrait on it... which would you like?
Granny Shan: Ah... So you're just asking around. I see. Rex Lapis-themed toys are so very popular among the children, so I naturally thought that...

Traveler: What do you have to sell here?
Granny Shan: What you see is what I've got. Have a look, perhaps there might be something that catches your eye.

## Talk

Granny Shan: Go on, buy a little something for the kids.
Granny Shan: I'm not here to make big profits. Just an old granny out enjoying the festive atmosphere.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you selling?
Granny Shan: Take a look.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Granny Shan: May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
