# Time to Drink


## Talk 1

Heinry: #Traveler! Good timing! Our research into Fonta has borne great fruit!
Heinry: I've produced a bottle of what you might consider a "testing sample." You know, one that's in need of a "tester" to give some comments on it.
Heinry: And since you're here, why don't you give it a swig?
Traveler: It's not going to cause me any problems, will it?
Heinry: Oh, of course not! I've already tried it out, mind. I can guarantee that it shall do your health no harm.
Traveler: In that case... here goes nothing.
Heinry: Don't worry, there'll be no issues. And in any case, I greatly appreciate your opinion! Come, let's head over there to conduct the test.
Heinry: A taste of delicious Fonta must, after all, be paired with lovely, open scenery to match!

## Talk 2

Heinry: This bottle is yours. Fret not! This is the fruit of our joint efforts — there is no way it could taste bad.
Heinry: Of course, there are issues that still need ironing out. For example, the processing of the ingredients, the amount of ingredients put in, and the optimal volume to which the bottle should be filled...
Heinry: Even the bottle design itself shall require some thought. It is a new type of Fonta, after all, so we must give it a unique packaging to make an impression.
Heinry: You can leave those problems to me, though — just enjoy the Fonta, alright?
Heinry: I filled this bottle of Fonta with enough to serve two, so it should serve you just fine.
Heinry: Thanks again for your help. Remember our motto! "Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!"

Heinry: Considering the amount of time that's passed, this bottle might no longer be drinkable. Pass it to me, would you? I'll give you a new bottle.
Traveler: Could you leave both bottles with me?
Heinry: Sorry, but the bottle of Fonta I gave you was specially made to have excellent sealing properties.
Heinry: I only managed to make one such bottle at the moment... So if I want to fill it with new Fonta, we'll have to pour its current contents out.
