## Talk

Arachatora: Sister is angry, so Arachatora is keeping a piece of "Head Mushroom," till the Sunsettia ripens ten times.

## Talk

Traveler: Keeping a piece?
Arachatora: #Cooking all the "Head Mushroom" for Nara Traveler, that was the plan. But sister said, no mushroom picking before the Sunsettia ripens another ten times.
Arachatora: Without the scent of mushrooms, Arachatora feels bad. Arachatora might sneak out for mushrooms when the Sunsettia ripens only nine times.
Arachatora: So Arachatora kept a tiny little piece, thinner than the leaves. It will stay with Arachatora.
Arachatora: So embarrassing...

## Talk

Traveler: That's a long wait...
Arachatora: *whimper*
Arachatora: But at that time, maybe "Head Mushroom" in Vana, could grow bigger, and have richer taste.
Arachatora: Perhaps... They'll grow into "Super Triple Head Mushroom."
Arachatora: Thinking about that, makes Arachatora a little happier.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arachatora: *whimper*

## Talk

Arachatora: At Festival Utsava, everyone is happy, Arachatora is even happier. When the Sunsettias ripen once more, I can go to find new mushrooms.

## Talk

Traveler: Once more?
Arachatora: Yes! Arapacati said the "Head Mushroom" brought happiness to Nara.
Arachatora: That's why she's not angry anymore and I don't have to wait until the Sunsettias to ripen many times to pick mushrooms.
Arachatora: I must find mushrooms with better flavors. I hope this time Arapacati won't be angry, or Arapacati will definitely have me wait until the Sunsettias have ripened 100 times, or even 100 times of 100 times.

## Talk

Traveler: New mushrooms?
Arachatora: It's said that, somewhere far, far away, there are mushrooms that have the color of fallen leaves and grow on the feet of pine trees.
Arachatora: There's another kind of mushrooms. They are as blue as the sky. They glitter at moonrise.
Arachatora: That mushroom and the "Head Mushroom," which tastes better?
Arachatora: #For this "special cooking training," I want to find those mushrooms, and use them to cook the supreme delicacy for Nara Traveler.

## Talk

Traveler: Good luck!
Arachatora: #I will find mushrooms with richer flavors! Nara Traveler must come and enjoy the food together by then!
