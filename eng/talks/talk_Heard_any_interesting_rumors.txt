Traveler: Heard any interesting rumors?
Darcy: You mean, apart from "Pretty Face" becoming "Dirty Face"? Ooh, let me think about that for a moment.
Darcy: Haha, just kidding. But honestly, I can't think of any rumors. It's all either big news you must have already heard, or tittle-tattle you wouldn't be interested in.
Darcy: Hey, why don't you tell me some rumors?
