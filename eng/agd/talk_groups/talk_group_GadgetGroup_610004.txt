Guest Message: "Uh, I applied to meet with the Pyro Archon last week and discuss how to promote a new type of sport and fitness movement..."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Last week? She went to take part in a fitness invitational contest at the invitation of the Collective of Plenty. It seems she did not have the time to respond to your message. Please, do..."
Guest Message: "Oh, I'm from the Collective of Plenty, actually. She said that she'd try the new fitness program herself, before picking the appropriate weight for each training stage."
Guest Message: "But it's been a week, and she hasn't sent me a reply. I would just like to know... How's she finding the experience?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Considering the number of barbell plates outside her training room, we suspect that our Archon will be in training for some time."
Guest Message: "H—Huh? Wait, then... how is she doing right now?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "She is presently shooting for a new weight, and she just went outside to get some new weightlifting belts, humming all the way. Would you... like to wait a while longer?"
Guest Message: "Alright. I'll head back and bring a merchant who sells those belts with me next time..."

Guest Message: "Could I ask what the Pyro Archon thinks of the Saurian Cookies we sent her?"
Guest Message: "Could we ask for her opinion on them?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "She loves them! In fact, she's had quite a few. If she had to have one teeny-tiny criticism of them, it's that they're just the slightest bit on the dry side."
Guest Message: "Uhh... Well, they're for little Saurians, so..."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Yes, and that's why she's gone off into the wild to look for wild Saurians."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "'Wild Saurians tend to be very sensitive to food, so I'll find the most energetic of the lot and feed it some,' so she said."
Guest Message: "Then... You don't happen to know where she is now, do you?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "According to her previous plan, she should have arrived in the vicinity of Teticpac Peak. Please exercise some patience."
Guest Message: "What sort of Saurian will she be looking for...?"

Guest Message: "Apologies. I'm a merchant from the store next door. Could I ask what the Speaker's Chamber has been doing lately?"
Guest Message: "We often hear dull thudding, and the ground will tremble slightly from time to time... Is it some sort of earthquake? Or is the building going to collapse?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Very sorry! Please rest assured that earthquakes don't happen around here, and the building is very stable."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "The tremors and dull thuds you heard are from the Pyro Archon's daily routine training."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "The weight of the barbells used by the Pyro Archon are very heavy, which is why they make a loud noise when they fall to the ground. We will speak to her on the topic. Thank you for your understanding!"
Guest Message: "Might I... ask how much weight is needed to make such a noise...? Anyway, since it's so heavy, wouldn't it be better if she trained outdoors instead?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "She said that she sometimes loses control out in the wild, and tends to use weights that are... Let's call them somewhat overboard."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Since the last incident, where she almost smashed a certain volcano with a giant rock, causing a landslide, she has endeavored to refrain from further outdoor training."
Guest Message: "...I see. In that case, I, too, suggest that she remain indoors when training."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Thank you for your kind understanding. We will send you a set of earplugs."

Speaker's Chamber Reply: "...Using woven scrolls to record fictional novels? You might be barking up the wrong tree. We are the Speaker's Chamber, not the Masters of the Night-Wind, nor are we a publishing company."
Guest Message: "Uh, no, what we've actually done is hire a famous external novelist. We'd like to write an interesting light novel for our Pyro Archon."
Guest Message: "The novel is largely complete at this point, and we'd like to create a promotion plan that has a distinctly 'Natlan' flavor to it..."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "So, that's why you'd like this novel woven into a scroll, yes?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Hmmm. That does sound quite interesting! We'll inform the Pyro Archon about this..."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "Well, I think that's a great idea. I'll hit Citlali up later. She might be interested, too."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "That said, do let me have a look at the book first, would you? I'd be interested to know what outlanders think of me..."

Speaker's Chamber Announcement: "Today is the Speaker's Chamber Question-and-Answer Day. Please leave your queries here in an orderly fashion, and our Pyro Archon will answer them in order."
Guest Message: "Big Sis Lady Mavuika! What are your glasses made of? Why don't they get burned by fire? I asked Dad, Mom, and Big Sis, but none of them know..."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "My sunglasses? I had 'em custom-made from Xilonen. If you want a pair, too, kiddo, you can ask her. I'm sure she's happy to help."
Another Guest's Message: "Lady Archon. I'm an athlete, but I've been in subpar form lately, and a breakthrough has eluded me constantly."
Another Guest's Message: "...I sometimes wonder if I simply... lack talent. If I should give up. Dear Archon, could you give me some advice?"
Pyro Archon's Reply: "If you wish to gain fame and wealth through 'sport,' then I urge you to work within your limits and be realistic about your chances."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "If you're in this line because you love it, however, keep pushing on."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "The sweat you have poured out and the pain you've endured will serve as the stepping stones toward your victory."
