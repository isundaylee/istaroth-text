Andrei: What are you doing?
Andrei: I'm sure you've been enjoying all that Liyue Harbor has to offer?
Andrei: As a native of Snezhnaya, I was initially quite reluctant about being transferred to Liyue by the Northland Bank.
Andrei: But as I came to understand more about Liyue, I found myself liking it more and more.
Andrei: Things like the sea here and the city's atmosphere are all quite different from my home, haha!
Andrei: Tell me about your home.
Andrei: My hometown is not quite as lively as the bustling city of Liyue...
Andrei: And I've completely fallen in love with the food in Liyue. With such a variety of colors, flavors, and aromas, the cuisine here is simply exquisite!
Andrei: But even so, I could never turn my back on Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
