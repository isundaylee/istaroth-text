# To Measure the World!


## Talk 1

Farghani: Hey, friend, can I have a moment of your time?
Traveler: What is it?
Farghani: Now, have you ever thought about this: what will happen if the sky falls?
Traveler: You are worrying too much...
Farghani: That may be so. But why doesn't the sky fall? Why won't the earth collapse? Without accurate measurements, we'll never have answers to these questions.
Farghani: In fact, I've come up with a model that explains these questions perfectly. I just need more observational data to support it...
Traveler: So, do you need my help?
Farghani: So you are willing to help, then? Many thanks to you!
Farghani: I've chosen a perfect spot for my observations, but some monsters are active there.
Farghani: Please, drive them away so I can conduct my observations safely.
Traveler: Sure.
Farghani: Thanks a lot. Let's be on our way, then.
Traveler: Do you need to be at the scene yourself?
Farghani: I need to get some data on-site to find the cause of any discrepancies in my calculations.
Farghani: Fixating on a pile of papers will only lead you further away from the correct answer, so let's hit the road.
Traveler: Good luck. See you.
Farghani: Wait, wait! Please reconsider. If my work is published, it could be earthshaking!
Farghani: You will then be a collaborator in this great theoretical undertaking. I can also put your name in the acknowledgments...
Farghani: Or... Or you could even be my co-author...
Traveler: Are things really this urgent?
Farghani: If I can't get results, I'm afraid that I'll have a problem getting research funding... And that would be far more devastating than the sky falling.
Traveler: I wouldn't demand co-authorship.
Traveler: I prefer to be paid fairly.
Traveler: Technically, it can't.
Traveler: I'm really busy right now.
Farghani: Oh, please don't say that. What could be more serious than the incoming collapse of one's own house?
Traveler: Your house is... collapsing?
Farghani: Ahem... Of course not. But say you live in a house, and you've never seen it in its entirety, and no one has ever guaranteed its structural strength...
Farghani: Wouldn't living in this house every day worry you somehow? Such is also the case with living in this world.

## Talk 2

Farghani: Hmm... So that's it. Introduce this variable, and the discrepancies can be explained.
Farghani: But does that change my other deductions?
Traveler: Any progress?
Farghani: Sorry, I forgot that you were still here... Here's your payment.
Farghani: As for my progress... I've fixed some issues, but new ones have emerged. That's research, I guess.
Farghani: I might have to keep troubling you, Traveler, until I reach a final conclusion.

## Talk 3

Farghani: Hey friend, can I have a moment of your time?
Traveler: What is it?
Farghani: Now, have you ever thought about this: what will happen if the sky falls?

Traveler: So, do you need my help?
Farghani: So you are willing to help, then? Many thanks to you!
Farghani: Actually, I have ordered a customized set of beacons that will automatically collect the raw data necessary to support my deductions.
Farghani: They need to be set up on high places such as cliffs and mountaintops for the raw data to stay free of the possible effects of terrains.
Farghani: But as you can see, I'm not much of a climber...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Farghani: Thank you! The sampling sites are nearby. Just let me know when you're done.
Traveler: You didn't take terrain into account when placing your order?
Farghani: Ahem... The sensitivity of the instrument was a priority, so the range of applications was naturally sacrificed...
Farghani: After all, the calculations could veer far off the mark even if we make only a small mistake. Anyways, I'm counting on you.
Traveler: Good luck. See you.
Farghani: Wait, wait! Please reconsider. If my work is published, it could be earthshaking!
Farghani: You will then be a collaborator in this great theoretical undertaking. I can also put your name in the acknowledgments...

## Talk 4

Farghani: Hopefully there won't be any more data errors this time...

## Talk 5

Farghani: Huh? Have you finished setting up all the beacons?
Traveler: We're all set.
Farghani: Thank you so much. Please take this as your payment.
Farghani: Now all I have to do is wait for them to collect the data, and then I'll be able to confirm my deduction!
Farghani: Still, how am I supposed to go up and retrieve the beacons...?

## Talk 6

Farghani: Ah, Traveler, you've finally come!
Traveler: How's your research going?
Farghani: Thanks to you, I've made huge progress in the past few days. The beacons should be collecting data as we speak.
Farghani: Now I only have to retrieve the data and verify my new conjectures!
Traveler: All you have done these days is make conjectures!?
Farghani: Well, I've optimized some equations and calibrated my instruments. After all...
Farghani: I won't be able to climb up to the locations where you set those beacons.
Farghani: I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you to retrieve those beacons.
Traveler: Well, alright then...
Farghani: Please, Traveler! I will take care of the payment, do not fret.
Traveler: Why don't you take retrieval into account next time...
Farghani: I have weighed some options, you know. Adding a retrieval device, expanding our range of applications... things like that.
Farghani: But they require a higher budget, and I'm not sure how this might affect the data precision.
Farghani: Anyways, I'll be counting on you this time as well!
Traveler: You haven't made any progress at all...

## Talk 7

Farghani: Hopefully there won't be any more data errors this time...

## Talk 8

Farghani: What? Monsters, out there? This doesn't make sense. The environmental parameters showed that...
Farghani: Could the beacons have become variables themselves? Perhaps their vibrations and sounds attracted the monsters...
Farghani: Oh no, will these things affect the data? Ah, sorry. I've been talking to myself again.
Farghani: I didn't expect to cause you extra trouble. My apologies, and please, take this as your payment.
Farghani: I should be more conscientious with my measurements next time.
