# Fishing For Jade


## Talk 1

Kun: A perfectly good Jade Chamber... Gone, just like that...
Traveler: What are you doing over here?
Kun: Ah, it's you. I... Well, I'm currently thinking about how to clear up the fragments of the Jade Chamber currently floating on the ocean surface...
Kun: You recall that it was completely destroyed when it crashed, right?
Kun: Those fragments ended up floating on the ocean, with some larger pieces even blocking the path of passing ships...
Kun: The Ministry of Civil Affairs organized a cleanup, which got rid of all the larger pieces.
Kun: But as for those smaller bits of flotsam... Clear them out one day, and more come floating in the next...
Kun: While they're not that much of a problem, the Ministry's stance is that we should clean them up all the same. I'm currently thinking about how this can be done.
Kun: Our sergeant said that I could look for some people to help out, but who would want to do this job anyway?
Kun: I mean, um, unless you... Well, are you willing to help me with the cleanup? You might even be able to keep some of the useful items you pick up.
Traveler: You can count on me.
Kun: Thanks, you're a big help. I'm afraid that I'm not a particularly good swimmer...
Traveler: Useful items? Such as...?
Kun: Honestly, I don't know myself. But given that this is the Jade Chamber, I'm sure that something eye-catching will turn up.

## Talk 2

Kun: A perfectly good Jade Chamber... Gone, just like that...

## Talk 3

Kun: Have you finished the cleanup?
Traveler: I found these things...
Kun: Hmm... I suppose you can just keep that Mora. It isn't much, so I suppose you can keep it as compensation for your help.
Kun: This box, on the other hand, is unknown to me. You might want to pass it on to Baiwen.
Kun: She's currently attending to some business at Yuehai Pavilion. Perhaps she might know what it is.

## Talk 4

Baiwen: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: I picked this up from the sea...
Baiwen: Hmm? Allow me to have a look.
Baiwen: Yes, this does indeed come from the Jade Chamber.
Traveler: Anything specific you could tell me?
Baiwen: Well, the contents consist of several documents and an announcement that has yet to undergo review. To think that they are still so well-preserved... How unexpected.
Baiwen: Still, your find should save us some work. Cleaning up after this mess really has proved an unending font of busywork.
Baiwen: Still, thank you for bringing these to us. Do take this as a token of our appreciation.
