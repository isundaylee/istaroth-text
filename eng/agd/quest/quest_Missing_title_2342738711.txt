# Missing title (2342738711)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ah, there you are, Verenata!
Verenata: #Uh... Um, hey there, Traveler and Paimon. What do you need from me?
Paimon: Well, this has to do with what you were all chatting about earlier. About preparing food for Serene—
Verenata: N—No, wait, please stop talking!
Verenata: We... want to make this a surprise for Serene, and don't want anyone else to know. Not even Carabosse...
Paimon: Don't worry. We won't tell a soul! We just want to help you prepare. This will make things easier for you too, right?
Verenata: Hmm... You two are pretty reliable. If that's the case, I've a favor to ask...
Verenata: The dish we're trying to make usually uses... fish.
Verenata: But Lutine told me that... the outside world has something called "bacon," and that it tastes delicious. Monsieur Neuvillette has also enjoyed it before.
Verenata: So, I think that if we can get some "bacon," we might be able to cook something incredible... Just like Carabosse always says, "knowledge is power"!
Traveler: I'm not sure this has anything to do with knowledge...
Paimon: It's the knowledge of what to do with cooking ingredients... kinda-sorta?
Paimon: Anyway, don't worry about it. We've got this bacon thing down pat!
Traveler: "Fontaine is bacon"...
Paimon: ?

## Talk 2

Canotila: #Ah, Mister Traveler...
Canotila: So... Hmm, about those new pages...
Paimon: Hey, c'mon, enough about the pages! Aren't you trying to make "That Dish" and prepare the relevant ingredients for it?
Canotila: Hmm... Well, since you've overheard, I suppose there really is nothing for it... You two must be included in this as well.
Canotila: #A question, if I may! Mister Traveler, what ingredient symbolizes "birth" to you?
Canotila: Something that "bestows life" and represents "newborn." I believe you know what I'm looking for, yes?
Traveler: ?
Paimon: ?
Canotila: ...I want a bird egg. Just a bird egg.
Canotila: But I suppose you can see the rub too, can't you? We Melusines have short arms and can't climb trees well, so it'll be... very troublesome for one of us to get any bird eggs.
Traveler: Don't worry, leave it to me.
Canotila: Anyway, I leave this to you, alright?
Traveler: You're not going to need a fresh one, are you...
Canotila: Huh? A fresh bird egg?
Canotila: #Hmm. That does sound much better than an "ordinary bird egg"! In that case, Mister Traveler, I'll need you to get fresh bird eggs!
Paimon: No, no, wait! They're not really any different! An ordinary bird egg will work just fine!
Traveler: You mean... like a bird egg?
Canotila: Hehe, yeah! That's right! Sharp as always, I see!

## Talk 3

Puca: Flatbread's a-baking, Flatbread's a-baking~♪

## Talk 4

Verenata: Hmm, if we wrap the fish inside the bacon...

## Talk 5

Serene: Ah, you finally looked over! Hello there, tall stranger and...
Paimon: #Paimon's Paimon, and he's Traveler.
Serene: #Alright, I got it! Mister Traveler and Miss Paimon. Welcome to Merusea Village!
Traveler: Miss...?
Serene: #Ah... Sorry. So sorry. I'm just used to being considerate to the people in the village. Miss Paimon also looked like she could use some care, so I just called her that without thinking...
Traveler: #Paimon probably could use some more care indeed...
Paimon: #Hey! Paimon cares for you all the time too, you know!
Paimon: Still... what's your name...
Serene: I'm Serene. Just call me Serene.
Serene: I heard you were trying to collect components... Did something happen?
Black Screen Text: You explain everything that happened before to Serene...
Serene: I didn't think something like that would occur... This must be reported to Monsieur Neuvillette immediately.
Serene: #Thank you, Mister Traveler and Miss Paimon. If it weren't for you, something worse would've definitely followed.
Paimon: But Seymour still broke down...
Serene: Hmm... So that's why you were collecting components, yes?
Paimon: Yeah! Though we're not really sure how to fix him right now... We were thinking that after getting the components, we could go somewhere like the Fontaine Research Institute and find someone to help us...
Serene: If that's the case, then please take this.
Paimon: Huh? Are these... components? Are you just giving them to us?
Traveler: Thank you.
Serene: I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for taking care of Mamere.
Serene: That child's always alone and never tells me about anything...
Serene: So, seeing her joyously talking with someone — and that someone being an outsider human friend as well — makes me happy.
Serene: Though, if I had more components, maybe that could solve the problem immediately, right? It's as I expected. It will take more hard work on my part to better assist everyone...
Paimon: C'mon, you've already helped us. Anyway, we'll be taking these components! Thanks a lot, Serene!
Traveler: Right, where can we find more components?
Serene: Hmm... Let me think. You can check the areas around the village. If you're lucky, you might be able to pick up some scattered components.
Serene: But, this method alone isn't that efficient...
Serene: So, why don't you ask the villagers if they need help with anything? I'm sure they'll give you components in exchange for that help.
Traveler: Do you need us to help you with anything?
Serene: Huh? Ah, no! I didn't mean to use this to get your help or anything!
Serene: #Well, either Traveler or Mamere are going to need those components, right? So just accept them!
Traveler: Thank you.

## Talk 6

Puca: *sigh* But... what should we give Serene?
Canotila: So long as it expresses our intentions, we can give her anything, can we not?
Verenata: Yeah, Carabosse said the same thing!
Puca: Hmmm... "intentions"... Let me think. Mister Chesil's sent me a new clock, but would a clock really make the best birthday gift?
Puca: After all, Serene's taking care of us all. This would be a great opportunity for me to give her a gift that'll make her happy...
Canotila: Everyone wants that! Though if we think about it, gifting her something else might end with her turning it away right? She'll say "I can't accept something so valuable" or something like that.
Verenata: Yeah...
Canotila: If that's the case, then why don't we make her a nice meal? The act of eating together will express our intentions perfectly!
Puca: Oh, yeah! You're the best, Canotila! In that case, let's make "That Dish" together!
Verenata: Huh? You want to make "That Dish"? Well, preparing it will be a bit...
Traveler: Do you need help?
Verenata: Huh? Well, that...
Puca: #Ah, it's... it's Mister Traveler and Paimon!
Canotila: #Ahaha... Today's weather isn't bad either, Mister Traveler! Did you find any new pages?
Paimon: Huh? Ah, if you're talking about the "Book of Revealing"...
Paimon: Wait, hold on, no! Don't change the subject! You were just talking about preparing something for Serene...
Verenata: Ah! Ah! I just remembered there are notes that need to be collated! I need to get back right now!
Puca: #I—I have also remembered that I need to meet with Mister Chesil tomorrow! I have to go now too! See you, Mister Traveler and Paimon!
Canotila: Hmm... Golden butterflies...
Paimon: Wait! Huh? Why did they all run off?
Traveler: Maybe they don't want anyone else to know.
Paimon: Hmm. So, they're planning to host a big birthday dinner for Serene?
Paimon: Come to think of it, we haven't actually gotten to try the Melusines' dishes! If it's a birthday celebration, the food should be extra fancy, right?
Paimon: #Ooohh, Paimon's starting to look forward to this birthday thing... Traveler, why don't we find and help them?
Traveler: That's a birthday gift for someone else...
Paimon: Paimon... Paimon knows that! But... if we prepare a dish with the Melusines, you'll figure out how to make it, won't you? You know, in case Paimon wants some later...
Paimon: No, wait! Paimon means "we"! We can eat it together in the future!
Traveler: You're really something else, Paimon...
Paimon: Hehe. Anyway, let's go check up on them and see if they need our help to prepare anything!
Traveler: Don't you try to sneak a bite, Paimon.
Traveler: That's what we call a birthday surprise...

## Talk 7

Canotila: Anyway, let's open the shell first...

## Talk 8

Puca: White and sweet...

## Talk 9

Puca: #Ah! Thanks, Mister Traveler! Thanks, Paimon! This way, we can make some delicious flatbread!
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon can't wait!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Puca! About what you said earlier...
Puca: ...Ah! That... that was supposed to be a secret. You can't tell anyone else! Not even Sluasi!
Paimon: Don't worry about a thing! We definitely won't tell anyone else! We just want to help you prepare! Two extra helpers will help get things ready faster, right?
Puca: Hmm? Yeah... yeah! I'm sure you two would be a big help!
Paimon: Hehe, right? So, what do you need us to do?
Puca: Hmm... The other ingredients are pretty easy to prepare, but we still need that white and sweet thing...
Paimon: Huh? You mean sugar?
Puca: No! Not that! Sugar is dangerous! *sigh* Eating that just once will make you always want to eat it. In the end... you'll get all round and stuff...
Traveler: Just like a Breacher Primus?
Puca: Anyway, absolutely no sugar! I almost fell into its sweet trap in the past... We can't let the same thing happen to Serene!
Paimon: But what else is white and sweet besides sugar?
Traveler: Flour, perhaps?
Paimon: Huh? How's flour supposed to be sweet?
Paimon: No, wait, you can taste a little sweetness if you sample it for long enough...
Puca: Um, well, I am referring to flour. First, we'll need to make it round. Then we bake it till it's tasty and crispy...
Puca: But... I've used up all my flour... and Xana doesn't have any, either. We'll need to go out and get more...
Paimon: #No problem, leave it to us! Traveler, let's check if we're carrying any flour!
Traveler: (Stares at Paimon.)
Paimon: Wh—Why are you staring at Paimon like that?
Traveler: Just like Paimon?
Paimon: Hey! Paimon isn't round!

## Talk 11

Verenata: This "bacon" that Lutine mentioned... I wonder what it is?

## Talk 12

Verenata: #Whoa, so this is "bacon"? Thanks a lot, Traveler, Paimon!
Verenata: Still, it's a bit different from what I'd imagined...
Paimon: Don't you worry! Bacon tastes good no matter how you prepare it!
Verenata: Really? I don't quite get that, but I'll do my best!

## Talk 13

Canotila: Well, have you a bird egg with you?

## Talk 14

Canotila: #Thanks, Mister Traveler! I'm sure that Serene will be happy too!
Canotila: Thanks. I'll go prepare the ingredient now!
Paimon: Alright! You got this!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Yeah! This way, all the ingredients for the dish should be ready!
Puca: #Hehe, you really are awesome, Mister Traveler!
Canotila: Alright! We'll leave the cooking to you, Verenata!
Verenata: A—Alright! You can count on me! I've learned the greatest, bestest, most powerful-est cooking methods from Carabosse and Lutine!
Traveler: You got this!
Verenata: Carabosse once said that the most important thing in cooking is vigor, and the will to never give up! We must never surrender to the ingredients, no matter what!
Paimon: This style of cooking is already entirely different from what Paimon's familiar with...
Verenata: No worries, no worries! Nothing will go wrong! Probably!
Black Screen Text: Under your supervision, Verenata gathers two pieces of flatbread, seven fish, the cooked bird egg, and sliced bacon before throwing them all into the pot at once and stirring away with focus and gusto...
This really doesn't seem like the way flatbread is cooked, but it's too late to stop the process at this point...
Verenata: Mm-hmm! There we go! All done, easy-peasy!
Canotila: Oh, it looks pretty good! I think Serene will definitely be pleased!
Puca: #Of course! Why, I'm already super happy! Anyway, we should also thank Mister Traveler for helping us make such a wonderful meal!
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's gonna ask, just in case...
Paimon: But... what is this?
Verenata: Huh? Haven't you seen Poissonchant Pie before, Paimon?
Paimon: Uh, that sounds and looks like you'd use it to cast some kind of forbidden magic or something!
Canotila: Huh? Why?
Paimon: Well, you're the one who called it "Poissonchant"... Also, look at all these fish heads!
Puca: Hehe! They're so cute, right? They look just like a choir in a picture book, with everyone holding their heads up high and singing happily—
Paimon: Which part of that dish even remotely looks like what you're talking about?
Verenata: Hmm... Since neither of you have seen a Poissonchant Pie before, then maybe we should give you two a serving first!
Verenata: You both were a big help after all — I mean, you look after us just like Miss Serene does.
Canotila: Hmm, I'd say that Serene's a bit noisier and nosier at times, actively trying to help when we don't need it...
Puca: That's just the way she is...
Canotila: #But either way, Mister Traveler and Paimon are better at... caring for people?
Canotila: Anyway, we would like the two of you to accept our "goodwill"!
Traveler: Hehe, awesome! This looks delicious!
Paimon: #Huh? Traveler, you can't be serious... right?
Puca: #Hehe, you look so happy right now, Mister Traveler!
Canotila: Alright, let's go give the Poissonchant Pie to Serene!
Traveler: Okay. Let's go!
Paimon: Will this... really be okay?
Traveler: Am I coming along as well?
Puca: Yup. I mean, you helped prepare the ingredients after all! And besides, the more people who eat together, the merrier, right?
Traveler: Hmm. Uh, thanks?
Traveler: As long as it doesn't turn out like your potions...
Paimon: Ahh! Don't make Paimon remember that smell!
Verenata: I got it this time! Don't worry about it!

### Additional Talk 2

Black Screen Text: You look for Serene together with everyone else...
Serene: Well, I suppose this should be fine now...
Serene: #Ah. Hello, Traveler, Paimon! Is there something you need?
Paimon: Hmm? What are you doing, Serene?
Serene: Oh, are you talking about this thing? Well, Xana accidentally broke the water bottle she usually carries with her, so I came by to try and fix it...
Serene: #So, Traveler and Paimon... Do you need me to help with something?
Paimon: Uh, do you remember what day it is?
Serene: Huh? Come to think of it, today's the day that I'll need to submit a report to Monsieur Neuvillette...
Paimon: That's not what we're talking about!
Canotila: Seriously, you should consider yourself more. It's your birthday, you know...
Canotila: Come, everyone! Altogether now!
Canotila (Canotila, Puca, and Verenata): Happy birthday!
Serene: Eh?
Verenata: #Traveler helped us prepare a totally unique Poissonchant Pie for your birthday!
Puca: This is for all the time you've spent taking care of us, and for all your help when I was trying to communicate with Mister Chesil...
Canotila: Well, you're really noisy sometimes, but as long as you don't suddenly pop in and interrupt my thoughts, you're welcome to be even louder if you want.
Serene: I... everyone...
Canotila: Come on, that's no way to look at your own birthday. Anyway, if we don't eat the Poissonchant Pie we spent so long preparing soon, it'll get cold.
Canotila: #Come, let's eat! You too, Mister Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: My taste buds were born for such adventure!
Paimon: Wait, how does this count as an adventure?
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the strange Poissonchant Pie with the Melusines...
Though it looks rather strange, the taste isn't as bad as you expected. On the contrary, it's quite delicious, so long as you can stomach the stares of the fish heads, their eyes still gleaming with a strange light...
Paimon: Huh? It... tastes pretty good...
Traveler: Another!
Verenata: Ah, but we don't have any more... If you're still hungry, though, we can make more together in the future!
Canotila: Come on, make a wish — and make sure it's a wish for yourself!
Serene: Well, if that's the case, my wish has already come true.
Serene: #Thank you everyone! Thank you, Traveler and Paimon.
Traveler: Humanity might not yet be ready for this wonder...
Paimon: Yeah, though it tastes good, it looks...
Traveler: Do I... really have to eat this...
Paimon: (Uh... Well, here goes nothing. Paimon should have a nibble at least...)

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? Serene? Why did you call out to us? Did something happen?
Serene: Yeah, so, remember when you two said you wanted to go collect some components, right?
Paimon: Collecting components... Ah, you mean fixing Seymour!
Serene: Yeah, at that time I didn't have that many components with me, so I couldn't help you two...
Serene: So I went out and collected some more!
Paimon: Whoa! You sure got a lot!
Serene: Please take them. This way, you can speed up the repairs, right?
Paimon: Well, thanks a lot, but Seymour is already fixed...
Serene: Huh? Already? Wow, I should have expected that from you two!
Serene: If that's the case, you doubly deserve these components!
Paimon: Huh?
Serene: You've been putting in a lot of work to help everyone, right?
Serene: If that's the case, then I would like you two to have these components as a token of my gratitude. Thank you for taking care of everyone in the village!
Serene: It just so happens that *Xana* is here in the village too! If you need anything, you can trade with her using these components!
