Baron Bigfoot: Golden Comet, and Silver Companion, congratulations on making it to the finals.
Traveler: Thanks!
Baron Bigfoot: After watching your match against Layla, I feel that the two of you have a special bond with the Fungi.
Baron Bigfoot: You seem to... view the Fungi under the control of the orb... as friends. That's why you're able to understand them better and bring out their full potential.
Baron Bigfoot: In comparison, I still have the idea that I'm their "master." All I could think of was to train with them to better our techniques. I've failed at giving them the care that they needed.
Baron Bigfoot: The gap between me and my Fungi is probably the reason I lost to you. I lost, and for good reason.
Paimon: Please, Brown... erm... Baron Bigfoot! It's not that you were being too hard on your Fungi, it's just that you were treating them in an ordinary way.
Paimon: Besides, we might actually pick up a thing or two from you. Like going on adventures with the Fungi, or putting ourselves in a dire situation to make our bond a little more... resilient!
Baron Bigfoot: That's very nice of you to say, Silver Companion! There is no end to honing one's skills. I still have much to learn...
Baron Bigfoot: Hopefully, after you've claimed the championship, I'll have the honor of going up against you again in the future.
Traveler: Wait for our good news.
Paimon: We'll be waiting on yours as well.
Traveler: We need to go and start preparing.
Baron Bigfoot: Formidable opponents await! You have to keep your eyes peeled. You guys are the best candidates to be champions in my book!
