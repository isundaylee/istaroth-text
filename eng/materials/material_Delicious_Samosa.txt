# Delicious Samosa

A deep-fried snack. Each golden, crispy pocket is stuffed full with a soft, glutinous filling. You can't help but wolf one down immediately, and then reach out for a second one, taking your time to savor it... Piece by piece, you become lost in the dish's enticing aroma, and before you know it, you are only left with an empty plate.
