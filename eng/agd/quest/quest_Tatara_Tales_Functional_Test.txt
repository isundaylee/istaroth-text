# Tatara Tales: Functional Test


## Talk 1

Xavier: Oh! Uh, Traveler... Things do not look good.
Xavier: The Fatui within have concentrated their forces near the core. It seems that they have discovered something.
Xavier: Surely they don't intend to breach the core's defenses... No, we can no longer afford to delay. We must move now to initiate functionality tests.
Traveler: Functionality tests?
Xavier: By that, I mean that we must test our machine friend's purification abilities. I have no intention of moving it into the furnace only to find that it will not function.
Xavier: To that end, please help me find 3 Onikabuto, if you will.
Xavier: I want to place them near the Mikage Furnace, which will cause them to be tainted by Tatarigami.
Xavier: Then, we will retrieve them, and use this purification device to cleanse them.
Xavier: This is the test I have devised.
Traveler: Where do I find these Onikabuto?
Xavier: Hmm... normally, they are found in Electro-rich environments...
Xavier: I have also heard that they can survive near the Mikage Furnace. What hardy little critters they are...
Traveler: Why don't I just snag some from in the furnace, then?
Xavier: Well, you could do that, but if you were to take Onikabuto directly from the Mikage Furnace for testing...
Xavier: To tell you the truth, I worry about the reliability of my little machine...
Xavier: It is best to work through tests step by step, after all.
Xavier: Ahem, well then... please help me find 3 Onikabuto, if you will.
Traveler: I've got this.
Xavier: So you do. Just 3 is fine!
Traveler: I could just take a dip inside the Furnace myself...
Xavier: Well... you could use yourself as the test subject, yes.
Xavier: But like I said before, this device's reliability may not meet expectations.
Xavier: If something unexpected truly does happen during the purification process, you might... uh, encounter some unforeseen issues...
Xavier: Ahem. Let's just stick to using the Onikabuto for now, shall we?
Xavier: Just 3 will do! Once you've caught them, just bring them back here.

## Talk 2

Xavier: Ah, my machine friend, let's hope that you do fine...

## Talk 3

Xavier: Ah. How's it going? Have you caught those 3 Onikabuto?
Traveler: They're right here.

## Talk 4

Xavier: That should do, then, yes. Thank you! I shall begin tests immediately.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Xavier: I wonder if Inazuma did appointed a project manager for this whole Mikage Furnace business...
