# A Mysterious Loss


## Talk 1

Viktor: Oh, this is terrible. I'm finished for sure...
Traveler: Something wrong?
Viktor: Gah! Staying here was just too boring, what with the weird looks the sisters give me and all, so I decided to get out, get some fresh air...
Viktor: But just as I left the city, thinking to go to the Thousand Winds Temple for a stroll... all these meteorites started raining down from the sky.
Viktor: There was no way I was staying out there, so I ran back into the city... And that's when I realized that I left a box behind...
Viktor: Given all the chaos out there, I didn't dare to go out to look for it, either.
Viktor: And, well... I'm Fatui. If I were to make any sudden moves, I'd be suspected of doing something untoward for sure...
Viktor: Bah, enough nonsense. Could you help me look for that thing?
Viktor: Our transactions have been quite amiable so far, and I plan to continue doing good business with you...
Traveler: Stop saying such suspicious stuff.
Viktor: What? Come now, there was nothing suspicious about the stories I told you...
Viktor: Well, how about it? Will you help me out, or won't you?

## Talk 2

Viktor: What? Did you need something else?
Traveler: It's a little hard to search without any clues, you know...
Viktor: Um, alright, one moment. Let me try to remember...
Viktor: No, nothing comes to mind. There's nothing special about the box, either...
Traveler: Then if I may ask you something...
Viktor: Sure. What would you like to know?

## Talk 3

Traveler: Bit hard to search without leads, don't you think?
Viktor: Um, alright, one moment. Let me try to remember...
Viktor: No, nothing comes to mind. There's nothing special about the box, either...
Traveler: Then if I may ask you something...
Viktor: Sure. What would you like to know?

## Talk 4

Viktor: That's all I can remember. Find me that box, and quickly.
Viktor: If you can't, well... then I'm done for...

## Talk 5

Traveler: What happened while you were running back here?
Viktor: While I was running back? Hmm, let's see... No, I can't recall any details.
Viktor: Ah, yes! I did encounter a large group of Electro Slimes near the <color=#00E1FFFF>Thousand Winds Temple</color> on the way back. They gave me a few hard knocks, causing the box to fall out!
Viktor: Now, I did manage to grab it back, but... I wound up losing it again in my haste.
Viktor: Still, since the box was touched by those Electro Slimes, it should have some <color=#00E1FFFF>elemental traces</color> on it.
Viktor: In any case, try following the trail of Electro traces and see what you can find.
Viktor: Once you've found the box, bring it back to me.

## Talk 6

Traveler: What's in the box?
Viktor: That's, uh, none of your business. Just a few odds and ends...
Viktor: Come on! Don't look at me like that. I'm not some kind of villain!
Traveler: But you're with the Fatui.
Viktor: Fatui this, Fatui that... So all of us are the bad guys now? What sort of logic is that?
Viktor: Well, whatever. Go out there and have a look. <color=#00E1FFFF>Come back and look for me if you really can't find it</color>.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...

## Talk 7

Traveler: What were you doing out there?
Viktor: Oh, come on. What's with that look of suspicion?
Viktor: I just went out for a stroll, really! I legged it back here the moment those meteorites started falling.
Viktor: Well, whatever. Go out there and have a look. <color=#00E1FFFF>Come back and look for me if you really can't find it</color>.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...

## Talk 8

Viktor: Have you found that box?
Traveler: Got it right here.
Viktor: You... actually managed to find it! Phew... That's good... That's good.
Traveler: And as for our "deal"?
Viktor: Uh, fine... Fine, I get it. Out with it, then. What do you want to know this time?

## Talk 9

Traveler: I'll help you out.
Viktor: That's great. Now, let me think... While I can't remember the details, I was wandering around the Thousand Winds Temple earlier...
Viktor: But as I was running back, I encountered a large group Electro Slimes. I got careless and took a few hits from them, and the box fell out...
Viktor: Now, I did manage to grab it back, but... I wound up losing it again in my haste.
Viktor: Still, since the box was touched by those Electro Slimes, it should have some elemental traces on it.
Viktor: In any case, try following the trail of Electro traces and see what you can find.
Viktor: Once you've found the box, bring it back to me.
Viktor: Well... <color=#00E1FFFF>you can also come back and look for me if you really can't find it</color>.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...

## Talk 10

Traveler: What about the other Fatui in the city?
Viktor: Oh, them? They're probably spinning their wheels here, just like me.
Viktor: *sigh* I wonder when these days will finally end...

## Talk 11

Traveler: So, what do you know about the meteorites?
Viktor: The meteorites... Well, not that I don't want to tell you, but I have no clue either.
Viktor: All I do is stand here in Mondstadt, unable to leave or move. What do I know?
Viktor: But my gut feeling tells me that those meteorites don't bode well...
Viktor: I'd stay out of this one if I were you. It can only mean trouble.
