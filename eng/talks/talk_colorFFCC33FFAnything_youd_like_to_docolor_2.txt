Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Anything you'd like to do?</color>
Beidou: What do you think? I wanna take you out to sea on an adventure, of course!
Beidou: I can teach you how to steer a ship if you're interested.
Beidou: You know, no two waves are ever the same...
Beidou: If you're free, it'd be a shame not to take the opportunity to show you 'round the seas.
Traveler: I'll need to prepare.
Beidou: Sure thing. Just say the word.
Beidou: Oh, uh... And if you've got any unfinished business, best take care of that first then call me when you're done.
Beidou: One voyage takes about one and a half years, but that's just a rough estimate.
Beidou: So, you should tie up any loose ends before we set sail!
Beidou: Anyway â€” let me know when you're done prepping, and we'll pick a date to set off!
Beidou: The thought of you and I conquering the seas together... I can't wait!
Traveler: I'm worried that I'll get seasick.
Beidou: Don't be afraid. Don't let that hold you back.
Beidou: You'll get used to the ocean's movements soon enough. If you're really struggling, I have some medicinal herbs.
Beidou: I guarantee you, it'll be fine. Trust me on this.
Beidou: It'd be a pity if you missed out on a voyage across the seas because of something like that!
