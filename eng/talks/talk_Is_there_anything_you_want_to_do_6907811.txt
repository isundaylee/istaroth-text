# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you want to do?
Alhaitham: I already do what I want every day, so I can't think of a substantial answer to that question right away.
Alhaitham: I'm content with things as they are now.
Traveler: You don't seem very busy most of the time.
Alhaitham: Oh? Do I give you that kind of impression?
Alhaitham: Very well then. I don't like having my hands full â€” it interferes with my thinking process.
Alhaitham: But that reminds me... I need to make myself look like I'm always occupied, so I can avoid things I don't want to do and people I don't want to interact with.
Alhaitham: You, on the other hand, have a vast social circle, so you must run into difficult people quite often.
Traveler: Is there a solution to that?
Alhaitham: I suggest that you ask them a few questions that they'll never find exact answers to.
Alhaitham: Once you divert their attention and energy into other matters, they should leave you alone rather quickly.
Traveler: Thank you. That was very helpful.
Alhaitham: Don't mention it.
Alhaitham: To some extent, I want everyone to lead the lives they want to live.
Alhaitham: That way, people will cause fewer headaches for each other.
Traveler: That's a pretty unique way of thinking.
Alhaitham: I figure most people would think similarly.
Alhaitham: Wouldn't it be great to live in a world without annoyances?
