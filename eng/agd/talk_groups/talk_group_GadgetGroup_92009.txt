Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): A note placed with Shiroyama's Testament. After comparing the handwriting, it was confirmed to have been written by the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): "Shiroyama, long time no see. I trust the thing I asked you for is in progress?"
Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): "I paid a visit to your home today while you weren't around. Thankfully, your wonderful wife welcomed me in... She's a fine woman. A perfect match for you."
Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): "Your wife is five months pregnant, I believe? Fancy that â€” my wife too."
Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): "I took the liberty of returning once more to provide her with some health supplements, even helped administer them to her myself. She was most grateful indeed."
Paimon (Takatsukasa Isamu's Message): "You will be equally grateful to me, no doubt? Then don't keep me waiting."
