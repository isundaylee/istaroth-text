Acrobatic Adventure Troupe: Your smiles are the greatest gift we could ask for. Today only, let us all share in this celebration of joy together!
Public Apology: "While our troupe was performing a firebreathing act in front of the Palais Mermonia, the fire suppression systems were accidentally activated, resulting in water damage to a large number of files. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused."
Maison Gardiennage: Due to the unlawful usage of open flames during a performance near the Palais Mermonia, the license of the Acrobatic Adventure Troupe to tour has been temporarily revoked. We hope that all citizens will learn from their mistake.
