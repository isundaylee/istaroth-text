Traveler: The stars determine your destiny...
Ashk: Ah, are you talking about the research into constellations?
Ashk: Unfortunately, I don't have a Vision, so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
Ashk: But I feel that the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
Ashk: Because if such things can be "decided," then they can also be "changed," right?
Ashk: If destiny could be rewritten just like that, I doubt that the Dendro Archon would have had to expend so much energy quelling the ancient calamity back then.
