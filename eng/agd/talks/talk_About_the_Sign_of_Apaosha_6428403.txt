Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Zurvan: The appearance of the Sign of Apaosha is a result of the constant build-up of defilement.
Zurvan: The last time such an occurrence happened was centuries ago. I, along with some human warriors, set about eradicating it.
Zurvan: Should the defilement be allowed to erode the structure of the Harvisptokhm, then once the filth grows too much for the Khvarena to contain, the Tunigi Hollow's rift might just reopen.
