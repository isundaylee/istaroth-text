Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Iara: Argh, it was so intense that all the fish got scared off!
Iara: Hmm, speaking of that... Did it happen just as Delaroche said it might? Did a whole school of Linebreakers strong enough to shake Merusea Village appear?
Iara: If that's the case, all the more reason for me to guard this fishing spot. I'll show them the strength of my will!
