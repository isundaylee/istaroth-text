Traveler: How's the situation in the Kujou Clan...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Being as busy as we are, I have not paid the clan's internal affairs much mind... So the news that some in our family tried to stab the main Kujou Clan in the back, I was very shocked...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: It is fortunate that Lord Kujou Kamaji was able to gain the Almighty Shogun's trust. If not... *sigh* I dare not even think about the consequences.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Still, this series of events has me thinking that I should pay our internal affairs more mind... Once I have finished my work here, I will pay the main clan a visit...
