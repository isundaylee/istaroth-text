# The Final Chapter


## Talk 1

Aranaga: #Golden Nara... Yep, that's right, Nara {NICKNAME}, and the Floaty, White Floaty.
Aranaga: Hello, Aranaga, I am! Been waiting here for a long time, I have!
Paimon: We've also been looking for you for a long time, little bean!
Aranaga: Aranaga, I am. Little bean, I am not. Soft-Fluffy White-Mushroom Floaty.
Paimon: Soft and fluffy... white mushroom? What? Are you talking about Paimon?
Traveler: Paimon's silhouette does resemble a mushroom.
Paimon: No, it does not!
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: And Paimon is Paimon, hello!
Paimon: Um... Aramango, what can we do for you?
Aranaga: #It's Aranaga. My friends, Nara {NICKNAME} must have met. They are the ones who led you here, correct?
Paimon: Yes, we met your two little friends! They said we could meet you here.
Aranaga: Welcome to the Mawtiyima Forest, my garden, this is. Many flora friends, mushroom friends here. Here, they love.
Aranaga: Because is here, Mawtiyima. Protects us, protects the forest, Mawtiyima. So can gather with friends, help friends thrive, Aranaga.
Aranaga: #But need help, we. Can give help, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: So... What do you want us to help with?
Traveler: Chase away Fungi for you?
Aranaga: #Yes, yes, correct you are, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Aranaga: Turning into a dull color, Mawtiyima is very sad... But you guys can definitely help, she said. So I waited for you here.
Paimon: Morty... mi-amore... momma-mia? Argh! However you pronounce it! What is it?
Aranaga: It's what Nara Varuna left behind, gathering the Elements and nutrients to feed the forest, Mawtiyima.
Aranaga: "...During the first moon, made the Fungi came to life, Mawtiyima. During the second moon, the branches woke up."
Aranaga: "On the ground, the moon cast shadows, shadows of the chattering leaves..."
Aranaga: "During the third moon, startled lazy flowers from sleep, Mawtiyima. They blossomed one by one, lively and rambunctious," said the long-lived trees...
Aranaga: But after many, many more moons, Marana came out of the moons' shadows and devoured Mawtiyima.
Aranaga: They came too, the walking Shroom-Kin, not afraid of Marana, but very frightening.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon is getting more and more confused...
Aranaga: Because White Floaty is silly.
Paimon: Hey, why are all of you like this!
Aranaga: Oh, you should have the Kusava already.
Aranaga: Don't eat it. Is for waking mushrooms and vines, the Kusava.
Aranaga: When mushrooms and vines wake up, they will carry everyone higher so that you can find the Yajna Grass!
Paimon: Yammering Grass? What's that?
Aranaga: It's "Yajna," destinated to turn into Arahaoma. Very cute and pitiful.
Aranaga: Over there, its home is. I point it to you, I take you to see.
Paimon: Um, find it and then what do we do?
Aranaga: Make it and its other two friends into Arahaoma, then open the... pass?... puzz?... of vines that leads to Mawtiyima... Use Arahaoma.
Paimon: You mean "path"?
Aranaga: Yes, Nara call a flat stripe with no grass a "path." Nara don't like plants. Aranara like plants. But the meanings, same.
Aranaga: Only this way will Marana recede, Mawtiyima said. Everyone is also urging me, flowers and trees.
Traveler: So you came to us?
Aranaga: Golden Nara, very much like Nara Varuna. Save the forest, save us, must be... should be able to.
Paimon: For some reason that last pause really annoys Paimon...
Aranaga: Aranara trust you, so please trust Aranaga as well. Let Aranaga bring you there.
Paimon: Whoa, by the looks of your eagerness, it seems like something very serious.
Aranaga: Serious, yes. Be ahead of the moon, not behind.
Paimon: What's this about behind the moon now...?
Traveler: He meant time's running out.
Aranaga: I'll take you to the Yajna Grass.
Traveler: We have to pick up the pace.
Traveler: Why us?
Traveler: Rejuvenate the soil for you?
Traveler: Little bean is right. Paimon is indeed soft and fluffy.
Paimon: It's weird to hear you say that!
Aranaga: It's not little bean, it's Aranaga. Golden melon Nara is doofus Nara, likes to be bad.

## Talk 2

Aranaga: Here it is! The Yajna Grass! It's protected, the Yajna Grass!
Aranaga: Unseal it, and then we can talk to the Yajna Grass!

## Talk 3

Traveler: I am ready.
Paimon: Paimon too!
Aranaga: So... Aranakin, Aragaru, let's start the ritual.
Black Screen Text: "Come, come, dreams of the garden, memories of the forest..."\n"Come, come, wind that doesn't return, water that doesn't flow backwards..."\n"Come, come, sweet dreams and bitter aftertastes."
Black Screen Text: "Farewell, let us say:"\n"Old leaves, swollen fruit..."\n"Drifted dreams, fallen flowers."
Black Screen Text: "Wait, let us."\n"Season of rain returns, plants rejoice..."\n"The pomegranate sings, the apples clap."

## Talk 4

Paimon: The Yajna Grass is right here!
Aranaga: Excuse me, please. Let me say a few words, with the Yajna Grass.
Paimon: Though it's the garden of Aranaga, there is only one Yajna Grass here...
Aranaga: There were many, once. Whenever the moon rose or fell, a Yajna Grass would grow...
Aranaga: But it came, Marana. In the wake of Marana, walking Shroom-Kin came. They ate and ate. Died, many Yajna Grass, leaving just this one.
Paimon: Then what are you guys gonna do after we use the Yammering Grass to make Arahaoma?
Aranaga: It's the Yajna Grass, White Mushroom silly. But no need to worry. The important seeds are kept safe by Jamikayomars. The gate of Mawtiyima, Jamikayomars is guarding.
Paimon: Paimon sees...
Traveler: Doesn't Aranaga still need to catch up on the old times, with the Yajna Grass...?
Black Screen Text: Aranaga whispers to the plant for a while...
Aranaga: Willing to become Arahaoma, he said.
Aranaga: And... Thank you.
Aranaga: Next, let's go to Jamikayomars, together.
Paimon: Then lead the way, little bean!
Aranaga: Little bean, not! Aranaga! Floaty is mean!
Paimon: Okay, okay, Paimon is not mean!
Traveler: There's no time to lose. Let's take the Yajna Grass away.

## Talk 5

Aranaga: Over here, Jamikayomars is!
Aranaga: Nara Varuna's memory cup grows here, so the name is Jamikayomars. Jamikayomars is guarding Mawtiyima, so cannot enter, those bad guys.
Paimon: But... Where, the Marana you spoke of is?
Traveler: Yes, anything unusual, we haven't seen...
Paimon: Talking like this? Since when did you start...
Aranaga: Mawtiyima has been infiltrated by Marana. So we must infuse Arahaoma into Jamikayomars.
Aranaga: He will open the path for us, once Jamikayomars remembers it all, then we go in and rescue Mawtiyima.
Traveler: What is it, Arahaoma?
Aranaga: The essence of memory, messenger that drives away death, the elixir Arahaoma is. Carries our memories, carries our life, the elixir Arahaoma.
Aranaga: To make Arahaoma, three types of plants are required: Yajna Grass and its friends, Barsam Flower and Zohrah Mushroom.
Aranaga: Under the moonlight, with the precious memories, refine them, so that the potion can be complete.
Aranaga: After Arahaoma is offered, Jamikayomars will awaken, then our memory will flow out, flow into the forest.
Aranaga: Mawtiyima, will be saved.
Traveler: About the memory...
Aranaga: Nara language, I don't know how to use. Memory, dead, frozen, many Nara believe. Memory will be lost, many Nara believe.
Aranaga: But it is alive, flowing, not lost... It needs to be nourished.
Aranaga: There are dreams because there is memory. Memory is nourished, so there is life.
Aranaga: So, it can grow, the thing to repel Marana.
Aranaga: Oh, what's that Nara word... I'm stuck. Don't know how to say it.
Traveler: You mean courage?
Aranaga: Yes, that's right. Seeds must be sturdy to withstand Marana. Only seeds with hard shells will not let Marana penetrate their soft cores. Only seeds with thorns will prick Marana.
Aranaga: But first, we must have Arahaoma to awake Jamikayomars. And to make Arahaoma, we need the Barsam Flower and the Zohrah Mushroom.
Traveler: They have already been gathered.
Aranaga: #Nara {NICKNAME}, exactly the same as Nara Varuna... And golden too. Thank you.
Aranaga: Please come back when the moon rises over the tallest tree. The ritual to obtain Arahaoma will begin then.
Traveler: I'm guessing you mean "hope"?
Aranaga: #Yeah, right you are, Golden Nara {NICKNAME}. The thing that flows, cannot be seen, cannot be touched... Hope. Like the wind... But it never dissipates, like a dream.
Traveler: Is it... wisdom?
Aranaga: Wisdom... Flowing memory, wisdom. Stagnant wisdom, Marana's lair. So, living memory gives birth to living wisdom, and dead Marana will dissipate. Nara Varuna said... that the dead cannot defeat the living.
Traveler: Talking in this way as well, Paimon is.
Paimon: Hey! That's none of your business!

## Talk 6

Aranaga: There you are! Welcome!
Aranaga: But the moon's not there yet... Would you wait a bit?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Wow... Look, the potion is ready...
Traveler: Shh...
Paimon: Oh...!
Aranaga: Finished, we are! Is here, Arahaoma!
Aranaga: Please take good care of her. Next, we will go offer the potion to Jamikayomars.
Aranakin: Please take good care of her! Save our dream garden together, Mawtiyima's dream.
Aragaru: Yep! Aragaru wants to say the same!
Traveler: Don't disturb them.

## Talk 8

Aranaga: #This is the place, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Aranaga: Please offer Arahaoma, over here.
Traveler: (Offer Arahaoma)
Aranaga: Look! Has accepted you, Jamikayomars.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #Whoa! What's going on!? {NICKNAME}, be careful! Are you okay?
Traveler: I'm okay.
Aranaga: Okay, next... Um...
Paimon: Enter the Morty Arena! ...Right?
Traveler: It's Mawtiyima.
Paimon: How do you actually remember this name!?
Aranaga: Yes... Yes, go in. Fight Marana, together let us.
Aranaga: New life, memory nourishes. Death is just a one-time loss of memory.
Aranaga: So... our sacrifice, please witness, please keep it in your memories and dreams.
Paimon: Eh...?
Traveler: We will.
Aranaga: ...
Aranakin: Okay, don't keep Mawtiyima waiting too long! Everyone's worried...
Aragaru: Yeah! Let's go and defeat Marana together!
Traveler: Let's talk about this when we've solved the problem.
Traveler: Well, we just have to go in, right...?
Traveler: That was sudden...
Paimon: Yeah...

## Talk 10

Aranaga: You're here! Welcome!
Aranaga: Is here, the moon. Is here, the moment when the moon is high up in the sky. Are you ready?

## Talk 11

Traveler: I have other things to do.
Aranaga: Alright, but it won't wait for us, the rising and setting of the moon. So hurry there and back, please do. But... No need to rush. Here, we will wait for you.

## Talk 12

Aranakin: #Aranaga, {M#he}{F#she}'s here, they're here!
Aragaru: Yea, here, here!
Aranaga: #Here you are, Nara {NICKNAME}, White Floaty. Welcome you, the three of us.
Aranakin: Welcome!
Aragaru: The Arahaoma ritual is about to begin. What are we waiting for?
Paimon: Yeah, aren't you guys really anxious to hold the... that ritual?
Aranaga: Still wait for a little bit, we can. Grateful, we are. So... as is customary for Nara, precious gifts, we will give you.
Paimon: Uh... gifts? Precious gifts?
Aranaga: Yes, indeed. Gifts! Precious gifts!
Paimon: Oh...!
Traveler: Don't get too excited, Paimon.
Aranaga: Our gifts are the most precious. They have life. Compared to dead things, living things, are more worth protecting.
Paimon: See, Aranaga said it — the most precious gifts!
Aranaga: #Helped us, saved the forest, Nara {NICKNAME}. We are grateful, so... I give you, this.
Paimon: Eh... What is this...?
Aranaga: It's a living memory, a "remembrance," Nara calls it. Creatures that forget easily, Nara are. So must remember, use things that have life.
Aranaga: Here, Aranaga's remembrance, is this flower. Cannot blow him away, the Ad Oblivione; cannot destroy him, the device that takes away dreams.
Traveler: Ad Oblivione...?
Aranaga: Yes, the wind that flows forever, the thousand winds that return to one. But, on earth is the stream, and the ubiquitous is the wind. Everlasting, devastating.
Paimon: You've lost Paimon...
Aranaga: White Floaty silly, but silly is only for now. White Floaty will know, in future.
Aranakin: And me! Here's my flower!
Aranakin: When you leave the forest and go back to the place full of sand, please don't forget us... Like this flower.
Paimon: We won't forget. You can't forget us either!
Aranakin: ...
Paimon: What's the matter? Are you upset?
Aranakin: No, no, I'm very happy! We won't forget you all... Even if we do, you will remind us, right?
Paimon: Yeah!
Aragaru: I'll give you my flower, too! Please accept it!
Paimon: Wow, thank you!
Aragaru: I wanted to give you meaty bugs... But Aranaga said Nara don't like eating those... so I gave you a flower too!
Paimon: It's okay, flowers are great!
Aranaga: Is here, the moon. Is here, the moment when the moon is high up in the sky. Are you ready?
Traveler: The thing that takes away dreams...?
Aranaga: The living memory of nature, dream. Man-made dead thing, mechanism. Taking away living memory, grinding and crushing to extract its juice, like a grinder, for dominion and domestication... Don't like this, Aranara.
Paimon: Eh... Why?
Aranaga: Because the garden of freedom, the source of power, dreams and memories, not only for Aranara, but also for Nara. But Nara don't know. Not good action... extraction, grinding.
Aranaga: Memories and dreams are gone, reason for action is gone, strength is also gone.
Paimon: Hmmm... Paimon doesn't get it...
Traveler: Paimon, it might not be what you think...

## Talk 13

Aranaga: Thank you, Nara... Golden Nara. For all that you've done, thank you.
Aranaga: Free of the burden of Marana, Mawtiyima is. She is very happy, Mawtiyima.
Paimon: Hehe, we just happened to be passing by so we lent a hand! That Morty Arena should be thanking you guys!
Aranaga: Is that so...
Paimon: Mm... That's right. What's wrong?
Aranaga: Nothing, nothing... It's just, before we came here, the things we experienced together now seems like a fog, like clouds. Can't see them clearly... Need to remember.
Paimon: Hmm... Is it because you're too tired?
Traveler: Please rest more.
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. Let's go out together and bask in the sun more, and our heads will be clear!
Aranaga: Thanks, but... still needs our company, Mawtiyima.
Aranakin: Mm, because Mawtiyima just woke up and got a lot of stories to tell us!
Aragaru: Mawtiyima wants to share her dreams with us, so we can't leave yet...
Paimon: Paimon sees... We've just finished the important business, and Paimon hasn't got the chance to get to know you better...
Aragaru: It's okay, we will still be friends as long as we remember you.
Aranaga: As long as... still remember you, we can.
Aranakin: Yeah! As long as we remember!
Aranakin: Here is a song so you don't forget me. Please remember this...
Paimon: Okay... We got it!
Aranakin: Then... If I forget you guys, I will remember when I hear this song.
Paimon: Eh...?
Aranaga: Because... new life, memory nourishes. Death is just a loss of memory.
Aranaga: So... our sacrifice, please witness, please keep it in your memories and dreams.
Traveler: You've said this before.
Aragaru: Why do you look sad now? Please don't be sad. We're still going to play together at Festival Utsava!
Aragaru: The memories we described to you, the story we experienced, will definitely remain in dreams!
Paimon: Yeah... though Paimon can't help but feel a bit worried...
Aranaga: It's okay, Mawtiyima is used to it. The forest and the earth are used to it... In the soil, in the roots, our memories are.
Aranakin: Yes, Marana makes others forget, but we defeated it. Our memories are forever.
Paimon: But you guys haven't said if you will forget us...
Aranaga: ...
Aranaga: Still needs us, Mawtiyima. So... sorry, can't keep her waiting too long.
Aranakin: Yeah, please give us some time. Mawtiyima still needs to talk with us!
Aragaru: Remember to come play with us, Golden Nara and White Floaty!
Traveler: You guys will forget, won't you?
Traveler: Spend more time in the sun and your head will clear up.

## Talk 14

Aranaga: The essence of memories, the powers of the Kusava... Only with these can we defeat Marana.
Aranakin: Yes. Let's use the Kusava right now!
Aranaga: Kusava!
