# Missing title (1225921223)


## Talk 1

Millelith Soldier: Halt! The Chasm is an important location. No unauthorized personnel may enter!

## Talk 2

Tie Hong: Halt! The Chasm is sealed off. If you're an outsider, please... Oh, it's you!
Paimon: Oh no, run!
Traveler: Paimon, come on now.
Tie Hong: Hahaha! Sorry for scaring you. Of course I remember you. How could I forget the person who saved my life?
Tie Hong: I was only recently transferred here myself... Didn't think I'd meet you here. Guess I'm a lucky guy, eh?
Paimon: We saved you? Did we do that?
Tie Hong: Oh, come now! I was at the Jade Chamber when we fought that sea monster together. I was lightly injured and only returned to my post recently...
Tie Hong: You might not remember me, but I'll never forget you. All our comrades who fought that day witnessed what you did for Liyue.
Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about The Chasm?
Tie Hong: Two years ago, an unknown incident occurred deep within the caverns and the Qixing gave the order to close the place. The miners were largely evacuated to safety.
Tie Hong: It's just a shame that such a huge mine ceased production, just like that. The workers took their compensation and went their separate ways... Once such a gathering of people is dispersed, I fear it may be difficult to get them back together again.
Tie Hong: ...Um, sorry, got a bit off-topic there. I believe that you must be here on important business, so I won't bother you any further. If you have any questions, just ask Muning directly. He should be at the campsite at the mine entrance.
Tie Hong: Also, uh, it's not that I don't trust you or anything, but it's my job to remind you not to do anything that breaks the law!
Paimon: Don't worry, you can trust us, come on!
Traveler: You know me?
Traveler: We've been recognized! Time to scoot!

## Talk 3

Tie Hong: I apologize, but it is my duty to guard this path. If you are not here on important business, please do not remain here for too long.
