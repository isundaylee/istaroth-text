# Wishes


## Talk 1

Paimon: So what did you guys do in the Raiden Shogun's Plane of Euthymia anyway?
Paimon: Is the Vision Hunt Decree abolished?
Traveler: It was all thanks to Yae Miko.
Paimon: Oh, gotcha... Paimon was super worried, y'know.
Paimon: So maybe the reason Yae Miko is looking for us now is 'cause she wants to thank us? Let's go find her.
Traveler: We conveyed the wishes of the people.

## Talk 2

Yae Miko: Why hello... if it isn't the triumphant Traveler. And why might you be visiting the Shrine? A sign of piety, perhaps?
Paimon: You literally told us to come meet you here!
Yae Miko: Haha... I was just joking. I've been waiting for you.
Paimon: Seems like someone's in a pretty good mood.
Yae Miko: Mm-hmm. Catching up with an old friend I hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.
Yae Miko: By the way... I heard that you had a duel before the throne, with a Fatui Harbinger no less. Courageous and astute — I must say, I am most impressed.
Traveler: It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
Yae Miko: Defeating Signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
Yae Miko: Still, you did end up victorious. I gather congratulations are in order.
Paimon: Ah, it sure feels good to finally thwart a Fatui plan for once.
Paimon: They caused plenty of trouble along the way, but at the very least, they didn't get their hands on another Gnosis!
Yae Miko: Wait a second... did you say "Gnosis"?
Yae Miko: As in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
Paimon: Yep, that's the one! You've seen one, too? Gnoses belong to The Seven — they're what keep them connected to Celestia!
Yae Miko: Oh...
Paimon: What's wrong?
Yae Miko: I handed that over.
Traveler: Hmm?
Paimon: ...You did what now?
Yae Miko: Well... how else was I supposed to save your skin from The Balladeer, exactly?
Traveler: ...
Yae Miko: The Balladeer is No. 6 of the Fatui Harbingers. In terms of strength, he is superior to Signora.
Yae Miko: I'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
Paimon: *stammers* For once, Paimon just does not know what to say.
Traveler: But why was the Gnosis in your hands?
Yae Miko: After Ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
Yae Miko: As her erstwhile closest friend... Ei handed it over to me, and I've kept it in the Grand Narukami Shrine ever since.
Yae Miko: She no longer needs the power of the Gnosis, and in any case, she tells me she has severed ties with Celestia.
Yae Miko: Thus, the Gnosis became not only useless, but also a potential source of conflict.
Yae Miko: Is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
Yae Miko: Judging by the results, at least, I daresay I struck a good deal. Hehehe.
Paimon: When you put it like that, Paimon has to agree... The Traveler is worth more than a Gnosis...
Traveler: No wonder we haven't seen The Balladeer since.
Paimon: *sigh* Well, what's done is done, and Paimon hardly thinks we'll be getting it back now. Let's leave the past in the past.
Paimon: Um, so anyway, you still haven't told us why you called us here today.
Yae Miko: Hehehe. It's to thank you.
Paimon: Really!?
Yae Miko: You intend to travel all over Teyvat, and the time has come for the Inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
Yae Miko: As a mark of my gratitude, I will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
Yae Miko: What would you like to know about?
Traveler: About the Shogun puppet...
Yae Miko: That puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. Perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins...
Yae Miko: Still... there is one other thing on this topic that I suspect you may be curious to know.
Yae Miko: Before Ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet...
Paimon: So... you mean there are three Raiden Shoguns!?
Yae Miko: No, the prototype was merely a proof of concept. Its appearance and intellect were not based on Ei. It was a test.
Yae Miko: The original plan was for Ei to simply discard it. But perhaps Ei thought this to be too cruel, because in the end she chose only to seal the power within it.
Yae Miko: Later, this puppet wandered Inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until... the Fatui took an interest in him.
Paimon: Ugh, not the Fatui!
Yae Miko: Some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the Fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
Traveler: Surely you don't mean...
Yae Miko: Mm-hmm. The object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the Gnosis... and the prototype puppet is now known as "The Balladeer."
Paimon: What in the... What a crazy story!
Yae Miko: It is, isn't it? Who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
Traveler: About the former Raiden Shogun...
Yae Miko: I'm surprised an outlander like you is aware that there was once a change of Electro Archon... Few citizens of Inazuma are aware of this.
Paimon: Morax told us. He said that the Electro Archon, Baal, has passed away...
Yae Miko: Yes. The truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, Baal and Beelzebul.
Paimon: ...Twin gods?
Yae Miko: They won the Archon War together, and when Baal established the Shogunate, Beelzebul became her Kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." In other words, she acted as Baal's body double.
Yae Miko: Beelzebul is Ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. Baal's name was "Makoto."
Yae Miko: As far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. They complemented each other, and they ruled Inazuma jointly. So there was no need for the public to know the truth.
Yae Miko: In fact, the name "Baal" and the title of Raiden Shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up until—
Paimon: Until what?
Yae Miko: Makoto died several hundred years ago in a war that I was not personally involved in. Since then, Ei has assumed the Shogunate.
Paimon: Losing her sister must have been super hard on Ei...
Traveler: Several hundred years ago...
Yae Miko: That was when Ei began to change. Makoto was her greatest loss.
Paimon: Paimon feels like she understands Ei a lot better now after finding that out... So, what kind of god was Makoto?
Yae Miko: I didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was... she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: #About my {F#brother}{M#sister}...
Yae Miko: Sorry, I haven't a clue. I am also unfamiliar with the god you describe.
Yae Miko: But if you still have doubts about Ei, I would say they are misplaced.
Yae Miko: Not only does she not fit your description, but she voluntarily gave up her Gnosis long ago, severing her ties with Celestia in the process.
Traveler: Having met her, I don't believe she was the one.
Yae Miko: That's good to hear. Otherwise, given that I am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
Paimon: Don't worry, we aren't looking to pick a fight with you!
Yae Miko: Hehehe... I wish you the best of luck. May you soon discover the truth behind it all.
Yae Miko: #As for your {M#sister}{F#brother}'s whereabouts, I will use all the resources at my disposal to investigate it, and I will also borrow some of Ayato's people from the Shuumatsuban.
Yae Miko: I'll let you know if I find out anything. Consider it part of my means of thanking you.
Traveler: About the next stop on my journey...
Yae Miko: After leaving Inazuma, hmm... I think it would be easiest for you to go to Sumeru.
Paimon: Ooh, ooh, Sumeru! We've run into loads of scholars from there on our journey so far.
Yae Miko: Yes, well, Sumeru is the land of the God of Wisdom, where the quest for wisdom and knowledge is never-ending.
Yae Miko: But their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. For example...
Yae Miko: In Sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
Paimon: Knowledge... is a resource?
Yae Miko: Yes. I don't know whether it was the sages or Lesser Lord Kusanali who came up with the idea.
Paimon: Lesser Lord Kusanali? That's a cute name.
Yae Miko: Oh, you haven't heard? "Lesser Lord Kusanali" is the deity in whom the people of Sumeru place their faith. It's their chosen term of endearment for her.
Yae Miko: I'm sure you must have some things to discuss with her, too. I wish you all the best.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Yae Miko: Are you sure? Okay then. Oh, Traveler, do you still have the omamori I gave you?
Traveler: Of course. I'll keep it in a safe place.
Yae Miko: Keep it safe? Is that all you intend to do with it?
Yae Miko: There was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than Yae Miko, the wise and beautiful.
Paimon: Who in their right mind would do that!?
Yae Miko: Hehehe... Okay, I'll stop. Now, a question for you. Traveler, what is your ambition?
Traveler: #To be reunited with my {F#brother}{M#sister}, I guess?
Yae Miko: I see... But that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
Yae Miko: Your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. Something that shines in unison with fate itself.
Yae Miko: Perhaps the reason you do not possess a Vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you... It's a possibility.
Yae Miko: Continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
Traveler: Khaenri'ah...
Traveler: Never knew I could fetch such a high price.
Traveler: The Gnosis is long gone, then.
Traveler: I don't know what came over me.
