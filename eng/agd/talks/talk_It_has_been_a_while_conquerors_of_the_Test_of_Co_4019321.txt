# Talk Dialog

Hitomi: #It has been a while, conquerors of the Test of Courage — or should I call you "Traveler and Paimon"?
Paimon: Ah, you're that... Shrine Maiden from the Test of Courage! The one who likes saying all sorts of weird stuff! So what brings you to the Yae Publishing House's stall?
Hitomi: Hehe... O'er the land, a darkness falls, and only those our Guuji call, may search the waves of blackest night, and find within a thread of light...
Traveler: Can I request a translation?
Hitomi: Heh. Our Lady Guuji said that a brave — and relatively idle — shrine maiden was needed to guard this place, so I volunteered.
Paimon: Heh. Guess your "boldness" does mean that you fit the bill! You did experience that Test with us, after all.
Hitomi: And more importantly, my hands have indeed been quite idle since then.
Traveler: Miko sent you here again, didn't she?
