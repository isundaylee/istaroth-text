Glory: I don't recognize that voice... Are you a traveler from afar?
Glory: Though I can't see, I'm always here to listen if there's anything you need.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Glory: Sorry, where are my manners! Allow me to introduce myself — I'm Glory.
Glory: I come here often, waiting for Godwin to come back... I pray he manages to avoid those rotten hilichurls and the Abyss Order on the way... so he can come back and be with me soon.
Glory: Ah, I'm rambling again... Sorry, it's just so nice having someone to talk to.
Traveler: Who is Godwin?
Glory: He's the man I love. He's with the Knights, and he's away with Grand Master Varka's expedition.
Glory: It was hard to let him go, but I was so proud of him managing to join Varka's expedition party.
Glory: ...Sadly, I don't know when the expedition is supposed to end. All I can do is wait here for him.
Traveler: Tell me more about the hilichurls and the Abyss Order.
Glory: You must find them a nuisance too? All they do is go round causing mischief.
Glory: I heard that most of the hilichurls suddenly appeared in Teyvat out of nowhere several hundred years ago... And the same for the Abyss Order, actually.
Glory: Some said they were borne of some great catastrophe that descended on Teyvat... But I think they probably came from outer space!
Glory: ...Sorry, because I can't see, my imagination sometimes runs a bit wild. Just ignore it.

## Talk

Traveler: It must be difficult not being able to see.
Glory: Yes... Especially at the beginning, it was hard to adjust.
Glory: But when you can't see, your sense of hearing becomes stronger. Now, when the wind brushes past my ears, I can almost picture certain things in my mind's eye...
Glory: And since putting my faith in Lord Barbatos, I sometimes hear the whisper of a soothing voice carried on the wind.
Glory: My mother — or "Sister Grace" to everyone else — always tells me that Mondstadt is looked after by the Anemo Archon. I think she's right, you know.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Glory: Bye-bye.
Glory: Hope you enjoy your stay in Mondstadt.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Glory: I obviously couldn't see what happened in Mondstadt when Stormterror attacked, so I only know what other people have told me.
Glory: People's voices were full of fear during that time, but recently the sounds of anguish have finally died down.
Glory: Mondstadt's wind, too, has finally calmed down again.
