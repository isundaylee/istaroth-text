Traveler: Has it ever worked?
Shouta: Hmm... It works about once in a dozen times... Last time, I wished bad luck upon someone who bullied me, and then he flunked his exam, haha!
Shouta: ...What? You don't believe me? Why do you look so skeptical?
Shouta: The archon is real. I won't allow you to doubt that! After all, wishes don't come true if your heart isn't earnest...
Shouta: Those bad guys who laughed at me for having my snacks stolen won't be blessed, I know it. Their teacher will never get diarrhea. When they borrow comic books, they'll always be missing the next volume!
