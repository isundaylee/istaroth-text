# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
Yusuf: This isn't pride talking. It is a fact.
Yusuf: At such a young age, I am already so capable! I can support myself!
Yusuf: I work for Ms. Sulaykha. I do the daily registration every day, and get my pay at the end of the day.
Yusuf: If I keep doing this, I'll get paid for life, and I can eat Uncle Lambad's fish rolls every day.
