## Talk

Innam: It's so boring to be a guard... And I can't change shifts now...
Innam: Hello, would you like to talk?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure, what about?
Innam: Do you think luck is something you're born with?
Innam: Dehya joined the Eremites after me, but got better assignments.
Innam: She's working as a bodyguard for a rich girl. Great environment with high pay.
Innam: Me, I just make the rounds here every day and have to deal with disputes between Eremite groups.
Innam: Life in the Eremites isn't as exciting as people might think.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Innam: *sigh* Guess I'll keep working this boring job...

## Talk

Traveler: You can't change shifts?
Innam: Yeah, at first, we mercenaries who worked at the docks could change shifts as we liked. Bad mood? Well, we could just change shifts and go for a drink.
Innam: But now the Inspector won't allow it...

## Talk

Traveler: Why is that?
Innam: A few days ago, a young man who'd not been here long asked Matari to change shifts, and happened upon a sea monster warning.
Innam: After the warning was withdrawn, the Inspector came to look into the situation at the harbor and questioned the young man. The poor lad could not answer.
Innam: The Inspector checked the roster again, and found out there was a shift change. Now she's been paying extra attention to this matter and no one dares to break her rules.
Innam: *sigh* I just want to finish work early and go to the bar for drinks.
