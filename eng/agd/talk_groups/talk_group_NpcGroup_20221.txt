Hanachirusato: That was well done — whether it was dealing with Ioroi's illusory tricks, or the way you defeated those demons.
Paimon: "Eek!"
Paimon: Or so Paimon might have said, but this trick of yours is getting real old, Miss Masked Maiden.
Hanachirusato: Ah, so I disappointed you, then? I apologize. I'll do better next time.
Traveler: There's no need to "do better" at trivial things like this...
Hanachirusato: That is true. So, as for Ioroi... Is he doing well?
Traveler: He's very spry, alright...
Paimon: Even though he's been turned into stone.
Hanachirusato: I see...
Hanachirusato: Usually, when bake-danuki make a mess, we won't send anyone to deal with them as long as they don't cross the line. After all, although they are mischievous, they're kind-hearted and simple, just like children.
Hanachirusato: But when Ioroi dared to steal the ward for the Cleansing Ritual, well, that was enough to get him punished. Since the "Yougou Three" were mentioned in your story, then it was probably Kamuna... an onmyouji from a past age, who did the deed.
Traveler: He also mentioned a "sneaky kitsune"...
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden, are you Ioroi's kitsune friend?
Hanachirusato: ...That's quite the compliment. He was actually talking about the daughter of the Hakushin bloodline, also known as the "Kitsune Saiguu." She was worshiped as the kitsune goddess in many places long ago.
Hanachirusato: The Sky Kitsune and Earth Kitsune were once her emissaries. After she left, they all turned into stone statues to preserve their power and await her return — and when she does, they will all walk the Byakko Plain together once more.
Hanachirusato: Following her departure, the bloodline and mystical might of the kitsune on Narukami Island today have dwindled to less than one tenth of what they used to be...
Traveler: Ioroi said "Our contest isn't over yet!"
Hanachirusato: Oh, that. This is what happened. Did you know that Ioroi's full name is "Ioroi, the Hidden Protector of the Grove"?
Hanachirusato: Ioroi may be dull and impish, but he is also kind and loyal. That's why the Kitsune Saiguu aimed to guide him to the right path a long time ago.
Hanachirusato: In order to make sure that he would comply with the Electro Archon's rule, the Kitsune Saiguu set the two of them up and got Ioroi appointed as the Protector of the Grove. This made him responsible for the safety of the Chinju Forest.
Hanachirusato: That's why, when the world became pitch black, the Kitsune Saiguu was worried that Ioroi might die while fighting against this inexorable evil in his capacity as protector of the forest.
Hanachirusato: So she used a game of Hide-and-Seek, something the bake-danuki are good at, as a way to challenge him...
Hanachirusato: "Ioroi, whatever happens... they're all my magical tricks. Don't fall for them and don't show up," she said.
Hanachirusato: "Of course, you sneaky kitsune. I will definitely defeat you this time," said Ioroi. And that's how their endless contest began.
Paimon: ...So Ioroi is still waiting for her to come back and find him?
Hanachirusato: Based on what you said about Ioroi, that appears to be the case...
Hanachirusato: But after a while, Ioroi sensed that something was wrong and started wreaking havoc. He even stole the ward in an attempt to lure the Kitsune Saiguu out.
Hanachirusato: He didn't realize that it was something required for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. He just thought that it was a comb of some importance to the Kitsune Saiguu. Later on, Kamuna sealed him into stone due to that misstep.
Traveler: What about the Kitsune Saiguu, then?
Hanachirusato: ...She was swallowed up by the darkness. In the end, after that darkness was defeated, she returned to the great land of Narukami along with the soil.
Traveler: And who are you then?
Hanachirusato: Me? As you can see, I am just "Hanachirusato." A shrine maiden who wants to borrow your strength to destroy these evils.
Traveler: That wasn't my question...
Paimon: Miss Masked... Hanachirusato, it's really strange that you know so many things about the past that most people don't.
Paimon: You even know how to use bake-danuki magic and cook tanuki dishes.
Traveler: But you don't know much about the present.
Paimon: It's almost like you're someone from a few centuries ago...
Hanachirusato: ...
Paimon: We also saw someone who looked like you in some memories. She even had the same name as you...
Traveler: So...
Paimon: You must be just like Ioroi, a bake-danuki who was sealed several centuries ago!
Hanachirusato: N—No, that's not who I...
Hanachirusato: I...
Hanachirusato: I inherited her memories. As for other things, please forgive me. I cannot speak of them yet.
Hanachirusato: I made you a promise, back there in the cave. So when the time comes, I will reveal everything.
Paimon: #What do we do, Traveler?
Traveler: I believe her.
Paimon: Okay, if you say so, Paimon will have some faith in Miss Masked Maiden too!
Hanachirusato: Thank you for your understanding.
Hanachirusato: Now, we must part here for the time being.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanachirusato: "We part in body alone, for our hearts drift with the clouds."
Hanachirusato: I will pray for your success beneath the well in Konda Village. I shall be next to the Thunder Sakura root that you cleansed successfully.
Hanachirusato: When the tree roots at all five places have been cleansed, please look for me there.
Traveler: Let's leave it at that.
Traveler: Your kitsune mask...
Traveler: He was turned into stone...
Paimon: But he's very well!
