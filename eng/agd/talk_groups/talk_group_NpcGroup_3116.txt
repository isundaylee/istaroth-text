Moriguchi: Hmph, if it hadn't been for the Shogunate, I would have been able to reunite with my wife...

## Talk

Traveler: What happened to your wife?
Moriguchi: My wife is on Watatsumi Island. I have to serve here because of the war, so we've been separated.
Moriguchi: The Vision Hunt Decree has not only hurt people with Visions, but also the commoners like us. Damn this stupid law.
Moriguchi: I just feel like I've spent too long on the battlefield. I've almost forgotten what the blissful life we had as a couple was like...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Moriguchi: See you. Ugh, I really want to go home.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything more to say about Watatsumi Island?
Moriguchi: If you've only been here for a short while, don't be misled into thinking that every island of Inazuma is as run-down as this dump.
Moriguchi: My homeland, Watatsumi Island, could not be more different from this place in terms of scenery.
Moriguchi: Watatsumi Island has many highlands with numerous waterfalls, with Sangonomiya in their center. And Sangonomiya itself is a most beautiful place. Not only are there gigantic corals, but also vegetation with colors totally different from those you'd see anywhere else...
Moriguchi: Back in the day, I would always run up the highlands to admire Sangonomiya. I even met my wife there when she was harvesting flowers. Hahaha!
Moriguchi: *sigh* The more I talk about it, the more I miss her so dearly...

## Talk

Moriguchi: Haha, have you heard? The Vision Hunt Decree's been abolished! The Shogunate's had to eat some humble pie and no mistake!
Moriguchi: Once the dust settles, I can return home to my wife at last!

Moriguchi: The Vision Hunt Decree has not only hurt people with Visions, but also the commoners like us. This law... It could burn in a fire, for all I care.
Moriguchi: But it's all over now! Isn't that wonderful?
Moriguchi: Once I return home to my wife, I'll tell her this good news for sure...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Tatarigami...
Moriguchi: *sigh* As a resident of Watatsumi Island, it pains me to say this, but it was our comrades who undertook that action.
Moriguchi: Wars really do cause people who fight in them to stop being themselves.
Moriguchi: As a soldier, I can understand what they did. But as a husband and a father, such deeds are unforgivable, even if they were perpetrated by my comrades.
Moriguchi: Her Excellency the Divine Priestess has imposed strict military orders to prevent any such things from happening again.
Moriguchi: Regardless, this is a lesson to both sides of this conflict.
