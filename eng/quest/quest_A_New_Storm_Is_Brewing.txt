# A New Storm Is Brewing


## Talk 1

Vind: *sigh* How am I going to get past...
Vind: Oh, hello... Is something wrong?
Traveler: What are you doing?
Vind: I'm trying to get to the watchtower at Stormbearer Point — I want to see if there is a storm brewing out at sea or not.
Vind: But there's a group of monsters blocking the way up ahead. I don't know how to get past.
Vind: Don't worry, I'm not about to ask you to go to the watchtower for me!
Vind: It is my duty, and I must see it fulfilled no matter what it takes.
Vind: You probably have things to do. Go on, don't worry about me, I'll figure it out.

## Talk 2

Vind: Is something the matter?
Traveler: The monsters are gone now.
Vind: Really! Thanks be to the Anemo Archon...
Vind: I mean— Sorry, I take that back. You are the one I should be thanking!
Vind: How can I repay you? Oh! I've got it...
Vind: Come and find me at the top of the watchtower. I'll wait for you.

## Talk 3

Vind: Hmm... maybe if I run fast enough I can get all the way to the top without getting hurt...

## Talk 4

Vind: Mmm... Calm seas and no wind again today.
Vind: Generations of my family have kept watch here on behalf of Mondstadt, looking for any signs of an oncoming storm. It was Lady Vennessa who first entrusted us with this task.
Vind: Since Lord Barbatos began protecting Mondstadt, we have not seen a single storm, and the watchtowers have slowly fallen into disrepair.
Vind: Even so, I still cannot bring myself to stop coming here to this watchtower.
Traveler: You're really dedicated.
Vind: Thank you. But, on the subject of my duty...
Vind: ...I would prefer never to have to fulfill it.
Vind: Anyway. Thank you for your help. These Windwheel Asters are for you.
Vind: In the past, my family would look at how well the Windwheel Aster grows in an area to determine how strong the wind was there.
Vind: The Windwheel Aster can grow neither in places with no wind, nor anywhere that is plagued by strong storms.
Vind: It can only flourish in places like Mondstadt, where the wind is gentle and nourishing.
Vind: Let's hope they continue to prosper here forever.
Traveler: Quite the sob story...
Vind: Yes. I hope that part of history is one that never repeats itself.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: She talks like she's got this one covered, but boy there are a lot of monsters...
Paimon: Come on, let's clear out the area for Ms. Vind shall we?
Paimon: Look at her... She's seriously thinking of just making an almighty run for it...
Traveler: Okay, let's do this.
Paimon: People of such good character deserve a bit of help, if you ask Paimon.
Traveler: I've never seen such dedication in all my life...
Paimon: That would be the worst thing that could happen.
Paimon: Let's not let it happen that way. Come on, get rid of these monsters.
