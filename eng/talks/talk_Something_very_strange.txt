Traveler: Something very strange?
Shizhuang the Strong: ...I didn't see it with my own eyes. But I'm told the ones who did have been in a coma ever since.
Shizhuang the Strong: Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
Shizhuang the Strong: Now I've actually heard that a small portion of The Chasm has been reopened, and that some of our comrades have returned to work. But I'm not too sure about the details...
Shizhuang the Strong: But there's no point thinking about all this either way. It's better to be patient and wait for further news.
