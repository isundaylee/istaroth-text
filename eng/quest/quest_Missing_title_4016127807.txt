# Missing title (4016127807)


## Talk 1

Una: Kito, Kina, you're back...?
Una: Really now, you should stop running around all the time. These old legs can't keep up with the two of you! And what would we do if the two of you got into any trouble, hmm?
Traveler: Hello there...
Una: What? Come now, how could you children say that to an old lady? You'll break my heart...
Una: Well, since you're here, don't go running off for now, alright? Keep Granny company for a bit.
Traveler: Look, sorry, but I...
Una: Now, where was I with that story I was telling? Ah, yes, yes... This was when your grandfather's grandfather was still young...
Una: Beyond the Sea of Fog, on an island of the outsiders, there lived the Sumari Clan. They say that the Matriarch of this clan was a woman with the appearance of a fox...
Una: They say that flowers the color of thunder grew on this land, and the Sumari people built houses and lived in harmony there amidst the mountains and the plains...
Una: And then... Phew... Their flowers... Hah... *snore*
Una: *snoring* Outside the Sea of Fog, yes...
Traveler: Uh, Granny? Are you okay?
Una: Eh? Kito, Kina? Oh. You're leaving? *sigh* Ooh, I'm sorry, I must have fallen asleep by myself again.
Una: Don't forget these before you go... Granny's been keeping them for you this whole time: flowers from the far side of the Sea of Fog. Don't lose them, now.
Traveler: (Best not to disturb her...)
Traveler: Alright...
Traveler: You might have gotten the wrong person...

## Talk 2

Una: Kito and Kina... They are still here on this island, aren't they?
Una: Ah, those kids... How they worry me...

## Talk 3

Una: Alright then, alright. Guess Granny needs a little nap now... *snoring*
Una: You two be careful now... Don't run off too far... *snoring*

## Talk 4

Una: Ah, you're here. Kito! Kina! Come on now, greet our guest!
Una: ...Oh, where have they gone off to... I'm very sorry about this.
Una: Hmm, actually, what was your name again?
Traveler: #{NICKNAME}. Pleased to meet you.
Una: *sigh* I... I'm soon to depart, aren't I?
Traveler: "Depart"?
Una: The boatman has come to see me quite often lately.
Una: He comes quietly each time, wearing his golden fur clothes, his long gold pants, with a crown of gold silk on his head...
Una: Just like my mother told me, and just like I told Kito and Kina... He comes to take us aboard his silver boat, aboard his boat he'll take us...
Una: The boat will sail and sail, across a glittering river, into the land of dreams. There, there shall be no fog, and there shall be a great golden hall, with seventy cradles, and seventy more again... They will rock back and forth, back and forth...
Una: There we will sleep and become motes of light... And we shall become the dreams of this world's children...
Traveler: Whoa...
Una: The boatman said that he'd brought these to me from Kito and Kina. Ah, those two children...
Una: It is not time, ya-hey, ya-ho... The time has not yet come...
Traveler: So what you mean is...
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}, of course.

## Talk 5

Una: *sigh* It's all getting less and less clear now... Everything's getting foggier and foggier...
Traveler: Uh, hello?
Una: *sigh* My memory's growing worse by the day. I suppose that's getting old for you...
Una: But what shall I do? I don't know if Kito and Kina are hungry, or whether they're safe as they play outside...
Traveler: They'll be fine.
Una: Oh, Kito, Kina! You're here! Did you fall down or bump into anything on the way? You didn't go climbing up some trees again, now, did you?
Una: Ah, how you worry your old Granny! *sigh* I don't know what's happened lately, but it feels like there's fewer and fewer people on this island every day...
Una: And I remember even less of them now, too...
Una: *sigh* Whatever would I do if I ever forgot the two of you...
Traveler: ...
Una: *sigh* Here. Take these flower petals. If Granny should ever forget you, give me these...
Una: Ah, all the stories I still want to tell you...
Traveler: Is there anything we can do to help?
Traveler: Has something happened?

## Talk 6

Una: *sigh* Those children...
Traveler: This is from Kito and Kina.

## Talk 7

Una: But not now. Go on, go on and play. Granny will still be here.
Una: Petals, hey, petals, ho, where is the homeland where you grow?

## Talk 8

Una: I'm sorry, but I cannot come onboard yet...
Una: Those I love have yet to board...

## Talk 9

Una: Ah, is that Abe? How do the mushrooms in your home fare? Haha... Don't you go bothering the priest again. I won't agree no matter how many times he asks!
Una: Haha! I mean, I'm sorry, but I have my hands full taking care of the house on my own. Most sorry, hehe...
Una: Sorry... *sigh* I'm sorry...
Traveler: Hello there, Granny.
Una: Ah! You! You... Come on, get in here, before you embarrass us!
Traveler: Eh?
Una: How did the fishing go? Nothing, you say... Oh, never mind, never mind. Our garden produce should be enough. Well, not for the Great Thunderbird's offering, but... Eh? What is it?
Una: What in the world are you saying!? The ceremony this year went well! The year to come will surely go well. The priest even said that we'd have a healthy child...
Una: Why are you talking about this now!? Have you forgotten what happened to the Kama Clan?
Traveler: Hey, hey, calm down for a second!
Una: If you want to forsake the Great Thunderbird and be swallowed by the raging waves, be my guest!
Una: My baby... Oh, my poor baby... *sigh*
Traveler: "Kama"...?
Traveler: What...
Traveler: Are you feeling alright?

## Talk 10

Una: ...Did you say that he was holding onto... these?
Una: What... What were you thinking... What in the world were you thinking?

## Talk 11

Una: Oh. Oh, hello, hello...
Una: I'm most sorry, but my mind's getting less clear the older I get. Could I ask who you are again? Have we ever met?
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}.
Una: I've never heard such a name before. Did you come from the outside?
Una: That's awfully strange. You shouldn't have been able to come ashore without the Great Thunderbird's leave...
Traveler: The Thunderbird's long gone...
Una: *sigh* Looking at you reminds me of that poor husband of mine. I don't even remember his face now...
Una: We were still young back then, our minds full of all sorts of wild fantasies... But some people don't grow up at all. Not even after you've spent so long with them...
Una: He left me, built himself a wooden raft, and tried to sail across the sea to where the outsiders live. He said he wanted to hunt freely there and pick flowers he'd never seen before... Beautiful flowers...
Una: He'd been saying this since we were young... But he never grew up.
Una: Later, the priest's child found him... He was lying there on the beach, silent as the shells, whiter than the sands... and he was clutching these flowers in his hand...
Una: The priest then wept, saying that our ancestors' boat had rejected him. That his soul shall only roam the outsiders' lands from now on...
Una: Back then, I had only just given birth to our child... How was I to tell him this?
Traveler: ...
Una: Later, my child had children also, and I sent my child aboard the silver boat, all while I remain here in this land...
Una: As for any attachments and worries... I suppose they must just be Kito and Kina...
Traveler: This might take some explaining...
Traveler: #Just call me {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 12

Una: Ah, this scent... This is Kito's sachet, is it not?
Una: This can only mean that they've gotten tired of playing and are leaving now, yes?
Traveler: I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but... "yes," I guess.
Una: Thank you, outsider... Farewell.
Una: The cypresses silver, the river of dreams... Take me there, dear boatman...
