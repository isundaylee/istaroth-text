Traveler: Tell me about your store...
Mikoshi Genichirou: You mean where the name of this store came from?
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, I see you're not from Inazuma.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Netsuke is a kind of small craftwork that the Inazumans carry with them as pendants. Generally, they are carved into different shapes based on the owner's preference.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Take this one for instance. If you cross the rope from the inner side of the belt and then hang a coin pouch, seal or stamp on it, the netsuke will be stuck onto the belt. Convenient, eh?
Mikoshi Genichirou: As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.
