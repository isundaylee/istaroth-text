Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Mona: Hmm, I want to reserve some of your spare time. Let's go on a vacation together.
Traveler: A... A vacation?
Mona: Maybe on an uninhabited island or in a quiet rainforest, just somewhere we can put work aside and relax for a bit.
Traveler: This doesn't sound like you...
Mona: Is that so...? Hey, you don't just think of me as some research-obsessed maniac with a one-track mind, do you?
Mona: Everything I do is to comprehend the truths of the world... Even a vacation is a way to meet this end.
Mona: I started preparing for this a long time ago.
Mona: Saving money can be difficult, so I specially prepared a savings jar. Every time I received a payment, I put aside some of it.
Mona: During this time, I also resisted buying hardcover copies of research manuscripts... Eventually, I had saved up enough.
Traveler: That must've been hard...
Mona: Hehe, it's alright, it was worth it!
Mona: Okay! I'll await your word.
Traveler: I can't use your money.
Mona: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Mona: Thanks for being considerate, but this is something I want to do, so it really is fine.
Traveler: Then I'll go set aside some time.
Traveler: Do you have funds for this...?
Mona: Hehe, I've already prepared them, of course.
