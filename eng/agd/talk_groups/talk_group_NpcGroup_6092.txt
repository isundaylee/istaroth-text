Traveler: Good day.
Pacal: Hello. I am the Chief of the Children of Echoes.
Pacal: Hmm... I call myself the chief, but really, I much prefer looking after and supporting everyone than managing the details of their lives.

Traveler: We meet again.
Pacal: Hello there, my friend. How have you been doing lately? Has everything been going well?
Pacal: Any friend of Kachina's is a friend of our tribe. You will always be welcome here.
Pacal: Of course, you're always welcome to visit the other tribes, too. It's always fun to go for a swim at the People of the Springs, or go for a hot air balloon ride with the Flower-Feather Clan.

Traveler: About fighting the Abyss...
Pacal: The credit for our previous victory against the Abyss belongs to every single person of Natlan. It was a great victory, yet undeniably a temporary one.
Pacal: The Pyro Archon has visited several times after the war, inquiring about our casualties and providing strong support for our reconstruction efforts.
Pacal: However, she also emphasized that the Abyss has not yet been defeated once and for all, so we must stay vigilant.
Pacal: Thank you too, for your care and contributions. I believe that as long as we all stay united, we will surely be able to persevere until victory is ours.

Traveler: So, about that stomach story...
Pacal: Well... It's kind of a long story...
Pacal: Basically, I was also once a dashing young man who dreamed of earning the Wayob's acknowledgment and recognition.
Pacal: And once I realized that an Ancient Name would be forever beyond my reach, food became my main way of coping with stress.
Pacal: But I've made my peace with the matter of Ancient Names. Even if I can't fight, there are still other things that I can do to support everyone.
Pacal: You know what our mantra says: no one fights alone. My determination is just like my weight — they are both here to stay.
