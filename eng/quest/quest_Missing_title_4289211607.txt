# Missing title (4289211607)


## Talk 1

Traveler: About catching monsters instead of fish...
Delaroche: Oh! Now that I come to think of it... it was quite a unique experience that my own bait attracted monsters instead of fish!
Delaroche: Though I'm not really scared of monsters. I used to commute alone between the Fontaine Research Institute and Court of Fontaine, so I often fought against bandits along the way. I won most of the time too...
Delaroche: However, I am now a director of the Fishing Association, so I must behave like one.
Delaroche: If I scare off the fish or cause any trouble to the people fishing nearby, I would see it as failing to meet people's expectations for a director either way.
Delaroche: That's why I must proceed with self-constraint and caution!

## Talk 2

Delaroche's Notes: (This seems to be a record of the recipe Delaroche used to make bait...)
Traveler: Read.
Delaroche's Notes: My 634th day as director — 75th attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
Delaroche's Notes: My attempts to analyze the bait samples failed. The highly-adept alchemical process meant that the various raw materials were untraceable, and thus I was forced to combine them by myself.
Delaroche's Notes: I combined the flesh of Cider-Lake-irrigated Sunsettias imported from Mondstadt along with Slime Condensate, using a standard amount for each serving...
Delaroche's Notes: The results are not promising. The fish did not react at all — and this, when they're liable to flee whenever things drop into the water!
Delaroche's Notes: The Sunsettias that that traveling merchant sells are incredibly expensive. That's two days' worth of food money gone down the drain — best not to buy from him in the future...
Delaroche's Notes: ...
Delaroche's Notes: My 635th day as director — 81st attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
Delaroche's Notes: Further analysis has proved futile, and thus I press on with my own formulation.
Delaroche's Notes: I combined Sakura petals imported from Inazuma, preserved perfectly in ice blocks, with broken-up Fish, in the hopes that this would attract some vicious, carnivorous fish...
Delaroche's Notes: But the Linebreakers seemed uninterested, ignoring my provocations...
Delaroche's Notes: Come on! At least swing your tail my way and tell me you saw what I did!
Delaroche's Notes: ...
Delaroche's Notes: My 636th day as director — 90th attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
Delaroche's Notes: The researchers all suggest that I give up analyzing the bait samples or commission a professional alchemist to do the job... But I don't know anyone who could do that... So I continue the formulation process on my own.
Delaroche's Notes: This time, I used powdered dried Harra Fruit imported from Sumeru and combined it with Bulle Fruit juice from the latest season. I steamed the mixture over and over, concentrating it as much as I could!
Delaroche's Notes: This was the... strongest combination of aromas I could possibly have thought of!
Delaroche's Notes: If I were to make a comparison... It would be like setting up a big pot in front of someone's house and stewing fish-and-radish paste that has been fermented for five years! Why, any sensible neighbor would have rushed out of doors to beat me senseless!
Delaroche's Notes: Yet these Linebreakers seem to have lost all sense of smell. They did not react at all.
Delaroche's Notes: Is my declaration of war simply too weak for them? In that case, I must seek out a curio merchant... I shall obtain the most flavorful items in the world, and I shall have a showdown with those fish — a battle to end all battles!
Traveler: Leave.
