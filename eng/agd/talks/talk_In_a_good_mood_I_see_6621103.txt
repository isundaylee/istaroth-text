Traveler: In a good mood, I see?
Tepano: You bet.
Tepano: As long as there aren't any large-scale Abyssal assaults like that one before, patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind might just be the easiest thing there is.
Tepano: Now that assault was tough... Thank goodness a whole bunch of friends from outside came to help out.
Tepano: But usually, the people in our tribe are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.
Tepano: And the few not-very-intimidating monsters that there are in the area can be easily beaten using pre-prepared Phlogiston Engravings.
Tepano: The main thing I've gotta do is keep reckless outsiders from disturbing the Iktomisaurs. Get on their bad side and their tempers are no joke, I'll tell you that.
