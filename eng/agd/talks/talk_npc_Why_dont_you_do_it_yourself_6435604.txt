Traveler: Why don't you do it yourself?
Aybak: Haha, that won't be necessary. We're not that shorthanded.
Aybak: I'm the leader of the Eremites in Caravan Ribat. It's best if I stay to supervise public safety here and carry out the maintenance of the Wall of Samiel.
Aybak: Those are basic orders from the Akademiya, and I can deal with them on my own.
Aybak: As for the other commissions, my brothers and sisters can see to them. If all of us can make money, we'll live happily together.
