Traveler: What's the problem with the reports?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Well, you see, the abolishing of the Decree caused a huge stir. This also exposed many instances of nepotism and fraud within the Kanjou Commission.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: We've currently got our hands full clearing the old accounts.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: And with the war ending with the Shogunate being unable to decisively defeat the rebels, Sir Matsukawa is even less optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma than usual.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: The work on my hands has grown significantly, and the paper pushers below me have not been all that useful in this matter, so I have had no choice but to follow Sir Matsukawa through this work every step of the way.
