# Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma

The heirloom blade of the Iwakura Clan.
Although the one who forged this blade possessed great skills, and though it is true that this sword has slain many a foe, it does not possess any special powers. Nor has the Iwakura Succession ever obtained a Vision. Their excellent swordsmanship was purely a result of their honing of mind, body, and technique.
This blade has been submerged in water for a long time and seems to have completely rusted.
