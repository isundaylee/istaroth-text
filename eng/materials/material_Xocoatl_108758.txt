# Xocoatl

A Natlan drink made from Cacahuatl. Initially, bitter Cacahuatl was ground up and blended with various spices, creating the eponymous "bitter water." Much evolution later, added sugar would transform the final product into something fragrant, delectable, and broadly popular, though the name indicating "bitter water" has never changed.
