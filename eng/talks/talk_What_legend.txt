Traveler: What legend?
Miss Bu: Why, the legend of the conch lodge. It's very popular among the young people of Liyue.
Miss Bu: ...You can hear the sound of the sea in a conch shell. The same is true of the conch lodge...
Miss Bu: Only, the sounds heard here come not from the ocean blue... but from the Sea of Souls.
Miss Bu: If somebody hears sounds from the conch lodge, it could well mean thatâ€”
Miss Bu: Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you...
