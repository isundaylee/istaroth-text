# Chilled to the Bone


## Talk 1

Traveler: Do you have a commission for me?
Iris: A commission, you say? Your timing couldn't have been better! I was just thinking I should find an experienced adventurer to investigate the strange air current.
Traveler: What strange air current?
Iris: Let me give you a bit of background. Not long ago, a small team of explorers went on an expedition up the mountain. A few highly experienced adventurers joined them, and they took a safe route that avoided all the known dangerous spots.
Iris: But somehow, they fell foul of a sudden and powerful cold current along their way and were forced to return to the camp.
Iris: I spoke to the adventurers when they got back. They said that it shouldn't have been possible for an air current that strong to appear on the trail they were following. Apparently, it just came out of nowhere, and did not have the hallmarks of a naturally occurring phenomenon...
Iris: Since then, numerous explorers and surveyors have reported encountering the same situation. After organizing a fair few investigations of our own, we now believe that we have pinpointed the source of the air current.
Iris: Unfortunately, our investigations have now ground to a halt, as we are short on personnel...
Iris: Traveler, if you are willing, could you continue investigating the source of this phenomenon on our behalf?
Traveler: One step ahead of you. I've already been.
Iris: You've investigated it already? Wow, what a lucky coincidence... Well, what did you find out?
Traveler: This is what I discovered.
Iris: I wonder when it could have appeared here?
Iris: Thank you for investigating, I'll report the situation to the Guild. Here's your reward.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Regarding the air current...
Iris: What about it? Has your investigation revealed something?
Traveler: This is what I discovered.
Iris: Goodness... I wonder when it could have appeared here?
Iris: Thank you for investigating, I'll report the situation to the Guild. Here's your reward.

Iris: Unfortunately, all the adventurers who have taken part in the investigations so far are still recuperating from frostbite, muscular fatigue, and other issues, so our investigations have temporarily ground to a halt...
Iris: Traveler, if you are willing, could you continue investigating the source of the air current on our behalf?
Traveler: Sure.
Iris: Many thanks. Make sure you're well-prepared before you set off â€” whatever is causing this is most unnatural.
Iris: If you've no further questions, I will leave you to proceed with the investigation. Many thanks for your assistance.
Traveler: What's in this for me?
Iris: Oh... Straight to the point, I see. Don't worry, the Guild is not in the business of short-changing its adventurers. I will have a reward waiting for you when you return to the camp.
Iris: As for the size of said reward... That will be determined based on the value of your findings. You know the score, right?
