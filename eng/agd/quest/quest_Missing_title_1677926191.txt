## Talk 1

Jeht: #Here's a thousand hugs, Traveler! We will meet again!

## Talk 2

Jeht: #Traveler!? I—Is that you?
Jeht: And Paimon too! I didn't expect to run into you two here!
Paimon: Jeht, it really is you!
Jeht: Haha, keep it down! You're gonna scare my fish away!
Benben: Beep beep!
Paimon: Uh... You're fishing? But why aren't you using a fishing rod?
Benben: Beep...
Jeht: #Benben, that's not true! Anyway... Why don't we talk about something else, Traveler?
Traveler: So, about that fishing rod of yours...
Jeht: You...!
Jeht: It... broke — totally its own fault, though... Hehe.
Jeht: *sigh* I never thought fishing would be this different from hunting. Seriously, why is it so difficult? I hadn't the patience to sit here for hours waiting for them to bite my bait. So I thought, "why don't I just jump into the river and catch them myself"?
Paimon: But you didn't catch any in the end, did you?
Jeht: Hmph, of course I did. I got a really big one, and it's longer than you by... Um, the length of half a Benben!
Benben: Beep! Beep!
Jeht: I grilled it and ate it, so there's none left for you.
Benben: Beep...?
Jeht: Yup, Benben also had its share. You're the only one who got left out!
Paimon: Like Paimon's gonna believe that fib!
Jeht: Hahaha! Your loss!
Traveler: How have you been?
Jeht: Huh? Good, don't you worry about me.
Jeht: It's not the first time that I've traveled alone...
Benben: Beep! Beep!
Jeht: Hahaha, there there, I know I have you!
Jeht: After my fallout with the Tanit, the various desert tribes stopped providing me with food and shelter... I'm no longer under any tribe's protection.
Jeht: Later... Rukh Shah from the Corps of Thirty offered me a place in the city, but... I didn't feel comfortable there. It reminded me too much of my mother...
Jeht: So I left Sumeru City. Thought I'd travel to another nation and check out some beautiful places I'd never seen before.
Jeht: So I boarded a merchant ship and somehow ended up here.
Jeht: And after that... Well, there's nothing new to share after that, haha! You know how bodyguards are always needed in every corner of the world, right? Well, that's especially so in big cities like this where merchant caravans come and go every day. So yeah, I'm living alright.
Jeht: Hehe, and well, this is fine. I quite enjoy the life I have now, adrift and unattached.
Jeht: Me and Benben are just like you and Paimon, aren't we?
Paimon: Hmph, Benben is no match for Paimon!
Benben: Beep-beep!
Jeht: #Hahaha, no fighting, you two... Well, I won't keep you any longer, Traveler. I had planned to treat you to a big meal, but us guards-for-hire have rules we need to follow... *sigh*
Jeht: Ahem! So much for complaining! Let me give you a thousand hugs and wish you a pleasant journey ahead!
Jeht: #Our paths will converge one day! Don't you forget that, eh?
Traveler: I didn't expect to see you here.
Jeht: Yeah... I wasn't expecting to see you either. What a neat surprise!
Paimon: Hehe, hope we didn't interrupt your fishin— Uh, fish-catching, did we?
Jeht: Knock it off, little Paimon!
