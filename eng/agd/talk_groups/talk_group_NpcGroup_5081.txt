Traveler: About security...
Plessia: The Gardemeks are in charge of daily security matters, and they aid their corresponding Gardes officers in conducting patrols.
Plessia: Machines are not omnipotent, after all. There are many things that can only be accomplished by humans.
Plessia: Gardemeks and the Gardes are both under the Maison Gardiennage.
Plessia: If something arises that they, too, cannot handle, then it shall be up to the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, or the Chief Justice's personal unit, the Marechaussee Phantom.

Traveler: Tell me about the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...
Plessia: They are the elite of the Maison Gardiennage.
Plessia: They handle affairs that ordinary Gardes would struggle with — such as criminals who refuse to negotiate and attempt to resist violently.
Plessia: Normally, criminals who still maintain the spark of rationality would surrender upon encountering the Patrol.

Plessia: That organization was once comprised only of humans, but now the majority of them are Melusines.
Plessia: They were added in when the Chief Justice noticed that their special visual acuity was most suited to investigating cases.
Plessia: I apologize if I get a little excited at times. Please understand.
Plessia: After all, the lovely Melusines are treasured companions of us Fontainians.
