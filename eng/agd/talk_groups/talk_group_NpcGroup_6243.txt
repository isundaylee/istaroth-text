Kotimy: I wonder what kind of Saurian Ifa is going to bring home next time?

Traveler: A wounded one?
Kotimy: Probably. He is a vet, after all, and there're always plenty of patients at his clinic.
Kotimy: But he spends most of the time out on calls with patients.
Kotimy: If the Saurian he took home to care for isn't suffering from a minor sickness, like a cold, then there's probably something pretty seriously wrong with it.
Kotimy: Heh, I wish I could learn how to treat Saurians too.
Kotimy: If I could help a Qucusaurus someday, perhaps it'd let me ride it...

Traveler: A playful Saurian?
Kotimy: Oh, that's probably just Cacucu.
Kotimy: He's Ifa's, err... "brother".
Kotimy: Anyway, that's what he calls himself. He can mimic human speech, too! That's probably why Ifa calls him Cacucu...
Kotimy: Now, I don't know if he truly understands human speech, but he looks pretty cool and I love chatting with him.
Kotimy: But not for too long, or it'll get in the way of my daily training!

Traveler: Random opportunity isn't exactly reliable.
Kotimy: I know! Don't worry, I've always been very serious when it comes to flight training!
Kotimy: However, having a good relationship with your Saurian is never a bad thing, is it?
Kotimy: Maybe soon I'll be able to help Ifa out, just like Ororon did!
