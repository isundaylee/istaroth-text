# The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well


## Talk 1

Parvaneh: Traveler... you're just in time! Have you seen Julie? The... the short Mondstadt girl who was with me!?
Traveler: No, I haven't...
Parvaneh: You— You haven't seen her either? Where on earth did that idiot go...
Traveler: What happened?
Parvaneh: Julie suddenly disappeared. No, well... maybe it's not accurate to say that she "suddenly" disappeared.
Parvaneh: We met an old man named Kamei Munehisa when you last came with us to collect ingredients. Do you remember him?
Traveler: Sort of, yes...
Parvaneh: Yeah. He defeated the monsters near the camp and gave us ingredients from around those parts.
Parvaneh: Ever since we got back, Julie has been talking about sending him food to show our appreciation...
Parvaneh: Xudong and I thought she was just saying it. However, she left a note in the camp today and actually went looking for him.
Parvaneh: The idiot... She doesn't know what she's doing! That Kamei Munehisa looked so suspicious!
Parvaneh: *sigh* Xudong and I split up. He went to find the place where we met Kamei Munehisa the previous time. I came to the Adventurers' Guild to post a missing person commission.
Parvaneh: I can't believe that she actually dared to run off with how things are in Inazuma right now... We must find her, and quickly!
Traveler: I'll go with you.
Parvaneh: That would be great.
Parvaneh: Xudong and I have agreed on a rendezvous point, so we'll meet him there first.
Traveler: If she runs into a monster...
Parvaneh: If Julie runs into a monster... Honestly, I'd be more worried for the monster.
Parvaneh: But if she runs into the Kairagi or something like that, that would be bad. Kairagi can't be dealt with in the same way as monsters...
Parvaneh: Even if Xudong and I joined forces, it would still be...
Traveler: I can help, too.
Parvaneh: Huh? You're willing to help? That would be great.
Traveler: The samurai?

## Talk 2

Xudong: Parvaneh... and Traveler? What brings you here?
Traveler: I came to help.
Xudong: Really? Thank you so much! Now, Julie seems to have gone deeper within...
Xudong: There are tons of monsters there. It's hard to deal with them with just the two of us. But we should be much better off with your help.
Xudong: Let's get going. Julie should be in the woods.
Traveler: I'm here for the big feast you promised.
Xudong: No problem. But I can't cook it alone.
Xudong: Traveler, could you do me a favor and help us get Julie back first?
Xudong: Julie seems to have gone deeper in... and there are tons of monsters there. It will hard going with just the two of us.
Xudong: After we find Julie, I'll make you the feast I promised.

## Talk 3

Parvaneh: Hey! If you break the wok, what will we cook with!?
Xudong: Don't underestimate Liyue's skill in making woks. This is a unique cast iron wok specially designed for tossing. It won't break easily.
Xudong: Besides, it's just a few monsters. What kind of iron wok would it be if it couldn't knock them flat?
Parvaneh: You're expecting too much out of it...
Traveler: Xudong has quite a bit of swagger.
Xudong: Of course! A chef has to carry himself in a certain way.
Parvaneh: I've never heard of such a thing! Why would a chef learn to smash monsters with an iron pot?!
Xudong: Okay. Julie, let's get out of here. And fast...!
Julie: W—Wait! We have to help Uncle Munehisa! He's fighting against Kairagi in the woods, all alone.
Parvaneh: Kairagi? Not monsters? How did you get involved with them?
Julie: I—I'll tell you later... Let's go help him! He's all alone...
Xudong: Alright, I got it. Traveler, could you come with us?
Traveler: Let's do this.
Xudong: Come on, let's go!
Traveler: You're going to fight the Kairagi?
Xudong: Definitely. My wok's raring to go, see?
Xudong: Besides, chefs can't run away on the eve of battle.
Parvaneh: I told you not to have such high standards for chefs or their iron woks!
Traveler: Where can I buy a wok like yours?
Xudong: Haha, great question. I had it specially cast at Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: It's said to have materials excavated from the Chasm added to the iron. If you want to get one, go to Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: But I heard that the Chasm has been locked down for a long time. I doubt he would be able to make any now...
Traveler: Parvaneh's handling herself just fine, too.
Parvaneh: Huh? Well... hahaha, I just threw a few books at the monster's heads. You were the one who fought them off.
Parvaneh: Wait. Where is "Along with Divinity Volume 6"? Did I throw it, too? I haven't finished that one yet!

## Talk 4

Kamei Munehisa: Ahem... Sorry that you have to see me like this.
Julie: Uncle Munehisa, are you okay?...
Kamei Munehisa: Just a few lost go-arounds. No big deal.
Xudong: Now, Julie, could you tell us the whole story, then?
Parvaneh: Tell me everything please, or my books were wrecked for nothing... Agh, the pages are all wrinkled now...
Julie: It's simple... I just wanted to bring him some food.
Parvaneh: *sigh*... You only met him once. Why... do you trust him so much?
Julie: I'm sure he's a good man! He was starving, but he gave the food to us instead of keeping it for himself.
Julie: Anyone who is willing to share food with others when they are hungry must be a good person!
Parvaneh: Your concept of good and evil is so straightforward and pure...
Parvaneh: You must live in some fairy tale world instead of Teyvat.
Xudong: Hahaha, I think she's right, though.
Xudong: I agree. Those who can uphold their honor and decency when they are hungry can't be all that bad.
Traveler: Such simple and straightforward logic...
Xudong: Anyway, Julie, do continue.
Julie: So I made some Chicken-Mushroom Skewers and wanted to try my luck finding him where we first met.
Julie: I did see him there, as it turned out.
Julie: I was just about to say hello when I noticed that he was confronting some Kairagi.
Julie: I wanted to get away, but I was spotted by them...
Kamei Munehisa: I'll take it from here...
Kamei Munehisa: Among those... people, are some of my old friends who served with me under the Shogunate.
Kamei Munehisa: After Inazuma's sudden change, we all left the Shogunate one after another to make our own living.
Traveler: Is that how they make a living?
Kamei Munehisa: ...Yes. We don't have any way to make money other than by the sword.
Kamei Munehisa: Since then, they became the Kairagi as you see them, making a living by plundering.
Kamei Munehisa: I didn't want to live like that, so I've wandered the land looking for work.
Kamei Munehisa: But no one would dare hire me as soon as they found out that I used to be a samurai who had left the Shogunate.
Kamei Munehisa: Since then, as you can see, I've had to scavenge for food in the wilderness.
Kamei Munehisa: Recently, my former comrades seem to be short-handed, so they have come every day to persuade me to join them. I refused every time.
Kamei Munehisa: Today... when Julie appeared, they thought that I must've joined some Clan or another and was trying to get rid of them. So they attacked us.
Traveler: An unreasonable bunch...
Kamei Munehisa: They've never acted reasonably. But in their situation... there really isn't any reasoning to be done.
Julie: So he went to deal with those guys and I stayed where I was, waiting for him to return. Then suddenly, a group of monsters appeared...
Traveler: You should have been able to deal with them, right?
Julie: Usually, I could. But I didn't eat anything when I left this morning, so I was too hungry. I didn't have any energy.
Julie: I lost all the Chicken-Mushroom Skewers on me when I was spotted by those Kairagi... Luckily I had Uncle Munehisa to protect me.
Traveler: That's why breakfast is so important.
Parvaneh: There are still many of these unreasonable Kairagi in Inazuma. We're going to be here for a while, and it just doesn't feel safe...
Parvaneh: We can deal with a few weak monsters, but there's no way we can handle a group of people who know martial arts...
Xudong: Uh... Uncle, you just mentioned that you're looking for a job, right?
Xudong: How would you like to come with us?
Julie: Yay, that would be great!
Parvaneh: But since he's a samurai who left the Shogunate, wouldn't he get us into trouble in Inazuma?
Kamei Munehisa: That's true. If I go with you, I might get you into trouble.
Xudong: Hahaha, I don't think it matters. We're just going around looking for cooking ingredients.
Xudong: The best thing a person in his situation can do is to stay far away from anything to do with the Shogunate or samurai.
Xudong: If you work for someone as a guard or in a security detail, you're more likely to attract suspicion.
Xudong: Plus, I don't think it would be right to let a good man like you starve.
Xudong: I doubt I can fix anything else as a chef, but I can at least make sure that you're well-fed.
Kamei Munehisa: Sir, you...
Xudong: Hehe. Well, what do you think? Would you like to join us? We can't offer much pay, but there will be plenty of food.
Kamei Munehisa: ...
Kamei Munehisa: In that case, I am at your service, sir.
Julie: Woohoo!
Parvaneh: This is a good thing, right? Yeah, this is for the best...
Xudong: All right! I'm sure everyone is starving after all that work. This isn't a great place to cook... but I'll find a way to whip something up...
Xudong: Traveler, have a rest. I'll take care of it. You just wait here.
Xudong: Okay, time to get started!
Xudong: Done... haha. Onigiri made of leftover rice. It's a bit rough... but it will fill your stomach. Come on, let's eat.
Xudong: Traveler, thank you for coming with us. This recipe is for you. Uncle Munehisa just gave it to me, and I made you a copy.
Xudong: He said it's a recipe he got while he was still working for the Shogunate. It's quite unique. You can give it a try if you're interested.
Xudong: Alright then. Enough talk. Let's eat!
Traveler: Well, guess you won't be skipping breakfast from now on.
Traveler: A sensitive lot, huh.
Kamei Munehisa: It's not surprising, considering their position.
Kamei Munehisa: I think they were just using any excuse to deal with a "disobedient" person like me. To throw their weight around a bit.
Kamei Munehisa: After all, I have repeatedly refused them. It must have come as a blow.
Traveler: Are all the Kairagi...
Kamei Munehisa: Not all. But regardless, they were all cowards who raise their swords against the weak.
Traveler: Why did you leave the Shogunate?
Kamei Munehisa: I just... couldn't agree with what the Shogunate was doing in Inazuma.
Kamei Munehisa: I'm just a martial artist. I don't know what's good for the country or not.
Kamei Munehisa: I only knew that it went against what was in my heart, so I chose to leave.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe. Perhaps I was just too old-fashioned... Please try not to laugh.

## Talk 5

Xudong: Ah, full at last... Hmm...
Traveler: Why did you help him?
Xudong: Do you mean Uncle Munehisa? I did it out of my professional ethics as a chef, of course.
Xudong: Hah, just kidding. But I really don't want to see a good man like him go hungry.
Xudong: In truth... I don't want to see anyone go hungry.
Xudong: Hunger is a terrible feeling. I've had first-hand experience.
Xudong: People can do terrible things under the influence of hunger.
Xudong: I think that if everyone in this world ate well, perhaps, a lot of terrible things could be avoided.
Xudong: I can't do it alone, true, but as a chef, I can at least try to help the people around me eat well.
Xudong: Hahaha, to put it simply, I just want everyone to have food and eat well. A rather meaningless ideal, I suppose.
Traveler: No, it's a noble ideal.
Xudong: Hehe, thanks a lot. Okay... no more talking. Have some more and don't leave any on your plate. Wasting food is a terrible sin.
Traveler: See you later.
Xudong: You're leaving? Not having any seconds?

## Talk 6

Julie: Hehe. This is actually quite tasty. I'll definitely go for another round...
Traveler: Why did you want to bring him food?
Julie: Well... I just didn't want to see him go hungry.
Julie: The last time I saw him, he seemed sad. I thought it was probably because he didn't have enough to eat.
Julie: So I wanted to bring some food to him. He won't be so sad once he's full, I thought.
Traveler: What made you trust him?
Julie: That's... an adventurer's intuition. I'm very good at telling the good guys from the bad guys.
Julie: Only good people give out food when they're hungry...
Traveler: See you around.
Julie: Bye. I'll never miss breakfast again...

## Talk 7

Parvaneh: I can't believe those two...
Traveler: You still don't seem to trust him, huh?
Parvaneh: You mean Kamei Munehisa? Of course not... we've only met him a few times, how could I trust him so quickly?
Parvaneh: ...But while I don't trust Kamei Munehisa, I do trust Xudong's judgment.
Traveler: You're from the Akademiya?
Parvaneh: Sort of. I was originally doing field research for the Akademiya when I met Xudong in Liyue.
Parvaneh: He was planning to travel around and study recipes, and the topic I was studying happened to be related to food. After we talked a few times, we decided to travel together.
Parvaneh: We first went to Mondstadt where we were surrounded by a bunch of monsters. That's when Julie came, and she helped us chase them away.
Parvaneh: When she heard that we were traveling around looking for different cuisine, she joined us.
Parvaneh: She said she was planning to go adventuring, but I have the feeling that she just wanted to have some good food...
Parvaneh: We'll be going to Sumeru next. I'm almost done with my research, so it's time for me to go back to Akademiya.
Parvaneh: When we get to Sumeru, I'll make sure they get a taste of our local specialties...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Parvaneh: Okay, goodbye.

## Talk 8

Kamei Munehisa: What is the matter?
Traveler: Why did you agree to join Xudong?
Kamei Munehisa: Like Xudong said, if I want to have enough to eat... working for him is my best option at the moment.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, Julie and Xudong are both of high moral character, and it will be an honor to travel with them.
Kamei Munehisa: Parvaneh... is a thoughtful person. It is understandable she would be wary of me.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, she is merely a little suspicious of me as opposed to rejecting me outright, and that... that is enough for me.
Traveler: Have you really been just wandering around?
Kamei Munehisa: Indeed. I would never lie. Since I left the Shogunate, I've been just wandering around.
Kamei Munehisa: I usually fill my stomach with wild fruits and, when I'm lucky, fresh game.
Kamei Munehisa: Occasionally, I also help people to fight off monsters or Kairagi, which gets me at least some payment.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe... For someone like me who has no skills other than wielding a sword, job opportunities are a bit scarce.
Kamei Munehisa: Not to mention my background of leaving the Shogunate. People always associate me with the Kairagi, and that makes it even harder to find work.
Kamei Munehisa: I have no home or family to go to in Inazuma. Since I had nowhere to go, I just wandered.
Traveler: Why did you leave the Shogunate?
Kamei Munehisa: I just... couldn't agree with what the Shogunate was doing in Inazuma.
Kamei Munehisa: I'm just a martial artist. I don't know what's good for the country or not.
Kamei Munehisa: I only knew that it went against what was in my heart, so I chose to leave.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe. Perhaps I was just too old-fashioned... Please try not to laugh.
Traveler: See you later.
Kamei Munehisa: Farewell.
