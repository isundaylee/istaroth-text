Traveler: What's your daily life like?
Childish Jiang: There's a man who comes and gives me food sometimes. He says that I should call him Uncle Tian, and that he's a distant relative, and that he knows my mom and dad really well.
Childish Jiang: He says mom and dad are busy right now and can't come home, so if there's anything I need, I can just go to him instead.
Childish Jiang: But when I asked him where mom and dad are, he didn't tell me. So I think he's a bit of a weirdo, too.
Childish Jiang: There's also a bunch of Milleliths who come and see me, too. They always bring me lots of tasty snacks. Sometimes I can't manage them all, so they just leave them in the house for me.
Childish Jiang: But they say that they don't know where mom and dad are, either. It's so strange...
