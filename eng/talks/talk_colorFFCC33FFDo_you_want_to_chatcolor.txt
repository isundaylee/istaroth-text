Kamisato Ayaka: I'd be delighted. What would you like to talk about...?
Traveler: Let's talk about poetry.
Kamisato Ayaka: My affection for the arts stems from the education I received at home.
Kamisato Ayaka: Whenever I try to delve deeper into the meaning behind the words of a poem, I gain a better understanding of the author's state of mind.
Kamisato Ayaka: Through the author's eyes, I can immerse myself in the sights that only they have seen. Even if the subject is well-known to me, I am able to gain a deeper level of appreciation for it.
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Kamisato Ayaka: "Camellia petals fall to the ground, scattered among the raindrops of yesterday."
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: Just reading it makes me sentimental. This must be what people call "the power of art."
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah... How rude of me to talk about my own interests all the time.
Kamisato Ayaka: Even though I initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you...
Kamisato Ayaka: Would you mind if I took up a bit more of your time? Tell me about the things you like.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Is that alright?
Traveler: Let's talk about natural scenery.
Kamisato Ayaka: Talking about the beauty of nature, it is important to mention that the people of Inazuma believe that everything has its own spiritual essence.
Kamisato Ayaka: Even though we might be familiar with the way nature looks on the surface, each type of scenery evokes a different kind of "feeling."
Kamisato Ayaka: At least, that's a romantic way of approaching this topic.
