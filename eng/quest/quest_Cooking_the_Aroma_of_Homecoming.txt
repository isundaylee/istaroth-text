# Cooking, the Aroma of Homecoming


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa, what's cooking in there? Paimon's mouth is watering from just a whiff of it!
Paimon: It looks like some kind of soup. Hmm... Paimon can't tell what's inside...
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler...
Traveler: What is it?
Paimon: The person cooking it isn't here, and it smells so good. Let's have a mouthful while it's left unattended.
Traveler: Let's do it...
Paimon: Yay!
Black Screen Text: The pot is smaller than it looks.
The soup within it is all gone just like that.
Paimon: Ahh... Huh? It smells good, but why doesn't Paimon taste anything?
Arapas (???): Great Aramuhukunda! What are you Nara doing!?
Paimon: A—Aranara? Where did you come from?
Arapas: From underground! Forget that, why are you drinking my soup? Arapas worked very hard on that!
Traveler: Sorry...
Paimon: Sorry...
Arapas: Hmph! You stole my soup! Sorry won't cut it!
Arapas: Do you know how difficult it is to make soup here? One minute it's rainy; one minute it's sunny.
Arapas: I finally managed to make this pot of soup, but while I was away picking Fresh Harra Fruits, you...
Paimon: It smelled too good to resist...
Paimon: But if it's that difficult, why are you cooking here?
Arapas: Hmph! The key to cooking must be collected every day, which is...
Traveler: Your pride as a chef?
Arapas: Water! It's water! Water has a huge impact on the aroma of my soup. So it has to be made with the best water!
Arapas: I've been collecting water throughout Apam Woods to make soup with. After collecting water samples as numerous as the leaves on a tree, I finally found the best "Living Spring."
Arapas: It's the only water source fit for Festival Utsava's supreme delicacy! You wouldn't get it even if I told you... Only that Nara from before...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Arapacati sent us...
Black Screen Text: You bring Arapas up to speed on the events so far...
Arapas: Ah, you're Nara friends of my sister! And Festival Utsava is coming!
Arapas: It's fine. I've found Living Spring, and my Supreme Delicacy is complete. It's in this pot... Oh, right...
Arapas: ...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Eh-hehe... Don't be sad, at least your soup was really aromatic...
Arapas: Ah! My Living Spring! "Apshvaana" live at its source. I waited so long for them to leave and only collected a pot of it...
Arapas: No! You must get me another pot of Living Spring!
Paimon: "Apshvaana"? What's that?
Arapas: Hmph! You Nara really know nothing about the forest. They live in the water, and they have four legs, a tail, and they bite.
Paimon: ...Dogs?
Traveler: Dogs don't live in the water.
Paimon: Ah, right. Then what's an "Apshvaana"?
Arapas: Forget that! I want my water! And I want Living Spring from there in particular!
Paimon: #Alright, alright... Traveler, we don't have a choice here. Let's go...
Traveler: Right.
Arapas: It must be Living Spring and no other!
Traveler: Let's go.
Traveler: Perhaps Oceanid Dogs?
Traveler: The will to never forget your dreams?
Traveler: It... It was Paimon...
Paimon: #Hey! Traveler, how could you betray Paimon like that!?
Arapas: I don't care who drank it! My soup is gone!
Traveler: We shouldn't...
Paimon: Paimon is just so curious. Uh, Paimon will just take one mouthful, just one!
Traveler: What if you get a tummy ache after?
Paimon: Hmph! Don't you underestimate Paimon!

Arapas (???): Great Aramuhukunda! What are you Nara doing!?
Paimon: Ar—Aranara? Where on earth did you come from?
Arapas: From underground! Forget that, why are you drinking my soup? Arapas worked very hard on that!
Traveler: Sorry...
Paimon: Sorry...
Arapas: Hmph! You stole my soup! Sorry won't cut it!
Arapas: Do you know how difficult it is to make soup here? One minute it's rainy; one minute it's sunny.
Arapas: Hmm... Speaking of which, Varuna Contraption has been much more stable lately, and the weather has become normal again...
Paimon: Actually, it was us...
Arapas: Hmph! I'm sure it was a good Nara like that Nara who repaired Varuna Contraption! It wasn't soup thieves like the two of you...
Paimon: Hey, don't be so mean! It just smelled too good to resist...
Paimon: But if it's that difficult, why are you cooking here?
Arapas: Hmph! The key to cooking must be collected every day, which is...

## Talk 3

Arapas: Hmm... It is the water from the river's source. The Living Spring that's cold and clean, just like moonlight.
Arapas: Arachatora, Arasaka, and Araphala wouldn't be so stupid if they grew up drinking this water. Only Arapacati, my sister...
Paimon: Well, what's next...
Arapas: Huh? Oh. Next up, you have to make me a new pot of soup...
Black Screen Text: Receiving guidance from Arapas, you add some fruits and vegetables into the water and start cooking.
A rather nice aroma slowly emerges from the pot.
Black Screen Text: Once you're done, you taste the fresh soup together.
It sort of lives up to your expectations. It does carry the aroma of the ingredients...
But a soup without any condiments is just too plain.
It has no flavor at all.
Arapas: Mmm, this is how the supreme delicacy should smell!
Paimon: #Hmm... What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: It can quench thirst as soups should.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it would be better with some salt and pepper.
Traveler: Everything is better with salt and pepper.
Arapas: Great Aramuhukunda! You want to add salt? What a horrifying idea!
Arapas: Land with salt is land without life, and Aranara will be forced to shrink into seeds. Yet Nara wish to add salt!?
Arapas: Soups are supposed to be bland! How do you Nara not even understand that!?
Arapas: That Nara from before told us a story after having a bowl of my soup:
Arapas: "When we Nara children come home, the aroma of soup is the first thing we smell. As such, aroma is all a soup needs."
Arapas: #After that, {F#he}{M#she} complimented the aroma of the soup I made. I've never forgotten that. That's why I won't believe a word you say!
Paimon: But just aroma isn't enough...
Arapas: ...
Arapas: Hmph! But since you're the Nara of this Festival Utsava, I'm sure you've received approval from Araja and Arapacati. So... I'll try making a soup with taste.
Arapas: Next time, I'll look for even better water, so we can make even better soup!
Traveler: ...I don't think water is the problem.
Arapas: Really? Anyway, my cooking training has concluded. Alright, let's see what we can do about this at Festival Utsava!
Arapas: I've taught you how to make the soup. It's a soup approved by the Great Nara, so do give it a few more tries. But make sure you don't forget to use good water!
Paimon: #(Traveler, let's add some seasoning next time. It should be pretty good after that...)
Traveler: It's too healthy for me, I think...

## Talk 4

Arapas: Is there water that can give taste to soup?

## Talk 5

Arapas: My soup... *sob* How could this happen...
Traveler: (Leave quietly...)

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Arapas: Hmph! Both of you are bad Nara! Don't even think about tricking me with water from somewhere else!

### Additional Talk 2

Leaf With Careless Penmanship: (A huge leaf. Someone has written on it with messy handwriting...)
Leaf With Careless Penmanship: "...The 17th time frost covered the leaves. After some tests, I noticed that water from tributaries is filled with sand and mud. It has an earthen taste. Not acceptable."
Leaf With Careless Penmanship: "...The 30th time frost covered the leaves. It's raining again. Not acceptable."
Leaf With Careless Penmanship: "...The 60th time frost covered the leaves. After some tests, I noticed that water from a river's main stem makes much more aromatic soup, but it still isn't enough. Not acceptable."
Leaf With Careless Penmanship: "...The 80th time frost covered the leaves. It rained as soon as I finished my soup. Luckily, I wore a hat. Hmm, the quality of this water isn't bad."
