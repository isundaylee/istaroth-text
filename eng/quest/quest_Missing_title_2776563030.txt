## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Alhaitham: Don't rush. This is a big undertaking, and the planning and preparation for what lies ahead will no doubt take some time.
Alhaitham: Take it slowly. We need to make sure the plan is as effective as possible.
Paimon: He's starting to read his book again! Hey! Are you even listening?
Alhaitham: Would you like me to lend you something to read?
Paimon: No way! Your books aren't quite to Paimon's taste...
Alhaitham: I was joking. I know my books are far too difficult for you, and I have no intention of lending them out.
Paimon: Ugh! You're so annoying...

### Additional Talk 2

Candace: You must let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
Candace: Though I cannot leave Aaru Village, I can't help but feel... stirred when I see the looks in your eyes.
Candace: I've never felt as roused as this when fighting alone in the past...
Candace: I suppose this must be the power of camaraderie.

### Additional Talk 3

Dehya: The past few days have been some of the most challenging work I've ever taken on.
Dehya: And none of it will earn me a single Mora... I can't believe it...
Paimon: Look on the bright side, Dehya! Maybe we'll get a huuuge reward after this is all over!
Dehya: Hmm, you've got a point. Hey, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow with more money than you could ever spend?
Paimon: Paimon would buy boatloads of tasty snacks!
Dehya: That's it?
Paimon: Um... and maybe some tasty drinks as well?
Dehya: Hahaha, how adorable.
Dehya: Well, here's to all our indulgent fantasies... If there's a chance they can come true, I'll give it my best shot.
Dehya: And here's hoping that everything we do from now on will change this world for the better.
