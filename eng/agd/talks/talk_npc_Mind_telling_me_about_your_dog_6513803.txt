Traveler: Mind telling me about your dog?
Etienne: Ah. Baguette is an earnest girl who's dedicated to her work. I'm most fond of her.
Etienne: She's got a truly keen sense of smell, and she can sniff out all manner of contraband and prohibited items.
Etienne: No human inspector can beat her in that regard, but...
Etienne: Baguette is tireless at work, and just as tireless when it comes to tearing the house down.
Etienne: *sigh* If only she could be this at peace at home.
