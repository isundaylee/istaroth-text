# Expectations Not to Be Betrayed


## Talk 1

Yoimiya: Kouichi! I'm here, how is the boat coming along?
Kouichi: Yeah, it's... alright, I guess. Um, I was questioned though...
Kouichi: Wait, wait. Should we really be talking about this in front of them?
Yoimiya: Oh, don't worry, they're my friends, you can trust them! They came with me to check up on the boat.
Paimon: Yeah! You could say we're all in the same BOAT here! Haha...
Traveler: Pleasure to meet you.
Kouichi: Oh, I see... Sorry, I didn't mean to doubt you, I'm just being cautious. The boat is ready, but I'll have to be discreet moving it here.
Paimon: Huh? Why is that?
Kouichi: Because of the Sakoku Decree. The Tenryou Commission is really suspicious of any kind of seaborne vessel. Even the smallest ones — they'll stop and interrogate us, demanding to know what we plan on doing with it. It's a real nuisance.
Yoimiya: I understand. I'm sorry for dragging you into this mess...
Kouichi: Haha, don't be silly. I'm actually happy that you came to me for help. I've always come to you for fireworks, and again this time — so just consider this my way of saying thank you.
Kouichi: Right, I'll go fetch the boat now. I should be back shortly.
Yoimiya: Thank you! If it's on the way, you can always pick up your fireworks from my house. Everything was made in strict accordance with what was on the paper slip, you won't find the slightest thing wrong with them.
Kouichi: Alright then. The fireworks show will be starting soon, won't it — you should make sure your new friends get to see it. It's an Inazuman tradition, after all.
Yoimiya: Yep, that's the plan! ...Oh! You know what, you should tell them about your past — about the first time you ordered fireworks from my family.
Kouichi: That's a long story, actually... Where do I start...
Kouichi: ...Oh, uh — maybe I'll come back to that after moving the boat here.
Yoimiya: Oh, right, yeah. Got caught up in the conversation there, hehe.
Kouichi: Okay, well, I'll leave you to it for now and meet you back here later.
Yoimiya: Hehe, lucky he reminded me, otherwise I would've ended up chatting the rest of the day away.
Yoimiya: I've been so busy with the fireworks business these past few days that I haven't had a moment to stop and chat with anyone. Ugh, it's killing me.
Yoimiya: Of course, Pops is happy to listen to me chatter away... but because he can hardly hear anything, it's difficult to get an interesting reaction from him...
Yoimiya: ...Aaaand I'm doing it again, aren't I? Ugh. What I meant to say was, while Kouichi is bringing the boat here, we should try to find some firework materials.
Yoimiya: I need to make fireworks not just for you guys, but for those kids and Sakujirou as well. We're missing a lot of materials.
Traveler: If it's too much trouble, don't worry about us.
Yoimiya: It'll be fine. It's actually like this every year, there's always a bunch of extra orders to slot in here and there.
Yoimiya: When people want fireworks, it's always because they have something to commemorate. And if they miss the chance, they might never get another one. So, no matter how busy I am, I'm always happy to take their orders.
Paimon: So, what you're trying to say is that you enjoy the work?
Yoimiya: Oh, I do! I really do. Being born into a family of fireworks makers, I feel like since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with watching things go BOOM and then seeing all the lights and colors and...
Yoimiya: ...Uh, but what I really wanted to say was: Don't worry about me, it'll all be fine!
Traveler: Oh, so THAT's what you meant...
Yoimiya: Sorry, sorry! It's just that good conversation can be as fleeting as fireworks, sometimes, you know? So when I'm in the mood and I've got a lot to say, I just have to get it all out there in one go and leave no regrets!
Yoimiya: Let's head to the city, I think I'll try my luck with some people that I know.
Traveler: Your main point got a bit buried in all the extra information.

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: Ah, just as I thought, he isn't back yet. But not to worry, because actually, I've been hoping for a chance to have a nice long chat with you all day.
Yoimiya: Sorry for dragging you with me everywhere... Everyone's been so good to me though. It's all gone really smoothly, hee-hee.
Paimon: *sigh* Feels like Paimon has barely spoken a word this whole trip.
Traveler: You seem to get along well with everyone.
Yoimiya: I felt like I was neglecting you guys, so I wanted to find an opportunity to catch up.
Yoimiya: When we first met, I was in a hurry. We didn't have a chance to sit down and have a proper chat.
Yoimiya: You guys are travelers, right? So, where else did you go before coming to Inazuma?
Traveler: Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.
Yoimiya: Sounds great! I heard that they pretty much have no rules over there, right? So people are free to live their life however they want, doing whatever makes them happy.
Yoimiya: My pops actually received a gift from one of his old customers over there. It was from the winery or something...
Paimon: Dawn Winery! Their Dandelion Wine is super famous.
Yoimiya: Oh, yes! That's the one. I remember when he drank it — hee-hee, I've never seen him enjoy a bottle of wine so much in his life! He was telling me all night about how good it tasted.
Yoimiya: My friend once said to me that only people with a strong will and a clear purpose decide to go traveling. Maybe it's to see a certain view or to fulfill a certain wish...
Yoimiya: So. What made you guys embark on your treacherous journey to Inazuma?
Traveler: To track down an enemy god.
Paimon: And to find a lost family member, too.
Yoimiya: You were separated from your family because of a god?
Yoimiya: Oh...
Yoimiya: That must be really tough.
Traveler: Sometimes it is.
Yoimiya: I get it. Well, if that's how it is, then that's how it is. Eh-he, y'know, I was going to ask you guys if you wanted to stay here in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Unlike the outside world, what Inazuma seeks is eternity. In other words, a state of tranquility, where very little ever changes.
Yoimiya: The advantage of that is that if you're tired from your journey, Inazuma's a great place to come and rest.
Yoimiya: Umm... let me put it this way. I was just worried that you might be getting weary, and if you keep pressing on in that state, you might start to lose sight of the things that made you want to start your journey in the first place.
Paimon: *sigh* Sometimes, that's also just how it is.
Yoimiya: When you're exhausted, everything becomes an uphill struggle. Even trying to have fun — you won't be able to enjoy yourself if you're too tired.
Yoimiya: An adventurer friend of mine once told me that if you're too focused on reaching the end of the race, you'll miss a lot of opportunities and precious moments to be had along the way.
Traveler: ...
Yoimiya: Don't worry though, I'm sure I can think of some way to get you feeling relaxed and happy!
Yoimiya: And you're here now, so even if you're gonna leave eventually, I wanna make sure you at least leave with fond memories.
Yoimiya: Who knows — once you're reunited with your family, maybe you'll find Inazuma the right kind of place to call home.
Traveler: I'll add it to my list of candidates.
Yoimiya: Hehe, I already have an idea of the color and type of fireworks I wanna give you guys. I'll keep it a secret for now, though.
Kouichi: Yoimiya, I'm back! Sorry to keep you waiting! Let's head over to the boat... or, uh, did you want to keep chatting a little longer?
Traveler: We just finished, as it happens.
Kouichi: Okay, good. Let's go, then. Just act naturally, though, we don't want to raise any suspicion.
Paimon: If it can withstand the storms out on the ocean, it must be super sturdy, right?
Kouichi: Absolutely. Rest assured that the quality is guaranteed.
Traveler: #It also depends what my {F#brother}{M#sister} thinks.
Traveler: I'll bear that in mind.
Traveler: I'm slowly learning to cope.
Traveler: #I'm looking for my lost {F#brother}{M#sister}.
Paimon: And we're looking for answers from the gods, too.
Traveler: Liyue, the nation of contracts.
Yoimiya: I haven't been to Liyue before, but from what I've heard from Miss Beidou, it sounds like a really interesting place.
Yoimiya: But something big happened there recently, right? Didn't their archon leave all of a sudden?
Paimon: Yeah, a lot of crazy things went down as a result.
Paimon: *sigh* Luckily, everyone worked together to stave off a huge disaster that could have wiped out the whole city.
Yoimiya: Oh, well that's good to hear. I gotta say, it's pretty remarkable that the citizens managed to step up and keep things going even after their archon left.
Yoimiya: I mean, I sure can't imagine Inazuma without the Shogun.
Traveler: It was nice just listening quietly.

## Talk 3

Yoimiya: Hello, Morihiko. How's business these days?
Morihiko: Haha, Yoimiya, there you are. I thought you might show up.
Morihiko: No need to beat about the bush — you'll be here for the firework materials, I assume? I put a batch aside just for you. It'll definitely be enough.
Yoimiya: Huh? Really? How did you know!?
Morihiko: Because a fireworks show is coming up! And that usually means you'll be running all over the place trying to get your hands on some last-minute materials.
Morihiko: I've come to expect it now. There's always a few extras unaccounted for, eh.
Yoimiya: So sorry for bothering you every time...
Morihiko: Ah, come on now, you know I didn't mean it like that! I'd sooner have my business go under than turn down one of your requests.
Morihiko: What about you two, are you the ones needing some fireworks made?
Traveler: Hi, yes, thank you ever so much.
Morihiko: Haha, it's no trouble at all, my friend.
Morihiko: Once when I'd had an argument with my son, Yoimiya was the one who came and calmed him down.
Morihiko: I'm hopeless at communicating with him. If it wasn't for Yoimiya, who knows, he probably would've run away by now...
Yoimiya: Naw, it was never gonna come to that. He's a sensitive kid and he cares a lot about your feelings. It's just... he doesn't know how to express it.
Yoimiya: Maybe if you turned that frown upside down once in a while, he might feel more at ease.
Morihiko: Yeah, I guess I'm probably too serious around him...
Morihiko: Which is strange, because I don't think I'm anything like that when I'm talking with other people...
Yoimiya: Don't worry about it! No one's perfect. If you have any more trouble in the future, just come to me.
Yoimiya: Even if it's not fireworks-related, I'll happily oblige. Customers come first, always.
Morihiko: Haha, alright then. Everyone's always saying what a good kid you are. Your father must be very proud of you.
Morihiko: Go ahead and take the ore, by the way. It's on the house.
Yoimiya: Oh no you don't! That's out of the question!
Morihiko: Don't worry, just take it as a token of my gratitude.
Yoimiya: Gratitude won't pay your bills, though... Don't do this to me, can't we just play by normal business rules here?
Morihiko: I already said it's fine. Please, just take it. Surely you've got a whole load of other things you need to get done today?
Yoimiya: Um... Well, how about this, then: I'll record this in my notebook, and we can consider it a down payment against any fireworks you want to purchase in the future.
Morihiko: *sigh* There's no convincing you, is there...
Morihiko: Alright then, if you insist.
Morihiko: Pass on my regards to your dad. Tell him Morihiko wishes him health and happiness.
Yoimiya: Will do. You look after yourself as well. Don't push yourself too hard — you don't wanna make yourself ill again.
Paimon: Everyone seems to really like you, Yoimiya.
Traveler: Seems like you'd happily do anything for anyone.
Yoimiya: You're not the first person to say that. In fact, some people think I'll literally do any favor they ask me to.
Yoimiya: When that happens, I say to them "Hey! This is a fireworks store! We do fireworks!"
Yoimiya: But, ugh. They don't always listen. So, it can't be helped... but also, it's not really a big deal.
Yoimiya: Anyway, we've got all the materials we need now, so that solves that problem!
Yoimiya: Next, we just need to go find someone to process them!
Traveler: Fireworks are pretty important to Inazumans, huh?
Yoimiya: Well, for one thing, if you want to commemorate something, naturally you're gonna want something loud, bright, and beautiful.
Yoimiya: But I think more importantly than that, everyone trusts us. If it wasn't for our customers, we wouldn't be able to stay in business.
Traveler: Sorry for the trouble.

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: Hajime, Mr. Amenoma! It's me!
Hajime: Ah, Yoimiya. If I'm not mistaken, you must be here for some firework materials?
Paimon: Seems like everyone knows how busy Yoimiya gets leading up to the fireworks show.
Hajime: I'm very sorry, would you be able to wait for a while? I have quite a backlog of weapons orders right now.
Yoimiya: No worri— Oh wait, actually... Ahh, yeah, that could be a problem... some worries.
Yoimiya: Oh, how about this! Do you need a hand? As long as we can get through your orders, you can help me process my ore, right?
Hajime: Uh... that will depend on my master...
Yoimiya: Oh, you don't mind, do you, Mr. Amenoma! As you know, it's not long now until the Naganohara Fireworks Show starts.
Yoimiya: There's still a lot of fireworks left to make. If I don't finish them on time...
Amenoma Tougo: Talkative as ever, I see, dear child.
Amenoma Tougo: The essence of Amenoma Art is patience and focus. When the mind is disturbed, it will show in the blade that is forged.
Amenoma Tougo: If you badger Hajime like this, you will only succeed in disrupting his concentration.
Hajime: B—But, this is a special circumstance, surely! The Naganohara Fireworks Show is right around the corner...
Amenoma Tougo: So give me your ore, and I will process it for you.
Hajime: Huh!? Master... you mean, you'll do the work personally?
Amenoma Tougo: Is that so surprising? It is, after all, the only option.
Yoimiya: Thank you for helping out, Mr. Amenoma!
Amenoma Tougo: You're quite welcome. The Naganohara Fireworks Show is an important event, this I know well. In addition to this, I am indebted to Ryuunosuke for all the business he has given me.
Amenoma Tougo: But Yoimiya... you should plan things more carefully in the future. Do not rush everything at the last minute.
Yoimiya: Hehe, I'll try my best. In the future, I'll get some extra materials in to cover any unexpected changes of plan late in the day.
Amenoma Tougo: *sigh* Though for you, dear child, no matter how much you prepare in advance, it may never be enough...
Amenoma Tougo: Excuse me. I will be back shortly.
Yoimiya: Wow, Mr. Amenoma! Just look at the shape and size of these grains... It's beautiful. I'm at a loss for words.
Yoimiya: It's been a while since I've seen you take up your tools, but it looks like your craft hasn't degraded one bit.
Amenoma Tougo: Of course. I have studied these techniques my whole life... they are impossible for me to forget.
Paimon: So have Amenoma Art and Naganohara Fireworks been working together for a really long time already?
Amenoma Tougo: Back in the day, it was my master and Ryuunosuke's father. The people may have changed from one generation to another, but the ingredients required to make fireworks have remained the same.
Amenoma Tougo: Hajime, in the future, this will be up to you.
Hajime: I know, I know...
Yoimiya: Hahaha, alright, I won't bother you guys any longer. Remember to come and watch the fireworks!
Yoimiya: #Okay, {NICKNAME}, time to head off.
Yoimiya: Kouichi probably isn't back just yet, but let's go wait for him.

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: The boat is a-ready and waiting. I'll mark the location for you on the map. Before you leave, I recommend that you pack some food and water. You can never be too prepared.
Sakujirou: Ah...
Sakujirou: *sigh* After how much effort it took to get back in, it's hard to convince myself to leave again... especially when I'll be going up against the stormy ocean on a tiny little boat... My prospects don't look great.
Yoimiya: Well, they won't look much better if you get caught by the Tenryou Commission...
Yoimiya: I'm afraid that sooner or later, they are going to find you here. Time is starting to run out.
Sakujirou: I'm sorry, I'll make sure to get out of here before they come. I promise I won't cause you and your family any more trouble.
Yoimiya: I didn't mean it like that. If we ever ran into any problems, I'm sure I'd figure something out.
Yoimiya: But if the Tenryou Commission does catch up to you, then make a run for the boat.
Sakujirou: Okay. I won't let them catch me...
Sakujirou: But... *sigh* Ah, I guess this whole trip was a waste in the end.
Paimon: Why did you wanna come back to Inazuma anyway? Is there something you wanted to do?
Sakujirou: I didn't use to like this place at all, that's why I left. But looking back on things now, I was really just running away from my responsibilities.
Sakujirou: Once I started to realize that, I got restless. I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the things I'd left behind...
Sakujirou: So, I... Ah, forget it, what does it matter now. It's too late, anyway. I originally wanted to make up for all my regrets, but instead, I found myself in the situation I'm in now.
Yoimiya: *sigh* What a pity...
Paimon: Talk to us about it, maybe we could—
Yoimiya: If only there was no Sakoku Decree, huh.
Yoimiya: Anyway, don't worry, we're not going to bother you about it. We'll keep trying to buy you as much time as possible until you reach your final decision.
Yoimiya: The Tenryou Commission... If only they weren't so overzealous, there might be a way...
Yoimiya: Oh, that's right! That elderly couple, old customers of ours — their son's in the Tenryou Commission, isn't he? Yeah, quite high up, as well.
Yoimiya: That's it! I'll go talk to them. Maybe they can do something!
Sakujirou: Um... Are you sure they won't just report me instead?
Yoimiya: Oh, don't worry about that. They're really nice people, I know them well. They won't cause us any issues.
Yoimiya: Alright, you should get back indoors, Sakujirou. We'll be back in no time at all.
Yoimiya: Okay, let's go. Time waits for no one.
Yoimiya: Wait, hang on... What about the fireworks? All those materials... there's so many orders to finish...
Yoimiya: ...Pops! Pops!
Yoimiya: Oh, never mind. I know, I'll write him a note telling him to sort out the fireworks!

## Talk 6

Paimon: That's way too small!
Traveler: It is technically sturdy though...
Kouichi: Can't be helped, I'm afraid, this is the biggest and sturdiest boat that I can provide. It's built from the finest Inazuman timber.
Kouichi: Still, I'll be the first to admit that if he's planning to ride this into the storm, it's going to be exceedingly dangerous...
Yoimiya: I'm also hoping Sakujirou won't have to use it. It's just there as a last resort.
Yoimiya: I gotta say, though, Kouichi, it feels like your craft has improved once again.
Kouichi: Haha, I'm not the one you should be praising. It's all thanks to the guys who kindly pitched in.
Kouichi: To avoid detection, we each worked on our own materials separately, then assembled them secretly in the night.
Kouichi: This is the largest we could afford to build it. Any bigger and there's no way it would pass the Tenryou Commission's inspection.
Yoimiya: Let's store the boat here for now, then. I'll fill Sakujirou in when I get back, he'll need to make some preparations before setting sail.
Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon feels really worried all of a sudden... Uh... Doesn't helping Sakujirou make you a collaborator in the eyes of the Tenryou Commission?
Yoimiya: Haha, maybe it does, but I knew what I was getting into from the moment I agreed to help him.
Yoimiya: My family has pretty good connections with the Yashiro Commission. We work very closely with them. And whenever there's a national event of any sort, the other two Commissions come to us, too.
Yoimiya: As long as I'm polite and respectful and don't cause a fuss, they won't look to cause trouble for me, either.
Yoimiya: And anyway, to your point about collaboration... you've been helping out too, right?
Paimon: That's true, this was all a collaborative effort... wait, huh? *gasp* Oh no!
Traveler: We were chased by the Millelith in Liyue, too.
Yoimiya: Ah, so you're seasoned crooks already, eh? Don't know what I was worried about then! Hehe.
Yoimiya: Anyway, thanks for everything, Kouichi.
Yoimiya: Oh, and your fireworks are ready, so just go and pick them up from my house whenever you want. While you're there, you can get my pops to settle the boat construction fees.
Kouichi: Oh, don't worry about paying anything. Third Sis would be sure to scold me if she found out I'd taken Mora from the Naganoharas.
Paimon: Who's Third Sis?
Yoimiya: Oh! Uh, let me explain this one, it's a story my pops told me. There used to be a thriving merchants' guild in Inazuma, it got really prosperous.
Yoimiya: At one point, there were a dozen or so kids born around the same time to the families of the guild. They all grew up together, each of them learning their respective family's business.
Yoimiya: They were a tightly knit group of friends, but eventually, they all grew up and decided they each wanted to go into business themselves.
Yoimiya: It was inevitable that their business would send them all to different corners of the world, and that they'd have far less opportunity to see each other in the future.
Kouichi: That's right. Just before we went our separate ways, the eldest of the group suggested that we should all go watch some fireworks together one last time.
Yoimiya: Hehe, they were all very ambitious types, and each had their own knack for doing business. One by one, they left, until Kouichi was the only one of them remaining in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: After that, he hardly saw them. But whenever one of them did come back to visit, fireworks would always be involved.
Kouichi: Yeah, no matter how close you and your friends are, there's always going to be some distance after being separated for a long time. But as soon as the fireworks lit up the sky, it'd instantly take us right back to our childhood, and we'd be chatting away like in the old days.
Kouichi: To us, those memories are eternal.
Paimon: Ohh, so this is what you meant when you were talking about commemorating things.
Yoimiya: Yep, that's exactly right. That's why I can't let people down when they're counting on me for their fireworks.
Yoimiya: Anyway, I need to go update Sakujirou. See you, Kouichi! Thanks again for your help!
Kouichi: Yeah, I should get out of here, too. I don't want to get caught red-handed.
Traveler: Do we have to be the bad guys in Inazuma as well?
Traveler: Makes me think of Atsuko.
