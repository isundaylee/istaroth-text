## Talk 1

Traveler: I have other things to do.
Sara: Okay. I'll look for someone else to help out...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Sara: That would be great, thank you!
Sara: Please be careful while you make the delivery. *Don't let any strange elements touch the food*.
Sara: Also, *do your best to avoid monsters, or they might knock the dish over*.
Sara: Please hurry, this dish won't taste good if it gets cold.

## Talk 3

Short-Tempered Wallit: Why hasn't my order arrived yet... What's with all this dilly-dallying, anyway?

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Yup, you've come at just the right moment â€” I'd just finished preparing this Sweet Madame.
Sara: Wallit ordered it earlier, and requested that we deliver it to a location west of the Dawn Winery later in the day...
Sara: If you don't mind helping us out, could you take his order to him real quick?
