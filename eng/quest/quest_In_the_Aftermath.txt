# In the Aftermath


## Talk 1

Huffman: *sigh* If we just had a couple more people on hand...
Traveler: What are the other knights doing?
Huffman: Maintaining the city's defenses, helping with the rebuilding effort, and a whole host of other odd jobs.
Huffman: Every last knight we have is up to their eyeballs in work right now.
Huffman: For once, guard duty at the main gate is the relatively easy job.
Traveler: You could solicit help from the Adventurers' Guild.
Huffman: In fact, we're lucky to have had their assistance from the outset. At first, they were helping find and rescue victims in the city, more recently they've been keeping watch on monster activity further afield.
Huffman: When the monsters began gathering near to the city, it was thanks to the adventurers who carried out early reconnaissance and reported back to us that we were able to make specific and effective plans for the defense effort.
Huffman: Even now, they are hard at work supporting all our efforts to get the city back on its feet. Honestly, without them, the Knights would be starting to crumble under the load.
Huffman: I must make time to thank Cyrus properly...

## Talk 2

Huffman: How's your progress? Finished clearing the area yet?
Traveler: All done.
Huffman: Fantastic. You've been an enormous help, who knows how much longer those ugly things would've been stood there otherwise...
Huffman: Honorary Knight, please accept these as an expression of my gratitude.
