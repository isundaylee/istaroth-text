Traveler: What are you waiting for?
Xiaodong: Cargo I ordered.
Xiaodong: The tea and ore I brought are all sold out. I'm just waiting to load the blankets and spices from Sumeru so I can get back to Liyue Harbor.
Xiaodong: It's just those spices I ordered a long while ago that still haven't showed up...
Xiaodong: My contact could only say they're on the road. I think he's just trying to stall me.
Xiaodong: It's better to wait at the dock myself.
