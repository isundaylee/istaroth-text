Traveler: How do you like it here?
Navia: I like this place a lot! It's really nice.
Navia: The scenery is wonderful, and I love what you've done with the interior — very tasteful. You never fail to impress.
Traveler: Thanks. Not quite as nice as your place, though.
Navia: Oh, don't be silly. It's not a competition.
Navia: Every home's character is unique to its owner. It's not a question of good or bad, just... personality.
Navia: Yeah, that sums it up nicely — your home is a reflection of your personality!
Navia: Just one look around here, and I can tell that this place belongs to you and Paimon.
Traveler: What kind of style do you like in a home?
Navia: Hmm... cozy and practical, I guess? Beyond that, I'm really not that picky.
Navia: Melus actually did most of the interior decor at my place. I've always been quite fond of his style, and now that I've gotten used to it, I'm reluctant to change things up.
Traveler: Well, if you like it here, you're welcome to visit whenever you want!
Navia: Really? Literally, whenever I want? Because I'll definitely be taking you up on that offer.
Navia: Don't worry, I'll make sure to always come with snacks. Home-made cookies, little cakes... and whatever else you like.
Navia: Oh, and I'm happy to bring enough for Paimon, too!
