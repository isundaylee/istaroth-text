Traveler: When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
Hautemontagne: Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
Hautemontagne: I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
Hautemontagne: See, all this takes time, so I won't be able to go back for quite a while.
