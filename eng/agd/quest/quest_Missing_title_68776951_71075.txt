# Missing title (68776951)

???: Hey, you! Yes, you!
???: Someone familiar with this place like you could find what that Erge lug couldn't, I'll bet.
???: No? Well, I'll just wait for someone who can, make 'em find it, and get it off them.
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): They call me The Qingce Kid, and no measly motley of Chasm miners is going to stop me, or I'll never show my face again out there. Well then! Give me the thing.
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): We'll take the Millelith's treasure, thank you very much!
Traveler: I don't know what you're looking for...
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): And what you say goes, eh?
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): ...Hmph. You know, I thought all that running around would've made you look a bit tougher.
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): Well, I'll give you a choice. You can give me the Helm of Warding, or you can give it to me after I've knocked your lights out.
Traveler: ...I doubt you actually want to fight me.
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): Oh, look who's talking big?
??? ("The Qingce Kid"): Looks like you'll have to learn the hard way!
Traveler: ...But you won't find it here.
