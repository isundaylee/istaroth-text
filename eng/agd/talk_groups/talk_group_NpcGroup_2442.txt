Traveler: Who might you be?
Luoxia: This one's humble name is Luoxia. I handle... many things onboard this ship. But do not misunderstand. I am not the master here.
Luoxia: Our boss is Rouran. There are very, very few who have the privilege of meeting the boss...
Luoxia: If I may say one more thing... If you do indeed meet our boss, do be mindful of your actions.
Luoxia: Our boss may seem like a delicate flower, but you will find few thorns to match in all of Liyue Harbor.
Luoxia: I will say no more, but do bear what I have said in mind.
