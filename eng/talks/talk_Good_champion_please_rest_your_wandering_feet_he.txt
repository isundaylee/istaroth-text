Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Good champion, please, rest your wandering feet here for a spell...
Traveler: Why are you here...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It is just as you see, valiant warrior. I and my brothers-in-arms defend this place, just as we have every day for millennia.
Traveler: A legion? You've got help, then?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): In the past, yes, but they have departed.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Or perhaps they laid down their obsessions and hatreds over the winding years. Perhaps, they were even consumed by said passions, casting duty aside and embracing senseless slaughter.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Only I still stand guard here.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Noble warrior, come you from the capital? Could you bring word to the citizens there that Legio VI has done their duty â€” that not a single vishap has passed our leaguer?
Traveler: Are there still vishaps in here?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Nay, not for many years now... But the history of our battle has been recorded in the "Symphony" somehow, playing over and over like an opera...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I, too, cannot discern truth from illusion. Do you wish to enter and see? A champion from the capital will see no danger there, so please, inscribe our history using your hands and eyes.
Traveler: What is this place?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Caesareum Palace was what we named it once, but today, naught is left but wrack and ruin.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I and fellow legionnaires of Legion Athanatoi defend it still, as we have for thousands of years.
