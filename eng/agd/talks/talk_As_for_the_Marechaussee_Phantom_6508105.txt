Traveler: As for the Marechaussee Phantom...
Plessia: That organization was once comprised only of humans, but now the majority of them are Melusines.

Plessia: I apologize if I get a little excited at times. Please understand.
Plessia: After all, the lovely Melusines are treasured companions of us Fontainians.
