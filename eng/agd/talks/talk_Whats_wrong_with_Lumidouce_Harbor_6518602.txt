Traveler: What's wrong with Lumidouce Harbor?
Kimpel: Look at all those ships down there. Do you think there are more vessels from Fontaine or other places?
Kimpel: Once, there were more Fontainian ships in the harbor. I don't know when it started, but at some point, there were more foreign ships instead.
Kimpel: If this continues, can this harbor still be considered Fontaine's harbor?
