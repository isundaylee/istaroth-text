Nervous An: Hmm... What should I write on this gift envelope...
Nervous An: Ugh, what is this? When I'm up to my eyebrows in work, bright ideas cling to me like dead skin, but now that the festive season's upon us, they've all sloughed off and fled for the hills!
Nervous An: I was going to ask some Linling for some special ideas, but... You know what, I'd rather find a book of this year's popular festive phrases and just copy that.
Nervous An: Forget it, there's still some time. I can just... find some work for which I can apply overtime. Maybe that'll bring the inspiration rushing right back.
