Traveler: How's business been?
Ramsay: It was quite good at first. Exotic items from faraway lands will sell well anywhere, after all.
Ramsay: But later on, the Resistance emerged in Sangonomiya due to the confiscation of Visions by the Shogunate. Business has gotten worse ever since that war started.
Ramsay: That just won't do. How can there be a healthy market in this environment? The way I see it, the Shogunate is stabbing itself in the foot... *sigh*
Ramsay: But now that the Sakoku Decree has been abolished, I think things should pick up here again. I mean, life resurges wherever the blood flows, am I right?
Ramsay: I mean, the weather in Inazuma remains very comfortable. And Komore Teahouse is very safe and secure. So all in all, I'm in no hurry to leave, haha.
