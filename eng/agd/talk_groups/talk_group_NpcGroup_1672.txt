Tommy: Ugh, why oh why didn't I read the fine print... Oh, if only I hadn't taken this commission...

Traveler: What's getting you down?
Tommy: I'm talking about a commission that I took on a while back.
Tommy: I thought at the time that it was a low-ranking commission, and what was more, the commissioner was Su— Ahem, I mean, a lady alchemist whose work I've admired for a time now.
Tommy: ...At the time, I thought that we might be able to strike up some sort of long-term cooperative relationship should I complete the commission...
Tommy: But when I regained my senses, I realized that I'd bitten off more than I could chew...

Traveler: Is the commission that difficult?
Tommy: Well, it's not, I just need to collect some alchemical reagents. But... I didn't realize that the location was Dragonspine!
Tommy: Once you factor in the location, this suddenly becomes a commission for top-ranking adventurers only!
Tommy: Something clearly went wrong with the Guild's rating for this commission... But I'm also at fault for not checking the details carefully. *sigh*
