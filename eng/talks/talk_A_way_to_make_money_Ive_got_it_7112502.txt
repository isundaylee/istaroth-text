Patrice: A way to make money! I've got it!
Patrice: See, if you just attach the Receiver Crystal to the rope-pull mechanism that controls the lighting, all you have to do is activate the Transmitter Crystal from afar and... ta-da! Lights off!
Anatole: The rope-pull mechanism that goes with the Receiver Crystal would cost an absolute fortune.
Patrice: In the early stages of applying new technologies, costs are always high. But once there's demand for it and production takes off, they'll gradually come down.
Anatole: But... Wouldn't it make more sense to just use a longer rope? It'd be cheaper and have exactly the same effect as your mechanism...
Patrice: Uhh... Well, you can also attach the Receiver Crystal to things that you're prone to losing. If you happen to misplace such an item, simply activate the Transmitter Crystal and... voila! Item found again!
Anatole: Great idea! But... what if I lose the Transmitter Crystal?
Patrice: In that case, just attach another Receiver Crystal to your Transmitter Crystal... That way, I'll earn double the money too! You're a genius, Anatole!
Anatole: I'm not sure if I'm a genius, but it's clear that you're nowhere close to deserving that epithet... *sigh* Patrice, think of something practical for once, would you?
Patrice: Uhh...
