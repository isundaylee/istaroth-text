Traveler: About Naku Weed
Paimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its "petals" are in fact leaves.
Paimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...
Paimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.
Traveler: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?
