Traveler: About Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals...
Pitot: Same old rules.
Pitot: Excellent. That said, I suppose we probably won't meet again to conduct another one of these happy little transactions.
Pitot: Mysterious things are only mysterious because they're rare. I did buy some Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals from another adventurer before this. Only saw him three times, though.
Pitot: According to him, he was able to find these things three times â€” never again. Maybe there's some strange rule of nature at work.
Pitot: If you ask me, we'd best leave some of this world's secrets undisturbed.
