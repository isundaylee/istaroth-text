Traveler: What's the situation with Zhiqiong?
Muning: The search-and-rescue team hasn't had news of her yet. But please don't panic... This isn't the time to panic just yet.
Muning: We should have news of her shortly.
Muning: As for me, I believe that she's still alive. Adventurers are a tough lot, so she shouldn't... Um, sorry...
Muning: *cough* But if you do meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.
