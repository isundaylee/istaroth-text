# Upon the Plain, a Purple Shadow


## Talk 1

Paimon: The Detective Agency knows the most about what goes on in town.
Paimon: Let's see what Ryuuji has to say!

## Talk 2

Kagotsurube Isshin (???): Huh? So you don't have a Vision after all.
Kagotsurube Isshin (???): Seems like I've mistaken you for someone else.
Paimon: At the very least, you should make sure you've got the right person before you go attacking them!
Paimon: No, wait... even when you've got the right person, you shouldn't go attacking them out of the blue! It's dangerous!
Kagotsurube Isshin (???): Have you ever met someone by the name of Kaedehara Kazuha?
Kagotsurube Isshin (???): He carries a sword, just like you. I've also heard that he possesses an Anemo Vision.
Traveler: Why are you looking for him?
Kagotsurube Isshin (???): That's none of your business.
Kagotsurube Isshin (???): Hmph, never mind. You don't look like you know anything anyway. I'm wasting my time.
Paimon: What the heck is this guy's problem? Coming around here, waving that weird sword in our faces... and didn't even apologize! Seems like a real nutcase.
Paimon: Well, one thing's for sure... No way are we telling him anything about Kazuha.
Traveler: Couldn't agree more.
Paimon: Right? Paimon has a feeling though, that even if this guy gets to challenge Kazuha to a duel, he won't be able to beat him.
Paimon: Anyway, just to be on the safe side, we should go find Kazuha right away and tell him to watch his back.
Traveler: Actually, I have a hunch...
Paimon: Oh? What kind of hunch?
Traveler: I think this guy may have a special connection to Kazuha.
Paimon: A special connection? You mean, beyond already knowing each other?
Traveler: I can't say for sure, but...
Paimon: Hmm, yeah, maybe a little... But then again, most people look pretty much the same once they start fighting, so that doesn't really prove anything...
Paimon: Anyway, there's no time to lose — let's go tell Kazuha, so he won't get into any danger!
Paimon: Paimon heard that the Crux Fleet is stocking up in Ritou at the moment. Let's look for him there.
Traveler: ...I feel like their fighting styles are kind of similar.
Traveler: Very smart! ...For once.
Paimon: Hey, don't be mean. Paimon's smart lots of the time!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, hello! Do you know where Kazuha is?
Chao: You're looking for Kazuha too, huh? Guess he must've done something impressive after all.
Traveler: "Too"?
Chao: Hahaha, well, we took the small vessels into Ritou on a routine supply run — only this time, as soon as we entered the harbor, we ran into a huge crowd of Inazumans, all of them wanting to know about Kazuha.
Chao: If it's because of that battle on Nazuchi Beach, Captain Beidou had a great run there too, but I don't see her getting this kind of attention!
Chao: Kazuha keeps to himself most of the time. In fact, there are times when he doesn't even listen to the captain, but she just laughs it off...
Paimon: Oh? So, you still don't know what he did.
Chao: I've heard bits and pieces. Something about him blocking the Raiden Shogun's "Musou no Hitotachi."
Chao: Is it really as big a deal as everyone's making it out to be?
Traveler: You could compare it to the technique Beidou used to strike down Haishan.
Chao: Really? Wow, when you put it like that, it all makes sense. Hahaha, in that case, his new-found stardom is well-deserved!
Chao: He was called away earlier by some people from the Tenryou Commission. They said they had something important to discuss with him.
Chao: I thought they'd come to arrest him at first... turns out they couldn't have been friendlier to him. Seems like they really respect the guy.
Paimon: Just a little while ago, this would have been completely unimaginable...
Traveler: The Shogunate probably wants to show some goodwill.
Paimon: Thank you! Guess we'll go pay a visit to the Tenryou Commission.
Chao: Alright then. I'll just stay here and carry on trying to fend off the crowd.
Traveler: After all, the Raiden Shogun's mindset has changed.

## Talk 4

Kaedehara Kazuha: #Oh? It's you, Traveler.
Kujou Kamaji: Greetings. We were just discussing the repealing of the Vision Hunt Decree. Since you're here, you're very welcome to listen in on the conversation.
Kujou Kamaji: We invited Mr. Kaedehara here to extend a gesture of goodwill on behalf of the Shogunate.
Kujou Kamaji: Your hard work has secured for us the agreeable state of affairs that we now enjoy. Also, I have been granted the chance to correct my clan's past mistakes, and for that, I am deeply grateful.
Kujou Kamaji: The Almighty Shogun has issued a large array of directives aimed at resolving, or at least easing, the tensions that have built up over the years.
Kujou Kamaji: The Tri-Commission has made the recommendation to use this opportunity to restore the honor of the Kaedehara name.
Kujou Kamaji: Regarding the history of the Kaedehara Clan... I trust that you are already somewhat informed?
Traveler: I've heard a thing or two.
Kujou Kamaji: In short, there once was a group of select bladesmiths who served the Shogun directly, responsible for upholding and further developing the traditional blade-forging arts of the Almighty Shogun. The Kaedehara Clan belonged to this class.
Kujou Kamaji: But there came a time when some of these bladesmiths revolted and fled to Snezhnaya. Both the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans were held accountable for lax oversight, and entered a period of great turmoil.
Kujou Kamaji: We later learned that the whole misadventure had been secretly orchestrated by the Fatui. Attributing all of the blame to the Kamisato and Kaedehara Clans was neither proper, nor just.
Kujou Kamaji: Considering Mr. Kaedehara has once more made an outstanding contribution to Inazuma, the Almighty Shogun believes he should not only be rewarded for his achievements, but also receive recompense for the excessive punishment borne by his clan in the past.
Kujou Kamaji: In the interest of preventing further harassment of the bladesmith clans by the Fatui, we chose not to publicly release the findings of our investigations into these matters. We trust you can understand why this was necessary.
Kaedehara Kazuha: This is a true honor. I am delighted to be in a position to receive the goodwill of the Almighty Shogun and the Shogunate at large.
Kaedehara Kazuha: However... would I be correct to assume that this magnanimous gesture does not come without some strings attached?
Kujou Kamaji: I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. We seek only to correct a past injustice.
Kujou Kamaji: With the Kaedehara Clan's reputation and occupation restored, the Kaedeharas will be bladesmiths once more, and your wanderings will finally come to an end.
Kujou Kamaji: You will be able to lead a safe and prosperous life in Inazuma City with the Almighty Shogun's blessing and the full support of the Shogunate.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I have grown accustomed to life among the elements, I fear I would no longer feel at home behind the tall walls of a stately abode.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yet my ancestors did indeed take great pride in the name of Kaedehara and the art of blademaking for which it stood. I do have a responsibility to restore their honor.
Kujou Kamaji: I sense some hesitation in your words.
Kujou Kamaji: Should you accept this offer, I imagine many of the malicious rumors currently circulating through the populace will disappear.
Paimon: Malicious rumors? All we heard on the way here was so much praise that we almost wondered whether there was another Kaedehara Kazuha in town.
Kujou Kamaji: Well, to some, the Musou no Hitotachi is something that can never be defeated. They cannot accept the idea that Mr. Kaedehara really parried the Shogun's strike.
Kujou Kamaji: Also, eye-witnesses saw him using the power of Electro in addition to that of Anemo. As a result, the falsehood that "Kaedehara Kazuha was using a Delusion" began to spread...
Paimon: What? But that doesn't make sense. Using a Delusion turns you old and frail, and Kazuha still looks fine...
Kujou Kamaji: That is correct. However, to some people, the idea of a single person wielding two elements at once is a more inconceivable notion still.
Kaedehara Kazuha: This is just one of many similar rumors. I am very uncomfortable with being the subject of public discussion, no matter whether it brings suspicion or stardom my way.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But perhaps, if the Shogunate is willing to publicly support me, this situation will blow over more quickly...
Kujou Kamaji: This is precisely why I'd encourage you to give our offer some serious thought. It stands to benefit all of us.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm. Please allow me some time to consider.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In fact, let us put this discussion on hold for the moment. Well then, what brings the two of you here?
Paimon: Yikes, we nearly forgot about the most important thing!
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon recount the attack on the outskirts of town to Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Why would such a dangerous individual be looking for me...?
Traveler: Do you have any siblings?
Kaedehara Kazuha: No. This puzzles me as much as it does you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My fighting forms were taught to me by my family, based on techniques originally developed for blade-testing. We undergo rigorous training to standardize every motion the blade is put through, so that each can be fairly assessed for quality.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Over time, these techniques came to form something of a Kaedehara sword art, focused on blade-testing but with a full repertoire of combat forms.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Those forms are quite different from the more practical ones typically used by samurai in battle, so it's hard to imagine that the similarity you speak of was coincidence alone...
Paimon: All the more reason to watch your back! This guy was a serious nutcase.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed. He sounds highly aggressive. Anyone he targets is at risk of serious injury, or worse.
Kujou Kamaji: In that case, I will send some men out immediately to search for him.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you. I must say, I am now very curious about this matter, and I will also need some time to consider your offer.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #I will first join the Traveler in investigating the one who attacked him, then give you a conclusive answer upon my return.
Kujou Kamaji: Very well. Please stay safe.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Come on. Let's go and track down your aggressor.
Traveler: Could it be someone you trained with under the same master?
Traveler: I forget.
