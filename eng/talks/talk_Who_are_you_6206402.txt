Traveler: Who are you?
Hongyu: We're the Millelith guards for this area. I'm Hongyu, and that's Kun.
Hongyu: Liyue Harbor's a pretty safe place. I've not seen any big trouble the whole time I've been in uniform. Maybe you get a few more pickpockets and petty thieves around Chihu Rock, but that's about it.
Hongyu: Hey, have you heard about Lantern Rite?
Hongyu: It's a festival people in Liyue celebrate. Takes place on the night of the first full moon every year. It's the biggest festival of the whole year, too.
Hongyu: On the night of the festival, the whole city lights lanterns all night long. It makes the place as bright as day.
Hongyu: Also, we have a special floating lantern too. Unique to Liyue. It's quite a sight to behold, and you won't find anything like it elsewhere.
Hongyu: Anyway, just thought if you're new in town, it's something you definitely wouldn't want to miss!
