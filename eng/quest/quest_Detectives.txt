# Detectives


## Talk 1

Investigate: Missing text (389798274)

## Talk 2

Chevreuse: Aha, just as we thought — this is where the Imitation Sinthe was being made...
Traveler: [Medicine] (Help Chevreuse identify the drugs...)
Traveler: These bottles and jars... They're all Imitation Sinthe?
Chevreuse: ...Looks like he's got more than just Imitation Sinthe stashed around here... In addition to the raw materials needed to synthesize the substance itself, there's a large quantity of cleaning agents and a few drugs I haven't been able to identify.
Chevreuse: These cleaning agents are likely used to dispel traces of the substance... like its smell.
Chevreuse: The Special Patrol did some digging into Imitation Sinthe. Our records indicate that it's very difficult for ordinary people to detect traces left behind by this stuff. I'm sure that was the case for Pierre as well.
Chevreuse: It must have taken a considerable amount of time and skill to ensure all those traces get washed away.
Chevreuse: But what are these other drugs for...

## Talk 3

Lynette: ...When the Marechaussee Phantom searched Pierre's house, there was no sign of these barrels, right?
Traveler: He must've moved them. But carrying them all the way out here would attract way too much attention.
Lynette: You're right. That doesn't seem like his way of doing things... How did he get them here then?
Traveler: (Examine the barrels...)
Investigate: (The barrels show signs of water damage. Dried-up water stains can be seen around the circumference of the barrels...)
Investigate: (There seems to be a pattern to the location of the water stains. For some reason, they appear to be limited to the lower half of the barrels.)
Investigate: (The lids don't seem very tight, leaving sizeable gaps around the edges. But, there doesn't appear to be any traces of water inside the barrels.)
Lynette: Only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water...

## Talk 4

Lyney: The material these bags are made of... It's quite rare...
Traveler: [Knowledge] (Help Lyney assess the material...)
Traveler: Doesn't it look similar to the material used for your Magic Pockets?
Lyney: ...It's the very same, actually — Romaritime Flower fiber. But, there's something special about the composition of these bags. I took a closer look, and it appears they're not only waterproof but also corrosion and leak-resistant.
Lyney: Even the strings look specially designed to keep the bags closed nice and tight.
Lyney: I came across some bags made of the same material just now, but they were much smaller and thinner. From the look of them, they seemed far less durable as well.
Traveler: So... kind of like one of those small, sealed bags?
Lyney: ...Very similar, actually. Normally, it would be easy for a Guard Poodle to sniff out the Imitation Sinthe, but if it was sealed away in a bag like that, it might be possible to elude detection for some time.
Lyney: But what could these big bags be for then... If the goal is to keep the Imitation Sinthe hidden and sealed away, these bags seem a bit too conspicuous...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lynette: ...
Traveler: Something on your mind still?
Lynette: Ah, it was that obvious, huh... Well, even though it didn't feel like Bernard was lying, after talking to him, I'm getting an even stronger sense that something's not quite right.
Lynette: We investigated so quickly that perhaps we've missed a thing or two along the way. Let me activate deduction mode and consider things again from the top to see if we can find anything new.
Lynette: ...Is there still anything unresolved or strange that we should try to consider?

### Additional Talk 2

Chourei: Ah, sorry, but I can't go with you... Surely, you'll be able to handle him, what between Elodie's Gardemek and all three of you?

### Additional Talk 3

Lynette: Perhaps... we are now closing in on the truth.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: About what we found in Poisson...
Lynette: The Marechaussee Phantom found Bonnie and the Lefevere pendant at Pierre's residence. That was the beginning point of our investigation.

### Additional Talk 5

Lynette: Why would he leave such an obvious trail for us to follow when he took so much care to not leave any traces of Imitation Sinthe in his home?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: About Bernard's letters...
Lynette: Bernard claims to have received a letter last night from Pierre. In the letter, Pierre stated that he had gone into hiding. Is there something wrong with the letter...?

### Additional Talk 7

Lynette: If Bonnie had Imitation Sinthe in her body, then she was a liability that had to be recovered at all costs. But if she wasn't carrying anything, then it would have made sense to tell Bernard not to worry.
Lynette: And thinking about it, Bernard only attracted our attention in the first place because he came to look for Bonnie.
Lynette: Could it be that the person who wrote the letter also knew nothing about Bonnie's whereabouts... or they had a separate goal entirely?

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: There's an unexplained part in the operations of this trafficking ring...
Lynette: Well, we've discovered that Bernard is responsible for the trafficking, while Pierre deals with "supplying the goods." Is there something else in this scheme that we're missing?

### Additional Talk 9

Lynette: Yeah, according to Bernard, Pierre also supplied all of the goods... But if the Marechaussee Phantom's records are correct, Pierre should have lost all access to the materials required to create the Imitation Sinthe, and the Institute has also not reported any theft of their stocks.

### Additional Talk 10

Lynette: The final question is: why did I sense that something wasn't right after hearing Bernard's testimony? Even more so than before...

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Lynette: Deductive mode deactivated. I think... we may be close to the actual answer.

### Additional Talk 12

Lynette: Perhaps... we are now closing in on the truth.

### Additional Talk 13

Traveler: (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.

### Additional Talk 14

Traveler: (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.

### Additional Talk 15

Traveler: (No... I don't think that can be used to answer the question at hand.)
Lynette: There's no need to rush. Let's see if we can find any other suspicious points about this case.

### Additional Talk 16

Lynette: Only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water...

### Additional Talk 17

Chevreuse: But what are these other drugs for...

### Additional Talk 18

Lyney: But what could these big bags be for then... If the goal is to keep the Imitation Sinthe hidden and sealed away, these bags seem a bit too conspicuous...

### Additional Talk 19

Chevreuse: I can't believe how much progress we're making with this investigation... Without your help, getting this far would have taken me an awful lot of time and manpower.

### Additional Talk 20

Lyney: It's rare to see Lynette in serious mode... I wonder how long she'll keep it activated for.
