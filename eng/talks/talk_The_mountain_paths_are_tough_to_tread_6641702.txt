Traveler: The mountain paths are tough to tread.
Ruta: I agree. Now, if I was swimming it would be easy, no matter how far, but these steep mountain slopes...
Ruta: Though I've heard the locals say there are shrine maidens on Mt. Yougou. Shrine maidens are known to be skilled diviners, and that's all the incentive I need for the climb.
Ruta: I'm hoping for "Great Fortune"! I'm not quite sure what it represents, but I hear it's the best result possible.
Ruta: My luck's always been good. As long as I can make it up this mountain, I know there'll be great news waiting for me at the top!
