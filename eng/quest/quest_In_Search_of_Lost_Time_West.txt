Research Terminal: (There's a memo stuck next to the lever on the right side of the console. In neat and elegant handwriting, it reads, "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!")

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Pull the lever.
Paimon: #Whoa! What are you doing, Traveler?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You pull the lever without the slightest hesitation.
The entire tower then immediately trembles with a thunderous, ear-splitting rumble. It's as if the sky is crumbling and the earth is splitting...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Then... with a pop, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape right into your hands.
All is quiet once more.
Paimon: Is... Is that it?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't have a clue what's on it, but it looks pretty important...
Paimon: #Traveler, why don't we keep this paper tape for now? Who knows, it might come in handy later...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We probably shouldn't touch it...
Paimon: #R... Right. It does seem dangerous... Traveler, maybe we should take a step back...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? It's a console just like the one in that other tower from before...
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
Just like before, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape after a moment of rumbling and shaking...
Paimon: Hmm, it's paper tape, just like before...
Paimon: Paimon still doesn't get it, but we should probably take this stuff with us in case we need it later.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like a lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
After some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
Paimon: Great! Now we have the monitoring data from the Crepes Suzette Station!
Paimon: #All that's left now is the Pate de Fruit Station. Let's go, Traveler!

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like a lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!

Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
After some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
