Traveler: So, how've things been going lately?
Ogura Mio: It's still the same. The last time I got my hands on Liyue silk was when I was making that outfit for Miss Kamisato. My brother is also still somewhere far away...
Ogura Mio: Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
Ogura Mio: On the upside, business has been good and my brother is safe, so everything is going well.
Ogura Mio: If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.
