Daya: How about it? Care for a game of "Project Connectivity"?
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Daya: Alright. In that case, if you'll look over this way...
Traveler: I've got some other things to do.
Daya: Ah, is that so... It's alright. Our booth will be open for the entire duration of the Gala.
Daya: Whenever you feel like having a go, you can just come to me.
