# Treasure Lost, Treasure Found


## Talk 1

Soraya: Guizhong's Four Commandments... What are they really trying to tell us...
Traveler: I'm ready.
Soraya: Haha, raring to go! That's what I like to see. Then let's begin our reading of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
Soraya: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition — the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
Soraya: On the surface, it does read like a set of commandments. Golden rules for life.
Soraya: But it's also supposed to contain some sort of clues to a hidden treasure...
Soraya: ...I can't decipher it, though. It seems we'll have to approach this in what academics like to call the old-fashioned way...
Soraya: Those seven passages we found previously, they were all located in ruins of some sort.
Soraya: Since we're not sure where to start this time, perhaps keep searching in ruins for now.
Traveler: ...Where exactly?
Soraya: Hmm... For now, let's limit the search area to Guili Plains.
Soraya: However... as I'm just a scholar, there's no way I'd be able to keep up with you out in the field.
Soraya: So I will leave the actual ruin-searching to you. Just let me know what you find.
Soraya: While we're on the subject — I once came across a strange plate with some writing on in one of the ruins around here.
Soraya: I only looked at it in isolation though. Didn't do any sort of holistic analysis.
Soraya: Now I think about it, it might be connected to Guizhong's Four Commandments.
Soraya: How about I mark the location on your map? You should go check it out, maybe it'll lead somewhere.
Traveler: ...ALL the ruins?
Soraya: Obviously not... We'd never be able to cover all the ruins in Liyue just between the two of us.
Soraya: So let's limit the search area. Since the treasure has to do with the Guili Assembly from the Guili Plains...
Soraya: ...Let's restrict our search to the Guili Plains area for now.
Soraya: Oh, and one other thing. There's no way a scholar like me could keep up with you out in the field.
Soraya: So I will leave the actual ruin-searching to you. Just let me know what you find.
Traveler: Ruins of Liyue, here I come!
Soraya: Wait! Hold on a second! ...How exactly do you propose to cover every single ruin in Liyue!? It'll take you forever!
Soraya: You can't afford to get so excited every time you hear the word treasure, you know.
Soraya: How about this — since we know the treasure comes from the Guili Assembly in the Guili Plains, let's restrict the search area.
Soraya: Okay... to start with, let's limit the search to inside Guili Plains...
Soraya: Hold on! I'm not finished yet! ...Don't forget to search the ruins thoroughly. And if you find anything of interest, come back and let me know.
Soraya: Remember, stick to the Guili Plains! Don't let your boundless enthusiasm lead you further afield.
Traveler: Let's go find that treasure!!!
Soraya: Whew, the slightest mention of treasure and you're suddenly beside yourself with excitement... Hmm, so be it — let's begin our reading of Guizhong's Four Commandments.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'm definitely intrigued.
Soraya: I'll mark the first ruins I found on your map. I'd suggest starting there.
Soraya: If you do find something, don't make the amateur mistake of running off in your excitement. Be sure to *note down the clue* first.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, there's some writing on this plate! ...But it's barely readable.
Paimon: Paimon feels like it might have some special meaning.

## Talk 4

Soraya: I wonder how the Guili Assembly met its demise...

## Talk 5

Soraya: Sometimes fate is inescapable, even for a god...
Traveler: I found four clues in four ruins.
Soraya: Four ruins, four clues... And there are Four Commandments.
Soraya: Each of these clues expounds upon the meaning of one of the Four Commandments.
Soraya: To get to the correct interpretation, the original text of Guizhong's Four Commandments is key. These four are helpful, but peripheral to our enquiry.
Soraya: These five passages are all linked — but how?
Traveler: "Convergence..."
Soraya: Hmm... Could "convergence" mean that... these four things all link up in some way?
Soraya: Wait — I remember, each of Guizhong's Four Commandments can be found in a specific ruin...
Soraya: Hmm... I am speculating here, but perhaps the four *ruins* are relevant to deciphering the true meaning of Guizhong's Four Commandments...
Soraya: How exactly, I don't know. I need to mull it over. Maybe you could have a think too — or better still, go and investigate it firsthand.
Soraya: I'm just a skinny little scholar after all, I tire out completely after a few seconds on the run... Wish I had your stamina!
Soraya: Anyway, I'm going to keep thinking about it for a while. If you think of anything, or if you find anything, you know where I am.

## Talk 6

Soraya: It's a speculative hypothesis, but I believe the four ruins corresponding to each of Guizhong's Four Commandments may be relevant to deciphering their true meaning...
Soraya: Exactly what role the ruins are supposed to play, well, that's another question. And... I don't think I have the physical strength to test out each of my hypotheses in full...
Soraya: It's also possible that I just have a one-track mind, and this idea is leading me nowhere...

## Talk 7

Soraya: Did you find the treasure?

## Talk 8

Soraya: Did you find the treasure?

## Talk 9

Soraya: Did you find the treasure?

## Talk 10

Soraya: Did you find the treasure?

## Talk 11

Soraya: How is the search going? Found the treasure yet?
Traveler: Yes, it was about where they "converge" after all.
Soraya: Really... So it's just like Guizhong's Four Commandments says. The treasure was located at "the convergence of these four..."
Soraya: Whoever designed this riddle must have truly revered Guizhong.
Soraya: So much so that they preserved Guizhong's Four Commandments for future generations, even though the Guili Assembly was wiped out.
Soraya: And as for Guizhong herself, who established the commandments — she must have been adored by her people.
Soraya: Clearly, she wished for her people to be wise, to hold themselves to a moral code, to be strong and healthy, and to find solidarity in the shared enterprise of protecting their home — the Guili Assembly...
Traveler: But she failed.
Soraya: Failed? I suppose you're right, she died in the end... and when the Guili Assembly was wiped out, her people no longer had a place to call home.
Soraya: And yet, today, Guizhong's Four Commandments have seen the light of day once more.
Soraya: These were the words penned by Guizhong herself to serve both as maxims and blessing for her people.
Soraya: Once there was a time when she led her people to go forth and take this very land, guided by these commandments.
Soraya: She may no longer be with us, but her beliefs, the things she stood for — they will endure.
Soraya: Whoever it was that revered her so much was very clever indeed. They used the allure of hidden treasure to ensure Guizhong's Four Commandments would be passed down.
Soraya: Though for that person, I wonder whether the treasure they held dear was the rare metals and precious stones, or Guizhong's Four Commandments themselves.
Soraya: Haha, well, to me at least, it's clear that the commandments are the real treasures here. A chest full of gold or gems can't compare.
Soraya: ...But if you made people choose, how many would really pick a list of commandments over material wealth?
Traveler: Seems like a gentle-natured god.
Soraya: I'm not sure "gentle-natured" is a particularly common trait of gods...
Soraya: But maybe it was once. Maybe a long, long time ago, among the gods who led the peoples of the world, there were those gentle by nature.
Soraya: Those who protected their people... walked among them... stood by them as they went forth into the world...
Soraya: ...But it was the gentle gods who were ultimately powerless to protect their people. Look at Guizhong — it took an elaborate treasure hunt just to preserve the four commandments that once were the lifeblood of a whole civilization.
Traveler: I wish I could meet her...
Soraya: You want to meet a god? You do entertain some wild thoughts.
Soraya: But I'm curious, what would you say to Guizhong if you actually got to meet her?
Soraya: "...Cheer up, Guizhong, you did your best"?
Soraya: If it were me... I'd recite Guizhong's Four Commandments flawlessly from memory.
Soraya: And I'd tell her that her vision and her ideals were alive and well, that the people of this land still remember the things she taught to their ancestors.
Soraya: I think that for someone like Guizhong, who lost everything... That would be the only thing that could lift her spirits.

### Additional Talk 1

Soraya: I wonder how the Guili Assembly met its demise...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We're gonna get going.
Soraya: Heading off? Well remember, if you come across anything exciting, don't forget to come back and tell me.

### Additional Talk 3

Soraya: Just what exactly is being hidden in this saying...?
Traveler: Tell me about the saying...
Soraya: Though we call it a saying, it's really more of a riddle.
Soraya: A riddle that has been kept alive by word of mouth among the residents of Guili Plains.
Soraya: "At the place where wisdom and ambition, unity and fortitude converge like water; that is where I shall reveal the bountiful treasures of the earth."
Soraya: How about that, eh? However you interpret it, it sure sounds like there's some kind of buried treasure in the Guili Plains area.
Soraya: If I surmise correctly, those four words should correspond to four different ruins.
Soraya: If one were to find all four ruins, perhaps they would be able to find the meaning behind this saying.
Soraya: But I'm not cut out for finding all of them myself. Just finding that first one really took it out of me. Took days to recover.
Soraya: If you're interested, perhaps you could take a look. Who knows, perhaps you'll find the next lead before I do.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Remind me of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
Soraya: Having trouble memorizing them? I understand, most people would. Fortunately, I have a rather good memory for this sort of thing.
Soraya: Guizhong's Four Commandments are as follows: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition — the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: A battle for territory between the gods?
Soraya: A territorial challenge, you say? Hmm... but the Guili Assembly is said to have existed peacefully under Guizhong's rule for a very long time.
Soraya: Not that Guizhong was a particularly powerful god... At least, that's my impression...
Soraya: But there seems to have been another god with the Guili Assembly besides Guizhong. I highly doubt anyone would have been foolish enough to try and take on two gods at once...

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Someone wanted the treasure?
Soraya: Unlikely. The great gods would not have waged an all-out war over a bit of treasure that took their fancy.
Soraya: Or if they did, then you have to ask yourself... What kind of treasure would it take to drive the gods into war with each other?
Soraya: ...Haha, I for one cannot imagine such a treasure.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: Maybe Guizhong and one of the other gods...
Soraya: Wh—What are you suggesting? ...You shouldn't pay any heed to those tall tales you hear in Liyue Harbor.
Soraya: Guizhong was a god, a deity... Not a mere mortal...
Soraya: ...S—Surely a god wouldn't... Surely not...

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: I also wonder...
Soraya: Maybe it's to do with the Archon War.
Soraya: A protracted war erupted between the gods, each of whom coveted a seat at one of the seven divine thrones in Celestia.
Soraya: It seems that none in Teyvat escaped the reach of that all-consuming war.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: Goodbye.
Soraya: Goodbye. Don't forget to come back and tell me if you find anything.
