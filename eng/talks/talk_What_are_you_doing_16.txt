Traveler: What are you doing?
Vind: My family was given an order by Lady Vennessa. We are to keep watch here, looking out over the sea for any sign of an oncoming storm.
Vind: For generations, everyone in my family has felt honored to have this duty.
Vind: We see it as our life's purpose to be signal beacons for Mondstadt, ready to spread the message to every corner of Mondstadt at the first sign of a storm.
Vind: But... That's all in the past, now.
