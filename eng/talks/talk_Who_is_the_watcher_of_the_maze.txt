Traveler: Who is the watcher of the maze?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: It's said that when you reach <color=#00E1FFFF>75</color> sacrificed souls, the watcher of the maze will wake from a deep sleep and appear at a <color=#00E1FFFF>random place</color> somewhere in the maze. Killing it will get you a whole load of souls â€” enough to open the treasure trove. But it's a very powerful monster, so make sure you <color=#00E1FFFF>leave yourself enough time to battle it</color>!
