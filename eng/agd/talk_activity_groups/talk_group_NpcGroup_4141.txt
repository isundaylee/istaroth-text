Farahnaz: ...It's a shame that the Alliance was destroyed...

Traveler: The Alliance?
Farahnaz: Hey, did you not hear the story I just told you?
Farahnaz: That's okay, I'll tell you again!
Farahnaz: Back then, when Port Ormos wasn't as peaceful, the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys was established.
Farahnaz: The major pirate leaders who joined took stock of the situation and established a fair division of power in the Alliance.
Farahnaz: Each Alliance Leader, or "Dey," vowed to live together in peace and prosperity.
Farahnaz: But they did not expect that...

Traveler: See you.
Farahnaz: After the roar of the sea subsided, everything was in ruins...

## Talk

Traveler: A traitor?
Farahnaz: Yes, that was part of it. They are profit-oriented pirates after all, so a friendly co-existence is not their style.
Farahnaz: But I think where there's a conflict, there must be a winner. It's not like there isn't even one Dey left, right?
Farahnaz: But everyone is equal in the face of a sea monster invasion.
Farahnaz: According to folk legend, a huge sea beast never seen before stirred up a giant wave that wiped out the Alliance overnight...
Farahnaz: Oh, what a great story. It's a pity that it's only written about in scientific papers.

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

Farahnaz: It's a mixed feeling to see the characters in the deck get knocked down...

## Talk

Farahnaz: Haha, putting different cards into a single deck, it feels like an "alliance"...
