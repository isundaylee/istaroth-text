Message Board (Message): "If you're trying to get in the Akademiya, then visit this coffee shop often."
Message Board (Acting Manager's Reply): I'm very grateful that you're advertising our shop, but coffee will only give you a little more energy... Besides, the Mahamata might take action against unfounded statements like this, right?

## Talk 9

## Talk 10

Message Board (Message): "I heard many bandits have been popping up in the desert, and many merchants are refusing to travel the routes there. The price of Ajilenakh Nuts might start to skyrocket."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Awesome! I'm selling all my mushrooms for Ajilenakh Nuts right now! Haha! Perhaps this is the courage and vision of the Alkindi Clan!"

## Talk 11

Message Board (Message): "After retiring from the Corps of Thirty, this is where I get my cup of coffee every day."
Message Board (Message): "The acting manager makes me the same coffee every day, and the storyteller tells the same story."
Message Board (Message): "Perhaps the essence of life in Sumeru lies in repetitions like this."

## Talk 12

Message Board (Message): "The stories Mr. Maddah tell may be old-fashioned, but he's quite skilled when it comes to controlling their pace."
Message Board (Message): "But everyone's used to getting their information from Akasha now, so they unconsciously overlook such sophistication of technique and artistic maturity."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "You need to be more realistic. No art form is eternal. The day when all of its value has been exploited is the day it loses its reason for existence."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Like how overripe fruits fall to the earth and provide nourishment for new plants."
Message Board (Message): "And that is exactly why I've always despised materialists like you. Art is a precious fruit of leisure. You can't compare it to production and exploitation for commercial purposes!"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Leisurely people are like people walking on a spherical ground — they don't exist. Why don't you use your brain and think for a moment? Can the production of anything exist without commercial exchange?"
Message Board (Acting Manager's Reply): "What a sharp clash of theories... Anyway, it's time for Mr. Kaveh to settle his bill for the month. Should it be put on your tab as usual, Mr. Alhaitham?"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "No. That spoiled guy needs to experience the brutality of the business world."
Message Board (Message Seemingly From a Noble): "Miss Acting Manager, please put it on Lord Sangemah Bay's tab. After all, one can't make art without coffee!"

## Talk 13

Message Board (Message): "After so many years, this place is still so lively! Every time I come to this coffee shop, I can't help but recall that afternoon I spent arguing with him about the interpretation of a single word."
Message Board (Acting Manager's Reply): Our shop wouldn't be so lively without your patronage. Please do visit often.
