# Busy Adventurers' Guild


## Talk 1

Katheryne: Sorry to bother you again.
Traveler: No problem, I've been well looked after.
Katheryne: I am delighted to hear that. In which case, let me try to make this quick...
Katheryne: We are most grateful for your commission completion to date. The guild's reputation has grown stronger as a result.
Katheryne: However, another consequence is that we are receiving an unprecedented number of requests — more than our current numbers can handle.
Paimon: You want us to do some recruitment for you?
Katheryne: Ahh... No. Although I appreciate the offer — it would be fantastic to have some new members...
Katheryne: But scrambling to officially recruit new members at this stage would not really solve our immediate problems.
Katheryne: So what I want to ask is — Would your friends have the time to help out?
Traveler: I'll need to check with them.
Katheryne: Great, please do. Thank you!
Katheryne: Right now, we urgently need to find people for our <color=#00E1FFFF>expeditions</color>.
Traveler: Expeditions?
Katheryne: We organize expeditions to explore areas around the city and in the wilderness. It is a way to keep ourselves informed of any emerging dangers, unusual activity in the domains, and so on.
Katheryne: Since expeditions are not commissioned by a third party, there are no strict deadlines for completion.
Katheryne: However, we neglect them at our peril. If trouble were to foment unchecked, it could easily turn into a major disaster.
Paimon: Pretty important then!
Traveler: I'm sure my friends will understand.
Katheryne: All you need to do is convince them to help. I will take care of all the details.
Katheryne: Now, without further ado, let me show you the expeditions that are currently available.
Traveler: Check Expeditions
Traveler: What about compensation?
Katheryne: Rest assured that the Guild does not take a cut of the spoils from expeditions. Everything goes to you and your friends.
Traveler: You want me to convince all my friends to join the Guild?
Katheryne: No no, that is not what I meant. I know that your friends come from all walks of life, and asking them to become official members may be impractical.
Katheryne: My request is of the more presumptuous kind... The Guild needs a favor.
Traveler: There's a new reward up for grabs?
Katheryne: Hahaha... Bingo! And I presume you are interested.

## Talk 2

Katheryne: You can dispatch someone on an expedition at any time, and they will still be able to join you in your adventures should you need them.
Katheryne: You can also choose the length of time for the expedition. After your friend returns, just come here and confirm the outcome.
Katheryne: As your Adventure Rank increases, more dangerous expeditions will become available to you.
Paimon: After all, with epic power comes epic responsibility!
Katheryne: And of course, matching risk with experience is also for everyone's safety.
Katheryne: Thanks again for your help. I hope you and your friends can help out with our expeditions as much as possible.
