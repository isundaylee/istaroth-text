Nobumori: It's another peaceful, carefree day.

Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Nobumori: Hello! Welcome to Komore Teahouse. I am a doorman for the Kamisato Clan, and I work here.
Nobumori: That being said, I really have nothing better to do than drinking tea here... It's far more relaxed compared to the days when I still had a Vision. It's not bad. Not bad at all.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Nobumori: Goodbye! Take care.

Traveler: Your Vision...?
Nobumori: Ah, don't misunderstand. Even though I have lost my Vision, I am not actually a victim of the Vision Hunt Decree. I lost mine in a competition, fair and square.
Nobumori: Back when I was a polearm instructor, I challenged Kamisato Ayato to a duel with polearms. Having learned the secret techniques of the Kitain School, I thought I was invincible.
Nobumori: But as you might expect, how could I defeat Kamisato Ayato with my limited skill? After losing, I handed my Vision over.
Nobumori: Strangely, losing the Vision felt like letting go of a heavy burden. Those obsessions I had before all disappeared. From that day forth, I no longer stepped into the Kamisato Clan estate and became a "doorman" instead.
Nobumori: Kamisato Ayato not only has excellent swordsmanship, but has great skill with a polearm. It's really an honor that I can still serve him as an ordinary doorman.
Nobumori: And it's not as if a peaceful life is easy to come by. As for me, I no longer need to slave away for some glittering little ball.

Traveler: You've crossed blades with Kamisato Ayato...
Nobumori: *sigh* That was my youthful ignorance... Please forget about it.
Nobumori: In my current job, I probably won't be needing a sword or spear. My skills with the spear are probably of little use. If you don't mind, please accept it.
