# People of the Springs' Relaxation

A small settlement filled with curious shops and stalls that takes its inspiration from the People of the Springs. While away lazy afternoons in the shade of an overhead canopy as you sit back and relax with a cooling drink in hand.
There is a wide variety of water sports equipment on offer, as well as unique music and instruments to listen to... Spend enough time in these leisurely surroundings and your cares, no matter how big, are sure to melt away...
This Furnishing Set is favored by the following companions: Mualani
