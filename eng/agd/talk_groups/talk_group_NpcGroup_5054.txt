Chatelet: I'm a Gestionnaire at the Palais Mermonia. I guess you could call me an old colleague of Arouet's.
Chatelet: Arouet's opinions could be considered quite extreme in the office, but by cafe standards, they're quite ordinary.

Chatelet: Indeed — the aroma of the coffee available here is wonderful. I can only hope that Arouet will keep making it this way.
Chatelet: But I do have my reservations about his statement that "coffee is the source of life."
Chatelet: You must know, I'm sure, that not everyone loves coffee for its taste, but for its ability to impart wakefulness.
Chatelet: Where I work, there is much that many cannot control in their lives already — at least leave them their opinion on coffee.
