# A Story for You


## Talk 1

Iwao: #Hey {F#ma'am}{M#mister}, do you really know how to make Egg Rolls?
Iwao: If you're not confident in your cooking skills, you can always go buy them from Shimura Kanbei's shop instead. I promise I won't make fun of you for it.

## Talk 2

Albedo: What a coincidence. I was wondering where I might be able to find you, and here you are.
Traveler: What's up?
Albedo: Hehe, can't I come and see you when nothing is up?
Albedo: Alright, as much as I'd like to sit and chat with you, this time I'm here mainly for Klee.
Albedo: Before bringing Klee here, I told her many stories about Inazuma. It got her very excited to experience the local culture here.
Albedo: However, I've got other things to do in Inazuma this time besides painting the portraits of The Five Kasen. Over the next couple of days, I won't have the time to show her around.
Albedo: Inazuma is not like Mondstadt. I can't just let Klee wander off by herself when I'm busy with other things. So, I had to have her stay at the International Trade Association while I finish my work.
Albedo: She hasn't complained, but I can tell she's not enjoying being stuck there on her own.
Albedo: Fortunately, I now have you and Paimon. So...
Klee: #Yay, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight's here!
Klee: #Whatcha talkin' about, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight? Are we gonna go play?
Traveler: Klee, are you saying you'd like to go and play?
Klee: Yeah! ...Um, but Albedo is really busy. I can't go too far away, or he'll be worried about me.
Paimon: ...Aw, Klee, you're such a thoughtful kid.
Traveler: Unlike Paimon.
Paimon: Ah! Paimon's very thoughtful, thank you very much! Paimon always thinks of you whenever she's eating a delicious slime.
Traveler: Well, that settles it. You're very thoughtful.
Paimon: Anyway — it is pretty cruel not to let Klee go out when she was so excited to come here.
Traveler: We'll look after Klee.
Paimon: #Yup yup, allow the almighty {NICKNAME} and dependable Paimon to bring Klee on a tour of Inazuma.
Traveler: Let's take her somewhere interesting.
Albedo: #Klee, do you wanna go play with {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight?
Klee: Yay! You bet I do!
Albedo: As you know, Klee is our Spark Knight. You must keep her safe and sound.
Albedo: Ahem... by which I mean, try to keep her out of trouble.
Albedo: For instance, if a mountain in Inazuma was to lose one if its peaks, or if there were an explosion somewhere in the city, Klee could very well get in trouble...
Traveler: Got it. No explosions.
Albedo: Glad to hear it.
Klee: I promise I'll bring you back an awesome souvenir, Mr. Albedo.
Albedo: Great, I look forward to it.
Traveler: Let's introduce her to someone interesting.
Traveler: Ok, fine: Paimon, you are very thoughtful.
Paimon: Yeah, that's more like it.
Traveler: Miss me?
Albedo: Yes, indeed, I believe Klee has missed you tremendously.

## Talk 3

Klee: Wow, something smells so good... I think it's coming from this steaming thingy.
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, look at this noodley soup, it's so pretty! There's so many nice things inside.
Iwao: It's not "noodley soup." It's "Tonkotsu Ramen," actually.
Klee: Oh... so, um, what are those yellow-and-red thingies on that plate?
Iwao: You're kidding, right? Those are Tri-Flavored Skewers.
Klee: And what about this little yellow cake?
Iwao: That's an Egg Roll. They're amazing. Have you really not tried one before?
Klee: Wow, Tonkotsu Ramen, Tri-Flavored Skewers, and Egg Rolls... They all sound delicious.
Iwao: Hehehe, they sure are. Guess you're not from around here if you haven't tried any of these before.
Iwao: Lemme buy you an Egg Roll with my allowance so you can get a taste of our Inazuman food.
Klee: Really? But Master Jean said I shouldn't go taking other people's things.
Paimon: Also, that's your allowance, right? Taking another kid's allowance just seems kinda wrong...
Traveler: Don't take his Mora.
Iwao: Ohh... I remember you, you're Yoimiya's friend. How come you know how to make Egg Rolls?
Paimon: #Egg Rolls are a piece of cake for {NICKNAME}. Why don't you make some for Klee and Iwao?
Traveler: Sure — and I'll throw in some for you too.
Paimon: #R—Really? Wow, Paimon is so touched. You're learning, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Alright, we'll be waiting on those Egg Rolls.
Traveler: I'll cook them myself.

## Talk 4

Iwao: #Wow, you really can cook them. You're awesome, {F#ma'am}{M#mister}.
Klee: Mmm... it's sweet... so yummy!
Paimon: #...Yup yup, it's delicious... {NICKNAME}, you are the best.
Iwao: Yeah, these Egg Rolls are pretty good... but I still think Yoimiya's are better.
Klee: Who is Yoimiya? She makes Egg Rolls, too?
Traveler: She runs the fireworks shop.
Iwao: Yoimiya can do anything! She tells stories, keeps goldfish, makes fireworks, and gives us candy, too.
Iwao: Yoimiya's pretty much the best and most awesome person ever.
Klee: #For me, the best and most awesome person in the world is my mom! And Klee knows loads of other great people, too, like Mr. Albedo, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, Master Jean, Kaeya...
Paimon: Surely she's not going to name everyone she knows...?
Iwao: Oh... well, I don't know any of those people. But anyways, I still wanna introduce you to Yoimiya. If you want, I'll take you to find her.
Iwao: In most festivals, Yoimiya's so busy that you can never find her. But this festival's different — she has free time, so she can play with us.
Iwao: She seems like she hasn't been in a great mood recently, but maybe seeing you will cheer her up.
Klee: Okay, let's go play with Yoimiya.
Traveler: She's a superhero.

## Talk 5

Matsuzaka: Yoimiya, don't be sad. Um... I... oh, I know, lemme tell you something that'll cheer you up!
Matsuzaka: Yesterday, I won three beetle fights in a row against that guy with the horns on his head!
Yoimiya: Wow, Matsuzaka, nice work! It's not easy to beat Itto...
Saika: Don't worry, Yoimiya, maybe you can't light fireworks during the Irodori Festival, but there are still lots of other fun things to do!
Yoimiya: I know... Thanks, you guys, it's just that fireworks are banned in the city for a few days. I'm not that upset, really.
Iwao: Yoimiya, it's me!
Iwao: I wanna introduce you to a new friend. An outlander girl, I just met her... Wait, what's your name again?
Klee: Klee, my name is Klee.
Yoimiya: Nice to meet you, Klee. I'm Yoimiya, and I run Naganohara Fireworks.
Klee: Um... hello...
Yoimiya: I love the cute outfit, with the hat, and that cool little symbol, so unique. And your backpack — wow, it's really well-made.
Klee: That's a four-leaf clover. Mom and Master Jean said it can bring me good luck.
Yoimiya: Really? That's awesome. I bet everyone would love one of those.
Yoimiya: Also, that little fairy on your backpack is super cute, too.
Klee: That's Dodoco, my best friend. We always go fish blasting together in Starfell Lake.
Yoimiya: Oh, Dodoco? What an interesting name. I really like it.
Klee: Yep. My mom says that when a Dodoco is born, it rides the wind and goes off on a big adventure.
Yoimiya: "Ride the wind and go off on a big adventure." Klee, your mom sounds like a very cool person.
Klee: Yep! My mom is the best and most awesome person ever.
Klee: And, Yoimiya, Iwao was right. You're a really cool person, too.
Yoimiya: Hehe, thanks, Klee, I feel like we really get each other. We'll be great friends, I'm sure of it.
Paimon: It's so heartwarming watching these two chat away.
Yoimiya: Hey, Klee, since you like four-leaf clovers so much, why don't I make a firework with a four-leaf clover pattern and set it off for you?
Klee: Yeah! And after the fireworks, we can go fish blasting with Dodoco.
Paimon: Uh, hold on a second, fish blasting? No way, Albedo was pretty clear about that.
Traveler: No explosions allowed.
Yoimiya: Oops. I got so excited that I completely forgot about that.
Yoimiya: The folks from the Yashiro Commission specifically warned me that no fireworks are allowed in Inazuma during the Irodori Festival.
Klee: What? It's not allowed? But, awww... okay then.
Paimon: Hey, come on, you just made a new friend, this is a happy occasion. Why are you suddenly so upset?
Traveler: Don't be sad.
Paimon: Yeah, we still have loads of things we can do!
Traveler: Let's go check out the Irodori Festival.
Paimon: Right. Just like Saika said, there are lots of fun things to do.
Yoimiya: What do you say, Klee? Sounds like the Irodori Festival could be a real blast!
Klee: Okay then, let's go!

## Talk 6

Albedo: Thank you for taking care of Klee.
Albedo: I heard lighting fires is strictly prohibited in both Ritou and Inazuma during the Irodori Festival. Please keep a close watch on her.
Albedo: Klee's already run off. You'd better catch up with her.

## Talk 7

Yoimiya: "Outlander Brigade: When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai"...? What a long name... Must be a new one, I've never heard of it.
Klee: By... Kawabunga Icky. Yoimiya, this is a really strange name.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Who's this "Kawabunga"? It's pronounced "Kayabuki Ikkei." Heh... that would be me.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Outlander Brigade is a new series of mine, and When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai is the first volume.
Klee: Outlander's Big... Raid... um, is it a story about the best of friends?
Klee: Kaeya says that every good story has to have best friends in it.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Absolutely not. I would never allow such clichés in one of my novels.
Kayabuki Ikkei: This is a book about betrayal, blood, and tears! A long and lonely struggle! A stubborn samurai's path to the truth! This is the kind of story that needs to be told.
Yoimiya: Oh... is that right? Well, I'm not sure that's a very suitable story for Klee. Um... we might keep looking around.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Hey, Miss, don't go! Are you sure you don't want a copy? I'll give you 40% off!

## Talk 8

Iwao: I still don't get why Yoimiya is upset...
Saika: Ugh, dummy, Yoimiya is upset because she can't set off fireworks for everyone during the Irodori Festival.

## Talk 9

Matsuzaka: It's alright, I know Yoimiya's upset because she can't light any fireworks. You should go with her to the Irodori Festival.
Matsuzaka: I'm gonna take my strongest Onikabuto and go beat that guy with the horns on his head in a beetle battle again. I'll cheer Yoimiya up in my own way.

## Talk 10

Klee: Flowers for Princess Fischl... Oh, look, it's Fischl's story.
Yoimiya: That's right, Flowers for Princess Fischl. Have you read this book before, Klee?
Klee: Nope. But I know Fischl's story.
Klee: Fischl always hangs out with Oz. Everyone in the Adventurers' Guild knows, it's just like how me and Dodoco are always together.
Klee: I wonder if... Dodoco is getting bored now?
Yoimiya: Klee, I'm afraid it can't be helped. There are a lot of flammable items at the festival, and we have to be careful not to start a fire.
Paimon: Darn, it seems like even the Irodori Festival can't cheer Klee and Yoimiya up.
Paimon: Hmm... there must be plenty of things you can do with Dodoco besides lighting fireworks and going fish blasting.
Yoimiya: Yeah! Like, um... uh...
Traveler: Like painting.
Yoimiya: Wait, so that's what you're suggesting?
Traveler: Yeah, the Irodori Festival is the perfect occasion for storytelling.
Paimon: That's right! The Irodori Festival is a place for putting your work on display. You could show Dodoco's story for everyone here...
Traveler: Think of it like Dodoco playing with everybody.
Paimon: Bingo! What do you think of that idea, Klee?
Klee: Mr. Albedo taught me how to paint! I can paint the story of Dodoco's adventure in Inazuma!
Yoimiya: That's very imaginative. I think it's a great idea!
Yoimiya: Hehe, we can even put the finished story on display at the festival.
Klee: Yay, great! Dodoco will be so happy.
Yoimiya: Perfect. Okay, so I have some paper, paintbrushes, and paint at the shop. Let's go to the shop and paint your story there.
Klee: Yay! Let's go, let's go!
Traveler: Like writing a story.

## Talk 11

Yoimiya: #{NICKNAME}, Klee and I just had a discussion, and we've decided...
Klee: We're gonna keep the content of this story a secret from you guys for now.
Traveler: ...Why?
Yoimiya: Ugh, obviously I can't tell you why, or... You'll see, don't worry.
Yoimiya: You can keep exploring the festival while we're busy in the shop. We'll be here when you get back.
Klee: Come on, Yoimiya, we should get going. Let's go inside and start painting.
Black Screen Text: Yoimiya and Klee enter the shop.
Paimon: Aww, Paimon was hoping that we could all paint together... So unfair!
Paimon: Heehee, actually, Paimon's got an idea! Come on, let's go around to the windows and take a sneaky peek.

## Talk 12

Yoimiya: So. What does Dodoco do after getting to Inazuma?
Klee: Um, Dodoco goes to eat Tri-Flavored Skewers, Tonkotsu Ramen, and Egg Rolls.
Yoimiya: Ooh, that sounds great. Is that what you're painting? It looks beautiful!
Yoimiya: Once you're done painting, let's go get it printed. We'll print a whole bunch of copies and go hand them out at the festival.
Yoimiya: Hmm, although it'll cost a lot of Mora to get it printed. Let me see if I've got enough saved up...
Klee: It's okay, Yoimiya, I have some Mora! Look!
Yoimiya: 50 Mora is probably not quite enough...
Yoimiya: #Well, if we don't have enough, we can ask {NICKNAME} for ideas.
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight has helped a lot already. I don't wanna trouble {F#her}{M#him}.
Klee: So I think I should just go fish blasting to earn some Mora.
Yoimiya: #No fish blasting! Paimon and {NICKNAME} said so.
Klee: Oh... then we've got no choice. We'll have to go see Mr. Albedo.
Yoimiya: Who's Mr. Albedo?
Klee: He's my older brother. He's super-duper smart, he can do anything!
Klee: And he knows how to paint, too. He paints hilichurls, Kaeya, and even Dodoco. That's why he came to Inazuma this time, to do paintings for everyone.
Yoimiya: Is that right? Then I guess Mr. Albedo must be an artist working with the Yae Publishing House.
Klee: An artist? Oh, that means he has two jobs... One as an alchemy-ist, teaching Sucrose alchemy, and the other as an artist, doing paintings for people.
Klee: Yoimiya, lemme show you something. Mr. Albedo taught me you can paint Dodoco's color like this...
Yoimiya: Wow, I can see the resemblance. Alright, I'll paint the streets, and Klee, you fill in Dodoco's colors.
Yoimiya: ...Hey, you can even write the story over here to explain what's happening in the painting.
Klee: Okay! Let's write this...
Yoimiya: Oh...
Paimon: Shoot, Paimon didn't hear the last part.
Black Screen Text: A while later.
Yoimiya: Dodoco sure had a lot of fun in Inazuma!
Paimon: Those two sound like they really did go on an adventure with Dodoco. They couldn't be happier.
Yoimiya: Now we have to get Dodoco's story printed. C'mon, let's go to the Yae Publishing House.

## Talk 13

Yoimiya: Here we are. This is the Yae Publishing House.
Klee: Yae Publishing House... Ooh, it's Aunty Aratani! I know Aunty Aratani!
Aratani: Aunty? Who's that calling me Aunty? Oh, it's the little girl who came with Mr. Calx.
Aratani: How can I help you, little girl?
Klee: Aunty Aratani, can you help me get Dodoco's story printed so that everybody can see it?
Aratani: Dodoco? Oh, so you've been writing a story, huh? Is Dodoco the main character?
Yoimiya: Not only that, Dodoco is also real. Look!
Aratani: Huh, I don't quite understand...
Paimon: We'd better explain this to her.
Black Screen Text: You explain Dodoco's identity and Klee and Yoimiya's wish to Aratani.
Aratani: Oh, I see. I'd love to help you make this wish come true, but I'm sorry...
Aratani: The deadline has passed for accepting printing orders for the Irodori Festival.
Klee: Aunty, are you saying Dodoco won't be able to meet everyone after all?
Aratani: I'm sorry, little girl.
Klee: *sobbing*
Yoimiya: #Aw Klee, don't be upset. You still have me and {NICKNAME}. We'll think of something!
Traveler: Yeah, we'll find a way.
Yoimiya: Um, Miss Aratani, is there any way at all we can still get this printed?
Yoimiya: We can pay extra! And if you're short on staff to help with the printing, I can pitch in!
Aratani: Miss Yoimiya, I understand your sentiment, but I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
Aratani: We've been printing many people's personal works for this festival, and a lot of the books are already well behind schedule. The printing press is already working overtime to try and catch up.
Aratani: At a time like this, we really can't squeeze any more jobs in.
Paimon: What do we do? Seems like we might have to give up on this idea...
Yoimiya: No, I won't let that happen.
Yoimiya: I remember this one time when I was little, pops said he'd take me to the festival, but he was so busy with work that he forgot all about it.
Yoimiya: I waited and waited, and kept wondering when pops was finally gonna take me there. Eventually, people started coming home from the festival...
Yoimiya: That night, I cried miserably. To this day, I still remember how sad I felt. I don't want Klee to feel the same way.
Yoimiya: If we can't get it printed, then we'll just have to find our own way!
Yoimiya: I can paint. Over the next few days, I'll paint as many as I can, then we'll take those to the festival!
Yae Miko: My, my. Yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. I like it very much.
Paimon: It's Miko! And Albedo too!
Yae Miko: We heard everything.
Aratani: Oh, Lady Yae...
Yae Miko: It's okay, I know. You were just following the rules. Plus, we really are quite behind schedule with the printing.
Yae Miko: But our mission at Yae Publishing House is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. It would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
Yae Miko: Let me think... Oh, I know!
Yae Miko: Yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. Okay?
Yoimiya: Of course, Lady Guuji. Just tell us. Whatever this condition is, I am ready to face it.
Yae Miko: Dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. You make it sound like I'm some sort of wicked witch.
Yae Miko: All I mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: You have to combine it with another print.
Yae Miko: However, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. Your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
Yae Miko: Is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
Yoimiya: Klee, Lady Guuji is saying that we can print the book if we shrink it to half the size. Are you okay with that?
Klee: Yep, I am! Thanks, Miss Guuji Lady!
Yae Miko: Hehe, what an adorable little girl. Well, that settles it. Aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
Aratani: Yes, Lady Yae. I'll get right on it!
Albedo: Combining the prints is a plausible solution, but it'll cause a lot of extra work for the printing press. I am terribly sorry about that.
Yae Miko: No problem. Just think of it as my greeting gift for little Klee.
Yae Miko: Besides, the Yae Publishing House will need your help with the illustrations again next time, Mr. Calx. You could also consider it as my investment in you.
Yae Miko: Alright, I won't disturb you two any longer. Bye-bye, now.
Yoimiya: Yay! Everything worked out perfectly. Now we just need to wait for an update from the Yae Publishing House.
Albedo: #Yoimiya, {NICKNAME}, thank you for keeping Klee so exceptionally well entertained for me.
Yoimiya: Hehe, no worries!
Traveler: You should spend some time with Klee too, Albedo.
Albedo: Yes, you're right. Klee is family, after all.

## Talk 14

Klee: #Look, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight! Aunty Aratani brought us Dodoco's story!
Paimon: Now we can finally see what secrets Klee and Yoimiya were keeping from us.
Yoimiya: It's really nothing that exciting.
Klee: It's the story of Dodoco and me...
Yoimiya: And me...
Yoimiya: And you guys.
Traveler: You put me in the story?
Paimon: Paimon's in the story, too! This is Paimon's first time featuring in a printed book. Woohoo, Paimon's gonna be famous!
Yoimiya: Of course we included Paimon. This is the story of everyone's big, happy adventure with Dodoco.
Klee: #This story is me and Yoimiya's gift for {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight.
Aratani: Lady Yae wanted me to inform you that since this book was printed together with another work, there are many more copies than you may have anticipated.
Aratani: We won't charge you a printing fee, but in exchange, the extra copies of your book will be included as a free gift with purchases of the other book. Is that okay with you?
Yoimiya: Oh, are you sure? It's fine by us, but what does the author of the book think...
Aratani: Actually, the book that yours was printed with is called the "Teyvat Travel Guide."
Klee: Hey! That's Mommy's book!
Yoimiya: So Klee's mother is a writer? Huh.
Aratani: Klee's mother, Alice, is a renowned adventurer in Teyvat, and the Inazuma Edition of her popular "Teyvat Travel Guide" series is set to be released imminently.
Aratani: Lady Yae has already decided on how to promote it: "A joint endeavor by Teyvat's biggest and best mother-daughter adventure duo." It's sure to be a huge hit.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon knew it! Miko would never do anything for free...
Yoimiya: Hehe, a typical move by Lady Yae. It works out well for everybody, doesn't it?
Klee: Yep, I'm super happy 'cause my book gets to be released together with mommy's book. It's like me and mommy going on an adventure together.
Klee: I am so glad I came. The Irodori Festival is the best!
Traveler: You put me and Paimon in the story?

## Talk 15
