Etsuko: There has to be something wrong with the way the Guild rated this commission's difficulty...

Traveler: Not going back to the Guild yet?
Etsuko: Oh, hey, it's you.
Etsuko: Taisuke's been really taken with that talking cat named Neko. He insists that we continue investigating for a while.
Etsuko: I'm just here to make sure that he doesn't do anything idiotic in the process.
Etsuko: And I'm also taking this opportunity to slack off for a bit.

Traveler: Do you not like Neko?
Etsuko: I don't think I'd put it in those terms. I've just got no interest in her.
Etsuko: I came to this island to get this commission done.
Etsuko: I've never been very interested in much other than that.
Etsuko: The way I see it, if you get too invested in things outside the remit of your commission while you're doing it, you'll veer off onto a branching path...
Etsuko: And I wouldn't call that a good thing for a professional adventurer.

Traveler: Well, isn't the commission complete?
Etsuko: Yes. Which is why I'm over here slacking off in the Guild's name, see?
Etsuko: I wouldn't dare hang around here doing nothing otherwise.
Etsuko: To tell you the truth, though, this place is still very concerning.
Etsuko: "Asase Shrine," "Hibiki"... and of course, "Domeki."
Etsuko: I just feel that many heretofore undiscovered secrets still lie buried here on Seirai Island.
Etsuko: That said... Heh, I'm too lazy to figure them all out myself.
Etsuko: Once we get back to the Guild, I'll settle those reports, and we'll leave it to them to figure out a larger schema for exploring Seirai Island.
Etsuko: But before that... let me just slack here for a while more.
