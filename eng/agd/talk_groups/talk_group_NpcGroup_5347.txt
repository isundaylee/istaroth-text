## Talk

Loredan: Ho there, citizen! If you require shelter, simply head to the belltower in the city center.
Loredan: The savages have been getting all bold and uppity lately, so be on your guard!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are?
Loredan: Lauretus Vicetinus am I, under the auxilia of Machimos's Legio III!
Loredan: So long as we are here, we shall suffer no despicable invaders to step within the city walls!

## Talk

Traveler: You mean the belltower?
Loredan: Indeed! These are days of fire and sword, after all, and as soldiers of the Imperator, our God-King, we cannot allow our imperial citizens to be exposed to danger.
Loredan: Someone in the belltower will guide you to Machimos. You shall be safe there.

## Talk

Traveler: About the barbarians...
Loredan: Those savages? There's nothing to be said for those detestable invaders! They destroy our cities, slaughter our people...
Loredan: Enemies of the empire I name them... Nay, enemies of all civilization!
Loredan: Still, you need not fear, citizen! Dominus Boethius shall soon come to Machimos in person.
Loredan: When that happens, all disturbances shall be utterly quelled, and those putrid primitives shall get what they deserve!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Loredan: Fare ye well, citizen!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Loredan: Ah, hello there, dear guests! I'm Loredan Vicentino, a student of Master Giovanni's!
Loredan: If you wish to order instruments, please seek my master instead.

## Talk

Traveler: A beautiful melody?
Loredan: Indeed! Just as my brothers and sisters have, organizing performances at the Opera Epiclese to endless plaudits and applause...
Loredan: That said, I'm not at their level. I must work harder, practice harder, to maintain the prestige of our family!
Loredan: That's why I've stayed in town, working for Master Giovanni on one hand, while honing my musical craft on the other.
Loredan: One day, people will surely say of me, "Ah, indeed, you are a descendent of the Vicentino family!"

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Loredan: See you, dear guest from afar!

## Talk

Traveler: City walls? Where'd they come from?
Loredan: Hmm? Are we not within our defensive walls as we speak?
Loredan: Ah, wait, I see... You're testing me! Why, just as Dominus Boethius once said, "the mighty legions are the true walls of the empire"!

## Talk

Traveler: Have you met any barbarians?
Loredan: Hmm... No, not yet, I fear. They're a cunning lot, I must say. They rarely show up when they cannot be sure of victory...

## Talk

Loredan: Ah, if only I could play such a wonderful melody...
