# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Yun Jin: Yes, now that you mention it... there is one thing I have been meaning to do.
Yun Jin: When I was a child, my father often told me legends of the adepti. I remember that one legend in particular made mention of an adeptus's abode in Jueyun Karst.
Traveler: An adeptus's abode?
Yun Jin: Yes, that's right. The legend had it that adepti could drift upon beams of light, ride lightning, and leap into the sky to ascend to their abode.
Yun Jin: "From their lofty dwelling, they gaze to and fro. Drifting over land and sea, they know not the world below."
Yun Jin: My father would have a mesmerized look on his face whenever we got to that part of the story.
Yun Jin: But though the story has been passed down all these years, no one has yet to ever see such an abode...
Yun Jin: It has always been my dream to go and see such a place one day.
Yun Jin: I would even like to perform an opera there, letting adepti and people alike hear my voice echoing through the lands.
Traveler: I think I know of a place like the one you've described.
Yun Jin: No... Really?
Yun Jin: Ahem... I mean... I know that your words are sincere, it's just that you answered so quickly, and I haven't even decided what opera to perform or what costume to prepare...
Traveler: Take your time to think it over.
Yun Jin: Thank you very much! That's most kind of you.
Yun Jin: ...
Yun Jin: Alright, I have some ideas. I think for the performance, I will sing a selection about you and your dealings with the adepti...
Yun Jin: As for the costume, I was hoping you could give me some creative input.
Traveler: You have a deal!
Yun Jin: Alright, it's settled. I'll start practicing today... Actually, why not start right away â€” no time like the present! I must make sure this performance turns out perfect.
Traveler: I'll take you there once you've made up your mind.
Traveler: We could just go to Qingyun Peak...
