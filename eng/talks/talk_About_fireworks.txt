Traveler: About fireworks...
Takami: Speaking of our fireworks. Have you heard of Naganohara Fireworks? They are the oldest and one of the best fireworks shops in all of Inazuma. They're also the organizer of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.
Takami: I went to see the Naganohara Fireworks Show with my parents when I was still a child. I will never forget the spectacular sights that night.
Takami: It was that very moment that I realized my calling. I wanted to work somewhere related to the Fireworks Show to help and promote Inazuma's fireworks to all of Teyvat. This way, everyone will be able to witness and enjoy their beauty.
Takami: Thanks to Ms. Yoimiya, my wishes are slowly becoming realized, even with the restrictions of the Sakoku Decree.
