Old Finch: Spring fairy?
Old Finch: Yes, there's a fairy in this spring. You wouldn't have heard of it, and none of the villagers believe in it.
Old Finch: But when I was a boy, I would talk to her here all the time...
Old Finch: We'd talk about the weather, the spring water, the fish, who had fallen out with who in the village...
Old Finch: And when a kid fell into the spring, she'd tell me how she had secretly helped them back out and given them a few pretty stones to make them feel better...
Old Finch: She is a gentle-natured fairy.
Old Finch: But suddenly, one day, she refused to see me any longer.
Old Finch: So... what are you doing here?
Old Finch: How many years now... thirty? No â€” forty?
Old Finch: Well anyway, it's been half a lifetime that I've waited here, just hoping to see her one last time... and to hear her wonderful, flowing voice...
Old Finch: But after all this time, I'm sure she's probably... gone...
Old Finch: Whenever I have that thought, I realize... Look how old I am now... Too old to go traveling around Teyvat looking for her...
Old Finch: So all I can do is wait here, on the off chance that there's still some hope.
