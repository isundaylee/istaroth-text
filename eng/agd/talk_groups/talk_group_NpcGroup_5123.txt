Traveler: How do you do?
Yvette: Oh, a youngster with manners. Looks like you aren't one of those blockheaded Spina newbies.

Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Yvette: Right, forgot to introduce myself. I'm the technical advisor to the Spina di Rosula. I might be old, but my hands and brain still work just fine.
Yvette: Now, don't let the headaches I get with greenhorns who keep breaking things fool you — I very much enjoy my work here at the Spina.
Yvette: Back when I was at the Fontaine Research Institute, I quit on my own — too hard working with people with my crappy temper.
Yvette: As it turned out, that was a smart decision. Otherwise, you might have had to find my bones at the bottom of the sea.
Yvette: Things are different here. Doesn't matter if you're eight or eighty. So long as you've the ability, there's a place for you to use it.

Traveler: How fortunate.
Yvette: Yes. Perhaps this is how fate is telling me "You're on the right path."
Yvette: But as a former scientist, I have to say this is all too abstract.
Yvette: In other words, the right path in an orderly society should be one where people with proper capabilities gain recognition.

## Talk 4

Yvette: Be careful, and mind your head! It's a mess right now, so don't say I didn't warn you.

Traveler: You're...
Yvette: What? You think that just because I'm old I'm gonna stay in the shelter with the others and wait for everything to be fixed?
Yvette: Hmph, in your dreams! If I can still crack fish skulls with a hammer, then I still have the strength to work.
Yvette: Besides, now is when technical consultants are most needed. They'd best not think about sending me packing.
