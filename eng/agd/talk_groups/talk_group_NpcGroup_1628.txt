Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
Shizhuang the Strong: Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. And then one day, they dug up... something very strange...
Shizhuang the Strong: In an effort to contain it, the Qixing insisted on sealing the place off, despite it going against their immediate interests...
Shizhuang the Strong: Now that did surprise me. It's not like those big business types to look past the Mora signs in their eyes.

Traveler: Something very strange?
Shizhuang the Strong: ...I didn't see it with my own eyes. But I'm told the ones who did have been in a coma ever since.
Shizhuang the Strong: Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
Shizhuang the Strong: Now I've actually heard that a small portion of The Chasm has been reopened, and that some of our comrades have returned to work. But I'm not too sure about the details...
Shizhuang the Strong: But there's no point thinking about all this either way. It's better to be patient and wait for further news.

Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Mining in the Chasm is prohibited now. The Qixing came and sealed the whole place off.
Shizhuang the Strong: Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
Shizhuang the Strong: Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. Until one day, they dug up... something very strange...

Shizhuang the Strong: Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
Shizhuang the Strong: If even the Qixing's response is to literally put a lid on it, then I certainly don't plan to look into it any further myself.
Shizhuang the Strong: It will serve me better to concentrate on my next step now the mine's closed. I can't go letting my curiosity get the better of me.
Shizhuang the Strong: I feel sorry for the boys though. Now the mine's gone, they're lost souls. They've got nothing to do with themselves, and it's really crushed them.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Shizhuang the Strong: Nothing much, just a few pig-headed miners trying to get into the Chasm. I managed to stop them.

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Shizhuang the Strong: Ever since they closed the Chasm, I've been patrolling this area. Mostly to stop people breaking the rules and trying to get inside...
Shizhuang the Strong: I've noticed some sizable Crystal Ore deposits while on patrol. Shame they're no use to me, they aren't the ores I'm looking for.
Shizhuang the Strong: You're interested? Alright, I think they were...
Shizhuang the Strong: ...Here. Marked on your map. Feel free to explore, just keep away from the Chasm.

Shizhuang the Strong: I've heard that these Crystal Ores were formed under the influence of Ley Line energies. They are very hard to come by, and very few smiths know how to work them.
Shizhuang the Strong: While on duty, I've noticed quite a lot of Magical Crystal Ore around. Granted, it's much rarer than the regular kind, but still... you'd have thought at least one of the blacksmiths might know how to process it...
Shizhuang the Strong: You're interested? Alright, I think they were...
