Rajavi: When will he be here? Did that butler lie to me?

Traveler: Who are you waiting for?
Rajavi: I heard a wealthy merchant lives here, so I've come to pay him a visit.
Rajavi: I thought since we're both successful businessmen, we could earn more Mora together.
Rajavi: But no matter how I tried, that butler at the entrance refused to reveal the identity or whereabouts of his "Lord."
Rajavi: Every time I go over there, he leads me around in circles before somehow persuading me to come back here.
Rajavi: *sigh* Next time... Next time, I won't let him do it again!

Traveler: Maybe he did.
Rajavi: Darn! I knew it!
