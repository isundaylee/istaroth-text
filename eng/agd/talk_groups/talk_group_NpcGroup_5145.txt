Mela: You're welcome to come and play in the city anytime. We'll be waiting.
Leuca: Yup, I know! If I ever get bored in Merusea Village, I'll come and meet up with you all in the city.
Leuca: Speaking of which, the sea breeze has been pretty strong lately. I always find my neck rather cold... I should sew a scarf for myself.
Leuca: What do you think of a black scarf? The sea at night is pitch dark, too â€” we Melusines find it really peaceful.
Mela: That sounds great! But if it were me, I'd pick blue to go with the clothes.
Mela: But it's your scarf, of course, so you can decide for yourself, Leuca.
