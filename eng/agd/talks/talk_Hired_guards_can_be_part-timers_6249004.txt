Traveler: Hired guards can be part-timers?
Hung Fan: *cough* Well, since I'm new to the biz, and I taught myself martial arts, I don't get a whole lotta commissions. Not like those pros from the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency...
Hung Fan: So, I'm just doin' simple transport work for now, gonna save up some cash for maybe a few years.
Hung Fan: Once I've got enough Mora in the bank, I'm gonna sign up for classes and study martial arts seriously, get myself real fists of fury and killer kung-fu kicks.
Hung Fan: And then I'll go pro, and escort with the best! I won't even have to fear getting eaten by Xuanwen Beasts...
