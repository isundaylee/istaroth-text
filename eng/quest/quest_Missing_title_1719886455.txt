## Talk 1

Paimon: What are you doing here? Madame Melo?
Melo Lombroso: Oh, it's you. I heard that no-good husband of mine has a little spot around here, so I figured I'd drop by and check up on him.
Melo Lombroso: But look what I've found.
Melo Lombroso: He actually keeps the photo with him!
Paimon: Heh, Uncle Rocher cares deeply about you, Madame.
Paimon: We've had our suspicions on you, and Uncle Rocher was the sole voice of dissent. He alone assured us that you could never have committed the crime. We were wondering where he found the confidence to stand up to us...
Traveler: Probably used up every last ounce of masculinity he had in him.
Melo Lombroso: Oh... Really?
Paimon: Yeah! And didn't he tell you that he lost your locket in gambling? That's not true. He was merely too ashamed to tell the truth.
Melo Lombroso: Oh, that? I heard that story a long time ago, but I never believed it.
Paimon: Eh?
Melo Lombroso: My husband is many things. He may be timorous, somewhat cowardly, and a bit awkward, but he's also a salt-of-the-earth individual. He could be bamboozled, but he's no degenerate gambler.
Melo Lombroso: I didn't call him out because I was waiting for him to tell me the truth of his own accord.
Paimon: Wow, how nice of you. If only we could find him right now...
Melo Lombroso: (Shush... Look over there! I'm 100% certain that he's hiding in that box.)
Paimon: (...Huh?)
Melo Lombroso: (It's an old habit of his. Whenever we'd get into a tiff, he'd go and hide in the nearest closet. And to think he thought I didn't know.)
Traveler: (Do you want us to fetch him for you?)
Melo Lombroso: (No need to inconvenience yourself. Let's see how long he can hold out in there.)
Melo Lombroso: Right, there's one other thing I could use your help with. If you ever run into Curve and Agent Talochard, please tell them the following:
Melo Lombroso: I've tidied up a few of the rooms, so they're welcome here any time. Of course, the House of Lombroso is also open to the two of you.
Paimon: #But... Traveler...
Traveler: Alright, we get it, Madame.
Paimon: Okay... then we'll get out of your hair. Paimon does hope Uncle Rocher will come out soon. Have a nice day!
Melo Lombroso: Thank you. And best wishes to you, too. May you find the answers to all your questions.
