Traveler: Your master?
Nanako: I'm a disciple of the Meikyou Shisui Art. My master's name is Domon.
Nanako: My master used to be a great swordsman and a Vision-wielder. He will become the best in the world one day!
Nanako: However, my master has been very out of sorts after losing his Vision due to the Vision Hunt Decree. I don't know what to do...
Nanako: My parents were murdered by pirates when I was little, and I was almost killed as well. If it hadn't been for my master, I would have been dead a long time ago.
Nanako: I will never find a way to repay him fully. Now that he's in trouble, I have to find a way to help him get back on his feet...

Traveler: Keep up the good work.
Nanako: Yup! With your encouragement, I'll definitely become strong!
Nanako: That reminds me. Recently, when I was training in the dojo, I discovered a foreign-looking weapon. Did my master study it to hone his martial arts...?
Nanako: Even if we kept it here, not many people will know how to use it. If that's the case, how about I give it to you? You came from another lands, so I think you'll be able to draw out this sword's true potential.
