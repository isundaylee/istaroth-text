Traveler: So how's business?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Shh... Keep quiet. I'm still figuring this place out.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Seems like most people here only go to the Rag and Bone Shop to buy their bric a brac. I can't go prancing about with my wares setting up shop willy-nilly... Wouldn't be good to attract the wrong kind of attention from certain parties...
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Especially that Alvard...

Traveler: How's Blanche?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": She's good. I found her a tutor before coming in. Heehee, can you guess what kind of tutor? Photography!
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": I've told the tutor to fill her world with pictures every day, all of beautiful scenery from exotic locales abroad. This way, she's bound to want to visit them someday.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": And in the future, she won't be so against the idea of going overseas to study.

Traveler: What red-haired guy?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Oh, I used to have a buddy with red hair. Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep recently, because I keep seeing him around down here in the prison. My eyes must be playing tricks on me.
