Traveler: How's the symbol deciphering coming along?
Huixing: Ah, ahoy there, Traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
Huixing: It's been quite tough, I won't lie, but it's gone well enough. We've obtained quite a lot of nautical maps from various sources, so a full deciphering will take some time yet.
Huixing: I've heard that you're quite the code-breaker and puzzle-solver yourself. If I had your help, this would probably be much easier...
Huixing: ...Well, when you're free, of course! Also, feel free to tell me if you need anything!

Huixing: What a headache. What do those symbols that the previous navigator drew mean? Are those areas where they encountered leviathans?

Traveler: What's with the long face?
Huixing: I'm the crew's navigator. Determining our heading and course is my charge, as is drawing up nautical charts.
Huixing: Our previous navigator was getting on in years, so I came to take his spot.
Huixing: He loved employing some unique symbols to mark his nautical maps, but he never bothered to explain the meaning behind them...
Huixing: ...But I suppose that might be a quirk endemic to navigators.
Huixing: I mean, it's quick and easy, if troublesome for anyone else.

Traveler: What about those leviathans?
Huixing: I've been fascinated by marine biology since I was a child. Especially those behemoths hidden deep beneath the waves...
Huixing: To be honest, I signed up for this job precisely because I'd heard that Captain Beidou slew Haishan.
Huixing: More's the pity that I haven't had the chance to see a leviathan with my own eyes. I'd really love to see one up close some day.
Huixing: I've also heard some sailors say that they saw something like giant antennae around the Sea of Clouds...
Huixing: ...Is that true or not? Who knows. Perhaps they were just seeing things while dead drunk.

Traveler: Well, see you, then.
Huixing: I swear I'll become a navigator who actually does documentation...
