"Nine Swords of Xuanlian": (A novel of martial chivalry with an aged cover and lots of annotations written between the lines.)
"Nine Swords of Xuanlian": (The book described how Wufeng, the main character, fell off a cliff while gathering herbs, but ended up learning incredible techniques and becoming a hero of their time through a twist of fate.)
"Nine Swords of Xuanlian" (Annotations in Childish Handwriting): "An unexpected twist... The rusty sword bought from a roadside vendor turned out to be an extremely powerful blade! Huh. Maybe I should go to the market more often myself."
"Nine Swords of Xuanlian" (Annotations in Neat Handwriting): "Falling off a cliff, only to find a secret tome full of techniques? The beggar in the village was actually a grandmaster in hiding? Too cliche. This wouldn't fly with modern readers."
"Nine Swords of Xuanlian" (Annotations in Crooked Handwriting): "Hmm... But the part where the invading fiends were driven back by the main character, who had been living in solitude there... That wasn't half bad."
