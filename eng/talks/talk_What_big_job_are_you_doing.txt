Traveler: What big job are you doing?
Shima Masaoki: Reprimanding new recruits and fixing morale.
Shima Masaoki: Young people these days are lazy. If no one is strict with them, the entire group becomes one big mess.
Shima Masaoki: I need to let them know that serving as a guard of Tenshukaku is a precious honor not to be taken lightly!
Shima Masaoki: What most people would give for an opportunity like this... They must discipline themselves and work hard to rise through the ranks, just like me!
