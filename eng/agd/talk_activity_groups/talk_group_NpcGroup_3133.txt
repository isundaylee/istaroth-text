Iwata: Another failure... What sort of seeds should I try next time, hmm?
Hirai: You've tried this many times already, but nothing grows here for long. Aren't you ready to give up yet?
Hirai: The soil here on Watatsumi Island has never been suited to farming. We've only gotten some carrots to grow at the most, and I doubt even Sumeru fertilizers could help us here. Seriously, just give up already.
Hirai: Even if you can't go out to sea with me on account of your old injuries, you can still do some other work.
Iwata: No! How can we allow ourselves to be beaten down by adversity so easily? Never, I say! I will find something that can grow on this land.
Iwata: I should really be asking *you* why you keep wandering around the village. Weren't you gonna go out and catch some fish?
Hirai: Fish? Of course I'm going to do that!
Hirai: It's just that I caught sight of some strange ships when I went out recently. They seemed to be from another land...
Hirai: The sight of them left me rather ill at ease, and I thought that I'd exercise more caution out at sea in the future...

Iwata: This doesn't seem right either...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Iwata: Ah, hello there, Traveler. Well, I... Um... I'm trying to make some fertilizer.
Iwata: I heard from someone that someone from Sumeru has set up a fertilizer shop in Ritou.
Iwata: They say that these fertilizers have unusual properties. As long as you add a little when growing plants, they will grow exceedingly lushly.
Iwata: But I can't go to Ritou to purchase that fertilizer, so I tried making my own here...
Traveler: You figured out how to make some yourself?
Iwata: Actually, no... I asked around everywhere before coming up with this method myself.
Iwata: To get into the specifics, you want to mix some crops and some, ah, animal excrement together into a pile.
Iwata: Afterward, you cover it with a layer of branches and leaves and such to maintain the temperature.
Iwata: After a while, they say that the ingredients will undergo some changes and even blend together, forming a sort of fertilizer.
Iwata: But no matter how much I experiment, these materials just won't come together. It's really strange...
Traveler: Do you have the wrong ingredients by any chance?
Iwata: Crops, animal excrement, branches and leaves... Should be correct. That's what I've heard, at least.
Iwata: Where did I go wrong...
Iwata: Forget it. Let me just try again. Traveler, could I ask you for a favor?
Iwata: I'll make another batch of fertilizer. Once it's done, I'd like you to check on it together with me.
Iwata: Given how much you've seen and learned, you might know what went wrong during the process.
Traveler: Sure.
Iwata: Alright, I'm counting on you, Traveler! I'll make some preparations over there first.
Iwata: Making this sort of fertilizer requires some time, so please come find me in a bit. Until then, please help me watch that fertilizer pile.
Traveler: Did something go wrong during the process?
Iwata: Pile the materials up, cover with branches to maintain their temperature. No, this should be correct...
