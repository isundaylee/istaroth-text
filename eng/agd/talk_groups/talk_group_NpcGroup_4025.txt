Traveler: And you are...
Seiji: Hi! I came to Sumeru on business with the Inazuma Shogunate official Sir Hanbei. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Seiji: Hehe, speaking of which, it's a little embarrassing, but I was pretty nervous before coming here. This is my first time working abroad, and I can't let my superior down.
Seiji: But it seems like he's still getting some work ready, so he doesn't have anything important for me to do.
Seiji: So sometimes I'll come here to walk around and take in the sights and scenes of Sumeru.

Traveler: What do you think?
Seiji: It's nothing like Inazuma! Everything here is so new and fresh!
Seiji: Take their god, for instance. I always hear people in Sumeru going on and on about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, I actually thought that she's the Dendro Archon.
Seiji: I eventually figured out that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was the previous Dendro Archon.
Seiji: In Inazuma, we've believed in Her Excellency for generations, so it's difficult for us to understand the changing of Archons.
Seiji: Also, the curry here is hardly sweet at all! It's amazing...

Traveler: How do you find it?
Seiji: It's nothing like Inazuma! Everything here is so new and fresh!
Seiji: Let's start with their god, then. I've heard that she lost her memory for ages, and has only recently started directing the Akademiya again!
Seiji: In Inazuma, we've believed in Her Excellency for generations, so it's difficult to comprehend that a god could be left out in the cold like that.
Seiji: Also, the curry here is hardly sweet at all! Fascinating. Just fascinating...
