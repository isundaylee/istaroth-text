Traveler: Surely you're exaggerating...
Xi'er: Exaggerating? I'm just saying the plain old truth.
Xi'er: I am a native of Liyue, but as a gourmet, I am nothing if not fair and impartial!
Xi'er: It's just as well that I made some Black-Back Perch Stew this morning. Have a taste — you should be able to tell the difference right away.

## Talk 1

Xi'er: Li cuisine?
Xi'er: Yep, one of the two big culinary traditions in Liyue!
Xi'er: Li-style cooking is all about rich, indulgent dishes packed with flavor. It uses a lot of ingredients from up in the mountains.
Xi'er: The place you should go to try it is Liuli Pavilion in Liyue Harbor. They have the best Li-trained chef working for them.

## Talk 2

Xi'er: Yue cuisine?
Xi'er: One of the two major culinary traditions in Liyue, the other being Li.
Xi'er: Yue-style cooking puts emphasis on lighter, brighter flavors. It's heavily seafood-based, so if that's your thing you have to try it!
Xi'er: If you do want to try it, the most authentic Yue-style cooking is at the Xinyue Kiosk in Liyue.
Xi'er: Only thing is, for both the Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, you have to book about half a year in advance...

## Talk 3

Xi'er: This'd be so much better with some chilis added, I wonder if I should say something...

Xi'er: What are you doing?
Xi'er: Oh, hello. You're visiting here, too?
Xi'er: I'm Xi'er, from Chihu Rock in Liyue. My job is eating! Wait, no, there's a word for it... Gourmet! I'm a professional gourmet.
Xi'er: I'm in Mondstadt specially to try the food. Mostly because I heard that Chef Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant gets some of her ingredients from here.
Xi'er: I like that there's a focus on fresh, quality produce...
Xi'er: But in terms of presentation and seasoning, I gotta say Liyue is a cut above, regardless of whether you're talking about Li or Yue cuisine.
