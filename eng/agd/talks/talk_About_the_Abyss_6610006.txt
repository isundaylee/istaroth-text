Traveler: About the Abyss...
Wayna: Haha! Our old enemy's gone all quiet now.
Wayna: Our long battle with the Abyss has been like an extreme sport marathon, but there's nothing that the Scions of the Canopy can't overcome.
Wayna: Like with cliff-jumping, some come straight back up, others land safely, and still others fly off to yet farther places.
Wayna: Every outcome has a value of its own, and thus, deserves to be remembered.
