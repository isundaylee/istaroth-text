# Mine Craft

Wagner: Drat. Running out of ores, are we...
Traveler: Can I ask you some questions about finding ores?
Wagner: Ores? What do you want to forge? Weapons or armor?
Wagner: If you're looking to mine ores, I do know some good spots.
Wagner: There are all sorts of ores, though. Iron Chunks are the most common, followed by White Iron Chunks, and then Crystal Chunks...
Wagner: And there's Magical Crystal Chunks, which are of very fine quality, and can be used to forge excellent items.

Wagner: However, they are very difficult to work with. If you want to make anything with them, you'll have to expend a significant amount of other resources as well.
Wagner: Still, I've just come back from a trip outside, and it seems that most of the ore veins have already been mined. If you go out now, I doubt you'll get anything.
Wagner: Hmm, how about this? Come find me later, and I'll mark all the veins I know of on your map.
