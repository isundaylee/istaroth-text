Stanley: Stanley... Stanley... Your name shall never be forgotten...

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you repeating your own name?
Stanley: Oh, you heard that? Ah, it's nothing.
Stanley: I'm simply lamenting the past, lamenting a friend that has passed...
Stanley: That's exactly what I'm doing. Why would I lie about it?

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Stanley: Please, leave me. I need to be alone.

## Talk

Stanley: *sigh* What I would give to have another mug with you, Stanley...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you feeling alright?
Stanley: Ah, I... I'm fine, don't worry.
Stanley: I just get sentimental sometimes on nights like this, as I listen to the din in the tavern.
Stanley: It brings me back to the days when I and Stanley had just started adventuring together. We'd always drink ourselves under the table the night before setting out.
Stanley: *sigh* It's alright. I'll get up. For his sake, I definitely will.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you, then.
Stanley: No problem. I just need to be alone for a while...

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Stanley: If only that fellow Stanley were here now...
Stanley: I mean, Stanley's, uh, companion.
Stanley: Indeed! If that fellow were also here, we would be enough to take Stormterror on, just the two of us!
Stanley: I really miss him. If only he were still with us...
