Kaeya: You're not bad with that wind glider. Your gliding style seems familiar...
Traveler: How'd you get your eye patch?
Kaeya: My eye patch? Wanna hear my story, eh?
Kaeya: I didn't have time to introduce myself properly... Well, it wasn't on my mind to begin with.
Kaeya: Ehe... My apologies. I'm Kaeya, Cavalry Captain for the Knights of Favonius.
Kaeya: We can talk more after we get things sorted.
Kaeya: I know a great place more fit for a chat.
Traveler: Why is Jean the Acting Grand Master?
Kaeya: The Grand Master is currently off leading an expedition, so the Master, Jean, has stepped in to oversee the Knights while he's gone.
Kaeya: Hence, you'll hear many refer to her as the Acting Grand Master.
Kaeya: When the Grand Master left, he took the vast majority of our knights with him, leaving the Acting Grand Master with far more responsibility and stress.
Kaeya: Come to think of it, it must have been difficult for Jean.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Kaeya: See you later then.
