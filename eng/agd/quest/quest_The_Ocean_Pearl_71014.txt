# The Ocean Pearl


## Talk 1

Luoxia: ...That was just about the most unconventional entrance any visitor has ever made to the Pearl Galley.
Traveler: I'm just here to have a look...
Luoxia: *giggle* Well, you're no different from any other guest in that sense. Everyone comes here "just to have a look." Then, they like what they see, so they stay a little longer. Before you know it, they can't drag themselves away.
Luoxia: Nevertheless, despite the impromptu means by which you arrived here, you are an esteemed guest from afar, and we welcome you as any other. It would simply be bad manners to show you the door after you've only just arrived.
Luoxia: But we can't let you break the rule, okay? Otherwise, I'm the one who will have to answer to the boss.
Traveler: What rule?
Luoxia: A simple and straightforward rule. Guests are only allowed here by invitation.
Luoxia: Most who sneak in despite knowing the rule are petty criminals with dubious intentions.
Luoxia: *giggle* Don't fret, I'm well aware that you snuck in by accident, blissfully unaware of the rule. You're no criminal.
Luoxia: All the guests you see here are here by invitation. By the boss' rules, they have the right to invite other guests, too.
Luoxia: So, if you're planning on dropping in more often, your best bet would be to mingle with the guests and see if you can talk one of them into giving you an invitation letter.
Traveler: Challenge accepted.
Luoxia: A smooth operator, I like your style. Okay, I'll be waiting here.
Traveler: Maybe I could talk you into it instead?
Luoxia: *giggle* I admire you for trying. But we staff can't be handing out invitation letters to everyone we bump into.
Luoxia: You're better off seeing if you can persuade one of the guests. Go ahead, I'll be waiting for you.

## Talk 2

Luoxia: When you want to go back ashore, just speak to Pinghai.
Luoxia: In the future, whenever you want to visit again, find him at the harbor, and he will escort you.

## Talk 3

Luoxia: That was just about the most unconventional entrance any visitor has ever made to the Pearl Galley...
Luoxia: But, I'm afraid you'll be needing an invitation letter if you wish to stay.

## Talk 4

Cui'er: I wonder if Mr. Chao will be visiting today...
Traveler: Can you sort me out with an invitation letter?
Cui'er: I'm afraid you've come to the wrong person. I'm just a lowly attendant, I don't have the right to issue invitations.
Cui'er: I must say, though, it's very unusual that you're able to be here without one in the first place. Most people who show up on board uninvited are promptly removed.
Cui'er: Were you hoping that somebody on board would issue you with an invitation letter? If so, you've got your work cut out for you... People don't typically dish out invitations to strangers...
Cui'er: Tell you what, I'll keep my eyes and ears peeled for any guests who might be willing to help you. But you've got to do something for me in return.
Cui'er: My lover's name is Chaoxi. We have made a pact, that when next we meet, he will take me away from here...
Cui'er: But I have waited and waited, and still I haven't heard anything from him. I also haven't the time to go ashore looking for him, since I'm needed here on board.
Cui'er: Could you deliver a letter to him for me, and also see how he is faring?
Traveler: Alright, deal.
Cui'er: Great, thank you! I'll be waiting here when you get back, as long as you're quick.
Traveler: That name sounds familiar...
Cui'er: Well, he is a brilliant sailor. I'm hardly surprised you've heard of him.
Cui'er: Please, deliver this letter to him for me. I'll be waiting here when you get back, as long as you're quick.

## Talk 5

Chaoxi: Sisi, I literally just got back from sea and right now I just need a rest. We can talk about it later...
Sisi: But... But I saw you in the harbor just a few days prior...
Chaoxi: Yes, the guys on the boat, they sent me on a quick trip back to shore to stock up on supplies.
Chaoxi: And this trip was a last-minute leave request. The things I had to do to get Captain to approve my leave, honestly...
Sisi: ...Xi...
Traveler: I have a letter here for a Mr. Chao.
Chaoxi: A letter? For me? What's this... Oh, I recognize this handwriting...
Chaoxi: What the... Goodness me. The second I mention the guys on the boat, here they are writing me, begging me to come back on board, heh...
Sisi: What? But you only just got back, you're not leaving already, are you?
Chaoxi: Sisi, worry not. I was prepared for this.
Chaoxi: My friend, I too have a letter for you to deliver. Please see it safely into the hands of the one who sent you here, and inform them that they will just have to wait a few more days.
Traveler: I have a letter here from a certain Cui'er.
Sisi: Cui'er? That... sounds like a girl's name to me...
Chaoxi: It is, yes. She's, um, one of the sailors. Hands down, best handwriting of everyone on board. Whenever anyone needs a document or a letter writing, they go to her. Fun fact.
Chaoxi: Tsk, I know exactly what this is about, don't even have to read it. They're begging me to come back on board...
Sisi: What? But you only just got back, you're not leaving already, are you?
Chaoxi: Sisi, worry not. I was prepared for this.
Chaoxi: My friend, I too have a letter for you to deliver. Please see it safely into the hands of the one who sent you here, and inform them that they will just have to wait a few more days.

## Talk 6

Cui'er: Did you deliver my letter to Mr. Chao?
Traveler: Yes, and here's his reply.
Cui'er: Fantastic! And he's replied, too — that's so great!
Cui'er: I'll be sure to keep you updated on the invitation letter situation.
Cui'er: That said... I wouldn't get your hopes up. It's not often that guests are willing to issue invites to total strangers.
Cui'er: Reason being, if someone breaks the rules, not only do they have their own invitation revoked...
Cui'er: But the person who issued them with their invitation has theirs revoked, too.
Cui'er: Still, let's stay optimistic. It can't hurt to try.
Cui'er: I wonder what Mr. Chao has written in his letter? *giggle* I'll save it for the evening...

## Talk 7

Cui'er: I wonder what Mr. Chao is up to...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Guan Hong: Life is too short...
Traveler: Any chance I could get you to give me an invitation letter?
Guan Hong: An invitation letter? From me to you?
Guan Hong: That's a new one... Get onto the boat, then see if you can find someone to invite you...
Guan Hong: Sorry, though, no can do. I can't go trusting a complete stranger.

### Additional Talk 2

Li the Ninth: Ahh, what a beautiful wine, the best of the best! Haha, oh yes, this is the good stuff!
Traveler: Please can you give me an invitation letter?
Li the Ninth: Good wine, good poetry... hehehe, and good company, too...
Li the Ninth: All the finest things in life... there's a thought, if you had to pick one, which would it be?
Li the Ninth: Easy choice, has to be the wine! Hahaha! When the taste of the finest wine doth flow through mine own throat, on springs of thoughts deep and divine...
Paimon: Okay, so this guy's ears aren't working. Let's try somebody else.

### Additional Talk 3

Luo Feng: Ah... a new face on board? I don't believe I've had the pleasure...
Luo Feng: Don't tell me — you're a new guest? Well, can I just say, it's wonderful to meet you, whatever it is you do I can see that you must be at the top of your game...
Traveler: Thanks, so far I'm just looking for an invitation letter.
Luo Feng: ...You didn't, uh, sort that part out before coming aboard, then?
Luo Feng: That's... Wow, haha! I've got to hand it to you, you are definitely an outside-the-box kind of thinker.
Luo Feng: But, um... Forgive me for being frank, but an invitation letter is not the sort of thing one can go around begging for...
Luo Feng: I, at least, try to be somewhat selective in my choice of invitees, as I'm sure you must be able to understand.

### Additional Talk 4

Maksim: The Pearl Galley truly is as wonderful as they say...
Traveler: #Hey comrade, help a guy out with an invitation letter?
Maksim: You didn't get one before boarding? ...And they still haven't kicked you out!? Bahaha! That is quite incredible.
Maksim: I'm not helping you get an invitation letter, though. Nuh-uh, not me.
Maksim: I'm not about to risk getting kicked off when the party's barely started!

### Additional Talk 5

Qiu'ge: *cough* My throat...
Qiu'ge: *sigh* Here for the opera, are you? I'm terribly sorry, but I have an awful throat ache, so I probably won't be performing now...
Traveler: Aw, then can I have an invitation letter instead?
Qiu'ge: An invitation letter... You still haven't got yours? I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to help...
Qiu'ge: I'm not a guest, they just booked me to come and sing here tonight. As soon as my performance is over, I have to leave.
Qiu'ge: But... *cough* my throat... I'm guessing my performance will be delayed for a while.
Traveler: How can I get hold of an invitation letter?
Qiu'ge: Let me get this straight, you're looking to get somebody on board to issue you with an invitation letter? Well, a word of advice, then: Forget it.
Qiu'ge: Nobody in this place is going to want to do that for someone they don't know.
Qiu'ge: Sorry to be so blunt about it. But people just won't be willing to take such a risk when it's their own neck on the line.
Qiu'ge: So, you're here for a good time, I suppose? Though somehow, you don't quite look dressed for the occasion...
Qiu'ge: I get it, though. You want to see something new, meet some new people, and so on. Chances like this are few and far between.
Qiu'ge: Hmm... While I can't help you with the invitation letter, I might just have a way of helping you to stay on board legitimately.
Qiu'ge: You'll have to do something for me in return, though. My throat is really quite sore right now... I need three Qingxin flowers to make some soothing tea, but I haven't had the chance to leave the boat.
Qiu'ge: Can you fetch me three Qingxin flowers?
Traveler: Sure, no problem.
Qiu'ge: Fantastic. As soon as you're back, I'll let you in on my idea.
Traveler: Is that all?
Qiu'ge: It's not much, but it's what I need. As soon as you're back, I'll let you in on my idea.

### Additional Talk 6

Qiu'ge: Did you bring the Qingxin flowers?
Traveler: I brought them.
Qiu'ge: Let me see... Yep, those are the ones. My tutor swore by Qingxins for a sore throat, here's hoping it works for me too...
Qiu'ge: Right then, as discussed, I have now added your name to the list of performers in the opera troupe.
Qiu'ge: That should tide you over at least for as long as I'm on board.
Qiu'ge: Now's your chance. Go get that invitation letter while you can.
Traveler: Why are you helping me?
Qiu'ge: Ah, you know...
Qiu'ge: I was in your position once, back when I was still a student. Desperate for opportunities to advance myself, show the world what I was capable of...
Qiu'ge: Struggling along all on your own is not a good feeling. I'm only where I am today thanks to my tutor's assistance.
Qiu'ge: And now that I've made it, it's my turn to give a little something back, too.
Qiu'ge: Anyway, I'll spare you the rest of my life story... I mentioned to Luoxia about putting on the performers list, she said she wants to see you.
Qiu'ge: Don't worry, I explained everything. She won't give you any trouble.

### Additional Talk 7

Luoxia: It seems that you still haven't found yourself an invitation letter.
Traveler: Not yet. But I will.
Luoxia: You sound just like our boss... Ever the optimist.
Luoxia: But there is no longer any need. Your efforts so far have already paid off.
Luoxia: I heard all about you getting turned down by every guest you spoke to. But I also heard something else, too.
Luoxia: Cui'er is quietly asking all the staff on board about which guests they find the easiest to talk to and to strike up a rapport with.
Luoxia: Meanwhile, Qiu'ge has just added your name to her list of performers. She stressed that you're a last-minute addition, and that I shouldn't be in a hurry to kick you off the boat.
Luoxia: Don't you find it amusing? The VIPs are quick to turn you away without a second thought, while it's the regular folk who are happy to lend you a hand.
Luoxia: *giggle* Make of it what you will, anyway. But anyway, you don't need to worry about getting an invitation letter anymore.
Luoxia: The whole thing about sending you around begging for an invitation letter was just a little idea our boss had.
Luoxia: In fact, he personally wrote you an invitation letter and handed it to me quite some time ago. But he said only to tell you about it once you had finished dealing with everything else.
Luoxia: From here on out, you are free to come and go on the Pearl Galley as you please.
Traveler: Who's the boss?
Luoxia: His name is Rouran. You may well have met him before...
Luoxia: Okay, I've told you everything which I am able to.
Luoxia: You'll be pleased to know that the next time you wish to visit the Pearl Galley, you won't need to take the aerial route.
Luoxia: We have a ferryman stationed at the harbor, his name is Pinghai. He takes people between the Pearl Galley and the shore. Just speak to him whenever you wish to visit.
Luoxia: He is on board at the moment. Let him know when you wish to return to shore.
Traveler: What was the point of that wild goose chase?
Luoxia: The boss must have his reasons. Far be it from me, a lowly servant, to speculate on what they might be.
Traveler: I just need more time.
Luoxia: Heh, I don't doubt for one minute your ability to obtain an invitation letter, or anything else you wanted for that matter — if you had enough time.
Luoxia: But there is no longer any need. Your efforts so far have already paid off.

### Additional Talk 8

Pinghai: You must be the new guest? If you want to go back to shore, just say the word.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Return to Liyue Harbor
Pinghai: Certainly, this way for the ferry, please.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: Stay on Board
Pinghai: No problem, just let me know whenever you're ready.

### Additional Talk 11

Luoxia: That was just about the most unconventional entrance any visitor has ever made to the Pearl Galley...
Luoxia: But, I'm afraid you'll be needing an invitation letter if you wish to stay.

### Additional Talk 12

Luoxia: When you want to go back ashore, just speak to Pinghai.
Luoxia: In the future, whenever you want to visit again, find him at the harbor, and he will escort you.

### Additional Talk 13

Qiu'ge: Come back here once you've got the Qingxin flowers. I think I have a way to keep you on board.

### Additional Talk 14

Cui'er: Don't worry, I'll let you know the moment I hear anything.

### Additional Talk 15

Guan Hong: My apologies, I'm not giving an invitation to a complete stranger.

### Additional Talk 16

Li the Ninth: Ahh, what a beautiful wine, the best of the best! Haha, oh yes, this is the good stuff!

### Additional Talk 17

Luo Feng: I tend to be selective in my choice of invitees. I'm sure you must be able to understand.

### Additional Talk 18

Maksim: Forget it, you're not getting an invitation from me.

### Additional Talk 19

Qiu'ge: You should go and speak to Luoxia. Don't worry, I explained the situation.

### Additional Talk 20

Qiu'ge: How'd it go? I'm guessing Luoxia agree to let you stay on board?
Traveler: Guess who got an invitation letter!
Qiu'ge: Really? ...From Luoxia? She invited you?
Qiu'ge: I'm so intrigued... you must be somebody important for Luoxia to issue you an invitation letter personally.
Qiu'ge: Congratulations, in any case. These invitation letters are a big deal, not even my tutor has one.
Qiu'ge: Ah, but your name is still on the opera troupe listing... I've already submitted it, and it's probably too late to change by now...
Traveler: Nothing wrong with that!
Qiu'ge: As long as you don't mind, then it's fine. Well then, feel free to come and see the troupe whenever you're free. Once my throat's recovered you'll get to hear me sing.
Qiu'ge: When will I get my invitation letter...
Traveler: Well then, if you ever need my help with opera stuff...
Qiu'ge: No, no, I wouldn't dream of asking you to help out! I just signed you up as a favor, I wasn't trying to rope you into anything.
Qiu'ge: Feel free to come and see the troupe whenever you're free. Once my throat's recovered you'll get to hear me sing.

### Additional Talk 21

Sisi: Chaoxi, does this mean you'll have to go back to the ship before too long?
Chaoxi: *sigh* It's not like I want to, but perhaps this is just my lot as a sailor...
Sisi: ...Xi...
