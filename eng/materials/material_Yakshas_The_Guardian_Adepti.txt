# Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti

A volume out of the "Wonders and Folklore of Liyue" collection, which serves as Liyue's own version of "Tour of the Land of Liyue," an encyclopedia of folk beliefs and customs by Masudi, a scholar from Sumeru. Due to the archaic nature of the author's writing style, it was largely dismissed by the public and publishers alike. "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti" introduces the readers to the various yakshas who fought side-by-side with the Geo Archon.
