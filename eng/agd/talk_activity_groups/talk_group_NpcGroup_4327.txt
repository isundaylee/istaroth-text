## Talk

Alphonso: The mission... I don't want to deal with it... What should I do? If the kids... Rana...

## Talk

Traveler: (Let's leave quietly.)
Alphonso: There's no other choice... It must be done...

## Talk

Alphonso: Vimara Village is such a great place... If you live here for some time, you'll definitely fall in love with it too.

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you staying in Vimara Village?
Alphonso: Where should I begin? Hmm... I came to Sumeru with my teacher to participate in the Akademiya's symposium. We passed by this place, and somehow I wanted to stay...
Alphonso: Vimara Village is much more comfortable than Fontaine, both the environment and the atmosphere.

## Talk

Traveler: About the children...
Alphonso: Kavus, Sudabeh, and Iotham are very good kids. They are so full of energy.
Alphonso: But some parts of the forest are too dangerous. Every time they go missing, I always wished if only they weren't that curious.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rana...
Alphonso: Rana is responsible and loved by those "tiger cubs"...
Alphonso: But she's always busy in the forest. I really wish she would rest a little more.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Alphonso: Alright. I hope you like it here.

## Talk

Alphonso: *sigh* What should I do if this goes on, Rana...

## Talk

Traveler: Rana will be fine.
Alphonso: ...
Alphonso: I'll take your word for it.

## Talk

Traveler: About Iotham...
Alphonso: The good news is Iotham is unharmed. But... the incident with Rana was a major blow to him.
Alphonso: But as they say, "Do not yield to the wind, or the rain. Do not yield to the winter snow, or the summer heat..."
Alphonso: It's these setbacks that help us grow stronger. I hope Iotham will learn from this experience too.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Alphonso: See you.

## Talk

Alphonso: What should I do about my mission?

Traveler: (Let's leave quietly.)
Alphonso: What should I do...
