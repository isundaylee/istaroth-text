Traveler: Do you need a hand?
Gentry De'an: #Hmph! {F#She}{M#He} wants to lend a hand! And just how do you expect to do that? Raise the dead? Magically recover my lost wealth?
Gentry De'an: *sigh* I used to have my own bank... The Minghua Company and the Minghua Bank used to be the two proudest stores on this whole street.
Gentry De'an: But then those bankers from Snezhnaya started descending on the Liyue financial market... All thanks to backing from the Fatui, I might add, not an honest-to-god bootstrapper among them! Anyway... that marked the beginning of the end for the old guard...
Gentry De'an: If I was a young man with some fight left in me, oh you can be sure I'd be fighting to make my comeback...
Gentry De'an: But there's not much an old man like me can do now.
Traveler: The Fatui?
Gentry De'an: What about them? ...You've never heard of them?
Gentry De'an: They came over here from Snezhnaya, flaunting their diplomatic immunity, then they started poking around in business circles, putting feelers out... I had a bad feeling about them from the start.
Gentry De'an: Then they started interfering with my business... They were intent on getting Snezhnayan investment into Liyue one way or another.
Gentry De'an: They were just relentless. Eventually, I had no choice but to sell off the bank to them. And the company? Who knows how much longer it will last. Business is getting worse by the day...
