# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Yegor: It's nothing serious, really. I'm living just fine here in Ritou, and business has been great since the Sakoku Decree was abolished.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders in Inazuma City. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...
