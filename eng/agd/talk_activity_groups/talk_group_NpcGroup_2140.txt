## Talk

Baixiao: Hello there, Traveler. How may I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: About the Jade Chamber...
Baixiao: The Jade Chamber is where Lady Ningguang holds court. Here, she gathers information and makes important decisions.
Baixiao: From here, there is no matter in Liyue, great or small, that she cannot oversee. Nor can any rumor escape our ears or eyes.
Baixiao: Of course, we continued working for Lady Ningguang during the period before the Jade Chamber's restoration, just as we always had... But it's good to be back.
Baixiao: Unfortunately, while you are Lady Ningguang's honored guest, we cannot disclose the intelligence gathered here to you. My apologies.

## Talk

Traveler: What can you tell me about Ningguang?
Baixiao: Lady Ningguang is one of the Liyue Qixing. She oversees all of Liyue and its trade.
Baixiao: You must forgive me for not being able to say more.
Baixiao: But considering how well the two of you get along... You might simply be able to ask her if you desire answers.

## Talk

Traveler: I have the utmost respect for Lady Ningguang.
Baixiao: Hmm... You are, indeed, a rare and honest sort â€” cut from a different cloth from those honey-tongued merchants, greedy for the smallest scrap of information.
Baixiao: The path to riches is actually quite simple. I've spent a lot of time by Lady Ningguang's side, and learned some... secrets, here and there.
Baixiao: How about this: Here are some nuggets of wisdom on the subject of "gold." It's my own personal guidance rather than Lady Ningguang's per se, but maybe it will still be able to bring fortune and prosperity your way.

Baixiao: Welcome, is there anything I can do for you?
