# Chili Con Cloudy


## Talk 1

Wenhua: This is the place. Please, do it!
Paimon: Whoa, who's the real bandit here?
Startled Treasure Hoarder: Hmm!? Who are you? We're with the Iron and Salt Gang, so you'd better watch yourself around us!

## Talk 2

Wenhua: Yun! My Yun! I've come to take you home!
Traveler: Yun?
Wenhua: It's my precious, my baby Yunyun, stolen by these Treasure Hoarders!
Wenhua: I've been a merchant for many years, and all my savings went into my three precious Sumpter Beasts. Chili is the most obedient and has always stayed with me. Jue, the most mischievous, ran off a long time ago...
Wenhua: If even Yun should leave me... Ah, that would be tragedy unbearable! Thank you, good folk, truly!
Wenhua: You must've suffered, haven't you? I've brought you your favorite Jueyun Chilis! Come, come, have some!
Wenhua: Hmm? You're not eating them anymore, Yun? ...Have you learned the wrong lessons while you've been out and about? Come on, eat!
Paimon: Uh, do Sumpter Beasts even eat Jueyun Chilis?
Wenhua: That's what I've been feeding Yun this whole time! Surely I know what it likes!
Tusheng (???): You're a disgrace, old man... Don't you know that Sumpter Beasts like eating fruit?
Tusheng (???): Unless they're practically starving, they won't eat Jueyun Chilis — that stuff's bad for their health.
Paimon: Huh? And who in the world are you?
Traveler: A wild Treasure Hoarder appeared!
Paimon: Huh, and here Paimon thought that it might be someone actually important...
Wenhua: Well, either way, Yun's back with us, so let's head back...
Tusheng (???): Hey! Don't you ignore me!
Wenhua: Hmph, alright... you thief.
Wenhua: Your comrades have all been brought to justice, but still, you dare to say this and that about my precious...
Wenhua: "Say"? I'll give you "say." Gainsay, soothsay, hearsay, assay, naysay...
Traveler: Uh, where's this coming from...
Wenhua: ...Essay, unsay...
Traveler: Alright, you can stop now!
Paimon: That's right! You, too, calm down! Let's hear them out — we can decide what to do later.
Tusheng (???): Pfft, a crook, he says... Your Sumpter Beast ran to us of its own accord... The rest locked it up, but I've been taking care of it this whole time.
Tusheng: Tusheng's the name. Yes, meaning "local-born," because that's exactly what I am.
Tusheng: As for why I know this and that about Sumpter Beasts, that's because I used to work for a caravan in Sumeru. I came to the Treasure Hoarders because they offered better pay... Pah. Didn't think things would get this dangerous.
Tusheng: Anyway, your Sumpter Beast... It ate all the Berries I spent three days picking. It must've been starving.
Paimon: Huh, so it was hungry... That would explain why it ran off...
Wenhua: What nonsense! This crook lies! Isn't Chili by my side still?
Traveler: Well, you do have a point there...
Tusheng: You have another Sumpter Beast? It comes from good stock, I presume? That's to say, a good breed?
Wenhua: Of course! Hmph... Why do you ask?
Tusheng: Sumpter Beasts of good breeds can go a long time without eating or drinking, which is what makes them excellent for long-distance transport through both desert and rainforest. *sigh* It's just a shame that some people are willing to spend so much Mora on buying them, but not on caring for them...
Wenhua: Who're you talking about, huh? What do you mean, "not on caring for them"? So you're an expert, is that it? After studying Sumpter Beasts for just a couple days? Huh?
Tusheng: I haven't formally studied, no, but I have fed Sumpter Beasts.
Tusheng: Anyway, Yunyun over here's been living good these past few days, so don't feed it anything weird from now on, alright?
Wenhua: You... Cutpurse cretin! Scurrilous slanderer! Well then, if you say Yun's been living well, why don't we have a showdown between it and Chili, then?
Paimon: Huh? A competition... how, exactly?
Wenhua: We'll take them out on a walk, and see which one is in higher spirits! If Chili has a spring in its step, that's how we'll know that this person's been putting Yun through the wringer!
Paimon: We saw Yun break through the fence earlier — it sure looked pretty lively then. It must've eaten pretty well, right?
Traveler: Well, someone's being unnecessarily competitive...
Tusheng: Hmph! Who's afraid of you, anyway?
Wenhua: Fine! Don't you dare leave — come to my camp. That's where Chili is. We'll have it out there!
Traveler: And didn't you have another Sumpter Beast up and leave on you...?
Wenhua: Jue... Do you mean Jue left because it was hungry? Impossible! Impossible!
Tusheng: And why would it be impossible? Even people hate places where there isn't enough to eat.
Traveler: Let's just hear what our thieving friend has to... say.
Wenhua: S—S—Say... Hmph! Fine, as you wish! Spit it out, you crook!
Traveler: Eek! A wild Treasure Hoarder appeared!
Paimon: Whoa, so spooky!
Wenhua: So sneaky!
Yunyun: Moo!
Tusheng (???): Oi! Quit making mountains out of molehills, you!

## Talk 3

Wenhua: Ah! My Yun! These wicked Treasure Hoarders didn't bully you, did they?
Paimon: Uh, do you really have to get all that fuzzy-wuzzy with a Sumpter Beast?
Startled Treasure Hoarder: Hmm!? Who are you? We're with the Iron and Salt Gang, so you'd better watch yourself around us!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Why are there Treasure Hoarders here too!?
Paimon: Whoa, and they're raising that Sumpter Beast? They sure do have time on their hands...

## Talk 5

Wenhua: See? Chili's doing great! And on the other hand... Yun's doing so poorly it breaks my heart.
Tusheng: Are you sure your eyes are working right, old man? Isn't it the other way around?
Paimon: Uhh... Y'know, Paimon can't really tell either way. They just look pretty similar. Maybe we'll need them to walk around a bit to tell.
Wenhua: Please, could the two of you be our referees? I'm sure you'll be impartial.
Paimon: And what are the rules, exactly?
Wenhua: We'll just see who gets to the finish line first — Yun, or Chili! I'll have my assistant wait at the finish line.
Wenhua: You can go over there now, Mingli.
Mingli: Yes, Boss.
Tusheng: Old man, don't you think you're too tough on the Sumpter Beasts? Especially that Chili of yours, it looks super hungry.
Wenhua: Hahaha! Scared, young one? Making excuses, are we?
Tusheng: What slander. I'm only being considerate! Fine, let's compete! I ain't afraid of you none!
Wenhua: Heh, let's begin then. I'm about to teach you a good lesson.
Mingli: Boss, we can start now!
Wenhua: Okay, begin!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh? Yunyun's stopped!
Wenhua: See? What did I say?
Paimon: You say that, but... Chili Pepper's stopped, too.
Tusheng: They must both be hungry.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa! That Sumpter Beast's charging, now that's what Paimon calls energy!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Mingli: Hello there. I'm Mingli, the boss's assistant.
Paimon: Why the long face?
Mingli: I'm worried about my boss... He lost yet another Sumpter Beast... We had three in total, but now we're just down to one!
Mingli: Sumpter Beasts are quite expensive, and neither my boss nor I know much about keeping them. We're going to take big losses if we keep going like this.
Mingli: Do you guys think he's getting old and starting to forget things?

### Additional Talk 2

Mingli: It's not over yet? Did something unexpected happen?
Traveler: It's over.
Mingli: Huh!? Did Boss forget that I'm waiting at the end!? Is his age finally catching up with him...
Mingli: Perhaps it's time for me to start looking at other options...
