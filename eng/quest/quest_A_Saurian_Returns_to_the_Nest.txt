# A Saurian Returns to the Nest


## Talk 1

???: "Sing me a song, call the flying Saurians and birds who have left their nests..."
Paimon: Huh? Do you hear that? Someone way up high is singing, and they're pretty good too. Wanna go say hello to them?

## Talk 2

Manyoya: Not that easy, huh?
Manyoya: Our captain would be furious if word got out that we flying squad members could be surpassed by just any passing adventurer. Haha!
Manyoya: Alright, it's nothing to be upset about. I should be thanking you for keeping my pride intact, if anything.
Manyoya: You flew quite well, but it's still too soon for you to surpass me.
Manyoya: If you think you can do better, why don't you give it another try? You should never stop trying while you're young. Losing isn't a big deal anyway.

## Talk 3

Manyoya: So, are we competing, then?
Manyoya: Ride your Saurian, and fly at full speed along the course, striving to get the highest possible score within the time limit. *It counts as a win for you as long as you exceed the second-highest score tier.*
Traveler: I'm ready.
Manyoya: Nice! Let's head to the starting point.
Traveler: I need a little more time.
Manyoya: Of course. Just let me know when you're ready. Flying has always been about relaxing and having fun.

## Talk 4

Manyoya: I enjoyed flying with you! Let's do this again sometime —but until then, take care, young adventurer.

## Talk 5

Manyoya: Hahaha! You were great! Guess it's true what they say, that the young are bound to surpass the old.
Manyoya: Even stars may fall, let alone people.
Manyoya: My time is over. Retiring happily was the right choice.
Manyoya: ...
Manyoya: ... Ah, but it's just so difficult to accept. I'm still young, I don't even have wrinkles. Why do I even have to retire?
Manyoya: How could my career be over so soon? I started falling before I could even experience what it was like to reach the top.
Manyoya: Had I known I'd have so many regrets...
Manyoya: Never mind. If I could do it all again, I would still make the same choices.
Manyoya: I would still do my best to join the flying squad, which isn't difficult given my skills. Then I'd wind up retiring at this age again.
Manyoya: I've done my best, and all I can do now is accept it.
Manyoya: I guess that's life. Many things are beyond our control, and if you dream of being a hero, perhaps you must accept that you can shine for but an instant.
Paimon: Manyoya...
Manyoya: #Not to worry, he's a brilliant flier. You had this pitying look the whole time, so why the uneasy face now?
Manyoya: Haha! Life's full of surprises, and they'll come whether you accept 'em or not.
Manyoya: Consider it a pearl of wisdom from a retired Saurian rider. My issues are my own to solve. Don't let them ruin your mood.
Manyoya: I'm impressed. If only my siblings were as calm as you are.
Paimon: You have siblings?
Manyoya: That's right. Two younger brothers, and unlike you, they're a chore and a half to get through to.
Manyoya: They're training their flying skills too— Well, no. Acomitl's just focused on running away from it all, so he might've been hiding instead.
Manyoya: Forget about those brats. I can see your talent, clear as day.
Manyoya: Try training a little more if you get the time. Who knows? The flying squad may come knocking at your door.
Traveler: I'll try my best.
Manyoya: That's good to hear. I hope I'll catch you flying again. Good luck, young warrior.

## Talk 6

Manyoya: It's time for my Saurian to return to its nest. Shall I too descend from the stage in the skies?
Traveler: Don't stop flying.
Manyoya: I guess you heard me mumbling to myself, huh?
Manyoya: I should make a trip home — haven't told my family about my retirement yet.
Manyoya: I'll have a bunch of free time soon, but I haven't figured out what to do with it.
Manyoya: Once I find my bearings, I'll have to face the next stage of my life.
Manyoya: So I should hear what my family has to say about it first. My father used to be in the flying squad, and he became a training master after retirement.
Manyoya: He's been on this path, so he's got to have some thoughts on the matter.
Manyoya: So, I'll be dismantling this place and taking it with me, but I'll leave the course here. Young warriors like you still need a place to train, after all.
Paimon: Will we meet again, Manyoya?
Manyoya: I don't know. But no matter what choice I make, I don't think I can ever give up on the skies.
Manyoya: So as long as you don't stop flying, I think we'll meet again.
Traveler: Until next time, then.
Manyoya: See you, young warrior.
Traveler: Manyoya...
Manyoya: Oh, there you are.
