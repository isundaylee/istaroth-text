Traveler: Thinking about graffiti again, are we?
Toltec: Haha, I should have expected no less of the one chosen by Elder Tlapo! You saw straight through me at a glance.
Toltec: Graffiti is the kind of art style that... really requires natural talent.
Toltec: Talent I evidently don't have, or I'd have thrown up the perfect masterpiece to showcase the arc of both the Ley Lines and phlogiston.
