Traveler: How do you like it here?
Dori: Ahem, well, even though it's nothing compared to the Palace of Alcazarzaray...
Dori: I suppose it could suffice as my backup base. It'll do.
Traveler: "It'll do"? C'mon, it's gotta be better than that...
Dori: Puh-lease, merely receiving a compliment from the wise and mighty Lord Sangemah Bay...
Dori: Is already high praise indeed!
Dori: You're certainly a cut above the average artless toadstool!
Dori: But, if the knowledgeable Lord Sangemah Bay is to serve as a renovation consultant for this place...
Dori: You'll need some Mora, a LOT of Mora...
Dori: No rush, though. I'm sure you'll save enough Mora... someday.
Dori: I suppose I might stay here a little longer, now that there's an opportunity to earn big Mora, hehe.
Traveler: How do I take it from "It'll do" to "It's amazing"?
Dori: Oh? You mean... you mean, what'll it take for it to beat the Palace of Alcazarzaray as my primary base?
Dori: Wow, good to see my young apprentice show some ambition for once.
Dori: Really, I'm impressed!
