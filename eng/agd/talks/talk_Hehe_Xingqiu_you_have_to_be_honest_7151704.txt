# Talk Dialog

Hu Tao: Hehe, Xingqiu, you have to be honest.
Xingqiu: Hm? Honest about what?
Hu Tao: How did you and Venti really meet?
Xingqiu: Wh—Why are you suddenly asking that...
Xiangling: Eh? Aren't they book buddies?
Xingqiu: Yeah! We met a few times at a book convention, that's all...
Hu Tao: Ohh? Really?
Hu Tao: With that extraordinary demeanor and literary talent, he's definitely not just any bard.
Hu Tao: If he's someone that could hold his ground in a conversation with the consultant, he needs to at least be as talented as me!
Xingqiu: Um, perhaps you're overthinking this matter...
Hu Tao: Ah...
Xiangling: Hu Tao, Xingqiu wouldn't lie to us...
Xingqiu: *sigh* Okay, I'll tell you the truth.
Xiangling: Huh!?
Chongyun: Xingqiu...!
Xingqiu: I'm actually a fan of Venti's poetry.
Xingqiu: You all know that I love reading, and sometimes come across poetry from Mondstadt.
Xingqiu: Among those works, I admire the ones penned by Venti the most. Just as Hu Tao said, his artistry is the reflection of his personality — remarkable grace and exceptional literary talent.
Xingqiu: I guess Venti didn't tell you the whole truth back at the restaurant because he didn't want to embarrass me in front of everyone... He's such a considerate person.
Chongyun: ...Yes, right. I can confirm that.
Chongyun: When Xingqiu was busy with other things, he asked me to buy him poetry books in secret.
Xiangling: I see...
Xiangling: That didn't sound like too much of a big deal. You could've told us right away.
Xingqiu: Well, I'm telling you now, aren't I?
Hu Tao: Oh... So that's your story...
Hu Tao: ...Ah, forget it. Let's drop this topic.
Hu Tao: It's not often that the four of us are all together. What should we do next? Hide-and-seek, hopscotch, or some shopping?
Chongyun: Since there's four of us... Why don't we borrow a mahjong set?
