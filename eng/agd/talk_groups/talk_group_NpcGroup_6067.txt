Anchieta: Hello there. Want to try playing an instrument?

## Talk

Traveler: You're...
Anchieta: The boss of Djembe Studios, at your service. I sell some old instruments.
Anchieta: Quite a few tourists who watch musical performances at Colomche Plaza come here to buy some — for my part, I always get them to try things out first, then come back the next day.
Anchieta: Many youngsters get caught up in the heat of the moment, buy an instrument, then wind up never playing it.
Anchieta: All the ones sold here hold some sentimental value to me, so I'd rather they not lie abandoned in someone's house.
Anchieta: As such, I prefer to give customers a chance to cool down and come back later. There's time aplenty, after all.
Anchieta: This store isn't going anywhere, and there's nothing wrong with just enjoying music.

Traveler: When you say "old fogeys"...
Anchieta: Ah, heard that, did you? Sorry about that. I was just talking about some old friends from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Anchieta: I'm often invited to perform and sing at some of their tribe's events when music or song accompaniment is required...
Anchieta: ...But those louts never show up to watch, even when I make the long, long trip over to where they are.
Anchieta: *sigh* Forget it. Those old geezers are just like that.
Anchieta: Unless I write them a letter myself, there's no getting them to move — and I ain't doing that!

Traveler: I'm fine for now.
Anchieta: Alright. See you then.

Traveler: Do you have something suitable for me?
Anchieta: Haha, that all depends on your talents.
