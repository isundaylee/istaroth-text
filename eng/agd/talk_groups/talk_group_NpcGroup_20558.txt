Scribbled Notes: (A piece of paper that has become crinkled due to the damp environment in the cavern. There are words on it, which you can read.)
Scribbled Notes: "I traveled together with Watatsumi's chosen hero this time. We discovered that the Bathysmal Vishaps had suddenly become active."
Scribbled Notes: "However, the clerk from the Sangonomiya Shrine convinced us to spare them. As it turns out, the people of Watatsumi were feeding these creatures when they threw food offerings into the Moon-Bathed Deep."
Scribbled Notes: "He even said that they could no longer pose any threat to humanity, so it was best that Enkanomiya be returned to them."
