# Serpent Devourer - Sublimation

A glorious, illusory sword glimmering with the power of "Life" that emerged from the depths of the Ley Lines. It can change its appearance based on the Elemental Type of its wielder. Legend has it that this sword once held the name "Logseims" when it was wielded by a transcendent sinner in an ancient land.
