# Festive Tour Ticket

Take part in the celebratory activities of the Windblume Festival to obtain these tickets and exchange them in the event shop for rewards.
The people of Mondstadt are fun-loving by nature, and they have a celebration for the seasons, the harvests of different crops, and the anniversaries of events of historic significance. Perhaps there might be a festival to commemorate the outlander who repelled Stormterror someday...?
