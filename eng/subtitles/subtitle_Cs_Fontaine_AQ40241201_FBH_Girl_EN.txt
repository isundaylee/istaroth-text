Ah
The hour of my execution is almost here
For the sinner
The curtain call has come
I know I may not sound it
But...
Faced with death
I find myself a little afraid
Perhaps
This is one thing both gods and humans have in common
Hehe
Farewell
Neuvillette
I hope you've enjoyed the part you played these five hundred years
Thank you, Furina
For all you've done
From this moment on
Please live happily as a human
Just as I wished we could
I, Iudex Neuvillette
Hereby declare...
People of Fontaine, your sins are forgiven
