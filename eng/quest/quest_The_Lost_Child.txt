# The Lost Child


## Talk 1

Rana: I'm so glad you both could come with me. Still, I'll need to report the expansion of the nearby Withering Zone to Tighnari.
Paimon: Eh? Is that... the kid from Vimara Village?
Rana: Eh? Iotham! Wait up!

## Talk 2

Rana: Iotham... What happened...
Iotham: #Wah, Rana... and Traveler...
Paimon: Eh? What're you doing in... a Withering Zone... And there are so many monsters...
Rana: ...
Traveler: I'll take care of this.
Rana: No... There's no time...
Rana: #Darn it! Traveler, let's do this together!
Rana: Iotham, wait here and don't move! We're coming to rescue you!
Traveler: What's that green thing...?

## Talk 3

Rana: Whew... Hah... Finally...
Iotham: Rana... Waaah...
Rana: Iotham... It's okay, little man, there's nothing to cry about. Look... If I can tell them about what I felt in the Withering Zone... to those Akademiya researchers... they'll be able to take care of The Withering for good...
Rana: #And... did you see... me fight? No... did you see Traveler fight? Be sure to thank him...
Paimon: Rana...
Traveler: Please, that's enough.
Paimon: Rana, you'd better rest now...
Rana: Ha... haha... it's fine. I just feel a little dizzy, that's all. And a little tired...
Iotham: Rana... I'm sorry...
Rana: Wh... What are you talking about? You're my little tiger, so no more crying! You're okay, aren't you? Does anything hurt, Iotham...? Do you feel dizzy, weak, or...
Iotham: I'm fine, but Rana, you...
Rana: It's nothing... I'll be fine. I'm a battle-hardened Forest Watcher, after all! Let's go!
Traveler: I'll go get help.

## Talk 4

Rana: Don't worry about me... You guys go ahead.

## Talk 5

Fatui Sergeant: ...Who are you people? Don't get in our way.
Rana: Hmph, I should be asking you that question! I'm a Forest Watcher here, and I'm in the middle of searching for a missing child. State your names!
Traveler: It's the Fatui! Where did they come from?
Rana: Huh? So, these are the Fatui that Alphonso mentioned? State your business.
Fatui Sergeant: Alphonso...? Whatever, don't think you'll be getting out of here without a fight!
Rana: Well, looks like we're not gonna be able to talk this one out!
Traveler: It's the Fatui. Be careful.

## Talk 6

Rana: #Thank goodness you were here, Traveler...
Traveler: Don't worry.
Rana: Looks like Alphonso wasn't kidding, these Fatui guys are dangerous...
Rana: Anyway, we can talk more about that later. Iotham must be somewhere deeper in the cave. We'd better keep moving.
Traveler: You fought well.
Rana: Really? Hehe, probably because you and Paimon were by my side.

## Talk 7

Alphonso: #Iotham? Why are you... and Traveler...
Paimon: It's urgent, so we'll make this quick...
Black Screen Text: You quickly explain what happened.
Alphonso: ...I see. Iotham, you go rest up.
Iotham: Okay. I'm sorry, Alphonso...
Alphonso: #It's fine, what matters is that you're okay... Wait here a moment, Traveler. I'll go with you as soon as I prepare some medicine.
Traveler: There's no time. This is the location, head there as soon as you can.
Paimon: Yeah, we have to hurry back to look after Rana...
Alphonso: Eh? Wait...

## Talk 8

Paimon: ...Eh? Paimon's sure this was the place...
Paimon: Rana! Can you hear Paimon?
Traveler: Rana!
Paimon: No answer... Darn it! What happened?
Paimon: Hm...? These traces...
Paimon: We'd better follow them... Maybe they're clues left for us by Rana.
Traveler: What are these traces...

## Talk 9

Rana: ...
Paimon: Hey! Rana! Can you hear Paimon?
Rana: ...
Paimon: What's going on here...? Could it be that Ara-thing Iotham and Rana were talking about? What was it called again?
Traveler: "Ararakalari"?
Paimon: Ah, yes, right, that was it! Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something...
Arana: Yes. Nara smart. Ararakalari can resist Marana.
Paimon: Woah!
Arana: Woah!
Traveler: Isn't this the thing we saw before...?
Paimon: Phew... You scared Paimon! Paimon thought you were a talking vegetable...
Arana: Not vegetable, Arana. Arana is friend, Aranara.
Traveler: "Aranara"...
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Aranara? Now that Paimon's really looking at you, Paimon thinks we really have seen you before...
Traveler: "Arana"...
Paimon: Paimon thinks we heard this name when Iotham was telling that story before...
Arana: Yes. Nara Iotham is Arana's friend.
Arana: #Aranara are children of the forest, we live with trees. Not like you, Nara Traveler. You are the child of dandelion, always traveling.
Paimon: #How do you know Traveler's name?
Arana: How Arana knows, not important. But Arana wants to help Narana, this very important.
Traveler: Narana... That's almost a tongue-twister.
Paimon: You want to help Rana? What do you need us to do?
Arana: Thank you, you good Nara. She is Arana's very important friend. So, Arana will protect her.
Arana: #But that is not enough. To heal Narana, we need Bija. Nara Traveler must go to Vanarana and ask everyone to help get Bija.
Traveler: Bija...
Arana: Narana got corroded by Marana, very serious. Bad bugs are biting tree roots. Trees will wither, fruits will rot.
Arana: Nara's life is like tree, bad bugs, like Marana. Only Bija can make Narana better.
Paimon: Uh... So, we need to go somewhere called "Vanarana" and come up with a way to get this Bija, right? Then we can heal Rana?
Arana: Mm-hmm.
Traveler: Then Rana's current condition...
Arana: No worry. Arana will be here and fight Marana corrosion. So, Rana will not get worse.
Arana: But with no Bija, Rana will not get better either.
Arana: Follow the forest path, keep going towards where water comes from, then you will reach Vanarana.
Arana: Then sing.
Traveler: Sing?
Traveler: (A melody is rising up in my mind...)
Arana: This is the Rhythm of the Great Dream. Sing it to enter Vanarana.
Arana: Enter our dreams, our world.
Traveler: That'll attract Whopperflowers...
Arana: #Nara Traveler, very funny.
Traveler: Got it. How do we get there?
Traveler: What's that?
Traveler: What do you need me to do?
Traveler: "Arana"...
Paimon: Paimon thinks we heard this name when Iotham was telling that story before...
Arana: Yes. Nara Iotham is Arana's friend.
Traveler: "Aranara"...
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Aranara? Now that Paimon's really looking at you, Paimon thinks we really have seen you before...
Traveler: Vegetable...
Traveler: What was that again?
Paimon: Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something... It had a funny name.
Arana: It is Ararakalari. It can fight Marana. Ararakalari, NOT a funny name.

## Talk 10

Rana: #I'm sorry... Traveler, Paimon, I need to rest... Wait for me, Iotham.
Paimon: Rana, are you really okay...?
Traveler: We'll go get help...
Rana: No, no, it's fine... I just need... a little rest...
Iotham: I'm sorry, Rana... I'm sorry...
Rana: Really... How many times do I have to say it? I'm fine! But I'm very angry...
Rana: You promised me... that you wouldn't go into the forest. Once I'm all rested up, I'll teach you a lesson about breaking promises... you little rascal...
Iotham: Waaah... Alphonso said that the mushrooms here are huge! And I just wanted to bring you some fresh mushrooms to eat... to give you energy...
Rana: Dummy... You didn't need to do that. Just thinking of you guys gives me energy...
Rana: Still, hahaha... the mushrooms here really are huge... They'd definitely taste great in a curry...
Traveler: Did Alphonso let you come here?
Iotham: No... Alphonso also told me not to go running off. But I wanted to give Rana something tasty to eat, so I...
Rana: Alphonso wouldn't do that, he's Iotham's big brother...
Paimon: Paimon understands... But Iotham, how did you get stuck in the Withering Zone?
Iotham: When I was in the forest, I thought someone was following me... I got scared, I thought it was Marana's Avatar... So, I just kept running... *sob*
Iotham: And I ended up running into Marana...
Paimon: ?
Traveler: "Marana"?
Rana: That's... The Withering.
Iotham: Oh... Yeah, The Withering.
Traveler: "Marana's Avatar"?
Iotham: Uh-huh. It does bad things in the world for Marana... It's a big black thing...
Paimon: Marana... What a strange name.
Rana: Mm... How did I know that Marana is The Withering...? Dang it... everything's spinning...
Rana: Iotham, what was that green thing just now?
Iotham: ...
Iotham: That was Ararakalari... It can protect people from the corrosion of Marana.
Traveler: More and more things I don't understand...
Rana: This is... a kind of forest magic. It's also a kind of music... It's an Ara...
Traveler: What is it?
Paimon: Don't worry about that, Rana, you need to rest!
Rana: It's on the tip of my tongue, but...
Iotham: I'm sorry, Rana, I'm sorry... I'll never run off like that again, I'll be good and stay home...
Rana: I know. You'll become smart, healthy, and you'll know right from wrong... It's just like knowing which mushrooms you can eat, and which you can't...
Iotham: I know... I know... I'm sorry...
Rana: #Know that Marana is bad, and... the forest is good... Become a strong and good person, help people who need help... just like Traveler and Paimon...
Rana: And don't forget... the forest will remember...
Paimon: Wah, this is bad, Paimon thinks Rana's condition is getting worse!
Traveler: I'll go get help.
Rana: Eh? Oh... I'm fine, really... I just need to rest for a little while...
Rana: #Traveler, please... take Iotham back for me...
Paimon: Okay. Let's go, Iotham. Don't move, Rana! We'll be right back!
Traveler: Rana, wait for us.
Traveler: Don't worry about that right now, rest up.
Traveler: "Marana's Avatar"?
Iotham: Uh-huh. It does bad things in the world for Marana... It's a big black thing...
Traveler: "Marana"?
Rana: That's... The Withering.
Iotham: Oh... Yeah, The Withering.
