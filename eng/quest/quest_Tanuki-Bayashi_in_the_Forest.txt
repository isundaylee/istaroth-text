# Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest


## Talk 1

Ioroi: What? Weren't you off to enjoy your Sacred Secular Steaming Victuals or whatever?
Ioroi: Go now. If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards.

## Talk 2

Paimon: We're finally here! This must be the Chinju Forest.
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden said that an old friend of hers is in here.
Paimon: Well, let's get moving!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is it? It's just a bunch of bare stones...
Paimon: Hmm? He seems to be using some kind of magic to...
Paimon: Whoa! The stones disappeared!
Traveler: That's amazing.
Paimon: So this is bake-danuki magic? Seems kinda fun!
Paimon: Thank you, Kichiboushi! Let's play Hide-and-Seek next time.
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Traveler: That's kinda spooky.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The Sky Kitsune Statue that was supposed to protect the ward... It's empty inside.
Paimon: Maybe it was hidden by Miss Mask's old friend. Let's go find out!
Traveler: "Miss Mask," Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon just came up with that nickname. How is it? Easier to remember, right?
Traveler: Not at all.
Paimon: Well, forget it then... Anyway, let's find some clues first!
Traveler: It makes no sense.

## Talk 5

Ioroi: What? I didn't realize that it was so important. You should've said so earlier...
Ioroi: Agh, I was sealed over this thing for...
Traveler: One hundred years?
Ioroi: Ugh! Stop speaking so lightly of my misfortunes!
Ioroi: Never mind. It's all water under the bridge now. I do also have some inkling about the barrier near the forest.
Ioroi: Back when I was fighting that sneaky kitsune, I once saw it on the eastern seashore. It looks like a Thunder Sakura with a torii gate, right?
Ioroi: Back when that guy was battling the demons or whatever, I was worried that some of them might come out to hurt us. So I used magic to put a seal on that place.
Ioroi: Let me see. The seal should be under the cliff face to the east... Kichiboushi, take them there and remove the seal.
Traveler: Thank you, Ioroi.
Ioroi: Alright, alright. Enough jibber-jabber. Go now.
Ioroi: If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards. Just say... let me think...
Ioroi: "You've ticked me off real good this time, you jerk. Come back and fight me — our contest isn't over yet! And help me break this seal while you're at it, would you? It's not as if I couldn't do it myself or anything, but you still owe me a favor! Also, Gyoubu Koban says he misses you!"
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, that's a lot to remember!
Traveler: One thousand years?
Traveler: One million years?

## Talk 6

Ioroi: Eek! I—I... Mine name is Ioroi. Do whatever you want! K—Kill me if that be your will!
Paimon: Wow, the statue is talking! And it's so scared that it can barely string a sentence together!
Ioroi: I am no statue! This unseemly appearance is but the work of a temporary seal! Mine name is Ioroi, the world-renowned bake-danuki!
Traveler: Ioroi?
Ioroi: What? Are you telling me that folk nowadays have heard naught of Ioroi?
Ioroi: The "Tanuki Gyouen Scroll," "Ioroi's Teapot," "Kakushigami Oobayashi," "Yougou Tanuki Gassen"... Of these tales have you heard nothing?
Ioroi: Ah, how long has mine seal persisted...
Traveler: I mean you no harm...
Ioroi: What? You aren't here to destroy me? Come now, why did you not say so earlier, then?
Ioroi: *cough* Ahem. Well then, speak! Why have you come seeking me, the lord of bake-danuki?
Traveler: This is about the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual...
Ioroi: The Sacred Secular what now? What is that? Some manner of oni treasure?
Traveler: This guy is unbelievable...
Paimon: *sigh* Is he really Miss Masked Maiden's old friend?
Paimon: Anyway, we're looking for something hidden inside a kitsune statue.
Ioroi: Eek... Uh, Wh—Why are you l—looking for that, might I ask?
Traveler: Ah.
Ioroi: Ugh, it's on that comb's account that I was sealed in here for...
Ioroi: ...
Traveler: One hundred years?
Ioroi: I don't know how long it's been! Sunlight doesn't come through the Chinju Forest. There's no way to tell time!
Ioroi: Back then, I wreaked havoc everywhere to lure that sneaky kitsune out, but it was all in vain.
Ioroi: Eventually, I decided to vent my anger by dismantling one of those kitsune statues, and I found a comb inside... Which gave me an idea!
Ioroi: The comb was hidden inside a kitsune statue and even had the Hakushin symbol on it, which reminded me of her white fur...
Ioroi: Thus, I concluded immediately that it must be very important. In which case, I just needed to hide the comb, and that sneaky kitsune would surely come out!
Paimon: Yup, treasure's a good way to lure people out for sure! Then what happened?
Ioroi: Then came one of the humans from the Yougou Three. He defeated my tribe and I, turning all of us to stone.
Paimon: So that's why Ioroi is afraid of humans...
Ioroi: Hmph! Humans. They're so short-lived, and they can't even transform... I don't get why that kitsune likes them so much.
Ioroi: That guy who sealed me up was especially infuriating. He even told me to "strike a nice pose so that I can become nice scenery." Why, that little—!
Traveler: Well, you do make for nice scenery...
Ioroi: Eh? You... How could you...
Paimon: #(Hey, {NICKNAME}, don't annoy him, or we may never get that ward...)
Traveler: I mean to say that you look really bold and burly...
Paimon: That's right! You make this dark forest look so much more colorful!
Ioroi: ...
Ioroi: And?
Traveler: Like the statue of a god...
Paimon: Well, so, being sealed up is not such a bad thing after all, eh? See, humans don't mean you any harm!
Ioroi: I reckon I can see where you're going, but at the same time... I also... don't?
Traveler: Could we borrow that comb you spoke of?
Ioroi: Well, you certainly could... But only if you play with the children first.
Paimon: #Sure, that's easy. {NICKNAME} is good with kids!
Traveler: Am I really...
Ioroi: Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi. Go find these <color=#00E1FFFF>three little tanuki</color> and play with them. I would do it, but as you can see, I'm not exactly at any liberty to move.
Ioroi: That dratted fellow was a bit sloppy when he sealed them. That's why some of them were able to get out earlier.
Ioroi: ...Wait, that's not correct! We should say, rather, that we bake-danuki are most powerful indeed. It's only normal, therefore, that we could free ourselves from a mere human seal!
Traveler: Well, what about you then...
Paimon: Ahem! You speak truth, Ioroi the mighty and powerful!
Ioroi: Although their power can't really compare to mine, they can still use it to hide themselves.
Ioroi: Alright then, off you go.
Traveler: Indeed, most powerful!
Traveler: That's right, I play with Paimon all the time.
Paimon: Hey!
Traveler: Even the Statues of The Seven pale in comparison...
Traveler: I mean that you are truly handsome and truly...
Traveler: One thousand years?
Traveler: One million years?
Traveler: Now we're getting somewhere.
Traveler: I'm looking for wards here...
Ioroi: Warts? Are those edible? We bake-danuki do know quite a bit about cooking.
Paimon: No, it's the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual!
Ioroi: Victuals? Oh, it's been too long since I've had any victuals...
Traveler: I am here to collect a debt.
Ioroi: Uh, collect a debt? Where? When was that? Let me think, let me think...
Ioroi: You, uh... What do I owe you, again?
Paimon: He's thinking really hard...
Paimon: You probably shouldn't tell this sort of joke in front of strangers.
Ioroi: That's right, jest not so!
Ioroi: Mm, it's all good, it's all good... Actually, best I make sure. Do I really owe you nothing?
Paimon: ...Do you really owe that many debts?
Traveler: World-renowned?

## Talk 7

Ioroi: Ooh... I do so wish to scratch mine belly...
Ioroi: Mm? You're back already? Go on, help me find Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi, and go <color=#00E1FFFF>play with them.</color>
Ioroi: Alright then, off you go.

## Talk 8

Ioroi: Hehe, well done! They seem to be quite happy.
Ioroi: ...Huh? Oh, no problem. Let me ask them for you.
Ioroi: Gyoubu Koban was asking, "If you are humans, why do you smell like tanuki?"
Ioroi: ...Actually, that's right! I demand an explanation! Why *do* you smell like tanuki?
Paimon: Eh? You're only asking this now...
Traveler: It was the masked shrine maiden...
Paimon: Right! That's what happened!
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden cooked us a very lavish meal earlier, and she said that she used magic she secretly learned from the bake-danuki to make it.
Ioroi: What? She learned our magic in secret? How dare she...
Ioroi: Hmm... Could it be...
Ioroi: Oh, come on. That sneaky kitsune! If she was still alive, she could at least have come over to say hello, right?
Paimon: She's a shrine maiden with a mask, and she called you an "old friend."
Ioroi: Mask? I don't know anyone with a mask. Don't know any shrine maidens, either. I sure do know a kitsune, though.
Ioroi: ...That said, that sneaky kitsune did appear in the form of a shrine maiden before. What does the shrine maiden you speak of look like?
Paimon: She wears a white fox mask...
Ioroi: Anything else?
Traveler: She had short black hair.
Paimon: And she wore a shrine maiden outfit.
Ioroi: Hmm... Don't know her. Never seen anyone like that in mine life!
Paimon: Is that so...
Ioroi: ...Mm? Yeah, sure, leave it to me.
Ioroi: Shousei said, "It was fun playing with you. Thanks!"
Paimon: Paimon had a lot of fun too!
Traveler: So, about that comb...
Ioroi: Now, now — I am the world renowned bake-danuki Ioroi, and I will surely keep my word. You may have the comb.
Ioroi: But what do you plan to do with the comb, anyway? It probably still smells like kitsune.
Paimon: Well, here's what happened...
Traveler: She was dressed as a shrine maiden.
Paimon: And she had short black hair!
Traveler: We ate some strange stuff...
