Khalil: Hello there. Welcome back to Aaru Village!

## Talk

Traveler: You know me?
Khalil: Hahaha, Isak has mentioned you more than once, so I recognized you right away.
Khalil: Honestly, I'm ashamed that I was too much of a mess to thank you earlier. It's all thanks to you, really, that I'm able to continue living here with him.
Khalil: There was this lady named Setaria who came over to ask me if I wanted to return to the Akademiya, but in the end, I decided to stay here.
Khalil: For one thing, I can't just leave Isak to fend for himself here, and on the other hand, Aaru Village has helped me a lot. And for the other, leaving just like this doesn't sit right with me.
Khalil: I may be old, but I was once a researcher too. I should be able to contribute to the village's development somehow.
