Yoimiya: #Hey, it's you, Traveler! How are you doing?
Yoimiya: If you want to pass the time, you can't go wrong hanging out with me.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Yoimiya: Pretty good! I'm surprised how awesome your place is!
Yoimiya: This is an adeptus relic from Liyue, right? It's incredible. I thought you were joking when you asked me to get into this pot.
Yoimiya: I had no idea what to say, I didn't know if I should object or just follow along...
Traveler: What was your objection going to be?
Yoimiya: Something like, "Are you blind? I can't squeeze into that!"
Yoimiya: Haha, Paimon told me that she had the same reaction when she first saw the pot.
Yoimiya: If she couldn't get in, there would be no chance for me.
Yoimiya: Who would have thought that a little push from you, and poof — we're in here!
Yoimiya: A wide open view, fresh air... It's such a nice place!
Traveler: I'm glad you like it.
Yoimiya: Of course I like it. I could easily live here forever.
Yoimiya: *sigh* Maybe I can open a second "Naganohara" here?
Yoimiya: You can invite all of your friends to see the fireworks. Consider it a gift from me to you!
Traveler: What would you have said to humor me?
Yoimiya: Like, "Let me send over 'Tarou the Goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
Yoimiya: I'm sure it'll be able to get in. It's a goldfish after all.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Yoimiya: Sure, you know I love to talk. Let me think, is there anything interesting going on these days...
Yoimiya: Ah, right. You've got such a large piece of paradise here. Do you have any plans for it, you know, besides just living here?
Yoimiya: Ever thought about building a parlor or a show room? Or maybe a training ground?
Traveler: I'd love to do some business like you.
Yoimiya: Wha—? There might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
Yoimiya: I know merchants in Liyue are really good at making Mora, they're experts at landing deals both big and small.
Yoimiya: However, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
Yoimiya: My pops and I, we mainly do business so that we won't let everyone down.
Yoimiya: Anyway, when it's finished, let me know. I'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.
Traveler: What would you build if you were me?
Yoimiya: Me?... Hehe, I'd build a playground!
Yoimiya: With toys everywhere! They'd be flashing, moving, and spinning. Also, tasty snacks for whenever I'm hungry!
Yoimiya: Living in a world like that would be a dream come true!
Traveler: I'll think about it.
Yoimiya: No, no. No need to seriously consider it. It's just a little fantasy of mine.
Yoimiya: But... I'm happy to hear you say that.
Yoimiya: A playground... Ahh, how wonderful.
Traveler: I want to build a garden.
Yoimiya: Wow, good idea! That sounds really interesting. I want to help.
Yoimiya: If you need anything, just tell me. If it can be found in Inazuma, I can get it for you.
Yoimiya: Thanks to the family business, I've got tons of connections. Haha!
Yoimiya: Well, I guess I can't get you the stars, or the moon. But pretty much anything else.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Yoimiya: I want to know more about youuuu!
Yoimiya: I've heard people everywhere tell tales of your heroics, and I've seen it first-hand adventuring with you.
Yoimiya: But the more I learn, the more curious I become — what makes you so special?
Yoimiya: There is always a reason for everything. For example, I like to talk because when I was a kid, Pops really seemed to enjoy listening to me.
Yoimiya: I like fireworks because creating incredible fireworks makes me feel so proud of my work.
Yoimiya: So what's there for you?
Traveler: There is someone I want to see.
Yoimiya: So that's what drives you.
Yoimiya: And you don't want your reunion to be a disappointing one, do you?
Yoimiya: Wow, I'm really impressed. Honestly, I envy you!
Yoimiya: I'll help you. No matter where it is, you must be reunited!
Yoimiya: Hehe, sorry, I'm getting too excited.
Yoimiya: But I've decided, I want to retrace your path!
Yoimiya: Starting from Mondstadt, to Liyue, and then to Inazuma... I will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
Yoimiya: That's what one has to do if they want to get to know someone completely!
Traveler: Isn't that a bit much?
Yoimiya: Sorry, I don't mean to put any pressure on you. I was just, well... how should I put it? Simply, I...
Yoimiya: I want to know more about youuuu!
Traveler: There are people I want to help.
Yoimiya: So that's what motivates you.
Yoimiya: You don't want to see anyone suffer.
Yoimiya: You are like a storybook hero, so awesome.
Yoimiya: Hmm, that means I'm friends with a hero, doesn't it?
Yoimiya: I'll support you with all I've got, so go ahead and write the rest of your story!

Yoimiya: Wow, is that an open-air hot spring I see? Amazing~!
Yoimiya: There's no better feeling than jumping into a hot spring when you're done with work for the day!
Yoimiya: Do you wanna join me? Relaxing in a hot spring, chatting away, ahh, it's one of the greatest feelings!

## Talk

Yoimiya: Yes! This is the kind of atmosphere I live for, I absolutely love it!
Yoimiya: I'm super impressed, it's pretty amazing that you managed to do this place up like a shopping street. Is there a Naganohara Fireworks here, too? I wanna go find it!
Yoimiya: Come on, come with me! After all the effort you've put into this place, we should have some fun here!
