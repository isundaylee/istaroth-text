Arataki Itto: That's it, I wanna take another look. And this time, I, Arataki "The One and Oni," will...
Kuki Shinobu: Boss.
Arataki Itto: Whoa! What's up, sourpuss?
Kuki Shinobu: Time for some Roasted Lavender Melon.
Arataki Itto: Huh? We're trapped in a life and death situation underground, and you're telling me it's time for Roasted Lavender Melon?
Ushi: Moo, moo.
Arataki Itto: Interesting, you hear that? Ushi says you're completely right... Wait, hold on, whose side are you on, Beefcake?
Ushi: Moo...
Kuki Shinobu: It's important to stay replenished. We must keep our energy and morale up in preparation for facing the unknown.
Kuki Shinobu: Even Ushi knows that.
Arataki Itto: Fine, you two... Hey are you already eating?
Arataki Itto: Hold on, is it still warm? Oh, that does smell good... Mmm...
Arataki Itto: Fine, yeah, we'll have a quick snack and then we'll keep looking for a way out. Hey, don't eat them all, leave a couple for me!

### Additional Talk 1

Yanfei: Who could've ever guessed we'd get trapped in a place like this. It's quite the predicament...
Yanfei: For all the studying I've done in my life, all I know is how to land people in prison... I don't know the first thing about breaking out of one...
Yanfei: I've even made a contract with my father to "live a happy life"... I can't give up hope now.
Yanfei: Try and stay positive... At least I've explored a new place and seen more of the world while reuniting with some old friends.
Yanfei: Uh-huh... Yeah, there's still a silver lining. I guess...

### Additional Talk 2

Yelan: Our situation is grim. There doesn't appear to be a way out for now. We should be prepared to stay for a while.
Yelan: Fortunately, we don't seem to lack supplies, and even our motley crew has people who can keep their cool when the stakes are high.
Yelan: Just focus on taking care of yourselves, I'll figure out the rest.
