Chiori: I see a lot of people training in the art of the sword to pursue martial excellence. But that's not my goal.
Chiori: I'm only interested in capturing the aesthetics of the sword, especially the interplay between light and shadow. Combat, for me, is a chance to get a wealth of inspiration in the bag.
Chiori: But don't worry. Even if I lose focus mid-battle, Tamoto will help you out.
