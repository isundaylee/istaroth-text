# For All Children Who Long for Life


## Talk 1

Arama: #Now that we have destroyed Marana's Avatar, peace should be restored in the forest. Well, I said "we," but it was mostly due to your efforts and courage. Thank you, Nara Traveler.
Traveler: It was really thanks to the garland and everyone's support...
Traveler: They gave me the courage to keep going.
Arama: Each flower is connected with the heart of an Aranara. One could even say that a garland of these flowers woven together can form the door to "Mahavana{RUBY#[S]the Aranara universe}ranapna."
Arama: As long as it connects us, we can support you when you are in need, lend you strength to conquer nightmares, help you through dark days, and fill the void in your heart.
Arama: There are those who no longer dream and thus can no longer see us, those who have accepted fate and stopped searching for the way forward, and those who wallow in fear and pain. Their hearts have hardened, unable to get help from these flowers.
Arama: #It's because Nara Traveler is kind and honest, and because Nara Traveler is Nara Traveler, that the garland could serve its purpose.
Arama: #Nara Traveler is Aranara's friend. We won't leave our friend alone to fight Marana and eliminate all evil for a brighter and purer world.
Paimon: #Well, Traveler is Paimon's best friend, so of course {F#she's}{M#he's} the best person ever! Anyway, Paimon guesses this Withering business has been settled once and for all then, right?
Arama: Marana should fall into slumber now that its avatar has been destroyed. But in a matter of decades, perhaps centuries, it will wake up again.
Arama: It's because Marana's memory has been left in Sarva. Unless that can be completely removed, the memory of "death" that dwells in all things will eventually bring it back again.
Arama: #...But this will take a long time. I believe that by then there will once again come someone as golden as the sun, just like Nara Traveler and Nara Varuna, so I wouldn't worry about it.
Arama: Today's forest has a bright future ahead. As long as what remains of Marana is cleared, the children of the forest will be able to enjoy abundant sunshine and rain.
Paimon: Well... Anyway, now that Marana's Avatar is destroyed, the next step is to plant a new Ashvattha Tree for the Bija, right?
Arama: Yes. Please wait here for a moment while I fetch Arana.
Paimon: Arana... Right, we've gotta use Arana's memories to produce the Bija...
Paimon: But isn't Arana around Vimara Village? How are we gonna...
Paimon: And there Arama goes...
Paimon: Whoa!
Arana: #Nara Traveler and Paimon, Arana sensed your battle against Marana's Avatar. You and Arama are very brave.
Traveler: How did you come all the way here in just a second...
Arama: I've received Aramuhukunda's memories. Through them, I learned how to use Sarva to travel through the forest in a flash. This particular Ararakalari is called "teleportation."
Arana: Arama is amazing. Aramuhukunda must be so glad that you were the one receiving his memory. Arana hasn't teleported in a long, long time either.
Paimon: Next, we need to plant a new Ashvattha Tree, right? Paimon remembers that Arama talked about some seed thingy...
Arana: Seeds know that they have to grow into big trees and bear lots of big fruits... Thank you, Arama.
Arama: No problem. I will grow into a new Ashvattha Tree, bear the Bija using your memories and dreams, and use my roots to reconnect the corroded bridges between dreams.
Paimon: Wait. What are you guys talking about?
Traveler: Arama is the "seed."
Arama: Having absorbed the memories and energies of Aramuhukunda, the Ashvattha Tree, and the Vasoma Fruits, I have now become the strongest "seed" in the forest.
Paimon: Eh? Paimon doesn't understand...
Arama: I was planning to build up my memories with my own eyes and body for several decades or centuries, and then embrace the land again to grow into a beautiful Vasara Tree.
Arama: If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the honor to heal the forest by destroying Marana's Avatar, or become the king of the Vasara Trees by collecting all these precious memories.
Paimon: Ah, so... the Vasara Trees in Ashvattha's Concourses were all once Aranara?
Arama: Yes, they were once Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha. The Vasoma Fruits are their memories.
Paimon: But if you turn into a tree, Arama, you would lose the ability to run, talk, and sing...
Arama: Though I did not spend many days as a seed, the days I spent with you are ten times, no, hundreds of times more precious than the days I spent before.
Paimon: That's not fair... Paimon still has plans to hang out with you...
Arama: #I see... I understand, Paimon. Nara Traveler and you are my friends. This will never change...
Arama: With all these memories and energies I've received, I'm now able to see many scenes and stories in Sarva. Let me tell you one.
Paimon: Okay...
Arama: Hidden in the golden sandstorm, the eternal oasis was devoid of life. The oldest ruler of all plants, whom no Aranara had had the pleasure of meeting, lay dormant in the sand.
Arama: The vegetation that once covered it had all died and been reduced to grains of sand. Just as Marana whispered: All good things must vanish.
Arama: But you should know that as dark as night is, the stars still shine and the sun will still rise. Death longs to dominate all, but life will not fade.
Arama: Just like the yellow leaves that fall down shall nourish Cuihua Trees, their fruits shall sustain Sumpter Beasts, foxes, and forest boars, while they shall feed Rishboland Tigers in turn. And so, the forest always teems with life.
Arama: Once, the land was polluted with toxic blood. Like Nara, Aranara too thought that was the end of the world, but now even the memory of it is gone. The forest is even more luxuriant than it was in the time of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Arama: In the end, all that remains is beautiful. Those who part will come to meet again in Sarva.
Arama: One day, our dreams and memories will intertwine and blossom on the numberless branches in Sarva. Wouldn't that be great?
Paimon: Paimon understands, but...
Traveler: Paimon.
Paimon: Okay... Alright. Paimon understands! You're the best seed, Arama! You'll definitely grow into a great and beautiful tree!
Paimon: #And... and even when you've turned into a tree, please don't forget Paimon and Traveler, and the adventures we had together!
Traveler: Thank you, Arama.
Arama: #Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon. It's been a great pleasure to meet you.
Arama: Arana, I promise I will turn your memories into the most beautiful and robust Bija.
Arana: I believe you, Arama.
Traveler: Goodbye, Arama.
Traveler: I guess this is it.
Traveler: Wait. What are you guys talking about?
Arama: I'm the seed for the new Ashvattha Tree. Having absorbed the memories and energies of Aramuhukunda, the Ashvattha Tree, and the Vasoma Fruits, I have now become the strongest "seed" in the forest.
Traveler: So, next up...
Traveler: They gave me the strength to stand up.
Traveler: You are welcome.
Paimon: #That was a close call... Thankfully, Traveler was wearing that garland! It's even more amazing than Paimon thought!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Arama...
Arana: Arama has grown into the new Ashvattha Tree. It's small now, but the roots are deep and strong. After many, many moons, it will surely grow to be big and beautiful.
Paimon: Arana, you once said that memories and dreams are Aranara's source of strength. If you give those memories up, you'll forget Rana, won't you? And the children of Vimara Village too...
Arana: Yes. But friends are more precious than memories. You can always make up for lost memories, but not a lost friend.
Arana: I want to help Narana. She has the same name as Arana. She is Arana's friend.
Arana: And even if Arana doesn't remember, you will. As long as you remember, your memory will one day grow into a ripe and robust fruit...
Paimon: Paimon understands...
Traveler: What should we do?
Arana: #Arana has taught you the Rhythm of the Great Dream. Do you still remember it, Nara Traveler?
Arana: Just play this song to Arana and Arama.

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: You claim the Bija.
Paimon: We finally got it. The precious Bija...
Traveler: We've certainly come a long way.
Paimon: Yeah. Now all we need to do is to give it to Rana, right?
Arana: ...Who are you?
Traveler: Let's bring it to Rana.

Paimon: #Well, Traveler is Paimon's best friend, so of course {F#she's}{M#he's} the best person ever! Anyway, Tighnari also said there'll be no new Withering Zones! Paimon guesses this Withering business has finally been settled once and for all then, right?
Arama: Yes. May we never meet again, Marana. Many tiny Marana remain in the forest, but we've defeated the greatest one.
Arama: I can sense that all memories about Marana in Sarva have been completely erased. In this case, even the memory and fear of "death" that dwells in all things cannot bring it back ever again.
Arama: #There are still many things in the world that covet life. But I believe that there will always be someone as golden as the sun, just like Nara Traveler and Nara Varuna, so I wouldn't worry about it.
Arama: Today's forest has a bright future ahead. As long as what remains of Marana is cleared, the children of the forest will be able to enjoy abundant sunshine and rain.

## Talk 5

Arana: #Nara Traveler, please make it quick. The Ararakalari that Arana left with Narana won't last long.
Traveler: Are you ready?
Arana: Yes. I'll be fine.

## Talk 6

Paimon: What's this...
Arama: This is where the last war ended. We... They crushed Marana's Avatar and imprisoned it here with the four seals.
Paimon: Looks scary... So is Marana's Avatar in there?
Arama: Marana has corroded the Vasara Tree that was meant to grow atop it and has gained possession of its bodily form. If left unchecked, it'll eventually eat away at all life on this earth.
Arama: Since it's not at its full strength yet, now would be the best time to destroy its avatar. With it defeated, we should be able to obtain the Bija.
Arama: #Come, Nara Traveler and Paimon, let's get going.
Paimon: You're speaking normally again, Arama...
