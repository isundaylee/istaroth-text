Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

Ma'asudi: Sorry, I've been busy recently, worrying all day about the funding for my research. I haven't been paying much attention to what's happening around me...

Ma'asudi: It's time to hire new mercenaries for the next study... Another bill to pay.

Traveler: Are you caught short financially?
Ma'asudi: Sort of. Instead of saying I don't have enough money, it's more accurate to say that the allocated funds are always delayed.
Ma'asudi: Because I travel to the desert frequently to investigate the ruins mechanisms, I've already taken up residence in Caravan Ribat just to save on the travel costs.
Ma'asudi: Even so, I still have to pay out of pocket.
Ma'asudi: ...Is the Akademiya doing this to warn us against going deep into the desert?
Ma'asudi: *sigh* Maybe I'm just overthinking and the Akademiya is just too poor. If I'd known this would happen, I would have taken a job for the fortifications instead.

Traveler: See you.
Ma'asudi: See you. I hope the funds will be delivered without a hitch.
