Traveler: We meet again.
Pacal: Hello there, my friend. How have you been doing lately? Has everything been going well?
Pacal: Any friend of Kachina's is a friend of our tribe. You will always be welcome here.
Pacal: Of course, you're always welcome to visit the other tribes, too. It's always fun to go for a swim at the People of the Springs, or go for a hot air balloon ride with the Flower-Feather Clan.
