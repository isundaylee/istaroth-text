Maziar: This sure is a busy tavern. If there was a games room in here specifically for games of cards, I reckon business could be better still.
Maziar: Oh, my! Sorry about that. I was thinking about how I might combine TCG with my work. Would you like to have a match?

Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Maziar: Oh, by all means, go settle your own business. We can play again when you've got the time.

Maziar: I see, I see! I think I've learned much from watching you play... Thanks a lot!
