Sharp: Who are you?
Sharp: Sharp.
Sharp: Master Goth's PSD.
Sharp: If you know the first thing about me, you'll keep away from my VIP.
Sharp: "PSD"?
Sharp: Tsk. Of course. You wouldn't know.
Sharp: PSD, personal security detachment. Bodyguard. We take the hit, so our clients don't have to.
Sharp: Personally, I much prefer "merc for hire." But now that I work for them, they've insisted on PSD.
Sharp: "VIP"?
Sharp: That one, over there. Marvin.
Sharp: My client. VIP, very important person. Very important to me, anyway, because he pays my wages.
Sharp: Master Goth's young... esquire.
Sharp: Tsk. They insist that I refer to him as "esquire." Well, what can I do? They pay my wages.
