# What is the Meaning of Work?


## Talk 1

Paimon: Go on, bad seagull, shoo! Stop bothering people while they're eating!

## Talk 2

Iaune: Thank you. I'll finish up my fries while they're gone.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

## Talk 3

Iaune: There's... really no end to these gulls and their appetites, is there?
Iaune: Thanks for distracting them. I've finished my fries — I'll get back to work shortly.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

### Additional Talk 1

Iaune: Y—You really don't do things by halves, do you? All the gulls in the area have been scared off...
Iaune: Thank you. I'll finish up my fries while they're not around to disturb me.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Have you tried getting a dog?
Iaune: You mean... I should get a dog to chase them off?
Iaune: That's not a bad plan. I might be able to get someone to lend me one...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Um, try eating somewhere else?
Iaune: I can't find anywhere better to eat now, anyway. If I'm too close to the Palais Mermonia, I might bump into one of my colleagues.
Iaune: And then I'll get dragged into their discussions of work again...
Iaune: But if I go too far away, I won't be able to get back to the office on time, and I might miss something important.
Iaune: Considering these two factors, this place is my only option.

### Additional Talk 4

Iaune: Ah, Violetgold Angler Gulls. Once you're done with these fries, please leave...
Traveler: How's the situation right now?
Iaune: No, not at all. When the gulls came for my fries, it turned tail and hid behind me, trembling.
Iaune: *sigh* Not that I blame the dog. Its breed have only ever had one duty — to love others and be loved by them. It has never learned to attack anything in its life.
Traveler: We have this duty too, you know.
Iaune: Perhaps. But in some circumstances, love, too, may be considered a "right." And where those things are concerned, things tend to proceed in difficult directions...
Iaune: Sorry, I've said too much. I've had to handle many disputes of an emotional bent today, and I fear I haven't quite sorted myself out yet.
Iaune: *sigh* But right now, my most pressing task is to figure out how to safely finish my fries...
Traveler: Did getting a dog work out for you?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: We will chase them all away.
Iaune: Sure, but could you focus on... only chasing them away? They just want my fries, but there's no malice in them.
Iaune: Well, it is a bad thing for me, but it's not a very serious matter, so... Please, just chase them away, would you?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: We'll find something else to feed them.
Iaune: Hmm? That's not a bad idea. But can you really feed that many of them?
Iaune: Well... Even if you can't, you just need to buy me enough time to eat my fries. Alright then, I leave this to you.

### Additional Talk 7

Iaune: The document that Roialte wants is... No, wait, I think I have this data wrong...
