Clanche: And so, his friends, the flying squirrels, came to him and asked, "Why do you never come out anymore? Have you fallen ill?"
Clanche: The north wind said sadly, "I've ruined everything! I've brought nothing but sadness and sorrow, and the ruination of such good things..."
Clanche: "No you haven't!" His friends cried out in surprise. "You've helped us soar into the skies. You've carried rainwater to distant places, and delivered petals and seeds to their places!"
Clanche: "I know. This is my duty... But I want to avoid the mistakes I make." He shook his head. "There must be a better way to finish my job â€” better than what I'm doing now."
