# Journey of Stars and Flames


## Talk 1

Vichama: That was amazing... Judging by your clothes, you're not from Natlan, are you?
Mallko: I've never seen a soul like you in the Night Kingdom.
Bona: But, the Night Kingdom doesn't accept outlanders... right?
"Cocouik": Croo...
Traveler: You're...
Guthred: Yes... Although, rather than a soul, it would be more accurate to say that I'm a "story" created by the people of Natlan.
Guthred: I was his most trusted second-in-command. Five hundred years ago, we fought against the Abyss together, and I sacrificed myself during battle.
Guthred: The shamans of the Masters of the Night-Wind recorded my story on a woven scroll. Even now, many in Natlan know my name.
Vichama: So, you're him, but also not him?
Guthred: That's right. What you see is the "me" from the story. I was remembered as a glorious hero, even though the truth is quite the opposite.
Guthred: It was in fragmented memories of my life that I finally began to understand the real "me."
Guthred: Unlike my righteous and noble commander, I was obsessive and cruel, an approach I believed to be more efficient. Our differences caused many an argument between us.
Traveler: No wonder you were ready to...
Mallko: Y—You tried to... sacrifice someone?
Guthred: ..."I" will stop at nothing to protect my commander's interests.
Guthred: The most idealistic and righteous among us are the most fragile, so I must protect his edge. A strong hand is required to stand against a strong foe.
Guthred: That is what "the glory of Khaenri'ah" means to me.
Traveler: So, you still believe in him?
Guthred: I do.
Guthred: I have my reasons, as do all who believe in something. You will understand that soon enough.
Guthred: Due to the limitations of the Ley Lines, we can go no further. The enemy's lair is close at hand.
Vichama: But don't worry — all the souls of the Night Kingdom will lend you their aid.
Mallko: You will become the hero of a new era.
Bona: You're a special one, Traveler! You've proved that again just now!
"Cocouik" (Och-Kan): (The light will continue to guide your way through the endless darkness.)
Guthred: Go now. For Natlan — and for all who lost their lives to the Abyss.
Guthred: This time, we shall prevail, not for any single nation or faction, but for us all.
Traveler: Even though he's a stranger to you now.
Traveler: ...sacrifice Ororon.
Traveler: Guthred.

## Talk 2

Wayna: On behalf of the Scions of the Canopy, I offer you our blessing.
Kinich: The name of "Turnfire" teaches us that everything comes at a price. We've offered generations of blood and tears to this war, and now, it's time to collect.
Kinich: We're all counting on you to take revenge, including the Mountain King.
Mountain King (Kongamato): During the Turnfire Night, I once said... "May the will of Kongamato... march ever on, until the Abyss is stamped out."
Mountain King (Kongamato): Recently, I saw him again in my dreams... my most trusted partner, Burkina.
Mountain King (Kongamato): He believed this would be the battle to end all battles and implored me to lend my support to the hero of this era.
Mountain King (Kongamato): As expected, traveler from afar, that hero is you.
Mountain King (Kongamato): From the first time we met, I sensed something special. You remind me of someone... the one who moved Burkina to their side...
Mountain King (Kongamato): I firmly believe you will defeat the forces of darkness. That miracle belongs to this era.
Kinich: We will answer to the fire for all our deeds, and so shall the Abyss answer for its crimes.
Kinich: Oh, and Ajaw has something to say.
Ajaw: Although you are but lowly servants, you have brought us much amusement.
Ajaw: We desire that entertainment to continue. If this is where you meet your end, it would be a great disappointment.
Ajaw: We would get over it, of course. But, if you do die, just go without regrets.
Kinich: That's the nicest send-off you're going to get out of Ajaw.

## Talk 3

Mavuika: #Traveler, Paimon, you're here.
Traveler: Mavuika...
Mavuika: Judging by the confident look on your face, I assume your ancient name is complete?
Paimon: Yep, it's good to go! Xilonen specifically reminded us to show it to you!
Mavuika: "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini"... Yes, that fits you perfectly.
Atoco: Is that... an ancient name?
Rayen: I heard this is the first time we've forged an ancient name for an outlander. Seems like it was a success... What's engraved on it?
Mavuika: #Looks like my people are just as curious about this name. Traveler, Paimon, join me over here.
Mavuika: #As you can see, I am holding Traveler's ancient name.
Mavuika: #With this name, the Wayob entrust to him a monumental task, and this land binds us as kin.
Mavuika: #"Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini"... That is his name. Like starlight amid the darkness, flames amid the cold — it means "hope."
Sakowew: "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini"...!
Tantoo: Hope... After all these endless years of fighting, we've finally found it, haven't we...
Mavuika: Ever since the invasion of the Abyss and the decline of the Ley Lines, the Ode of Resurrection has protected us for thousands of years.
Mavuika: For generations we have lived on this land, following in the footsteps of our forebears, taking their place on the frontlines.
Mavuika: We all carry that struggle with us. And now, thanks to your efforts, the end is in sight — we have a chance to defeat the Abyss once and for all.
Mavuika: This glory is one we share — it belongs to all of Natlan.
Otaska: For Natlan!
Everyone Together: For Natlan!
Mavuika: Our suffering will not soon be forgotten, but there will come a day when we can proudly declare to our progeny that this war is won!
Mavuika: For our fallen heroes, our lifelong comrades, and all who forged the path ahead through trial and tribulation. For our homeland...
Mavuika: We will claim victory! In Natlan, no one fights alone!
Everyone Together: No one fights alone!
Mavuika: To battle!
Traveler: Sorry to keep you waiting.

## Talk 4

Xilonen: I have no doubt that victory will be ours.

## Talk 5

Kinich: Everything has a price, and the Abyss must pay for what it has done.

## Talk 6

Mualani: That's what being friends is all about — quality time and good vibes!

## Talk 7

Xilonen: Go now and forge a new future for Natlan.

## Talk 8

Kinich: Everything has a price, and the Abyss must pay for what it has done.

## Talk 9

Mualani: Don't forget about our hot spring trip!

## Talk 10

Chasca: It's taken a lot to get to this point. I know it will not be in vain.

## Talk 11

Biram: A revelation came to me in a dream, and I shared it with my tribe — you are the star that will shine through the mist.
Biram: The spirits bless your journey.
Ororon: From this day forward, plants will sprout because of you, insects will take flight after you, and all will turn to your will.
Traveler: That seems like overkill...
Ororon: I disagree. The land of Natlan nurtures life, but the Abyss knows only destruction.
Citlali: Natlan is also a land of memories and legends.
Citlali: I live longer than humans, and in all that time, I've learned what life and death mean to people.
Citlali: The dead draw solace from the living, and the living push forward in honor of the dead.
Citlali: In life and death, we all leave marks on this world. We cannot let them be reduced to nothing.
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Citlali: Yes... Thank you for joining this fight.
Citlali: I'll wait for your safe return.
Traveler: That's why I am here.

## Talk 12

Ororon: We're all awaiting your safe return.
Citlali: Thank you for joining this fight.

## Talk 13

Iansan: Varesa and I will show you our tribe's customs and fun activities. Don't miss out!

## Talk 14

Mavuika: We're here. I'm sure you're familiar with the sight of the Night Kingdom by now.
Mavuika: The corrosion here is relatively mild, so this is our last pit stop.
Mavuika: Once we set off, we must destroy our final enemy as soon as possible. Otherwise, no amount of resistance to Abyssal corrosion will save us from contamination.
Paimon: So, there's no turning back after this, huh...
Traveler: Paimon? What are you doing here?
Paimon: After you left, Paimon started to be able to see this place. It's a mystery to Paimon, too...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roar!
Mavuika: The Sacred Flame is connecting us. The moment it sent us here, it made sure your consciousness could reach us.
Mavuika: Still, you can go no further. The Abyss also has the power to corrupt the mind, so once we venture deeper, it must be alone.
Mavuika: But, while we're still here, I believe some of your friends may wish to say a few words.
Traveler: We don't have much time, right?
Mavuika: True, but there's time enough to say goodbye.
Mavuika: Come find me when you're ready to set off. I'll explain the next step of the plan.
Traveler: You look... different.

## Talk 15

Pacal: You're about to set off, right?
Pacal: Your bravery is like an echo through the valley, calling on us to respond in kind. The Children of Echoes offer you our blessing.
Kachina: Everyone is waiting for you back at the Stadium! We'll be cheering the whole time!
Xilonen: The Abyss is powerful, but there's no reason to fear. We've defeated it before, and you can do it again.
Xilonen: Go now and forge a new future for Natlan.

## Talk 16

Mavuika: #Are you ready, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Mavuika: Alright. Before we face our final enemy together, we need to split up.
Mavuika: I'm sure you remember the "Abyss Tumors" from the previous battle. Eradicating them was critical to stopping the endless onslaught of monsters.
Mavuika: Our final enemy has a core that possesses similar qualities. It's hidden somewhere in the Night Kingdom.
Mavuika: Since I'm more familiar with this place, I will go find and destroy this core while you go straight to the enemy's lair. We can reconvene there.
Traveler: Understood.
Mavuika: Alright, then it's time to act.
Mavuika: All of Natlan is behind us. So let's gather our courage and march into the unknown without fear.
Mavuika: No one fights alone.
Paimon: Mavuika already left, so you should get moving. Oh, um, and Paimon should stop distracting you...
Paimon: Paimon still remembers her promise! She's gonna cheer you on with all her might!
Paimon: Paimon's not some kid who's afraid of the dark. She's gonna be brave this time, so don't you worry!
Traveler: Wait for me, Paimon.
Paimon: Always!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roar!
Paimon: You're not in this alone — we'll be with you in spirit the whole time!
Traveler: I need a little longer.
Mavuika: That's fine. It's best to move forward without regrets.

## Talk 17

Atea: I didn't expect to see you again so soon.
Nechca: Phew, I didn't know I could do that!
Nechca: #Hello, Mr. Traveler.
Traveler: Wait, you're...?
Nechca: You remember Tlazolli, right? She's my mom, and well... She did a lot of bad things.
Nechca: I saw her in a dream, and she spent the whole time apologizing to me. But, I didn't know what to say...
Nechca: Nepecha, all those people who lost their memories... They're the ones who deserve apologies, not me.
Atea: Nechca told me all about what happened, and this was my advice...
Atea: Even though we can't undo our mistakes, there will always be opportunities to make up for them.
Nechca: I had a good talk with my mom in that dream, and she agreed to lend me her power. That's how I was able to help you back there.
Nechca: My mom made a lot of terrible mistakes in the past. But, now... she's using her powers for good.
Traveler: It was a huge help.
Atea: You're a very talented person, Nechca. I'm sorry your life was cut so short.
Nechca: It's okay. We still managed to do something important in this place!
Nechca: #Good luck, Traveler! We're all counting on you!
Atea: You can leave this place to us. When the monsters attack again, we'll fend them off.
Traveler: Mualani's in the square over there.
Atea: We got to see each other in a dream, and that's enough.
Atea: The square makes it possible to connect the living to the Night Kingdom. If the Abyss starts to corrode that area, its forces could once again surge into the land above.
Atea: It pains me, not being able to see Mualani again. But, if I can do something to protect Natlan, then that is the only choice.
Atea: Mualani will grow to surpass me as a warrior and accomplish greater feats than my own — I have no doubt.
Traveler: I'm sure she'd like to see you again.

## Talk 19

Hine: Hey, Sis! It's been a long time... This form is probably what I look like in your memories, right?
Hine: Actually, we already met in one of your dreams, didn't we? But... You never told anyone.
Mavuika: ...
Mavuika: Out of all the awakened souls, I was surprised "you" were one of them. After all, it's been five hundred years.
Hine: Hehe, yeah. I'm sure my soul has been reborn many times by now. But, that doesn't mean "Hine" is gone.
Hine: If the past, present, and future exist at once, then it's only fair we get to meet again.
Mavuika: You're right.
Mavuika: It's too bad we don't have more time to talk.
Hine: Your plan is almost at the final stage, isn't it?
Hine: I knew it. When you set your mind to something, there's nothing you can't do, no matter how difficult.
Hine: I really wanted to help you in this era, but an ordinary person can't transcend time.
Hine: Back then, I said I'd come find you one day. But, I failed time and time again.
Mavuika: You didn't fail.
Hine: Wait, then, the paper frog I made... You got it?
Mavuika: Yes, and your architecture manual, as well. The family you left it with got it to me in one piece.
Hine: Haha, I'm so glad! Five hundred years is a long time... I was worried someone might toss it during a move or something.
Mavuika: No, they never forgot their debt to you. I learned a lot about you from them.
Hine: Sounds like I placed my trust in the right people.
Hine: Everything I wrote, though... It's probably outdated now, isn't it?
Mavuika: Yeah, I'd say so.
Hine: Oh, well! It's been a long time, and it's not like I was some innovative architect who left my mark on history.
Hine: But, I lived a really happy life. I dedicated my career to helping those without a home...
Hine: I didn't have time for love, or for myself, but I didn't care. There are so many things in this world that deserve to come first — that's what you taught me.
Hine: You never took time for yourself either, did you, Sis?
Mavuika: No, it wasn't necessary. Besides, I made my choice... And now, the end is near — be it the enemy's end, or my own.
Mavuika: In the end, the method you used to transcend time was much more than a simple paper frog.
Mavuika: You sent your love across time. So, let me say this, Hine — I will love you forever and always.
Hine: Hehe, I know that! Mom, Dad, and I... We feel the same way about you. We're family — that will never change!
Mavuika: Alright, I need to head out. Another hero is waiting for me.
Hine: I believe in you, Sis!
Hine: For Natlan!

Traveler: I'm sure she'd like to see you again.

## Talk 21

Bona: Wow, you're as strong as ever.
"Cocouik": Cheep!
Vichama: Oh, who are these two?
Traveler: An amazing adventurer and her companion.
Bona: Hehe, you said it, not me. Everyone here is amazing, so of course that includes me and Coco.
Bona: We all have our own journey, and we need to see it through to the end. Not all adventurers go down in history...
Bona: But, right now, it's safe to say we're doing something extremely important.
"Cocouik": Cheep!
Mallko: Definitely!
Bona: Then, let's go. We're all with you!
Bona: #I know your guide fairy and {REALNAME[ID(2)|HOSTONLY(true)]} couldn't join you here, but I'm sure they're still with you in spirit!
Traveler: My good friends.

## Talk 23

Vichama: It's you! I knew you would come.
Mallko: We meet again... Remember me? I'm Mallko. We met when you came to rescue Kachina. I could barely hold onto my human form back then.
Mallko: Vichama told me about the horrific battle on the surface. But now, the souls of the Night Kingdom have been revitalized.
Vichama: More importantly, after everything, we finally get to fight side by side again.
Vichama: It's all thanks to you and Citlali.
Traveler: Running into you here...
Mallko: The path ahead has been heavily corroded by the Abyss. Navigation will be tricky. I can help illuminate your way, just like before.
Vichama: I'll take care of recon and combat. I was in a bad place when you met me, but I was a capable warrior back in the day.
Vichama: C'mon, follow me.
Traveler: Thanks. I appreciate it.
Mallko & Vichama: Of course!
Traveler: Is a surprise for me, too.

## Talk 24

Atea: We'll guard this place so that the Abyssal power doesn't spread.

## Talk 25

Amina: In this place where streams and waves converge, the People of the Springs gather to honor your bravery.
Mualani: I love the hot springs! I can't get enough of them.
Mualani: I wanna go today, and tomorrow, and the day after that.
Mualani: Just thinking about spending time there with you and all our friends makes me so happy!
Mualani: So, after the battle, let's go there together! Paimon included! Sound good?
Traveler: Sounds good!
Mualani: YES! I'm so excited!

## Talk 26

Amina: In this place where streams and waves converge, the People of the Springs gather to honor your bravery.
Mualani: Uncle Nuu's here to see you off, too!
Nuu: You, young hero, are about to make history. Heh, my deeds are nothing compared to that.
Nuu: When our ancestors first set out on their adventure, they could never have known they were about to found a tribe that would last thousands of years into the future.
Nuu: When future generations look back on our accomplishment, they, too, will see our deeds for their greater significance.
Mualani: #Hey, why don't we record Traveler's story on a stone tablet, just like the one on the mysterious island!
Traveler: No objections here.
Mualani: Haha, great! I better get on it, or someone might beat me to it!
Mualani: Everyone in my tribe wants you to become one of Natlan's greatest heroes. Me too, obviously...
Mualani: But, as your friend, there's something I want even more, and it's way simpler...
Mualani: Once this is all over, I wanna go to the hotsprings together. Paimon included!
Mualani: That's what being friends is all about — quality time and good vibes!
Traveler: It's a promise!
Mualani: I'll hold you to it!
Traveler: Make sure you put it somewhere people can see it.
Mualani: Of course! Front and center — just like the first chief!

## Talk 27

Chasca: Thank you for everything. I will always be ready to return the favor.

Menilek: I embrace...
Sundjatta: I trust...
Sanhaj: I acknowledge...

Tupac: I walk with...
All Together: Tenoch, the one and many.
Wanjiru: I welcome...

## Talk 30

Traveler: (I didn't expect the situation here to be so chaotic... Is it because of the damage to the Ley Lines?)
Traveler: (The road has collapsed, but the structure above seems intact... That looks like the way forward.)
Traveler: (Still, how do I get over there?)
Traveler: (Huh? That sound, it's—)
Chuychu: #Hey, Traveler! It's me! Chuychu!
Chuychu: Need some help? Doctors can be really handy in an emergency, hehe.
Chuychu: With your special powers, you should be able to make it through this place.
Chuychu: Go, now. Go!
Chuychu: Huh? What was that? I felt shaking all of a sudden...
Traveler: Could it be...
Chuychu: Ooh, I was wondering where she went.
Chuychu: Well, that just means we've got even less time to waste! I never liked causing trouble, and I definitely don't want to be the one who holds up the Pyro Archon's plan.
Traveler: Chuychu...
Chuychu: ...Yeah.
Chuychu: I'm really glad she fulfilled her mission. She seemed a lot more... mature than before.
Chuychu: All those years of worrying, but... better late than never, right?
Chuychu: Anyway, that was enough for me. I won't show up in her dreams anymore.
Chuychu: Back to the natural order of things — worrying is supposed to be the older sister's job.
Traveler: You're really strong, Chuychu.
Chuychu: Alright, enough about that. All we can do is accept the past and continue to look forward.
Chuychu: I would say our nation's future is looking very bright.
Chuychu: #Go now, Traveler.
Traveler: You went to see Chasca, didn't you?
Traveler: That Mavuika's wrapped up everything on her end?

## Talk 31

Mutota: May the skies forever be clear and bright, and may we always be free to spread our wings and soar. For this wish, the Flower-Feather Clan gathers here today.
Chasca: War is a heavy burden. And still, we never stopped moving forward.
Chasca: Long-awaited peace is now within reach. You have the opportunity to set that future in motion.
Chasca: I'll be rooting for you... Oh, and Coya heard about the battle, so she's here, too.
Coya: Cheep...
Chasca: We both had to make a difficult choice about family. But, after our adventure together, we finally let go of our differences, and she came to understand my attachment to human society.
Chasca: Within the tribe, I found new sources of love and happiness. Coya told me she would do anything to protect that.
Chasca: And I would do the same for her.
Chasca: The same goes for my human family... Chuychu's father and mother.
Chasca: Maybe my relationships seem like a mess to you... But, it's okay. I won't let any one of them fall by the wayside.
Chasca: I will learn from everything we've been through and rise above the trials of fate to become a better version of myself.
Traveler: It's like you're becoming your own "peacemaker."
Chasca: Thank you, but beyond that...
Chasca: I pledge to be someone you can lean on in all your future endeavors.

## Talk 33

Pacal: You're about to set off, right?
Pacal: Your bravery is like an echo through the valley, calling on us to respond in kind. The Children of Echoes offer you our blessing.
Kachina: Everyone is waiting for you back at the Stadium! We'll be cheering the whole time!
Xilonen: The Abyss is powerful, but there's no reason to fear. We've defeated it before, and you can do it again.
Xilonen: Oh, and I brought Nepecha with me. She really wanted to see you.
Nepecha: #Hello, Mr. Traveler ...
Nepecha: Not too long ago, you and Xilonen saved me, and helped me recover my real name.
Nepecha: And now, you're going somewhere super dangerous in the name of everyone in Natlan...
Kachina: #Yeah, {F#s}he's amazing!
Nepecha: Xilonen says a name is like a blessing, so I wanna give you my blessing, too.
Nepecha: But, um, I don't know any fancy words, so... Just be safe, and come visit us soon!
Nepecha: We can celebrate your birthday next time!
Traveler: Sounds good to me!
Kachina: Hehe, then it's a promise!
Xilonen: That's right — a promise to meet again in the future.
Xilonen: Our tribe is always open to you. Whenever you choose to return, we'll welcome you back with a huge feast of barbecue and wine.
Xilonen: I have no doubt that victory will be ours.

## Talk 34

Acatl: At the end of the earth lies the primal flame. We have come from afar to offer you our land's blessing and the respect of the Collective of Plenty.
Iansan: True strength isn't gifted from the heavens. It culminates little by little from everything we do.
Iansan: Natlan's history goes back thousands of years. Every person who calls this land home — past or present — has a hand in this opportunity.
Iansan: Just like the Pyro Archon's concept of time — the past, the present, and the future exist at once. This moment is a convergence of all three.
Iansan: I have full confidence in the outcome of this battle. Victory will belong to Natlan.
Traveler: You have my word.
Iansan: Actually, I also have a more... personal request.
Iansan: Once the war is over, come visit us in the Collective of Plenty, okay?
Acatl: Haha, that's right! Our tribe can't wait to meet you.
Iansan: Varesa and I will show you all our customs and fun activities.
Iansan: I'll leave you in suspense for now. But I promise you won't be disappointed!
Traveler: Your hard work will not be in vain.
