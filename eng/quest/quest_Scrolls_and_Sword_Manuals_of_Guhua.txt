# Scrolls and Sword Manuals of Guhua


## Talk 1

Paimon: Also, the whole treasure thing still turned out to be a hoax in the end! Ugh, Paimon's really mad now! Just you wait, She's going to find something super valuable to take away from this place today!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Oh, there was also a line in that book just now that really bothered Paimon...
Paimon: It said something along the lines of "Observe it with your *eyes*." Could it be trying to say that we should use Elemental Sight?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa, the water level's dropping!
Paimon: #Did we... Did we actually find the Guhua Clan's treasure after all? Traveler, let's go take a look!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: #And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see Traveler's performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around for making you some rice with bacon? And I would be pleased about that? I would slap you to death if I were a few years younger...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!
