Message Board: "Golden Comet and Silver Companion are so ridiculously strong! I wonder if they're Fungi veterans!"
Message Board: "With the two of them here, I would say that this season's champions are already decided!"
Message Board: "I hear that Silver Companion has an obsession with Mora. Maybe we should pool some together and ask Silver Companion if they can take it easy and throw the match!"
Message Board: "That way, ordinary people like us would have a shot at winning the competition!"
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Are you a competitor from their group!? It would be cheating if you tried to use Mora to bribe them!"
Message Board: "They'll let their skills do the talking! You should use the time you spent coming up with stupid ideas like this to train instead!"
Message Board: "I think it's still too early to say that they'll be the final winners. I'm pretty sure they'll have a hard time if they're matched against Fried Tofu With All the Frills."

Message Board: "A foreign guest by the name of Aratani is collecting photos of the Fungi. They say that she has ways to produce Fungi picture cards that are extremely valuable collectibles!"

Message Board: "Anyone who's willing to purchase her cards, please leave a comment below! If you have any cute photos of the Fungi, make sure you send them to us as well!"
Traveler: Leave.
