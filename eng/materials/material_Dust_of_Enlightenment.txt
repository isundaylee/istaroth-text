# Dust of Enlightenment

The power of Artifacts stems from stories. Thus, sacred or profane writings may reshape them.
There is no good or evil inherent in stories. Songs and words may have the power to save as well as destroy, just as believed by the emissary who once conveyed revelations to the holiest of sovereigns, governed the nations on earth and their glory, yet eventually fell from the high heavens. To this day, whether pure or impure, these feathers can still inscribe false revelations and rewrite fated tales, yet the only outcome of defying the world is to scatter into dust.
