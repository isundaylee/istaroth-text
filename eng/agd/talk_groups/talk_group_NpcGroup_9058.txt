Yae Miko: Oh? Well hello, what brings you to see me today?
Yae Miko: If there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. I'm always happy to listen to other people's problems... Who knows, I might even try to help you come up with a solution.

Traveler: Hope you're settling in okay.
Yae Miko: Thank you for your concern, dear. But, believe me, I am quite comfortable wherever I go.
Yae Miko: So, this must be an adepti abode... Hmm, though it's a bit different from what I imagined, it's still most fascinating.
Yae Miko: At first glance, the act of containing this vast space inside a tiny little tea pot seems strikingly similar to the art of constructing a space from the imagination. But as it turns out, they work on fundamentally different principles.
Traveler: So you're researching how it works, huh?
Yae Miko: As Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. Only then am I capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
Yae Miko: Besides, if I can get the hang of this teapot trick, I'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever I go...
Traveler: Aha, so that's the real reason for your "research"!
Yae Miko: Hehe... regardless, please do look after me while I'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yae Miko: Need someone to talk to, hmm? Aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
Yae Miko: Well, as luck would have it, I happen to be in a good mood today. How about I tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
Traveler: Please, that would be great!
Yae Miko: Long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
Yae Miko: In her arms she was carrying a little fox on the brink of death. She knelt before Kitsune Saiguu and begged her to save her friend.
Yae Miko: The child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some Fried Tofu.
Yae Miko: But it wasn't long before misfortune struck. Now that the fox had let down its guard, a vicious dog from the village seized the chance to attack, delivering a near-fatal bite. Heart-broken and riddled with guilt, the child decided to bring the injured fox to the shrine for help.
Yae Miko: Kitsune Saiguu granted her request and agreed to nurse the little fox back to health. Worried that the little girl would be lonely without her companion, Kitsune Saiguu decided to ask another member of her kin to keep the little girl company for a few days. I was the one she asked.
Traveler: What happened after that?
Yae Miko: Well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that I am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
Yae Miko: Not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. She always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
Yae Miko: After two days, the little fox had recovered and I accompanied the girl back to the shrine. Upon our arrival, Kitsune Saiguu asked the girl which fox was her favorite — the one she had made friends with originally, or the new one?
Yae Miko: She hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
Traveler: That would be quite a difficult choice...
Yae Miko: But when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
Yae Miko: "The fox you gave me is very beautiful, Miss Shrine Maiden, but I still love my old friend the most."
Yae Miko: Finally, the child offered some Fried Tofu to thank me for accompanying her, then left with her little fox friend.
Traveler: What an amazing story.
Yae Miko: Hmm? Wait a moment, child. You're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
Yae Miko: Come on, I've told you my story — now it's your turn. Shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
Traveler: Alright, let me tell you my story.
Yae Miko: Hmm, I suppose that will do.
Yae Miko: But could you try to spice it up a bit? Tell it as if it were a best-seller from Yae Publishing House.
Traveler: How about I go buy you some Fried Tofu?
Yae Miko: Now you're talking.
Yae Miko: Alright, I'll wait for you here. Make it quick, though. I can tell you some other stories when you return.
Traveler: Thanks for telling me this story.
Traveler: I'd love to hear it!

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Yae Miko: Hmm... no.
Yae Miko: Hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? Ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face... I think it might be my favorite.
Traveler: So you were just joking...
Yae Miko: No, actually I wasn't.
Yae Miko: Or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what I wanted to do.
Yae Miko: Observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
Yae Miko: In principle, I should remain an outside observer. But you are far too much fun for that. I can't help but tease you from time to time.
Traveler: Oh, so it's my fault that you feel the need to tease me!?
Yae Miko: But of course.
Yae Miko: If you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
Yae Miko: As an observer, I get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
Yae Miko: Your story is one that has captivated me. I really do have high hopes for you... Please do your best to live up to them, child.
Traveler: My story? You mean my life story? Umm...
Yae Miko: Don't you worry. You still have a long journey ahead of you... Your story has only just begun.
Yae Miko: Besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
Yae Miko: Whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, I'll correct you. And if you're ever stuck in a rut, I'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
Yae Miko: That should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
Traveler: I'm not sure I can meet your expectations.

Traveler: Morning, Yae Miko.
Yae Miko: #Good morning, Traveler. My, by the looks of you, you must have had a very pleasant dream last night?
Yae Miko: Bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. You should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.

Traveler: Good night, Yae Miko.
Yae Miko: #Alright, off to bed now, Traveler. Youngsters like you should keep early hours.
Yae Miko: What about me? Oh, I'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels...
Yae Miko: You... weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you...?

Yae Miko: Yes... I have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.

## Talk 7

Yae Miko: Oh? I didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. You wouldn't mind it if I took a soak for a while, would you?
Yae Miko: Soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
Yae Miko: Now, if I only had a bottle of sake, that would make it perfect.
