Traveler: About drawing fortune slips...
Maki: The people who come to the shrine are mostly looking for the archon's blessings.
Maki: They believe that if they get a good fortune slip, they will be blessed by the Electro Archon, and that life will be easy in the upcoming days.
Maki: But if they get a bad slip, they can still leave the slip at the shrine in hopes for a change of fate.
Maki: If you have any wishes, why don't you come get a slip for yourself as well?
