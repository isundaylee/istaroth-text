# The Mysterious Island's Truth


## Talk 1

Paimon: Mualani!
Mualani: Just in time, I was about to go look for you.
Paimon: What the... You already caused the whirlpools to reappear again?
Mualani: We're in luck. The Phlogiston Nodes were recharged by dawn. I had Karya and Viramdra control the nodes this time, and we were able to quickly unlock the mechanism.
Mualani: We were practicing all morning so they could get the hang of controlling them.
Paimon: Oh? It seems that after apologizing, you've already become trusted members of the team.
Viramdra: Is now really the time to be teasing us? Don't forget that the whirlpools won't last all day.
Paimon: He's right, we really should hurry over to the massive whirlpool again!
Mualani: Even though we had this discussion yesterday, I still want to double check... You all trust me, right?
Paimon: You bet!
Mualani: Okay, then let's go!

## Talk 2

Paimon: *coughing* Paimon accidentally swallowed some water... So scary! Huh, what is this place?
Viramdra: I can't believe it! There are subterranean caverns under the water!
Paimon: Mualani was right!
Mualani: Let's see where this cave leads. Come with me.

## Talk 3

Paimon: What a maze... there's lava everywhere! Which way are we supposed to go now...
Mualani: Let's look around together and see what we can find.
Viramdra: Very well. It would indeed be useful to collect some environmental samples here.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Don't worry, Mualani. We'll take care of things here!

## Talk 5

Viramdra: Do you see that golden light in the distance? I'm positive that's the mysterious island! That's where we should go next!
Paimon: Really?
Viramdra: I'm a scholar from the Akademiya's Spantamad Darshan. I specialize in ores and minerals.
Viramdra: When I first heard about the legend of the mysterious island, I took note of its description.
Viramdra: One exaggerated description I heard was that it's "an entire island that shines like gold." What it was actually referring to was an extremely rare mineral known as Vulcanite.
Viramdra: Under certain environmental conditions, large amounts of lava are quickly cooled, which then results in this ore.
Viramdra: Since the ore can't be moved in time, it begins to accumulate, resulting in the alluring golden glow...
Viramdra: If I'm not mistaken, there'll be a large pool of lava up ahead, and the mysterious island will be floating on the lava! An entire island of Vulcanite ore!
Paimon: So you mean... we really found the mysterious island!
Viramdra: Rejoice! Even a small piece of that ore will be priceless!
Paimon: Really? Then let's hurry!
Mualani: Wait, Paimon. We should head back now.
Paimon: Uh... Why?
Viramdra: What are you saying?
Mualani: This map is covered with symbols and riddles, but there's one thing that's written clearly. "When you see the golden light, then go the opposite way."
Mualani: What you just said may be correct, but that golden place isn't the island that my ancestors once visited.
Viramdra: Are you joking? You expect me to turn back now?
Paimon: But Mualani's judgment has always been right... If she says head back, then we should head back. We can't be fooled by the thought of treasure!
Viramdra: You thought I'm after treasure? Hahaha...
Paimon: He's acting weird again...
Viramdra: After my previous findings were stolen, I began a new area of research... And this ore is the core of my research.
Viramdra: As long as I can bring this ore back, my theories will be proven beyond any doubt, and I will be able to reclaim everything I have lost.
Viramdra: To me, this ore is the "result" that must be obtained. Otherwise, all those hardships along the way will be rendered completely meaningless! Don't you understand!?
Mualani: As we agreed before, please trust my judgment.
Viramdra: Why? Are you wary of me? Now that we've confirmed that the legendary treasure really exists, you don't want outsiders to take it, do you?
Karya: She's not that kind of person, Viramdra...
Viramdra: The result is right before my very eyes. I won't give up here!
Paimon: Oh no, he went running in! How could he do that!?
Mualani: Not good, we must stop him!
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or is the ground shaking!?

## Talk 6

Paimon: From here, the light seems to be getting brighter. Speaking of which, where is that light coming from?
Mualani: A distant light... Wait, there seems to be a mark that matches that on the map.
Karya: Miss Guide, it seems Viramdra has also discovered something...
Viramdra: I've got it... I've got it!

## Talk 7

Paimon: They're back!
Mualani: I've brought him back. He's fortunate that he wasn't seriously hurt.
Karya: Thank goodness... Thank you so much, Miss Guide!
Mualani: You're welcome. It's getting dangerous here, so we need to find a way out!
Viramdra: No, I refuse! I can still stand, let me go back...
Paimon: Seriously! How can you be so childish at a time like this!?
Karya: Viramdra!
Mualani: Whoa...
Karya: I've always believed that you're the most talented person I've ever met. Even if your research was stolen and you didn't get any credit, I never doubted it!
Karya: I believe that even if you won't obtain any results this time, you'll still succeed in your new research, because no one can take your talent away!
Karya: So... I won't allow my dearest senior to die here because of his own stubbornness!
Viramdra: Karya...
Mualani: She's finally opening up, and it seems like she's just the person we need to talk some sense into him.
Paimon: Mualani, the lava is almost here!
Mualani: Don't panic! It seems like the trick that Uncle Nuu taught me is finally going to be put to use.
Mualani: *whistle*
Paimon: Where did all these Koholasaurs come from!?
Mualani: No time to explain, just get on!
Paimon: Got it, got it!

## Talk 8

Mualani: This is the place. From what I've heard, if we take a group photo here, it'll bring us good luck. I'm sure of it!
Paimon: What made you think of taking a group photo?
Mualani: Well, we completed our trip to the mysterious island together, so of course we need a memento to keep.
Paimon: *sigh* You've earned the greatest honor for a guide, yet you can only walk away with a photo of your friends. You're pretty amazing, Mualani. You really sacrificed a lot for your tribe!
Mualani: Would you call it a sacrifice? I don't really think so. Actually, after hearing Uncle Nuu's answer, I have this vague feeling that...
Mualani: After all that we've been through together, the results don't matter anymore... Ah, it's kinda hard to explain, I don't know if you get me or not...
Traveler: No, I get it.
Traveler: (You recall everything that has happened during your journey, and finally find an answer that you're satisfied with.)
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}...
Mualani: So that's your answer, huh? To the meaning of a journey?
Traveler: It's the answer I knew from the very beginning.
Mualani: It's a good one... Then let's make this group photo yet another part of your journey!
Paimon: Yep! Paimon's ready!
Mualani: Three... two... one... Koholasaur!
Traveler: It's the answer that I've gradually come to understand over time.

## Talk 9

Karya: How can I get Viramdra to stop running off?

## Talk 10

Paimon: The lava is rising...
Karya: Viramdra...
Mualani: #...{NICKNAME}, Paimon, please take care of Karya. I'll be right back!
Paimon: What are you doing, Mualani?
Mualani: I can use my surfboard on the lava for a short period of time... But it will be a lot spicier than surfing on water...
Paimon: But that's way too risky!
Traveler: Don't worry, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Okay, then we'll take care of things here!
Traveler: I know she can do it!

## Talk 11

Viramdra: It's right there... I'm almost there!
Mualani: Look carefully! You can't get through the lava. You'll die if you try to make your way forward. Why don't you just give up?
Viramdra: Why don't I give up? Well, I might not be able to do it, but what about you?
Mualani: Me...?
Viramdra: You have the ability to move over the lava. If you try, maybe you can reach the island, and earn the highest honor for a guide!
Viramdra: That way, you'll have the results you need to prove yourself, and even Koolau won't be able to question your abilities anymore.
Viramdra: You want to know why I don't give up, but I'm asking why you'd give up such an opportunity!
Mualani: The lava is rising! If I take this risk, then how will the others get back? Did you forget? I already gave you my answer.
Viramdra: You...
Mualani: Come with me!
Viramdra: No...!
Black Screen Text: Mualani uses her surprising strength to toss the reluctant Viramdra onto her surfboard.

## Talk 12

Paimon: *coughing* Ah, Paimon accidentally choked on some water again while riding the Koholasaur...
Mualani: Everyone okay? Let's take a headcount... One, two, three, four, five... Whew, we're all here.
Mualani: We escaped danger and made it back alive. That's what I call good luck. I think our fortune can only get better from now on!
Paimon: Oh... Really?
Viramdra: What's the point? We still didn't reach the mysterious island...
Paimon: Hey, don't look so depressed! You'll scare our good luck away!
Mualani: Actually, according to the map, we still have one more leg of the journey...
Paimon: Oh? Then which way should we go? Wait... Aren't we back where we started?
Mualani: Come on, let's go to the statue.
Black Screen Text: Everyone arrives at the statue.
Paimon: So what's the point of coming back here again?
Mualani: There seems to be some hidden words on the statue that appeared after I touched it.
Paimon: Really!? Let Paimon try!
Black Screen Text: ##2D Package Video begins
Black Screen Text: ##2D Package Video ends
Paimon: The hidden inscriptions disappeared...
Mualani: These must have been the words the first chief left for those that would come after him.
Paimon: In that case, the mysterious island from the legend is actually where the People of the Springs are living now!
Mualani: I remember now that the elders once told me our tribe was originally founded on a small island. Later, the coastlines changed, allowing the island to become what it is today.
Mualani: The journey to the mysterious island starts exactly where it ends...
Traveler: And just like him...
Mualani: Yeah, I think I understand the choice he made now.
Viramdra: The golden glow is an indicator of when the lava will periodically erupt... Hmm, if that's the case...
Viramdra: The principle of Vulcanite formation implies that it will only appear at the start of fierce lava activity... and the flowing lava will quickly swallow it and make it all disappear without a trace.
Viramdra: This means that there's zero possibility of ever bringing the ore back. Are the results I've been chasing all this time... only an illusion that can be seen from far away?
Karya: Viramdra...
Mualani: Our journey is not yet over. As we agreed, please come back to the People of the Springs with me. Then we'll officially complete this journey.
Viramdra: Fine, I suppose that would also count as some kind of result.
Mualani: Don't be so down. I have a feeling that the next answer I'm looking for will also be useful to you.
Paimon: Paimon remembers now! There's still something important we need to ask Mualani's teacher about!
Traveler: We didn't return empty-handed.

## Talk 13

Viramdra: I've got it... I've got it!

## Talk 14

Mualani: Uncle Nuu, we're back!
Nuu: Ah, Mualani... It's good to see you again. I always knew you'd return safe and sound.
Mualani: Uncle, I've completed the journey to the mysterious island. I'm here to return the talisman.
Nuu: ...But you still have a question you wish to ask me, right?
Mualani: Yes. You've been there before, haven't you?
Nuu: Yes, I have.
Mualani: If that's the case, then you've gone on the same journey. But why didn't you tell anyone?
Nuu: Because... I made a choice.
Paimon: A choice?
Nuu: Did you notice that the hidden inscriptions on the stone tablet disappeared as soon as you finished reading them?
Paimon: Oh yeah, you're right...
Nuu: There's a special paint on the statue that would change color when it comes into contact with volcanic dust.
Nuu: Only those who have been to that underground space will be contaminated by the dust, and be able to see the hidden message. But once the dust starts to wear off, the hidden inscription will disappear again.
Nuu: And this is the choice that the first chief left to us.
Nuu: If you choose to boast about your deeds, you will receive the highest honor, but the legend of the mysterious island would be destroyed as well.
Nuu: If you choose to remain silent, then the mysterious island will remain a legend, and continue to attract the next generation of young guides to rise to the challenge.
Nuu: In the end, my companions and I all chose the latter.
Mualani: Ahh... I get it now...
Viramdra: But not being able to tell anyone after accomplishing such a feat... People like Koolau will still look down on you. Are you really okay with that?
Nuu: But have you noticed that Koolau, who claims to have been to the island, hasn't actually completed the trip?
Viramdra: What!?
Paimon: Right, Paimon remembers that Koolau said that he went to the mysterious island alone, but there's no way he could've been able to use the Spiritways!
Nuu: He deliberately recommended the client to find Mualani, probably because he thought she wouldn't be able to reach the mysterious island. That way, Mualani wouldn't be able to expose him.
Nuu: As guides, we are not adventurers, let alone treasure hunters. The greatest responsibility of a guide is to take the client to their destination safely.
Nuu: But in the process, we also gain much skill and experience at overcoming danger. This allows us to go to places that no one else can reach, and even find treasures that no one else can find.
Nuu: Many guides gradually lose sight of their true beliefs and intentions in the process, and end up becoming like Koolau.
Nuu: They end up becoming more like thieves who would rush to the other side of the lava lake regardless of the consequences, rather than good guides who would turn around and save their friends.
Nuu: This is why the first chief left behind the legend and the map... to lure younger generations into taking up the challenge, thereby teaching them everything he had learned.
Nuu: Aside from me, many other tribe members have also traveled to the mysterious island. And just like me, they understood the first chief's intentions.
Nuu: So they've also made pacts with their companions, choosing to give up the results that would prove themselves, and give the younger generation the chance to continue the challenge.
Viramdra: You've all given up on the results...
Nuu: Sir, I've given up on merely one result. I haven't given up on everything.
Nuu: Given her talent and qualifications, Mualani was well within her rights to choose the top-ranked guide Koolau as her teacher, but she chose me.
Nuu: I believe I was able to cultivate such an outstanding student and witness her completion of the legendary challenge precisely because I didn't become someone like Koolau.
Nuu: If instead of looking at one single journey, we look at my entire career as a guide, I'd say I have not returned empty-handed. What about you?
Viramdra: ...
Viramdra: Karya... I've come up with a new research topic. Would you like to continue working as my assistant?
Karya: You're the same as always, Viramdra. You always have to find evidence before coming to a conclusion.
Viramdra: I...
Karya: In any case, I can't give you an answer right now.
Viramdra: Karya?
Karya: Because you haven't prepared the proposal yet. Shouldn't you finish that first before recruiting assistants? How could you forget?
Viramdra: Ah yes, of course. I'll certainly prepare all the necessary details...
Karya: But, I've always found your proposals fascinating, so I'm sure I won't be able to turn you down this time, either.
Viramdra: Karya... Given I have been presented with new evidence, I have come up with a very general theory... I can use the ideas from the chief's speech to express it.
Viramdra: Perhaps the treasure I'm seeking has been by my side the entire time... No, to be more precise, it's been with me even before I set out on this journey.
Karya: I understand, Viramdra.
Nuu: It appears this guest has also found his answer.
Paimon: It seems he's finally put two and two together.
Viramdra: There's nothing to worry about. It's just like Karya said — I can start some new research and reclaim everything I've lost.
Paimon: But it seems he's still as stubborn as before!
Nuu: Now it's your turn to make the choice, Mualani.
Mualani: But Uncle Nuu, I'm sure anyone who can complete the journey to the island would make the same choice, right?
Nuu: Very good. Then there's nothing more I can teach you. Here, take this talisman again. You can pass it on to your student in the future.
Viramdra: Looks like it's also our time to say goodbye. You've taken great care of us throughout our journey. As thanks, I'm also willing to keep the journey a secret.
Mualani: Then remember, the next time you come to visit the People of the Springs, you know where to find friends for help.
Viramdra: Friends? I supposed we are theoretically friends now, yes. When I publish my next paper, I'll be sure to add you to my list of acknowledgements.
Paimon: Well, that's one way to thank someone...
Karya: Then Viramdra and I will be taking our leave. I truly hope we'll get to see you all again someday!
Paimon: Okay, bye-bye!
Koolau: You're back already? So, as Nuu's student, did you manage to find the mysterious island?
Paimon: Huh? What are you doing here all of a sudden?
Traveler: He must be nervous...
Mualani: Well... I found something even more precious than the island... two friends that I can trust with my life!
Koolau: You... hmph! Seems you've really learned a lot from Nuu about how to make yourself feel better. I knew it... how could anyone ever reach the island with so many hindrances?
Mualani: Mm-hmm!
Nuu: Haha...
Paimon: Hee-hee!
Traveler: Hehe!
Koolau: Huh, wh—why are you all looking at me like that? The elders in the tribe also gave me that same look. What's that supposed to mean?
Koolau: Nuu, I've already proven that I'm stronger than you. I've been to even more dangerous places, and found far more precious treasures.
Koolau: I've even been to... the mysterious island! Why do you still look at me as if my words don't bother you at all?
Nuu: Koolau, even if you had never been to the island, no one would deny your abilities.
Nuu: But as for what we would deny about you... only you can find the answer to that.
Koolau: Me? Hmph!
Paimon: So now our trip to the mysterious island is officially finished, right?
Traveler: It's time to say goodbye.
Mualani: Yeah, but I have one more place I want to show you. Come with me!
Traveler: He wants to know if she made it.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Whoa, what's that light?
Mualani: Let's keep going. We'll be able to see more clearly up ahead.
Mualani: Watch your step. Follow closely, everyone!

## Talk 16

Paimon: There are plants growing here?
Mualani: There's nothing unusual about that. This is Spinel Fruit, which often grows around places with lava.
Mualani: Wait, it is a little strange... this isn't ordinary Spinel Fruit. It's the same as the one on this talisman.
Paimon: Isn't that the talisman your teacher gave you?
Mualani: Yes, in which case, could Uncle Nuu have been here before? But he clearly told me that he'd never made it to the mysterious island...
Mualani: I'll be sure to ask him about it once we get back!

## Talk 17

Paimon: There's so much lava, and it's getting pretty hot!
Mualani: The lava here doesn't look very stable... I'm afraid we can't stay here for long.

## Talk 18

Paimon: Is that lava up ahead?
Mualani: It appears these caves were formed by volcanic activity.
Viramdra: I see... then the Spiritways were affecting lava deep underground.
Viramdra: Altering the lava's flow created temporary holes which allowed us to follow the water's current and enter this underground space. Yes, it can all be explained in theory now.
Mualani: Are all scholars from Sumeru like this?
Paimon: Hard to say...
Viramdra: But can there be an island in this kind of underground space?
Mualani: It appears we haven't reached our destination yet. Let's keep going, everyone.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nuu: Mualani... she has quite a sense of ceremony. I'm sure she'll want to give you something as a memento. I suggest to not keep her waiting.

### Additional Talk 2

Mualani: I wonder when the next journey will begin...
