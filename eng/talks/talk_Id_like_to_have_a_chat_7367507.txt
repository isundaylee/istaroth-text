# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I'd like to have a chat.
Banu: Ah, this I can really relate to. It gets boring easier than you'd believe when you are out in the wild all by yourself.
Banu: When I was at home, I had so many things to do every day. Apart from all the housework, I had to cook meals for Shalmar with Apple, or else he'd have nothing to eat and starve.
Banu: Those were some busy days, but I never felt bored. But now, I'm away from home and all by myself, so I understand how you feel completely.
