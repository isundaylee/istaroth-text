# Mualani: Sharky

Namecard style.
Sharks that live in the sea don't actually like eating people â€” they prefer marine creatures. So as a shark that lives in freshwater hot springs, it's only natural that Mualani's Sharky Surfboard will only eat hot spring creatures. ...Just kidding, those Capybaras can sleep easy. Firstly, because their meat's too tough. And secondly, because... it's a surfboard?
