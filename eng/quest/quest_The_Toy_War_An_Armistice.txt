# The Toy War: An Armistice


## Talk 1

Caron: Haven't gone back, have you? Well, I must thank you — I'm sure father would be pleased that my brother and I finally spoke.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Y'know, today's supposed to be the day when Livre's gonna go pay Caron a visit. Should we go have a look? It sure would be nice if they could make up...

## Talk 3

Livre: You're here.
Paimon: Well, you seem to be in a good mood.
Livre: Thanks to your help. Speaking of which, Caron's trip to Mondstadt gave me an idea.
Livre: Perhaps I should go travel around for a bit and find some inspiration for toys myself.
Livre: You've traveled the world. You probably know some friends like that Bennett. Do you have any suggestions for me?
Paimon: Well, we do have a lot of friends, but when it comes to toy inspiration, that might be a bit tough...
Traveler: Why not look for a third party?
Paimon: Eh? We're a valid third party, aren't we?
Livre: Are you referring to... the Northland Bank?
Paimon: Oh, you meant the previous third party! Oh, let Paimon think... The Northland Bank's under the Fatui, and the Fatui are under...
Livre: Are you referring to a Harbinger? Do you mean that we can make a toy themed after a Harbinger?
Paimon: #...Huh! {NICKNAME}, do you mean... Oh, Paimon gets it.
Paimon: Hehe, Livre, did you know that there's a very special Harbinger, whom they call the—
Paimon: "The greatest toy salesman in Snezhnaya"!
Livre: What? Is there such a person?
Paimon: Of course, and he's a real expert, too! Maybe he'll inspire you... and y'know, a toy merchant and a seller would make a pretty awesome combo, don't you think?
Livre: Thanks for your suggestions — they've been very helpful.
Livre: I don't think it would be easy to get in contact with a Harbinger, but I do have some connections at the Northland Bank. I'll see what I can do.
Paimon: Hehe. Don't forget to invite us to try whatever new toy you come up with!
Livre: I will. Keep an ear out for news from me!
