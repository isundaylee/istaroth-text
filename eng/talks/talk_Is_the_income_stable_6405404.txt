Traveler: Is the income stable?
Mawyo: If you're a freelancer, you don't care about stability anymore.
Mawyo: See, I can rest for a long time as soon as I make a pile with an expedition team or a caravan.
Mawyo: It's easy to make a quick buck. With a little capital and a bit of luck, you can earn three months' money to pay for meals at the Kalimi Exchange.
Mawyo: Isn't this more proper than being an Akademiya researcher? I don't know what that old man is so worried about.
Mawyo: Those Invokation TCG cards command a ready market in Inazuma. I can trade those someday as well.
Mawyo: And my dad and Brother Sal won't let me starve to death even if there isn't a gig for me at the moment. So, please rest assured.
