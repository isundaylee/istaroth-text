Traveler: How's the research coming along?
Mtwa: Poorly, I'm afraid. It seems the more I look into it, the more questions I have. Why is it that as soon as one leaves Natlan, the fragments seem to disappear?
Mtwa: On the road here, I asked many an outlander, but all they gave me were funny looks. None of them seemed to know what I was talking about.
Mtwa: Then again, if I ran into a strange traveler from another land who was raving about a hole in the sky that I couldn't see, I'd probably think it was odd myself...
Mtwa: Well, not that I'm a traveler, obviously, I'm a researcher... That was just a hypothetical statement.
