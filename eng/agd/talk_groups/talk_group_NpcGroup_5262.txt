Roussimoff: Have you come to the ring to work up a sweat, too? Respect!

## Talk

Traveler: About Pankration...
Roussimoff: It's a very healthy sport!
Roussimoff: If you ask me, you really lose out by being the host! Sure, you get the best seat in the house, but do you think I want to be just watching?
Roussimoff: I want to get in the ring too, and go head-to-head with the best opponents!
Roussimoff: Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Roussimoff: Heh, it's more my speed than the Fleuve Cendre is.
Roussimoff: It's not that the Fleuve Cendre's bad, I just prefer it here. No matter how you look at it, the Fleuve Cendre just doesn't have any arenas as big as this one.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm just looking around. See you.
Roussimoff: See ya!

Roussimoff: Oho, if it isn't the coach! Here to scope out potential fighters to take under your wing?

Roussimoff: But on the other hand, we've been holding quite a few recreational matches recently. Maybe it's time to get back to the roots? Yeah, it's worth giving some serious thought.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Fonta sponsorship...
Roussimoff: I'm not a fan of Fonta, it's too sweet. Pure Water, on the other hand, is pretty decent. Too bad the supply's unreliable.
Roussimoff: That Heinry's a good kid, though. As you know, the majority of people here have hit rock bottom... literally or figuratively, haha.
Roussimoff: If you bring a little sweetness into people's lives at a time like that, they'll never forget it once they turn over a new leaf and get out of this place. Don't you think?
