# Not to be Missed


## Talk 1

Cyrus: The storms suddenly stopped...
Traveler: Is that a bad thing?
Cyrus: Ah, no... It's good that they stopped, yes.
Cyrus: Hmm... But it's all too sudden. I came up with so many contingency plans. Are we not going to get the chance to any of them?
Cyrus: My contingencies included ways to scatter the people in the wild to avoid the storms, teach them how to survive...
Cyrus: ...We were going to teach them to set up basic camps, do pest control, avoid beasts and monsters...
Cyrus: Ah, never mind. Rather than take our chances out there, better to remain safe within these walls.
Cyrus: Ah, yes. Some of our investigating adventurers have informed me that there are monsters congregating in the Whispering Woods.
Cyrus: Almost everyone is out investigating, and I must remain here to command them.
Cyrus: Traveler, can I count on you to clear those monsters out?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Consider it done.
Cyrus: I will leave it to you, then. Don't worry, you will be compensated fairly!

## Talk 3

Traveler: You seem unhappy about this.
Cyrus: Ah, this... Well, you know how the young people in Mondstadt all wish to join the Knights of Favonius, with their shining armor, their flying banners, the glory, and Master Jean as well...
Cyrus: As for the Adventurers' Guild, the only impression of us people have is that of people who bumble about outdoors... Basically, no one cares about us.
Cyrus: I thought to myself that if there was an opportunity to show the Guild's mettle, we might be able to bring in more fresh blood.
Cyrus: Ah, but it doesn't matter. The safety of Mondstadt is more important than my own personal wishes.
Cyrus: I'll leave those monsters to you. I'll have your compensation ready.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I've got other matters...
Cyrus: Alright. Go get your affairs in order first. I'll think of a way to get someone to clear those monsters out.
Cyrus: *sigh* Where has that kid Bennett run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.

## Talk 5

Cyrus: You're back. What's the situation?
Traveler: There are still monsters out and about...
Cyrus: Monsters are still in the area, eh? So it seems that the effects of the Storm have yet to disperse...
Cyrus: Hahaha! So there's still time, then â€” time for the Adventurers' Guild to show its quality.
Cyrus: It is up to us to take those monsters out in the wild on, while the Knights of Favonius are still focused on defending the city and the area around Mondstadt.
Cyrus: I understand. Thanks for your help in investigating. I will reconsider the commissions that we will be sending out. Take these as your reward.

## Talk 6

Cyrus: *sigh* Where has that kid Bennett run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.
