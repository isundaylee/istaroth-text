Traveler: About the letter to your family...
Atsuko: Ah, you've delivered it to my parents, have you? Thank you very much. It's a relief to know that they're doing well.
Atsuko: My mother would most likely keep worrying, while my father would try to comfort her while keeping his own worries in his heart...
Atsuko: *sigh* It was only after leaving that I realized how much they must miss. I'm... really sorry for making them worry.
