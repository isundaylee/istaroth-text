Traveler: You seem a little down. What's wrong?
Urville: Well, that probably has something to do with you... or myself, rather. I was bragging about how I'd have struck it rich the next time we met...
Urville: But the truth is, wealth has remained as elusive as ever.

Traveler: Just keep your feet on the ground and work hard, and one day...
Urville: Nadia said the same thing. You're all more knowledgeable about this than I am, so I'll trust you.
Urville: Actually, working here is a solid gig. It keeps you busy, unlike before when I was treasure hunting outside. You could go for days, or even weeks, without any discoveries.
Urville: You're right! I should work hard and be diligent from today onwards!

Traveler: Treasure hunt not going well?
Urville: Yes, indeed. I actually tried diving to search for clues before that could lead to treasure, but I was too weak.
Urville: Ball Octopuses are so hard to deal with...
Urville: But I won't give up. Someday, I'll defeat them on my own terms. Only then can I continue moving forward.

## Talk 5

Urville: I feel like I've gotten a little stronger recently. Let's go diving for treasure again when things are less busy at the harbor.
Nadia: Alright, if we're chased by any Ball Octopuses again, I'll take the responsibility and bring Urville back.
Urville: Can't you have a little faith in me? Why is it assumed from the get-go that I'm going to lose?
Nadia: Well... I don't remember the exact score, but I know you have lost to the Ball Octopuses more than a few times before. Not exactly a track record that fills you with confidence.
Urville: Darn it, we should still have hope, no matter what! What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, right?
Nadia: You are right. As long as we persevere, there will always be a chance of success.
