# A Little Booze Doesn't Hurt...


## Talk 1

Nimrod: Boy do I need a drink...
Nimrod: But if Eury catches me drinking, it'll be the end of me.
Traveler: Is everything okay?
Nimrod: Huh? Oh... It's fine, I just fancy a little drink is all.
Nimrod: My wife Eury can't stand it when I drink, though, so I never touch the stuff at home.
Nimrod: All I can do is wait till she's gone out shopping and then slip out for a few quick ones.
Traveler: The first step is admitting you have a problem...
Nimrod: Hey! Don't be like that. I'm hardly the only person in Mondstadt who's fond of a drink.
Nimrod: But could you go and distract Eury for a while? Just long enough for one or two brews, you know?
Nimrod: Whenever Eury goes shopping, all it takes is a little too much choice and she'll be there all day trying to make up her mind!
Nimrod: She's guaranteed to keep thinking it over as long as you can keep making sure there's another option...
Traveler: Okay...
Nimrod: Haha, excellent! May your glasses forever flow with the fine wine of good fortune, my friends!
Traveler: How long do you plan on drinking for, exactly?
Nimrod: Ho-ho, well that depends how long you can...
Nimrod: ...N—No, I just need enough time to enjoy one nice drink without having to down it...
Nimrod: Just the one, I swear! You can always trust a tavern-goer in Mondstadt!

## Talk 2

Eury: Hmm... Sunsettias or apples? Decisions, decisions...
Eury: *sigh* I wish Nimrod were here, I'd just pick what he wants...
Quinn: Apologies, Eury ma'am. We're all out of sunsettias.
Eury: Oh, I see. Well, I guess it will have to be apples, then.
Quinn: Ooh... Sorry Eury, I think these apples are starting to turn...
Eury: Really? Hmm... but there's no other choice.
Paimon: Allow us!
Quinn: Huh? Allow you to...?
Traveler: To help.
Paimon: Relax. We'll find some fresh <color=#00E1FFFF>sunsettias</color> for you.
Quinn: ...You will? Um, well thanks...!
Eury: This is great, Nimrod much prefers sunsettias to apples. I'll wait here then.

## Talk 3

Quinn: It's so kind of you to get me some sunsettias, Beatrice bought the last ones just before I got here.

## Talk 4

Eury: I really am grateful to you... You know what? My husband recently quit drinking for my sake, and he's been so miserable since...
Eury: Maybe some of his favorite fruit will cheer him up a bit.
Eury: That said... The apples are better value for money...

## Talk 5

Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's go get those sunsettias pronto!
Paimon: We need to keep Eury umm-ing and ahh-ing for as long as possible.
Paimon: Is it just me or it is weird that Nimrod understands his wife so well?

### Additional Talk 1

Quinn: Did you find any sunsettias?
Traveler: Will these do?
Quinn: Gosh, that's plenty! This is amazing, thank you!
Eury: They look really good!
Eury: ...But these apples are so cheap. Maybe I should get some of each?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: That should keep Eury pondering for a good while...
Paimon: Let's go and update Nimrod.

### Additional Talk 3

Nimrod: Y—You're back? What's the... situation with Eury?
Paimon: Judging by the smell, I'd say he's had more than one...
Traveler: Eury is struggling with a big decision as we speak.
Nimrod: Great... great! I, uh... I guess I have time for another then! Bartender—
Paimon: Oi! You said just the one! You said you swear!
Nimrod: Hehe... I did, didn't I? Just the one... I swear— I swear this next one is just the one for me! Haha! Bartender...
Nimrod: Thank you, my friends. Please, take these. My gift to you.
Nimrod: Now, I must get back to my wine! Wine o'clock doesn't come every day...
