# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I saw a lame local taking an outsider around here yesterday, they were talking about 'science' and 'medicine' while they were walking, what was going on?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I've also heard them say something like 'the more important the research, the more you need to do it in hidden, out-of-the-way places like this.' They're not planning on selling Sinthe, are they?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "It would be best if you two would explain the situation in detail. The Boss wants to talk to them."
