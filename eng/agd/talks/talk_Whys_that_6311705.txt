Traveler: Why's that?
Ooizumi: The oppressive practices of the Shogunate played out before our eyes day after day. Are we really just going to just call things square after all that?
Ooizumi: The Sakoku Decree, the Vision Hunt Decree... These both led to incredible amounts of suffering. We can't forget their actions just because we're all praying for a short-term peace.
Ooizumi: And as far as I know the Shogunate, they're not going to stop here. That's why we must remain vigilant as well. Someday, we'll make them pay for what they've done.
