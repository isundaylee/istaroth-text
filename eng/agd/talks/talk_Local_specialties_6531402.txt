Traveler: Local specialties?
Lutine: That's right. Let me introduce you. Here, we use ingredients sourced nearby to make delicious dishes that match our tastes.
Lutine: I might be tooting my own horn here, but our specialties are well-known amongst niche gourmets!
Lutine: The Steambird even included "trying Merusea Village cuisine" in their "100 Heroic Challenges to Try This Year" feature! We are No.20 on the list!
Lutine: Also, I've recently come up with a new dish. Wanna try it out?
Traveler: (Lutine takes out a dish with a blurry silhouette. The... stimulating scent makes your eyes swell up... This doesn't look edible. You don't think so, anyway.)
