Traveler: Why did you come to Inazuma?
Yegor: As you can see, I'm a Snezhnayan merchant. So naturally, I'm here for business.
Yegor: Apart from doing business, I also plan to travel around Inazuma.
Yegor: I've heard a lot of legends about places in Inazuma. Perhaps I might be able to find something if I go check those places out.
