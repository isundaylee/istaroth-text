## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ur: Grainfruit is so delicious... But if you eat them and only them, they stop tasting good after a few days.
Ur: Is that why humans... eat grass and Grainfruit at the same time...?

### Additional Talk 2

Huruk: So sleepy. I want to sleep... But we have to stand here together...
Huruk: Why... Do humans want to stand here all day?

### Additional Talk 3

Kusi: Well, that's my weight under control, but... Hmm? What's up?
Traveler: Might I ask your name?
Kusi: Ah, right. I'm one of the sentries stationed here, although I'm in vacation mode right now...
Kusi: So if something's come up, go look for the fella beside me, Yukom!
Traveler: Something on your mind?
Kusi: Well, y'see, I've been getting a little heavier lately, so I've added lots of healthy veggies to my usual Grainfruit diet.
Kusi: But for some reason, my buddy Ur's been copying me by eating a whole bunch of grass... Not a disaster, since Saurians are omnivores, but I worry he can keep up with all his nutritional needs, eating all that grass...
Kusi: Guess I need to give him a bit of a talking-to later.
Traveler: Nothing, really.
Kusi: Sure. Safe travels, then, outlander.
