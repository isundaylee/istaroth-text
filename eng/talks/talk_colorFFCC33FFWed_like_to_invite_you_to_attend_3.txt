Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Marjorie: A music festival? Didn't we just hold the Windblume Festival?
Paimon: This one's taking place in Inazuma, Marjorie, and it's a serious musical exchange! If you've got any tunes you like, we can play it for you right here and now.
Marjorie: Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't remember this one's name, but could you play it if I were to just hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Marjorie: Oh, that'd be grand!
