Wuwang: Thank goodness you're here. I think I'm lost...
Wuwang: And I think I must have eaten something a bit suspect, I'm feeling a little rough...

Traveler: Are you okay?
Wuwang: I'm looking for someone. The woman I love.
Wuwang: We met at... I forget, but it was either a theater or a tea house. Anyway, I was an adventurer, darting off all over the place, and she was a performer there...
Wuwang: You'd definitely have heard of her if you'd been there. Everyone's been singing her praises these past few years.
Wuwang: We hit it off straight away, and both of us felt we were ready to pack in the drudgery of normal life. So we promised we'd move out to the country together...
Traveler: Who is she?
Wuwang: Her name is...
Wuwang: ...Huh, that's strange. I seem to have forgotten her name.
Wuwang: I'm so scatter brained these days. Bits and pieces of memories, all jumbled together...
Wuwang: As I recall, my buddy and I agreed to go on one last big seafaring adventure before I made the move. And then something happened...
Wuwang: I don't know what. And I can't remember her name. All I remember is the promises we made... to live a simple life together, to watch the sunrise and sunset together, to grow old together...
Wuwang: Where should I go? Why can't I remember her name...

Traveler: Feeling rough in what way?
Wuwang: It's hard to describe... It's like I feel dizzy all the time, and I'm so drowsy during the day that I have to try to force myself to stay awake, but I just can't do it...
Wuwang: And then when I finally come round, it's dark out. So I have to travel during the night to catch up.
Wuwang: But at nighttime there's never anyone around to ask for directions. I once saw a guy sleeping by the side of the road and tried to wake him up...
Wuwang: But it was like he couldn't hear a word I was saying. And I tried to shake him awake, but I somehow couldn't touch him, either... Do you think he was a ghost?
Wuwang: ...Ugh, never mind all that, I should get going.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Wuwang: I will find her, I know I will. However long it takes, wherever she is...
