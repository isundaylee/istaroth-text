Traveler: What happened?
Makhfi: Sorry you had to hear me complain.
Makhfi: I was just lamenting that researchers have to deal with so many things on top of their own research.
Makhfi: Such as official Akademiya assignments, delegated tasks from mentors, getting along with peers, and sometimes, even inquiry from the matra.
Makhfi: *sigh* If only these things could just resolve themselves, like a tree shedding its leaves...
Makhfi: Now, I understand more or less why Tighnari left the Akademiya.

Traveler: See you.
Makhfi: The simple life is gone forever...
