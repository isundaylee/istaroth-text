Waranka: He's every bit as bold as his mother... *sigh*...
Mama Coco: Quite the clever kid, that one. Besides, he's still just a kid, so it's not like he can go too far. No need to worry about him too much.
Waranka: Just thinking about what could happen to him, I...
Mama Coco: It's fine! No need to scare yourself. Always look on the bright side!
Mama Coco: I'll help you look for him in a bit. I'm sure he's fine, maybe he's just hanging out with someone else's kids and lost track of time.
Waranka: Thank you...

Mama Coco: Being strict is actually what's best for children, don't you think?
Traveler: About Orqo...
Mama Coco: That's the kid I'm talking about. It's precisely because of his family's circumstances that he needs to grow up faster. What happened to his parents was indeed a tragedy, but what's done is done...
Mama Coco: Dwelling on the past is useless. We need to look ahead to the future. And in the future, that kid'll have to rely on himself.
Traveler: About the star that fell from the sky...
Mama Coco: You mean that weird rock? Well, it did fall from the sky, all right. Strange as it is, though, it doesn't seem to be dangerous.
Mama Coco: Though the story Orqo is talking about should have nothing to do with it. After all, that story's been passed down for ages, and it speaks of the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Mama Coco: *sigh* Though it's not like I can't understand where Waranka is coming from. But kids have to face the truth someday, and perhaps sooner is better than later.
Traveler: I'll take my leave for now.
Mama Coco: Do be careful!
