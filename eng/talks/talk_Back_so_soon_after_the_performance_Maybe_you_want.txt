Yinggong: Back so soon after the performance? Maybe you want to give it another go?
Traveler: I want to see it again.
Yinggong: Haha, it seems you really enjoy this. Let's do an extra performance then.
Traveler: About the Yun-Han Opera Troupe...
Yinggong: No special performance has been planned for this year's Lantern Rite. After all, we've already performed for many years' Lantern Rite in succession. So this year, we can finally have a good rest.
Yinggong: That said, I started getting a little restless and decided to put on a paper play for the kids, haha.
Traveler: See you.
Yinggong: Goodbye for now. When we meet again, I shall show you the costumes and props I've made.
