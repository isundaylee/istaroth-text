Traveler: What if I want to go to Narukami Island...
Chiba: You want to go to Narukami Island? Then it's not something that can be taken care of with just Mora.
Chiba: Even Inazuma locals must come here for approval if they want to go to Ritou, let alone an outlander such as yourself trying to leave it. You can forget it.
Chiba: Unless you can get a Travel Permit, but it's not something that can be obtained so easily. Even I don't have a way to get it. As for you... good luck to you.
