Ossie: As I've gotten older, my memory's gone down the pan... But thinking back to my youth, it wasn't too hot to begin with, haha.

Traveler: Sounds like there's a story in there.
Ossie: What's there to tell? Whether your memory's good or bad, life's still life.
Ossie: Has having a bad memory ever caused problems for me? Not really, aside from forgetting lyrics while I was singing.
Ossie: But that's all ancient history now! You wouldn't believe it, but one time, I completely blanked out while I was performing between matches during the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. That was quite the thrill...
Ossie: It's just lucky that the Masters of the Night-Wind have a habit of writing rather "classical" sounding lyrics. No one even knows what they mean half the time, so your audience won't notice when you go off piste, hehe.

Traveler: See you.
Ossie: Goodbye! I hope I'll still remember you the next time we meet.

## Talk

Traveler: That is indeed a "precious" memory.
Ossie: You could call my "amnesia" a blessing in disguise, haha.
Ossie: Hear me now, having a bad memory isn't always a bad thing. The less you remember, the less obsessive you become.
Ossie: Take that "Granny Itztli" Citlali, for instance. It's been how many years, and she still can't let that unfinished serial novel of hers go!
Ossie: *sigh* What was it called again... Heh, I've forgotten...
