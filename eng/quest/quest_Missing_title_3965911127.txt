# Missing title (3965911127)

Ooshima Junpei: Haha, the Lady Priestess is so overjoyed. This "Hibiki" must really have been someone of great importance to it.
Traveler: Trouble is, we don't know where she is...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Etsuko: Indeed, "Hibiki," "Asase Shrine," "Domeki"... these names are all quite concerning, actually.
Traveler: And where did you two pop out from?
Etsuko: Well, you were all making such a racket, so of course we'd come over.
Etsuko: Still, there's something that I think you must know.
Etsuko: Taisuke, if you'd do the honors.
Taisuke: Ah right, of course, Miss Etsuko. So what we're going to say... concerns Seirai Island.
Taisuke: The history of this place is very obscure, and while the Guild has attempted to specifically search for information regarding it, we've found very little...
Taisuke: According to what information we did manage to get, this was a gathering place for pirates several centuries ago. Then, the Shogunate cleared all the pirates out and moved the inhabitants to other places...
Taisuke: Unless I'm mistaken, this "Domeki" we speak of may well have been the pirate leader "Ako Domeki," who chose to fight the Shogunate head-on. The records do clearly record his name.
Taisuke: According to that same information we have, this Ako Domeki led his pirate fleet in a naval battle against the Shogunate.
Taisuke: They were quickly suppressed and forced to flee back to Seirai Island...
Taisuke: But as the Shogunate fleet pursued him, a sudden storm erupted on Seirai Island.
Taisuke: Ako Domeki's fleet and the Shogunate's were both caught in the ensuing storm... and they were all lost.
Traveler: A storm...
Etsuko: I'll pick things up from there. The biggest mystery here, of course, is the sudden emergence of that storm.
Etsuko: Although Ako Domeki's fleet was also hit by the storm and was nearly wiped out as a result, the fleet that the Shogunate sent was also all but lost with all hands, with the remnants being forced to retreat to Narukami Island. It would be quite some time before the fleet was ready again.
Etsuko: So the timing of that storm was just too coincidental. Almost as if... someone was specifically controlling it.
Etsuko: I'm sure you remember the Warding Stones on this island. Those had been intentionally unsealed.
Etsuko: And once we sealed them again, the storm on the island became calm once more.
Etsuko: I'm not going to jump to conclusions immediately, but my gut says that those incidents are definitely related.
Taisuke: Well, we could ask Lady Neko...
Etsuko: ...Eh, I say forget it. The record states that Domeki went missing â€” well, that's what it says anyway, but if he was hit by that storm, he probably...
Etsuko: We'll continue exploring this island and collecting more information about this incident for a while, and then we'll report back to the Guild.
Etsuko: Who knows? Maybe we'll have the pleasure of working together again some time.
Traveler: I look forward to it.
Etsuko: The feeling's mutual.
Etsuko: Well, Taisuke, let's ready up. We've got some exploring to do.
Taisuke: Uh, so Miss Etsuko, about Lady Neko...
Etsuko: You can keep treating that cat just as you did before, of course.
Etsuko: Just remember to refrain from saying anything you shouldn't.
Etsuko: She's a real happy camper right now. No need for you to be a wet blanket.
Taisuke: I got it. Haha, Miss Etsuko, you really are...
Etsuko: ...Just trying to finish our commissions more efficiently. C'mon, let's get to work.
Etsuko: Seirai Island... It seems that this place is still full of many mysteries...
Traveler: Do you know something?
