# Where Is the Unseen Razor?


## Talk 1

Lan: Hmph, looks like it should be here.
Traveler: Lan?
Lan: Traveler. I didn't expect to see you here.
Lan: Do you remember the sword hilt you found last time? Well, it turns out that it was indeed part of the Unseen Razor.
Lan: The funny thing is, the only reason I could recognize it is because I secretly etched a marking onto it as a child...
Lan: I remember I told my brother that if he ever decided to wield another sword, he had to give the Unseen Razor to me.
Lan: Heh. I suppose neither one of us could have foreseen how things turned out... I can't believe this is how I ended up finding the Unseen Razor. Looks like the sword... really did get shattered.
Lan: Alright. I suppose I'll cut to the chase now that you're here, Traveler. I'm going to need your help again.
Lan: Two gatherings of monsters should be loitering somewhere ahead. They seem to have amassed a sizable inventory of damaged weapons to hoard within their camps, though I'm uncertain as to why.
Lan: The Adventurers' Guild is worried that these monsters will wreak havoc on the surroundings and originally wanted to draft a commission to resolve this. However, after I reviewed the details, I thought that perhaps... I could find some pieces of the Unseen Razor here.
Lan: Traveler, let's each clear out a camp.
Lan: The camp to the left is being held by a group of hilichurls. Alone, each of them should present no danger to you...
Lan: But their numbers are substantial. Should you face them directly and all at once, it might require some effort to prevail, even for you.
Lan: On the right is a Stonehide Lawachurl. As for how dangerous facing one is... I don't think I really need to elaborate.
Lan: Since I'm the one who asked for your aid, I'll let you select which camp to clear.
Traveler: What are you doing here?

## Talk 2

Lan: Traveler, have you already wiped out the monsters in that camp?
Traveler: All done.
Lan: Just some ordinary monsters. It didn't take too much out of me. Shame that I didn't find anything of value. It's just scrap here.
Lan: How'd it go on your end? Did you find anything?
Traveler: I found this.
Lan: Huh... That looks like a piece of a sword... Thanks. I'll bring it back with me and examine it more closely.
Lan: Thanks, Traveler. Here's your payment. Please accept it.
Traveler: If we find all the shards...
Lan: My desire is a simple one... I just want to reforge the Unseen Razor.
Lan: Though the blueprints detailing how the Unseen Razor was made and what materials were used have been lost... I'll find a way.
Lan: If I can reforge the Unseen Razor, then my brother will also... *sigh*
Traveler: What will you do with them?
Traveler: How's it going on your end?

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'll take the left side.
Lan: Understood. I'll go for the other one. Let's make this quick.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I'll take care of the camp on the right.
Lan: Understood. I'll go for the other one. Let's make this quick.

## Talk 5

Lan: How goes it? You've cleared the monsters on your end?
Traveler: You've already... defeated all the monsters in the area?
Lan: Hmm? Of course.
Lan: I mean, I am the president of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild. Dealing with monsters is pretty typical for me.

## Talk 6

Lan: Traveler, have you already wiped out the monsters in that camp?
Traveler: All done.
Lan: Just some ordinary monsters. It didn't take too much out of me. I also got lucky and found a valuable piece from a longsword.
Traveler: I haven't found anything on my side...
Lan: Don't worry about it. You helped me rule out a misidentified location, so thanks.
Lan: Here, you've earned this.
Traveler: If we find all the shards...
Lan: My desire is a simple one... I just want to reforge the Unseen Razor.
Lan: Though the blueprints detailing how the Unseen Razor was made and what materials were used have been lost... I'll find a way.
Lan: If I can reforge the Unseen Razor, then my brother will also... *sigh*
Traveler: What will you do with them?
Traveler: How's it going on your end?

Lan: Hmph, looks like it should be here.
Traveler: Lan?
Lan: Traveler? Fancy running into you here again.
Lan: Yeah, I managed to get a few new fragments through some more... appropriate commissions.
Lan: The situation is the same as it was previously. I'd like to invite you to head out with me and defeat some monsters.
Lan: The camp to the left is being held by a group of hilichurls. Alone, each of them should present no danger to you...
Lan: But their numbers are substantial. Should you face them directly and all at once, it might require some effort to prevail, even for you.
Lan: On the right is a Stonehide Lawachurl. As for how dangerous facing one is... I don't think I really need to elaborate.
Lan: Since I'm the one who asked for your aid, I'll let you select which camp to clear.
Traveler: Are you still looking for sword fragments?
