Durgar: Hello, and happy Sabzeruz! I apologize, but I'm taking the holidays off, so if you have any carpentry commissions, please wait until after the festival.
Durgar: Everything that grows in Sumeru is a gift from the Dendro Archon, so let's give the plants some time off during the Sabzeruz Festival too, haha!
