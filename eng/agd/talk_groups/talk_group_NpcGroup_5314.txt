Lutine: Oh my, I've never seen you before, traveler. Would you like to try some of Merusea Village's specialties?

## Talk

Traveler: Local specialties?
Lutine: That's right. Let me introduce you. Here, we use ingredients sourced nearby to make delicious dishes that match our tastes.
Lutine: I might be tooting my own horn here, but our specialties are well-known amongst niche gourmets!
Lutine: The Steambird even included "trying Merusea Village cuisine" in their "100 Heroic Challenges to Try This Year" feature! We are No.20 on the list!
Lutine: Also, I've recently come up with a new dish. Wanna try it out?
Traveler: (Lutine takes out a dish with a blurry silhouette. The... stimulating scent makes your eyes swell up... This doesn't look edible. You don't think so, anyway.)

## Talk

Traveler: I've got other things to do, so, no thank you.
Lutine: Oh well, that's fine. If you've got the time in the future, be sure to come try our authentic cuisine!

## Talk

Traveler: You love making, uh, food, do you...
Lutine: Of course! Not to brag or anything, but my food's the best in Merusea Village! I greatly treasure the expressions everyone makes after eating my dishes.
Lutine: Hehe, in fact, I can't wait to see yours. How about it? Would you like to have a go?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure, hit me with it!
Traveler: (Contrary to its appearance, the dish is actually most refreshing. After a single bite, the pungent flavors also become... surprisingly amiable...)
Lutine: Hehe, there's lots of things you can't know till you try! My food was pretty good, huh? I could tell from your expression!

## Talk

Traveler: Well, um, cooking should require focus on all aspects, including color and scent...
Lutine: Ooh, you sound like you know a lot about cooking. Cool!
Lutine: All the more reason, then, for you to try my dish out — it's the culmination of all I know about flavors, scents, and colors!

## Talk

Traveler: Uh, I'm not all that hungry right now, I'm afraid...
Lutine: *sigh* True, true. If you eat while you're very full, even the most delicious food would seem merely ordinary.
Lutine: Well then, come back when you're feeling hungry and want to try some Melusine cuisine. Don't forget, now!

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Lutine: Oh, you mean from just now? Ugh, seriously, it made all the pies I made earlier drop...
