Chaonan: Are you tired?
Chaonan: ...I'm a ship repairman. When the ships are at sea, I have nothing to do. But when they dock, I'm so busy I never get a wink of sleep...
Chaonan: So I have decided to conserve my stamina from now on. Otherwise, I won't be able to cope when the busy period hits.
Traveler: Have you considered a change of occupation?
Chaonan: Well, this job is rather busy, but being busy also means that there's money to be made.
Chaonan: We have Rex Lapis' divine predictions to thank for that. The number of merchants going out to sea has increased year on year in recent times, which has led to our business being on the rise, too.
Chaonan: Those merchants who have made their fortunes aren't stingy, either. They often give us some tips on top of the repair fees.
Chaonan: Hard work begets an equal reward, and for the lads who want to earn some money while they're young, this job is pretty good. We shouldn't waste the opportunity that Rex Lapis has given us.
