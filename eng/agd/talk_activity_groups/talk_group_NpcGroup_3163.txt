Miyuki: Hi there, you can come to me if there's anything you need help with.
Miyuki: I have to work harder in my duties as a shrine maiden to earn the approval of Lady Yae, after all.

## Talk

Traveler: What are a shrine maiden's duties?
Miyuki: Our duties are obviously to obey the commands of Lady Guuji Yae!
Miyuki: I will do my best to complete any instructions Lady Yae gives me, just as I did in Tatarasuna. I won't ever let her down.

## Talk

Traveler: Lady Yae's approval, huh...
Miyuki: Yes! Lady Yae praised me after I completed my mission in Tatarasuna. That was the happiest moment of my life!
Miyuki: That's why from that day on, I've decided to work even harder to serve Lady Yae. I want to become a shrine maiden whom Lady Yae can count on even more than Kano Nana!
Miyuki: *sigh* I really don't understand why Lady Yae and Kano Nana are so close. She even shares her secrets with her...
Miyuki: Hmph. I mean, I can outperform her in many ways, for sure!

## Talk

Traveler: About Tatarasuna...
Miyuki: The problem with the Mikage Furnace in Tatarasuna has been resolved thanks to your help. You have my gratitude.
Miyuki: I've never worked in a place so far away, and I heard many interesting stories along the way.
Miyuki: It's said that the Sangonomiya troops are actually led by a shrine maiden. I never thought that a shrine maiden would be able to command a battlefield at the front lines...
Miyuki: I wish I could meet her, I'm quite curious as to what she's actually like...

## Talk

Traveler: I'll not bother you. Goodbye.
Miyuki: *sigh* So you don't need any help?
Miyuki: Alright then, I guess I'll keep waiting on Lady Yae's instructions...

Miyuki: Hmm? Ah, Traveler. What are you doing at a place like this at a moment like this? ...You really are an unlucky one, aren't you.
Miyuki: If you came here to enjoy the view of the Sakura, now is categorically not the time, so please don't get your hopes up.
Miyuki: We used to have a lot of visitors coming here for the Sakura, but no one wants to come here these days. Not with all the fighting going on.
Traveler: I didn't come for the Thunder Sakura.
Miyuki: Oh, so you just happened to be passing through? In that case, I'd better warn you — the Thunder Sakura have been damaged. I went to inspect them earlier and something about them just didn't seem right.
Miyuki: Don't get too close to the Thunder Sakura — it could be dangerous. Please, be careful.
Traveler: What's a Thunder Sakura?
Miyuki: You don't know the first thing about them, do you? Small wonder, I suppose, since you're not from the shrine.
Miyuki: You've probably seen the Sacred Sakura at the Grand Narukami Shrine? That's a symbol of the Great Narukami's power. The Great Narukami is eternal, just as the Sacred Sakura will always be in full bloom.
Miyuki: Beyond the shrine, in Kannazuka, you will find Thunder Sakura. They share a common origin with the Sacred Sakura and possess a similar power, too.
Miyuki: Recently, however, the Thunder Sakura have been damaged, and they are not producing blossoms. It cannot be a good sign.
Miyuki: It alarmed Lady Miko enough that she sent me to Kannazuka to investigate.
Miyuki: So far, I have discovered a group of Treasure Hoarders who keep showing up near the Thunder Sakura. They seem very suspicious to me, and I must find out what their connection is to all of this.
Miyuki: However, I... Well, to put it bluntly, I'd be hopeless in a fight, and these Treasure Hoarders look particularly fierce...
Miyuki: Traveler, I'd like to ask you to investigate their camp and find out what they're up to.
Miyuki: I initially thought that I'd be more than capable of handling the investigation on my own, but now... it's less straightforward than I'd imagined, so all I can do is ask for your help.
Miyuki: Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: What's the big deal with Thunder Sakura?
Traveler: That's a bummer.
Miyuki: It's a little more than a bummer. It's an absolute tragedy! Seeing the damaged condition that the Thunder Sakura are in fills my heart with grief.
Miyuki: Also, when I went to inspect them earlier, something about them just didn't seem right.
