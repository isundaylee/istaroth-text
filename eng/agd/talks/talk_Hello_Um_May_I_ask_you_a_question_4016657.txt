Elham: Hello! Um... May I ask you a question?
Elham: Do you still have those special candies? You know, the ones scattered on the candy towers.
Elham: My friend got some for me, and of course, the candies taste great, but I'm really curious what the coating is made out of.
Elham: It feels so soft, but it also isn't easily damaged by distributed pressure. I was just thinking, maybe it could be used for clothing?
