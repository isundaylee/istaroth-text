Traveler: Bigger whats... exactly?
Cintli: Grainfruit, Tomatoes, Sunsettias, Onions... You name it, we grow it.
Cintli: Did you know that I'm currently the producer of Natlan's biggest Grainfruit?
Cintli: But I haven't reached my limit yet, not by a long shot. I'm certain that my land has far more potential.
Cintli: I've decided that once I've grown even bigger fruits, I'll display them in Yantasar's store for all to see.
Cintli: As people taste the delicious drinks she makes from the fruit and veg I grow, they'll be able to see how big and beautiful they are with their own two eyes.
Cintli: Then my store's reputation will start booming too, haha!

Traveler: You seem very confident.
Cintli: Of course.
Cintli: But it's not just down to my efforts alone. Our Collective of Plenty is situated right by a volcano, where the soil was already rich and fertile to begin with.
Cintli: And cultivating land like this is much easier thanks to the fact that we can draw upon the awesome power of the Tatankasaurs.
Cintli: So when I said that the fruit and vegetables we grow in the Collective of Plenty are the best in the whole of Natlan, I wasn't just bragging. That's something everyone knows.
