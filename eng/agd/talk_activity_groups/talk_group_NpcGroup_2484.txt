Huang the Third: Ah, esteemed visitors, this must be a fated meeting! Are you interested in seeing a place of great significance to the Guhua... Oh my, it's you!

## Talk

Traveler: How's your fated meetings been going?
Huang the Third: I've had quite a few earnest guests come with me to Wangshan Hall. No doubt due to the fortune you brought, of course...
Huang the Third: They didn't leave much Mora behind, but they certainly did contribute to Wangshan Hall's repair fund.
Huang the Third: Do drop by if the fancy strikes you, by the way!

## Talk

Traveler: Still need me to make you a meal?
Huang the Third: Oh, no, no! Your sincerity was well-felt indeed!
Huang the Third: On the contrary, it should be I who should whip up a good dish for you, or perhaps treat you to a restaurant meal!
Huang the Third: Uh, hang on a moment, let me check our expenses over the last few days...
Huang the Third: *cough* Well, let's have that feast another day, shall we?

## Talk

Traveler: Alright, you do you, then!
Huang the Third: You are most kind! May we meet again!
