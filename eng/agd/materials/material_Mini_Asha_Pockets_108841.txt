# Mini Asha Pockets

An adorable pastry shaped like an Asha. Wrap the meat filling in dough, shape the pastry, then deep-fry until golden. Don't forget to paint on tiny sunglasses with sauce for a playful touch. It's not hard to guess why this snack is so popular â€” Asha are super, super cute, after all.
