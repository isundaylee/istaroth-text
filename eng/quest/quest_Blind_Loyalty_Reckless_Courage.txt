# Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage


## Talk 1

Kujou Sara: Lady Guuji. Here I am, as promised. Rest assured I came here alone and told no one about this trip.
Yae Miko: I knew you would keep your promise, after all... I'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days — have you managed to get any sleep at all?
Kujou Sara: I—I... You're quite mistaken. I would never doubt the leaders of my clan.
Kujou Sara: So. Where is your proof?
Traveler: Here.
Yae Miko: Ah, how wonderful. Everyone's keeping their promises today.
Paimon: You wouldn't believe what we had to go through to get our hands on this stuff.
Yae Miko: Hand them to Sara. She can examine them for herself.
Kujou Sara: What is this?
Kujou Sara: ...I see this document bears the official seal of the head of the Kujou Clan. And it doesn't look like a forgery...
Kujou Sara: I don't understand... Not a single word about the resistance, Sangonomiya, or the situation on the front line...
Kujou Sara: What about the soldiers who gave their lives on the front line, or the hardship endured by the people? Do they deserve no mention!?
Kujou Sara: Utter disregard for human life. Why would they want to hide it?
Yae Miko: For the sake of the Vision Hunt Decree, of course. Don't you think the Shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
Kujou Sara: So the Tenryou Commission... They are deliberately deceiving the Shogun?
Yae Miko: Yes. Now... who else do you think might be benefiting from the Vision Hunt Decree?
Traveler: I also have a confidential letter here.
Paimon: This is a letter from the Tenryou Commission to the Fatui. The head of the Kujou Clan kept this a secret from the Shogun, too.
Kujou Sara: ...
Yae Miko: Well? The things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
Yae Miko: Surely... you aren't planning to turn a blind eye to them?
Kujou Sara: So everything I've ever held on to... it's all... How could they... Argh!
Kujou Sara: This betrayal is unforgivable... Takayuki, you've got some explaining to do!
Paimon: Kujou Sara seems pretty angry, huh. Looks like our Tenryou rebellion is successfully underway.
Traveler: The Shogun's Army is without a leader for now.
Paimon: Yup yup, let's catch up with her.
Yae Miko: Hold on, Traveler. There's something else we need to discuss.
Paimon: Huh?
Yae Miko: Last time you entered the Plane of Euthymia, it was in front of the Statue of the Omnipresent God, correct?
Traveler: Correct.
Yae Miko: You must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
Yae Miko: If you can get the Raiden Shogun to "open her heart" to you once more before the Statue of the Omnipresent God, you will have the opportunity you need...
Traveler: I will do my best.
Yae Miko: Take this with you as a farewell gift.
Paimon: What is it?
Yae Miko: The omamori from the Grand Narukami Shrine are very potent indeed. I thought I'd put one aside for you.
Traveler: Thank you...
Yae Miko: Hehe, if you find yourself at your wits' end, take it out and see what happens. Maybe your prayers will be answered, and all your problems will disappear in the blink of an eye.
Yae Miko: Or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? Who knows, maybe I'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
Paimon: Cut it out, Fox Lady. This isn't the time or place to be poking fun at the Traveler.
Yae Miko: Hehehe... I'm sorry. Well then... time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. I'm counting on you.
Traveler: I will treasure it.
Traveler: If we follow her, we might meet the Raiden Shogun.

## Talk 2

Kujou Sara: You followed me here? You've got guts, I'll give you that.
Kujou Sara: Since you are witnesses, I suppose I can shield you from arrest — at least until I have received an explanation from Takayuki.
Kujou Sara: But... if it turns out that you have been deceptive in this matter, then not only will you be arrested immediately, but you'll also be charged with one more crime. Do I make myself clear?
Traveler: Perfectly clear.
Kujou Sara: Hmph. Good.
Traveler: Lead the way.

## Talk 3

Kujou Takayuki: Stop! Sara, have you gone insane!? How dare you disregard my orders!
Kujou Sara: M—Master, I...
Paimon: Go on, ask him! Don't let him intimidate you!
Kujou Sara: ...Master Takayuki, I've seen the report to the throne and the letter to the Fatui... Please, tell me why!
Kujou Takayuki: So this is how my documents went missing from headquarters? You stole them...
Kujou Sara: Should I take your words to mean that... these documents were not forgeries? They were really penned by your own hand?
Kujou Sara: Please tell me, Master, I need to know... Has the Tenryou Commission really... betrayed the Shogunate!?
Kujou Takayuki: Hmph... Yes, I have dealings with the Fatui. And yes, the report you saw was penned by my hand.
Paimon: Heh, he just came right out and admitted it...
Kujou Takayuki: The diplomats from Snezhnaya promised a very generous reward indeed... and all they requested of me in return was to see that the Vision Hunt Decree is upheld.
Kujou Takayuki: For too long, the Kujou Clan's position has been coveted by so many. There is no shortage of clans who would tear us down at the first opportunity.
Kujou Takayuki: So, when the chance arose to gain the backing of another powerful nation and crack down on our enemies at the same time...
Kujou Takayuki: It appeared to me to be an excellent deal. I simply saw no need to inform you, Sara.
Kujou Sara: But... you worship the Shogun. How can you betray her after all this time and act like it's nothing!?
Kujou Takayuki: Betrayal? How can you call this a betrayal?
Kujou Takayuki: The Fatui may think they are using me, but the reverse is true. What could they possibly hope to achieve?
Kujou Takayuki: When the lightning strikes in Inazuma, they shall fall to their knees and tremble, paralyzed by fear and trepidation.
Kujou Takayuki: After all...
Kujou Takayuki: None can contend with the supreme power of the Almighty Raiden Shogun and the Musou no Hitotachi!
Traveler: His intention wasn't to betray the Raiden Shogun...
Paimon: Yeah... he doesn't worship the Raiden Shogun herself, but her power as a warrior — especially the Musou no Hitotachi. In fact, he seems to be way too into it...
Kujou Sara: But Master... what about loyalty?
Kujou Sara: Ever since I was adopted by the Kujou Clan, you taught me the importance of loyalty from servants to their superiors...
Kujou Sara: But it's clear to me now that you wanted my loyalties to stop with the Kujou Clan. So you were scared that I would betray you one day?
Kujou Sara: You hypocrite! Preaching about virtue just to mask your own wretched selfishness!
Kujou Takayuki: Selfishness? I am but safeguarding the eternity of the Kujou Clan. I'm quite sure the Almighty Shogun would be sympathetic to that, as would the former head of our clan.
Paimon: Hate to say it, but his ego is getting in the way. If he thinks the Kujou Clan is a match for the Fatui, Paimon thinks he's in for a nasty surprise...
Traveler: There is no point trying to argue with him.
Kujou Sara: I've doubted the Vision Hunt Decree in the past. I asked myself, is this truly the correct thing to do? Even though it goes against what I know in my heart to be right?
Kujou Sara: But I chose to obey the Shogun. For as long as she leads the way, who among us is qualified to judge between right and wrong when we have not yet reached the end of the path?
Kujou Sara: But now I realize that the path of eternity is one without end, while this path... it has long since been defiled by your selfish ways.
Kujou Sara: So, I'm going to tell the Shogun the truth about all this. If nothing else, my conscience will be clear!
Kujou Takayuki: Stubborn and futile...
Kujou Takayuki: Report to the Shogun if you so wish. The Kujou Clan's position is now unshakable, and nothing you can do will change this.
Kujou Takayuki: The Shogun is at <color=#00E1FFFF>Tenshukaku</color> receiving a Snezhnayan diplomat — the Harbinger by the name of "Signora."
Traveler: Signora!
Paimon: Signora's the one behind all this? Ugh, not her again!
Paimon: Way back in Ritou, Lady Hiiragi said something about the Kanjou Commissioner meeting with an arrogant-sounding woman... We should have known.
Kujou Sara: A diplomat from Snezhnaya? Well! If she thinks she's leaving Inazuma in one piece, she's got another thing coming!
Paimon: Sara stormed off... Do you think she's gonna go barge into Tenshukaku right now?
Traveler: Either way, we have a score to settle with Signora.
Paimon: You can say that again!
Paimon: Alright then! Let's do this!
Kujou Sara: We shall go up to <color=#00E1FFFF>Tenshukaku</color>!
Traveler: Let's see what Kujou Sara thinks.
Traveler: He's just over-confident in her power.
