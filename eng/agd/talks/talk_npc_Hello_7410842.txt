# Talk Dialog

Elphane: Hello.
Traveler: This aquabus is really...
Elphane: "The Court Region Waterway Hub and the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering are working to improve aquabus speed."
Traveler: I was going to say that it was "really beautiful."
Elphane: I'm glad you think so.
Traveler: But you haven't heard what I think of its speed yet...
Elphane: Dear passenger. Previous feedback data indicates that you will either find it too fast or too slow. The official response to either is the same.
Elphane: Of course, if you believe that its speed is "really perfect," then good. Thank you, on behalf of the Court Region Waterway Hub and the aquabus itself.
Traveler: Are you in a bad mood, Ms. Elphane?
Elphane: No. I simply...
Elphane: ...Sorry.
Elphane: Hmm... I'll be frank. If you just wish to experience the joys of an aquabus, I personally recommend that you ride the Clementine Line, for which Aeval is the guide.
Traveler: Could you tell me about Erinnyes?
Elphane: Recommended areas of visitation are the Fountain of Lucine and Opera Epiclese. Other than that, I do not recommend anything. Institute's ruins comprise the northern part of Erinnyes...
Traveler: Well, I'm an adventurer, so...
Elphane: You misunderstand. That area is indeed dangerous, and does also play host to out-of-control clockwork meka.
Elphane: However, the most potent threat present at the moment is the Institute Technicians. They can drone on for an entire day without giving you any information or expressing any perspective. Truly ghastly.
Elphane: Do not go to Erinnyes's depths.
Traveler: Why not?
Elphane: I apologize, but I do not know, either. This was Monsieur Neuvillette's suggestion, and I trust his wisdom.
Traveler: Is there anything else?
Traveler: See you.
Elphane: See you.
