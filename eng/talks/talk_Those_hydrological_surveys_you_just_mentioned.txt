Traveler: Those hydrological surveys you just mentioned...
Mermet: Oh, yeah... We need to do them because the underwater environment can sometimes shift, you know?
Mermet: Currents could cause a sunken ship to drift over and end up blocking one route, while the same currents might simultaneously open up another route that was previously impassable...
Mermet: To facilitate navigation, our harbor usually hires specialists every once in a while to conduct a comprehensive survey of the waters near Lumidouce Harbor.
Mermet: They create updated hydrological charts, which are then distributed to all the navigators.
Mermet: But for some reason, it's been forever and a day since the harbor last organized a hydrological survey. We've been navigating based on outdated charts and experience.
Mermet: That's why I almost got into serious hot water.
