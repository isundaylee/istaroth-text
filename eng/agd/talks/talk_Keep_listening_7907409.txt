# Talk Dialog

Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Clanche: Instead, he should have worked hard toward his true goal: to help plants sow seeds far afield, to lift the burden from the backs of trees, to carry rainwater along, and to remind people to perhaps wear a layer or two less.
Clanche: Only a north wind who completes their work in such a manner might be called brave.
Traveler: Does this story have anything to do with what you were saying before?
Clanche: It is absolutely related! It is fear of "mistakes" that holds the flying squirrels of our kingdom back from flight.
Clanche: They fear being embarrassed, fear missteps, fear accidentally crashing into something... Just like how the north wind was terrified of blowing it.
Clanche: Absolutely ridiculous! The only thing they should fear is the inability to master flight!
Clanche: *sigh* I really should've made them re-read "Brave Northerly Wind"... You know what? I should just print some new copies and hand them out.
Traveler: That sounds like a different kind of courage.
