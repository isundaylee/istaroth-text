Cava: Oh wait! I did see loads of strange, glittering rocks when I went out to play earlier!
Cava: But... When I came back to grab some tools, Granny Yvette stopped me. Said I was too young to be playing with pickaxes...
Cava: I think it was somewhere hereabouts. Wanna take a look?

Cava: Oh wait! I did see loads of strange, glittering rocks when I went out to play earlier! They were really pretty! Some were dark blue, and others, light blue.

Traveler: I haven't got time for that at the moment...
Cava: Oh, I get it, you're one of those "people with things to do," like my dad and mom.
Cava: Grandpa says that you shouldn't trouble people like that, so I won't bother you anymore. I'll play by myself.
Cava: I'm very good at that — even playing by myself can be a super fun thing!
Cava: Well, I guess it's Super Fun Thing Number 2. Number 1 is when Navia comes around!

Traveler: About the flood...
Cava: Frankly, I was terrified when the water level started rising! But I didn't even have time to react before Archenoul rushed over and took me away.
Cava: Once everything settled down, I thanked her three times, just like grandpa taught me!
Cava: I guess only the strong can become a hero like Archenoul, huh?
Cava: I have to work hard! I'll run! I'll jump! And I'll swim!

Traveler: Do you need me to tell her?
Cava: You know Navia? Awesome!
Cava: Hmm... Let me think... No, it's okay. Navia is one of those who "have things to do." If I disturb Navia, Grandpa would lecture me again.
Cava: But since you're Navia's friend, you're my friend, too! Have this! I won't take no for an answer!

Traveler: Tell me about Big Sis Navia...
Cava: She's the one the adults call the Boss.
Cava: But that sounds super serious. Makes her sound like some old guy smacking tables and yelling at people — that doesn't seem like Navia at all!
Cava: Whenever she's around, the town's a super lively place. Even the grown-ups laugh and are happy.
Cava: Sometimes she even brings some amazing clockwork toys back for Granny Yvette to look at.
Cava: The look on Granny's face when she sees them — y'know, the kind people have when they want to say something but hold back? It's pretty funny.
