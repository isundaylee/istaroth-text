# Ellin, the Wannabe Knight


## Talk 1

Ellin: Ugh, what a headache... What am I supposed to do about this?
Traveler: What are you up to?
Ellin: Practicing for the Knights of Favonius' tryouts!
Ellin: *sigh* But I'm nowhere near as powerful as Jean.
Ellin: I think it's better for me to focus on technique rather than power.
Ellin: For example, I was thinking about how to break all these wooden dummies in one fell swoop... I know they don't look that robust, but they're what I've got. My father went to a lot of trouble to get them for me, so I shouldn't complain.
Ellin: If you're at a loose end, fancy helping me think about how to tackle it?
Traveler: I'll mull it over.
Ellin: Sure, take your time. It's not like these dummies are going anywhere.
Ellin: Nor is my life going anywhere while I'm stuck trying to sort this out, ugh...
Ellin: At this distance, maybe the best solution would be for me to deal with one side and drop a bomb to deal with the other side.
Ellin: Haha, just kidding. I have no idea where I would even get a bomb from anyway.
Traveler: How about we give it a go together...
Ellin: You like team combat, then? Alright for some... always someone to help you out.
Ellin: For people like me, the best I can do is try and hold my own as a lone fighter.

## Talk 2

Ellin: How are you getting along? Had a eureka moment yet?
Traveler: Still thinking it over...
Ellin: Huh. I've met a few other Adventurers before. They were the same way.
Ellin: They fight monsters like pros, but they're hopelessly lost when it comes to trying to break a few wooden sticks.
Ellin: And they reinforce the wood like it's for building a storm shelter or something... Way overestimating their own strength.
Ellin: If they want a challenge so desperately, why don't they just go off into the wilderness and pick a fight with the biggest monster they can find?

## Talk 3

Ellin: Nailed it!
Ellin: Huh, I never even thought of trying that...
Ellin: Thanks! I'm gonna try it myself now.
