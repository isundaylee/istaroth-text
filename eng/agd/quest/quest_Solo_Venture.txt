# Solo Venture


## Talk 1

Jack: This is bad... This is really bad...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Jack: Oh, you're... the traveler. *sigh* You must have seen the storm that hit us, too. All of Mondstadt's a mess right now.
Jack: Cyrus said that we need to stop monsters from taking this opportunity to attack us. So he put out commissions for adventurers to scout their movements out.
Jack: My next commission was to observe the monsters around the Thousand Winds Temple, so I confirmed my tasking and left.
Jack: At the Temple, I saw a large group of monsters gathering together, and I tried to get a closer look...
Jack: But I didn't expect to be discovered almost immediately upon getting closer. If a passing adventurer hadn't come to my rescue, I wouldn't have made it.
Jack: We left the Thousand Winds Temple for fear of being attacked by more monsters, and came back to Mondstadt.
Jack: And that's when I realized... that I had left my Adventurer Handbook and map at the Temple.
Jack: But there's no way I can go to get it back like this...
Jack: Traveler, would you be willing to help me go to the Thousand Winds Temple and retrieve my map and Adventurer Handbook?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Jack: Thank you so much. *sigh* Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing...
Traveler: Why were you there in the first place...
Jack: Ugh, this is a bit embarrassing... Do you know of the Adventurer Rank Rating?
Jack: I thought that if I could show my stuff a bit more, I could get through the rating process safely.
Jack: But I never thought that... *sigh* Please, help me get my map and Adventurer Handbook back.
Jack: I need to be more careful in future...

## Talk 2

Jack: I need to be more cautious in the future.
Jack: But not too careful, because... *sigh*

## Talk 3

Jack: Did you manage to find them?
Traveler: Got them right here.
Jack: Whew, that's a relief. I've always been using this map, so I've put down a lot of markings onto it. Losing it would have been a disaster.
Jack: And if I had really lost my handbook, I don't know how I would have asked Katheryne for a new one.
Jack: I mean, what a joke, for an adventurer to lose their handbook during an adventure...
Jack: Thanks, I'll keep these things close from now on. Please take these as a token of my appreciation.
