# The Culling of the Worms: Body

Vinayak: You're here, adventurer. We were just about to make the necessary installations.
Vinayak: If all goes well, we'll be able to give that monster a good lesson to remember today!
Shriya: During the formal charging process, there may also be monsters who will try to disrupt the process. When that time comes, please keep an eye out for the charging progress and durability of the device.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Shriya: Thank you very much, adventurer.
Vinayak: Ah, I've got an idea! You've been busy running around helping with the Wenutslayer Cannon. The honor of testing it for the first time... should be yours!
Traveler: You don't want to do it yourself?
Vinayak: I'll be happy enough to watch the shots land! Besides, to let someone else light the fire, so that we can see the firing in all its glory... Ah! It speaks for itself!
Vinayak: All you have to do is protect the charging device from the monsters and wait for the energy to fill up. Watch for the moment when the Wenut reveals its vulnerable spot and then fire at it with all you've got!
Vinayak: The ignition and auto-correcting mechanisms will take care of the rest!
Paimon: #Sounds impressive. {NICKNAME}, Paimon also wants to watch!
Traveler: Okay, I'll handle it.
Vinayak: Alright, that's a deal, then! Let me tell you how it works...
Traveler: I have no idea how this thing works...
Vinayak: Relax! Its design perfectly follows the principles of user-friendliness.
Traveler: No problem.
