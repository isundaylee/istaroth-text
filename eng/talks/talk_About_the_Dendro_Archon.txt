Traveler: About the Dendro Archon...
Royinjan: *sigh* The Dendro Archon will always be our greatest god. The Akademiya's conduct up till now has been simply disgraceful.
Royinjan: She defended us from such calamities and left us an inexhaustible store of wisdom and treasure...
Royinjan: So, usually, when I see an antique related to her, I will do my best to buy it and add it to my collection.
