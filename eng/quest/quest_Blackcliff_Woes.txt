Manager Kuan: *sigh* Where did those monsters come from...

## Talk 2

Manager Kuan: What's the situation?
Traveler: It's full of monsters.
Manager Kuan: Is that so... *sigh* Then it seems like that work site can't be reopened.
Manager Kuan: I understand the situation. Please take this as thanks for your help.
Manager Kuan: But at this rate, our quotas are going to require some extensions.
Manager Kuan: Gah, I have to find some place where we can start work...
Traveler: It's full of Treasure Hoarders.
Manager Kuan: Treasure Hoarders? And lots of monsters too? Ugh...
Manager Kuan: Those Treasure Hoarders would really do anything for Mora, huh...
Manager Kuan: Then it does indeed seem like that work site can't be reopened.
