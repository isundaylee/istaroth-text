Traveler: Medicinal herbs?
Gurgen: My father was a herb farmer. After I survived a shipwreck, I came home to help grow herbs.
Gurgen: I was unable to go to sea due to the aftereffects of that shipwreck, so I reapplied for knowledge on growing herbs from the Akasha Terminal.
Gurgen: I survived only because of the immediate first aid. It was natural for me to support my father when he decided to provide herbs for Bimarstan for free.
Gurgen: If possible, I want to pass the examination to study medicine at the Akademiya.
