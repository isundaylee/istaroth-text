# Their Childhood: City Caper


## Talk 1

Verut: C'mon, brother, this way! We haven't seen that big house, have we?
Aurele: Take it slow, Verut, or you'll fall again. You too, Lovi. Your father says that you're in ill health, so you might catch a cold.
Lovi: Ugh, your brother's such a nag, just like my mom!
Verut: I know, right?
Aurele: You two...
Traveler: We meet again.
Lovi: Hey, it's you! Well, we're not playing hide-and-seek this time.
Aurele: More precisely, we're done playing... and we got an earful from Ms. Nour too.
Lovi: She's always so serious when she's at work, lecturing people left and right. And I even gave her biscuits in the past!
Lovi: Well, whatever, we were tired anyway. I was gonna take Verut and Aurele around to grab something delicious.
Lovi: Would you like to join us in our... Uh... What do we call it?
Aurele: A stroll.
Lovi: Yes, a stroll! Come with us!
Verut: Let's head to the plaza over there. I wanna see the fountain!
Traveler: Well then, lead the way, Miss.
Lovi: Alright then! Let's... head over to the plaza first. The fountains there are all very beautiful.
Traveler: Well, please lead the way, then.
Traveler: What are you doing?

## Talk 2

Verut: Wow... I'd just love to jump in and tread water or use the fountain to take a bath!
Aurele: And that'll get you scolded for sure. Just watch it from outside, please.
Verut: But if the fountains aren't for people to play in, then why are they so big?
Verut: They might look nice, but if you can only look at them, then they're just pools of ordinary water. Nothing to them!
Lovi: This is no ordinary fountain, you know. But... Wait, my dad did mention those ordinary fountains... What was it that he said again...?
Aurele: "The main purpose of city beautification projects in the Court of Fontaine is to solve tax declaration issues in a flexible fashion."
Aurele: Mr. Delerue was explaining this to me.
Lovi: Hah, you even sounded like my father back there. No wonder he likes you, Aurele. I mean, he always takes that stack of books with him when he talks to you.
Verut: I didn't understand a word of that, but I bet my brother's killing the mood again.
Verut: Lovi, let's find another place to play. I mean, you don't have to study today for once, right?
Lovi: Alright, let's go see some other places. Let me think... The Steambird should still be open. Let's go over there!

## Talk 3

Aurele: So this is The Steambird? It... doesn't look all that special, really.
Traveler: A most ordinary place, yes.
Verut: Wow, so they really do have a machine bird here! Cool!
Lovi: Right? My father often takes me here to purchase a newspaper.
Lovi: He absolutely loves The Steambird. In fact, he could spend all day just reading the newspaper. Sometimes, he even cuts pieces out and sticks them in a book he keeps.
Lovi: He calls those his "reviews," and sometimes, he even reads them out to my mother and me.
Lovi: We don't really like hearing them, though. We just say "yeah," and "oh," and "is that so?" and stuff, but he enjoys reading them so much that he doesn't even notice.
Traveler: And what does he mean by "review"?
Aurele: Simply put, a review is a set of opinions that the reviewer expresses from their own perspective.
Aurele: Lovi's father, Delerue, is a scientist at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Aurele: At the same time, he's also a "reviewer" who writes "reviews" on The Steambird.
Lovi: Yeah, and he sure loves his lengthy reviews of... well, everything.
Lovi: Sometimes, he'll think of something as he talks, and he'll rush into his room to scribble a draft. He won't even eat while he's at it. He just drinks tea.
Verut: Huh. You can make Mora just by giving your opinion?
Aurele: That alone won't make you a "reviewer." You need to follow some principles if you want to write a review that others will acknowledge...
Lovi: Um... Uh... Well, anyone hungry?
Lovi: Mr. Louis told me that he's been selling Bulle Fruit-flavored fries recently. Let's go and try some. It'll be my treat!
Verut: Oh... yeah, sure! C'mon, brother, stop rambling. Let's go!
Aurele: You two...
Traveler: There is nothing all that special about it, yeah.

## Talk 4

Lovi: Mr. Louis! I'd like a few servings of Bulle Fruit-flavored fries!
Louis: Ah, if it isn't Lovi! I'm afraid I'm out of Bulle Fruit for the day. There were too many people at the port, you see...
Lovi: Bâ€”But I told you about this a while back, didn't I? And I even brought some friends with me...
Louis: *sigh* I'm sorry. There were too many customers today, and I forgot... I do have some ordinary fries here, though. Please, take them on the house.
Lovi: Alright, then. Thanks, Mr. Louis...
Traveler: Are you just missing Bulle Fruit?
Louis: Well, if you can provide me with some, I could make the sauce right away. I do have some of the other condiments left over...
Lovi: Yay! You're just awesome!
Verut: Thanks!
Aurele: I'm very sorry. It seems that we always trouble you somehow whenever we meet...
Traveler: No need to be so formal.
Aurele: Alright then. I need to learn from you. Mr. Delerue says that I'm too stolid, which will make becoming a reviewer in the future hard...
Aurele: *cough* Never mind that. I'll watch over the two of them. As for the Bulle Fruit, we're counting on you.
Traveler: Let's not get everyone down over this.
Traveler: I could fetch you some Bulle Fruit.

## Talk 5

Louis: Have you brought the Bulle Fruit?

## Talk 6

Louis: These should do. Please give me a moment...
Black Screen Text: Louis starts making Bulle Fruit sauce...
Louis: And we're done! These fresh-from-the-oven fries are on the house. You can eat them right away, but be careful, they're hot!
Lovi: Nice! Tuck in, all of you. They're great!
Lovi: Oh, and Aurele, don't tell my father about this, or he'll lecture me again...
Aurele: Heh. Don't worry. In any case, I doubt Mr. Delerue is all that interested in fries.
Verut: Well... what about me?
Aurele: You just eat up. As for my share, you can split it amongst yourselves. I don't really like eating fries.
Verut: Hehehe, in that case, I'll help myself! C'mon, here, you should try some too. This is all thanks to you, hehe!
Aurele: Ah, right, I have to go buy Mr. Delerue some coffee later...
Lovi: Wait, you can't do that! Mom has banned Dad from drinking coffee for a long time now.
Lovi: Every time he drinks coffee, he will cough non-stop in his room. He even goes hoarse in the process.
Lovi: Dad says that he does all this for work, but what sort of work makes you suffer like that?
Aurele: ...Is this the "price" he mentioned for writing excellent reviews?
Aurele: The work of a reviewer sure seems hard...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lovi: Is your brother always so serious? I've never seen him smile...
Verut: Not in the past, but he started becoming like this ever since he started reading with your dad. Now, he's always frowning, and I don't know what he's thinking.
Lovi: Urgh, that really does sound just like my dad. Mom says that it's like he's always wrestling with something.
Verut: But what is he wrestling with? Did he argue with your mother or something?
Lovi: No, they never argue!
Verut: Adults are so weird...

### Additional Talk 2

Aurele: Sorry for bothering you. I'll take care of them here. Someone's gotta stop them from running off...
Aurele: If I can become a reviewer for The Steambird, I'll be able to earn an income...
Aurele: But Mr. Delerue said that if I wanted to become a reviewer, I can't prize Mora too much. Otherwise, I'll start down the wrong path.
Aurele: But I really do need the Mora... What should I do... *sigh*
