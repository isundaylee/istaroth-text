Traveler: Handling fee?
Yurika: Of course. If you need to get something done, a handling fee is necessary.
Yurika: As for how much it is going to be... It depends on your reason for staying in Inazuma.
Yurika: The more urgent and more important the matter is, the more attention the Outlander Affairs Agency will pay. But of course, the required fee had best match that level of urgency, right?
