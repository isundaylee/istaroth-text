# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I've not heard. What do other people say?
Milu Nui: *sigh*... Well, everyone agrees. That's why Pakaa keeps moving my records from the popular section to the children's section.
Milu Nui: Really, shouldn't a musician have the right to say what genre of music their work is supposed to be?
Milu Nui: Besides, if you really think about it, I'm Pakaa's uncle! That brat, no respect for his elders...
Milu Nui: Ah well, there's no point continuing to be mad at him. He rarely listens to what I have to say, but at least he's got a knack for running a store.
