Ganyu: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. How have you been recently?
Ganyu: I hope everything's going well for you. Don't be like me, worrying all the time...
Ganyu: Oh, uh... it's nothing though, just... as you can see, there's a lot going on during the Lantern Rite, and I was originally supposed to head back to Yujing Terrace to assist with the preparations...
Ganyu: However, Lady Ningguang urged me to take a proper vacation. She said that there's nothing so urgent that it can't wait, and that this festival is a time to reconnect with friends and family...
Ganyu: But if I really spent this vacation with Cloud Retainer, it wouldn't be long before she started asking me "How has your career developed this year?" "Any new crushes one should know about?"...
Traveler: Oof, I can imagine...
Ganyu: Yes... I can handle overtime, but not that...
Ganyu: Besides that... I do feel better getting some of this off my chest. So... thank you for being here and listening to me.
Traveler: Seriously though... Got a crush on anyone at the moment?
Ganyu: What theâ€” Don't you start that as well!
