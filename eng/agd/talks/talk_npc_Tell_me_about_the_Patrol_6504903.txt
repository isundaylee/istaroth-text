# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about the Patrol...
Riqueti: The Patrol's membership is highly streamlined, picking only the best of the best, regardless of any member's past.
Riqueti: Even if they are the children of criminals and thus of ill repute, they can join the Patrol so long as they have the ability.
Riqueti: This sounds funny, but the Patrol is the least mechanized section of the Gardes.
Riqueti: If you asked the present Captain, Chevreuse, about that, she'd say, "Gardemeks will only block our bullets!"
