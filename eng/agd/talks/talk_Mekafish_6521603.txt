Traveler: Mekafish?
Damestier: Hello, Honorary Senior Researcher. I mean the ones swimming about in the water.
Damestier: I was part of the research team that developed them. The original idea was to have them clean up trash and junk from the water.
Damestier: But a few problems emerged during development, and the Mekafish started treating everything that wasn't the water itself as "junk" and cleaning it all up...
Damestier: We planned to turn them off remotely and retrieve them, then figure out what the problem was... But we never imagined the Institute would... y'know, explode...
