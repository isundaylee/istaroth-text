# Meow... Meow meow? Meow! Meow.


## Talk 1

Sareh: Meow— *cough*...
Traveler: Uh, what are you doing...?
Sareh: I'm looking for my kittens. Normally, they respond to my call.
Sareh: Is my pronunciation off today somehow? I've been calling them for ages, and none of them have answered. How strange...
Traveler: Can't you just call their names?
Paimon: Yeah. Don't people usually call kittens' names when looking for them, right?
Sareh: But if you call for them in our language, they can't understand it, can they?
Paimon: Eh? Well, you do have a point there...
Sareh: Still, I'm getting nowhere shouting myself hoarse like this.
Sareh: Traveler, I'd like to ask you a serious question.
Traveler: Leave it to me...
Sareh: ...Would you like to learn the language of cats?
Traveler: What?
Paimon: Eh?
Paimon: You mean you're gonna teach us how to talk to cats?
Traveler: The payment should be...
Traveler: What did you mean by "your pronunciation today" being off, anyway?
Sareh: Well, I was calling their names, actually, just in the language of cats.
Sareh: After all, they wouldn't necessarily understand if we called them in our language, right?
Paimon: Eh? Well, you do have a point there...

## Talk 2

Sareh: Oh, you brought the kitten back. Thank you so much.
Sareh: Well, it looks like you are doing pretty well with cat-talk.
Sareh: Here, please take this as compensation.
Sareh: There aren't many people who can pick up cat language this fast. You know... I could even use your help in the future.
Traveler: Meow!
Paimon: Hey, you can speak normally. Ms. Sareh is not a cat!
Sareh: I can see from your face that you were trying to say "my pleasure," but your pronunciation still has room for improvement, I think.
Sareh: It's okay though. I'll keep teaching you about cat language. We'll learn together!

### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Well, I've spoken to cats before...
Paimon: You mean Neko? But she can speak our language. That doesn't really count as "cat-talk"...
Sareh: Indeed. Still, in exchange, you will need to help me find a cat.
Traveler: No problem.
Sareh: So you agree? Why, thank you so much!
Sareh: Ahem... Now, listen carefully. This is the outline of cat language that I've been working on for a long time.
Traveler: Looks like each city has its unique way of looking for cats...
Paimon: Heh, that's true! If you think about it, we've helped people find cats in quite a few cities by now...
Paimon: Should we say that everyone just loves cats, or that everyone who owns a cat has the same problem?

### Additional Talk 3

Sareh: The one that has slipped out today is a black and white cat called "Lale."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow, meow meow meow, meeeeow!"
Sareh: Keep in mind how the tone falls and then rises again. Make sure that the last "meow" is very high.
Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Please wait just a moment.

### Additional Talk 4

Sareh: The one that has slipped out for snacks today is a dark gray cat called "Nargis."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow! Meow meow, meow."

Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment.

### Additional Talk 5

Sareh: The one that has slipped out for a date today is a gray and black striped cat called "Rozan."
Sareh: In cat language, you would call for it by saying... "Meow meow meow, meow meow meow."
Sareh: Both sets of meows are quick sounds, so make sure you don't drawl.
Sareh: Actually... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment, will you?

### Additional Talk 10

Sareh: Eh? You didn't find the cat?
Black Screen Text: You tell Sareh what happened...
Sareh: Is that so? Well, it's okay. Cat language is not easy for beginners, after all.
Sareh: I'll go find them myself later. Still, thank you for the trouble. Please take these as your payment, Traveler.

### Additional Talk 11

Sareh: Do you have any further questions, Traveler?
Traveler: Could you help me with the cat's name in their language...
Sareh: That's on the note I wrote for you. Please refer to it if your memory fails you.
Traveler: You don't seem too worried about them.
Sareh: Well, people in town love the cats. They often play with them and feed them.
Sareh: I'm just hoping that they don't eat too much and get overweight.
