Traveler: About your homeland...
Oda Tarou: My homeland is Seirai Island. Every generation of my family has resided there. Later on, we were relocated by the Shogunate alongside the other residents on the island to the Narukami Island.
Oda Tarou: There are many descendants of the Seirai Island locals in Inazuma now. I remember, for instance, that Miss Fujiwara's ancestors were from Seirai as well.
