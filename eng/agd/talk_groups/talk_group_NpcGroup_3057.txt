Traveler: Who are you?
Okawara Goemon: You don't even know who I am? Ignorant outlander.
Okawara Goemon: I'm the Chief Samurai of the Tenryou Commission. I'm in charge of the security of the Kujou Clan.
Okawara Goemon: Everyone knows that I am the best swordsman in Inazuma. You better not try any mischief in front of me.

Traveler: You're the best in Inazuma?
Okawara Goemon: That's right. I have always pursued perfection in my swordsmanship, and I have already reached that perfect state.
Okawara Goemon: As far as I am concerned, the best swordsmanship requires you to rely on your own strength, not some heretical Vision.
Okawara Goemon: My fellow students couldn't even scratch me with their elemental powers. I even managed to seize their Visions. What a bunch of clowns!
Okawara Goemon: Oh? Are you also a swordsman without a Vision? Not bad. If you keep up with your training and somehow become one thousandth the swordsman that I am, I'd say that you've done pretty well for yourself.
