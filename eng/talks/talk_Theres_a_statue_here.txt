Paimon: There's a statue here?
Paimon: *sigh*...
Paimon: Hey there, why are you sighing alone at this cavern entrance?
Paimon: Well, I've been living here lately...
Paimon: You've been living in a place like this!?
Paimon: I didn't have a choice! A bunch of actors came to the island and started making a racket all day and all night. I couldn't even sleep because of them... So I found myself a quieter spot.
Paimon: But then a group of hilichurls came out of nowhere and occupied my resting place. So I had no choice but to brave the elements out here!
Paimon: *sigh* I swore to myself that if someone could help me, I'd tell them...
Paimon: Tell them what?
Paimon: Tell them about a clue to finding the legendary Secret Pirate Treasure! Although I only know a quarter of it...
Paimon: A quarter of a clue?
Paimon: You seem like you're here for the treasure too. So, what do you say? Get rid of the hilichurls in there and I'll give you the clue's location.
Paimon: They say that if you collect all four parts of the clue, you can find the treasure that pirates left behind here!
Paimon: Well, you have a deal!
