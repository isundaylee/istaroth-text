Traveler: The Communications Office?
Fangju: If you want to better understand our duties, it might be best to consult the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I am just a lowly staff member, after all.
Fangju: To the best of my knowledge, our office is mainly responsible for transportation in Liyue. We are also involved, where appropriate, with related construction and road management, which is why we have a rather large number of staff.
Fangju: Good road networks, bridges, waterways, and docks are critical to transporting goods to various locations in Liyue, after all.
Fangju: Regardless of whether you're interested in traveling with a caravan, or have some talent in architecture, you're welcome to consider becoming an employee.
Fangju: And like me, enjoy the nice stable, peaceful life of an employee here in the office. It's not bad.
Fangju: Of course, the Office also conducts monthly performance evaluations to discourage negligence...
Fangju: So if you want to keep working here, you'll have to constantly improve yourself.
