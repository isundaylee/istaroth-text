Traveler: What are you doing?
Kimiya: Lately, I've been studying something called "Alchemical Divination."
Kimiya: You rely on intuition to randomly choose some things to conduct alchemy on. If it fails — and, of course, most of the time it does fail — the ashes are used in divination.
Kimiya: It's pretty much the same principle as divination of coffee grounds or leftover tea leaves.
Kimiya: I've noticed that the girls in my class are really interested in that sort of thing, so there's no reason that Alchemical Divination shouldn't be just as popular, right?
