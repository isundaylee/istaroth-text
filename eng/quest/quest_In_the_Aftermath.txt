# In the Aftermath


## Talk 1

Huffman: There's still so much cleaning up to do...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Huffman: As I'm sure you're aware, we faced continuous attacks from bands of monsters for the entire duration of the Stormterror incident.
Huffman: Although the Stormterror incident is now resolved, and we've successfully fended off the monsters...
Huffman: The monsters erected quite a substantial number of barricades outside the city over the course of their raids.
Huffman: So while the monsters themselves have been fought back... these barricades aren't about to disappear of their own accord.
Huffman: We can't just leave them here indefinitely, especially now that things are returning to business as usual in the city.
Huffman: Unfortunately, the Knights are short-staffed and there's simply no one to take on the task. As our Honorary Knight, would you be willing to clear up the barricades?

## Talk 2

Traveler: It is my honor to serve.
Huffman: Spoken like a true member of the Knights of Favonius! Honorary Knight, you have my gratitude.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Sorry, I have something else on...
Huffman: Well, I don't doubt that you must have far more important matters to attend to. In which case, never mind, I shall have to think of something else.

## Talk 4

Huffman: *sigh* If we just had a couple more people on hand...
Traveler: What are the other knights doing?
Huffman: Maintaining the city's defenses, helping with the rebuilding effort, and a whole host of other odd jobs.
Huffman: Every last knight we have is up to their eyeballs in work right now.
Huffman: For once, guard duty at the main gate is the relatively easy job.
Traveler: You could solicit help from the Adventurers' Guild.
Huffman: In fact, we're lucky to have had their assistance from the outset. At first, they were helping find and rescue victims in the city, more recently they've been keeping watch on monster activity further afield.
Huffman: When the monsters began gathering near to the city, it was thanks to the adventurers who carried out early reconnaissance and reported back to us that we were able to make specific and effective plans for the defense effort.
Huffman: Even now, they are hard at work supporting all our efforts to get the city back on its feet. Honestly, without them, the Knights would be starting to crumble under the load.
Huffman: I must make time to thank Cyrus properly...

## Talk 5

Huffman: How's your progress? Finished clearing the area yet?
Traveler: All done.
Huffman: Fantastic. You've been an enormous help, who knows how much longer those ugly things would've been stood there otherwise...
Huffman: Honorary Knight, please accept these as an expression of my gratitude.
