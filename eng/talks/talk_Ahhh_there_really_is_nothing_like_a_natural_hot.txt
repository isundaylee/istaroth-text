Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Ahhh, there really is nothing like a natural hot spring!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The tingly wingly sensation of a steady stream of bubbles against your body â€” it defies description!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "It would be ideal if we could put up some more signs showing the exact temperatures of each hot spring, so guests could choose the ones that suit them best..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Dear visitor, many thanks for your valuable suggestion. In line with our usual practice, we will first observe how the Koholasaur youngsters react before deciding if the water temperature is suitable for our foreign visitors."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Thanks to your suggestion, we'll make it our aim to ensure that a little Koholasaur is stationed in each hot spring in the future!"
