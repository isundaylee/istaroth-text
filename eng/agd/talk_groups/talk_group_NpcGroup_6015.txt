Tizoc: *sigh* It's always like this... So embarrassing...

Traveler: What happened?
Tizoc: Ah, well, I'm a supplier who delivers ingredients for Ms. Chanca every so often.
Tizoc: But even though all I do is help carry things around from time to time, she always insists that I stay for a meal.
Tizoc: The issue is, I have quite the appetite... So I always feel guilty eating here without paying.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Tizoc: *sigh* See you then.

Traveler: Your boss seems like the nice sort.
Tizoc: Yeah, that's just how Ms. Chanca is.
Tizoc: Did you know that she used to be a top-ranking warrior in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame?
Tizoc: But she was forced to retire after seriously injuring her leg in the Night Warden Wars.
Tizoc: Many people used to come here on her reputation's account, but she never liked them making all that fuss.
Tizoc: On that note, I suppose I shouldn't say too much either. All I'll say is, she's a very reliable owner, and this is a great place to come to.
