Traveler: Are you... sleeping with your eyes open?
Marvin: I was... until you woke me up!
Marvin: This is an act, you know. Something to fool my family, so that this night's rendezvous will not be exposed... Ahem.
Marvin: It's very impolite to wake someone when they're sleeping, so please refrain from doing it again. You won't find me to be as agreeable as my father... *yawn*
