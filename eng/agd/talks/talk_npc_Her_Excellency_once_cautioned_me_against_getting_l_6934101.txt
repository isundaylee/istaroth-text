Gorou: Her Excellency once cautioned me against getting lost in the heat of the battle. She said that while being fierce, courageous, and doggedly determined are good traits to have when you're leading an army, if you always throw yourself into the fray without keeping a level head, there will come a day when it backfires on you.
Gorou: So I think that whenever there's a break between battles, it's important to take a chance to calm down and collect your thoughts.
Gorou: You have to stand as firm as a mountain and burn as bright as a raging fire. That's the gold standard for any army, don't you think?
