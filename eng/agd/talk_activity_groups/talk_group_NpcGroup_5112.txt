## Talk

Navayi: Allow me to guess. The next one should be... a trial?

## Talk

Traveler: Hello there.
Navayi: Ah, hello! I'm a traveling scholar from Sumeru, and not a local. Pleased to meet you.
Navayi: I don't know how much you know about Fontaine, but I'm still in the process of understanding it myself.
Navayi: You see, Sumeru is a nation ruled by scholars, while Fontaine is a nation led by judges — and their social structures are immensely different.
Navayi: Not a bad research direction, eh?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm not entirely sure, sorry.
Navayi: Don't worry. I'm not trying to grill you — I'm just making a guess.

## Talk

Traveler: I think it's worth further study.
Navayi: That's my view as well, and I think so even now.
Navayi: Still, I must say that the events that have occurred in this opera house have really given me pause. Who would've thought that trials and theater could occupy the same space?
Navayi: This would have been inconceivable in Sumeru.
Navayi: But if you think about this another way, the causes of this situation would also serve as a good research topic...

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to your thoughts...
Navayi: It's okay. Thoughts are supposed to be exchanged through communications, no?
Navayi: Thank you for talking to me.
Navayi: Let me see... I only have some food brought from the Court of Fontaine. If you don't mind, please accept it as a greeting gift.
