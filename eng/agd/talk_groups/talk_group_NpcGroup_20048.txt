Read: "Here stood Taishan Mansion, established by royal decree. ...But the Geo Lord wished for his residence to remain among the people of Liyue; hence, all trace of the path to that divine place was lost in the mortal realm. Now, the hidden treasure of Taishan is engulfed in water. At the sight of these words, people should leave immediately, as they should at the sight of the adeptus."
Paimon: So this inscription means... Well, Paimon didn't get all of it... but it seems like there's treasure hiding somewhere in a body of water!
Paimon: So is there anywhere around here that water might come out?
