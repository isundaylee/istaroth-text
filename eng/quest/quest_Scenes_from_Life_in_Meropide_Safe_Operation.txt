# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Safe Operation


## Talk 1

Caterpillar: No one comes here anymore after the Geode Mine Shaft was closed, and the devices here aren't meant for just anyone to handle.
Caterpillar: And that's exactly what happened this time. Someone tinkered with the drive valve and trapped their own companion.
Caterpillar: Anyway, let's get it to open up the passage to <color=#00E1FFFF>Supply Warehouse 1</color>. By the way, if they offer you a drink, you'd best say no.
Paimon: Who's going to offer us a drink? And why won't we taking it?
Caterpillar: You'll find out soon enough.

## Talk 2

Caterpillar: Mitul, are you alright? I hope you weren't trapped for too long.
Mitul: My savior! You're finally here!
Mitul: Where's Koblenz? He's not with you?
Caterpillar: He told me about trapping you here and asked for my help, but he left because a guard interrupted us.
Mitul: I knew he wasn't reliable! He probably ran away because he felt guilty.
Mitul: I mean, how do you make money in business if you don't take risks?
Mitul: He was clumsy, and too cautious, to boot... I mean, Pure Water is one thing, but even Fonta is available nowadays.
Mitul: If Fonta is here, how are we supposed to survive?
Paimon: Oh...
Mitul: What, you like Fonta too?
Traveler: Don't you like Fonta?
Mitul: I do! I have to admit, it's a formidable rival...
Mitul: Anyway, I have to settle this with Koblenz. By the way, has he paid you?
Caterpillar: Nope.
Mitul: ...Sometimes I want to stuff him in a large bucket. That'll make him reflect on what he's done. Anyway, please take these Coupons.
Caterpillar: Take them, you two, if you would.
Paimon: What? You want us to take all of it?
Caterpillar: Of course.
Paimon: Thank you, then. We can go to the Rag and Bone Shop later to see if they have anything new.
Mitul: By the way, I'd like to apologize for dragging you into this. I have some fresh health drinks â€” would you like a bottle?
Paimon: Fresh... health drinks?
Mitul: Yup! Healthier than Pure Water, in fact!
Traveler: I'll take one.
Paimon: (Hey, didn't Caterpillar tell you to not take one?)
Paimon: #No, {NICKNAME} didn't mean it! We already had a lot of drinks before coming here.
Paimon: But Paimon bets these drinks are good! We'll make sure to try one next time.
Mitul: Bad timing, huh? Well, come back when you get a chance. It'll be my treat!
Mitul: Anyway, I must go talk to Koblenz now.
Caterpillar: I have something else to take care of, so I need to get going. Don't worry too much about the Coupons. <color=#00E1FFFF>I'll put the clues I come across on the blackboard</color>. Let's meet up later.
Paimon: See you later!
Traveler: I'll have a Fonta, please.
Mitul: Well, I have that, too. Wait. Do you have a problem with my healthy drinks? Let me tell you...
Paimon: #That's not what {NICKNAME} meant! It's just that we... had lots of drinks before coming here.
Traveler: It's just about alright.
Mitul: A customer with taste, I see.
