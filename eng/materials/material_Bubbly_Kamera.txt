# "Bubbly Kamera"

When used, this useful gadget can save and store the scenery before it and add a special color tone to it.
A strange device of unknown origin. The photos it takes have a peculiar effect. Who would've thought that a machine with no water inside could produce photos with jovial bubbles in them that lend them a sense of fantasy?
A certain Cavalry Captain once described this machine as being able to "capture people's desire for cool and refreshing days."
