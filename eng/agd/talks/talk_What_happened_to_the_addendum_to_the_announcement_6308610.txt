Traveler: What happened to the addendum to the announcement?
Hiiragi Chisato: The Matsuura Clan have already sent someone to handle that. Currently, everyone thinks that it was all a big misunderstanding.
Hiiragi Chisato: There are still some ill-favored rumors going about, but I believe that they will disappear given time.
Hiiragi Chisato: I will keep a close eye on that. Hopefully, nothing similar happens in the future.
