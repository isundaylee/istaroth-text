Traveler: Ah, so you're an outlander as well?
Nathan: I'm from Mondstadt. My travels brought me to Inazuma.
Nathan: I've witnessed the tyranny of the Shogunate and the sufferings of its people. Such things would have never been condoned in my hometown, Mondstadt.
Nathan: That's why I joined up with the Sangonomiya resistance and pledged to fight for freedom.
Nathan: I never thought that the resistance, which was disadvantaged in every way, could actually bring the Shogunate to the negotiating table, and even abolish the Vision Hunt Decree. Now that's a cause for celebration!
Nathan: I guess that's the power of freedom for you, haha!
