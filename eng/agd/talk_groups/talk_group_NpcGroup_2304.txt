## Talk 1

Dongdong: Yeeeaaah! I beat someone from outside our village! I'm gonna tell Daddy all about this one. He'll be so pleased!

## Talk 2

Dongdong: Wow, you're invincible... Don't tell anyone you beat me, though. Especially not anyone from the Crux Fleet!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Good luck, you can do it.
Dongdong: Thanks! You're one of the few people in the village to encourage me!
Dongdong: All the other villagers say I'll never become a big hero like my dad, because I don't drink my milk...
Dongdong: But who says heroes have to drink milk? That stuff tastes so weird.
Dongdong: Still, it'd be a shame to let it all go to waste... Why don't you take it instead?
Dongdong: Just don't tell anyone, okay!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Do you where Little Liu is?
Dongdong: Little Liu? We were going to meet here to watch the meteorites, but she said that she wanted to find someplace higher.
Dongdong: She said that she'd tell me once she found our new spot, but I don't know where she's gone.

Dongdong: Wow, cool! You must have been to sooo many cool places and seen sooo many cool things!
Dongdong: My dad's a sailor with The Crux! They travel all around the world and go on adventures every day. He's a real hero!
Dongdong: He doesn't come home much, but he always sends me letters about the coolest, most exciting things that happen on his journeys. Hee-hee!
Dongdong: When I'm older, I'm gonna join The Crux Fleet too! Then I'll be able to see all that stuff for myself! How cool will that be!?
