Traveler: About the Corps of Thirty...
Rukh Shah: The Corps of Thirty is probably among the oldest Eremites in Sumeru. The name came from its thirty founders.
Rukh Shah: We're currently responsible for Sumeru's defenses. Most tasks are assigned by the Akademiya, in addition to those from civilians.
Rukh Shah: Unlike other Eremites, its members wear a green scarf. Feel free to seek assistance from us in town.
Rukh Shah: But once you're out of town, watch out for the other Eremites. Even if you're in Port Ormos. They might not have good intentions.
