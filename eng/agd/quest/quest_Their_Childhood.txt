## Talk 3

## Talk 4

Verut: Whoa! You found me! Did my brother tell you about this spot!?
Verut: Bah, alright, guess you're pretty good at this. I'm going to our meeting place.

## Talk 5

Aurele: When will Verut grow up... *sigh*
Traveler: Not hiding?
Aurele: I never really intended to. If Verut didn't bother me as often as he does, I would prefer to read my books for a while more.
Aurele: Our parents work so hard, so I've got to grow up fast and help lighten their load.
Aurele: But Verut keeps saying that he misses Mom, so I have to accompany him. That way, he'll stop crying for a bit.
Aurele: Sorry, I've said too much. I'll be waiting at our meeting spot.
Aurele: I can only hope that Verut won't dirty his clothes this time...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Verut: #Hey! Did you tell him about my spot? How did he find me that quickly?
Aurele: I've told you this before. Your hiding spots are way too obvious.
Traveler: Experience is on my side, I fear.
Verut: Really? In that case, will you come over next time too? Could we play together again?
Verut: Our parents aren't at home in the day, and my big brother's always reading... No one has time to play...
Aurele: Well, you can do what I do and read the books on the shelves. That's a lot more useful than playing hide-and-seek.
Verut: Well... I'd rather go look for Mom and learn sewing from her...
Traveler: I'm very good at hide-and-seek.
