Traveler: Sorry, who's Moo?
Inna: He's a little Saurian from our tribe.
Inna: Ahh, he's not around here. Probably back at home playing with his new friend.
Inna: I think she's a kid from Fontaine. She's the wee small sort, and has a very cute nose...
Inna: Hehe, she's not a human and can't understand a word of what Moo's saying, but she seems to be getting along with him just fine.
Inna: I hope she stays a while to help Moo come out of his shell...
