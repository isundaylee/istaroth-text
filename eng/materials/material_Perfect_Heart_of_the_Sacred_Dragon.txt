# Perfect Heart of the Sacred Dragon

A flawless piece of jade. Before the fires of human civilization had ever been kindled, it was the heart of the Dragonlord Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L, ruler of Chichen Uctokah.
It once held the authority to command all devices within Ochkanatlan, the ineffable city, yet can no longer be used due to its energy having been completely exhausted.
Just as with the half-humans who pursued it so relentlessly, the Dragonlord's quest for perfection was ultimately in vain, leading to naught but an end that was as cold and lifeless as jade.
