Traveler: What is it?
Hamawi: He's not a child anymore. That Jut is even younger, but he has already settled down. He is just fooling around all day with nothing to do.
Hamawi: Even if he could apply for some technical information from the Akasha Terminal like his brother and use it to find a steady job, that would be fine.
Hamawi: But instead, he whiles away the day thinking about all that dangerous and unreliable stuff, and the moment he gets any money in hand, he runs straight to the Exchange. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him...
Hamawi: What do you think? How can I get those adventurers to stay away from my son?
