## Talk 1

Shitoki: It's not enough... Not enough at all...
Shitoki: The treasure that Brother left me is in those conches...
Shitoki: But they've been scattered, aye, they've been scattered all over...
Shitoki: It's Brother's treasure. I can't leave yet, no, no...
Traveler: Treasure...?
Shitoki: He went out into the Sea of Fog, and that made the priest really angry. The priest said that my older brother's spirit would never be able to return...
Shitoki: But Brother said that "there are lovely flowers there and seas with pearls. Father rows a boat there, and he and our little sister wave to us..."
Shitoki: He left his treasure behind when he went out to sea, and he never returned.
Traveler: What's this I heard about a brother...

## Talk 2

Shitoki: No, no, I cannot leave. Not before I find his treasure...

## Talk 3

Shitoki: Ah, I see, I see. So that's where the treasure was! Thank you so much.
Shitoki: Though we won't be able to go to the land of dreams together, I'm sure I'll be able to turn into motes of light and return to look for you...
Shitoki: Do strange spirits wandering in a strange land also dream, I wonder?
