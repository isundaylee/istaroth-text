Traveler: About the fruits and vegetables...
Eugenie: We produce lots of Bulle Fruit locally, but with our advanced water routes, we can import many fruits from outside as well — they'll just cost a little extra.
Eugenie: But don't you fret. I, Eugenie, will commit no fraudulent act. Every fruit you buy is one hundred percent delicious. Not a single bad apple amongst them!
