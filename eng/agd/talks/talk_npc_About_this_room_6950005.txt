Traveler: About this room...
Wolfy: Madame Mage has said before, that this is the room "before the story begins and after the story ends." That's why guests have all the time they need to do whatever they'd like.
Wolfy: In addition, feel free to try out any of the furnishings you'd like! Whether changing the music, or divining fortunes, it's all "self-serve."
Wolfy: Though very convenient, it sure doesn't leave much for me to do as the concierge... *sigh*
Wolfy: Speaking of which, Madame Mage is really amazing! She can see the path of fate in the starry reflections. So, you should be really satisfied with the divination service she proposed, right?
