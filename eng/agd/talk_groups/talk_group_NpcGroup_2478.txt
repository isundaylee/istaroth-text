Traveler: Your business is really prospering!
Baishu: You're too kind! I was merely lucky to ride the wave of industrial upgrading.
Baishu: Once upon a time, I was a very ordinary tea farmer who grew mediocre tea.
Baishu: It's all thanks to the inspiration I received from Master Jiuguan that my fortunes took a drastic change for the better!
Baishu: When the primary tea-making equipment in Chenyu Vale was being upgraded from classic tea cauldrons to machinery, I caught wind and took advantage of that early adoption to accumulate a substantial amount of funds.
Baishu: I started a teahouse with those funds and soon expanded to inns and restaurants.
Baishu: After visiting my teahouses, restaurants, and inns, foreign guests often purchase some tea leaves to try back at home or as a gift.
Baishu: I failed to be an outstanding tea farmer, but I fully intend to provide financial support and publicity to my former colleagues...
Baishu: I'm quite satisfied with where my career's gone now, so my next goal is to help more business people, just like Master Jiuguan!
