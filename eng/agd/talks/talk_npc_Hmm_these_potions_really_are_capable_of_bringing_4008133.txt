Baron Bigfoot: Hmm, these potions really are capable of bringing out the Cryo powers of the Fungi.
Traveler: Cryo?
Baron Bigfoot: Yeah. When I was younger, I traveled to Mondstadt and loved working in the cold. My peers called me the "Bigfoot."
Baron Bigfoot: Now that I've joined this competition, it would only be right that I carry on my old habits.
Baron Bigfoot: And that's why my Fungus team will be centered around Gusto-Frosto to maximize the Cryo effects.
Paimon: Why would you tell us all about your Fungi? What if we get matched against each other?
Baron Bigfoot: Using extra information to secure victory is a useful tactic, but it's not my style.
Baron Bigfoot: After all, this is just a competition â€” not some kind of cutthroat battle. Fairness is very important to me, so it wouldn't make a difference if I told you.
Paimon: Goodbye.
Baron Bigfoot: Maybe we'll see each other again in the arena.
