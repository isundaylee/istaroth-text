Kaushik: Ah, so that's how it is. You know what? I think that what this needs is an even more daring hypothesis!

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Kaushik: I'm a scholar from Sumeru, and I'm currently researching Watatsumi Island's culture and history.
Kaushik: I was here before the Sakoku Decree was declared, and I have remained here till now. In this time, I have discovered huge differences between Watatsumi Island and Narukami Island.
Kaushik: For example, have a look at this totem that I dug up from ruins in the wild. Studying these lines and patterns has led me to a marvelous conclusion!

Traveler: Well, see you around.
Kaushik: Goodbye. Ha, my conclusions must be correct!

## Talk

Traveler: And what are your conclusions?
Kaushik: My conclusion is that ancient Inazuma must have played host to two snake gods!
Kaushik: One of them was enjoined with coral and could not move, thus creating Sangonomiya Shrine. Its true divine form dwelled within Enkanomiya deep below, forever defending the people of Watatsumi Island.
Kaushik: As for the other snake god, it was a most ambitious being that dreamed of invading Narukami Island, but was cut down by the Electro Archon as it was making its way there.
Kaushik: See? This totem shows snake patterns with coral on them on one end, and patterns that completely lack them on the other. And that's how you know this is the truth!
Kaushik: Very reasonable, is it not? Once I publish my conclusions, I'll be famous! Hahaha!

Traveler: Are you sure of your conclusions?
Kaushik: Of course. A researcher must always persist in their views. For instance, it doesn't matter how much everyone thinks that Mondstadt only has The Four Winds. Well, I reckon that there are five!
Kaushik: My hypothesis is flawless!
Kaushik: That shrine maiden at the Sangonomiya Shrine may shake her head at my conclusions, but it is she who has been blinded by her faith.
Kaushik: I mean, it's not like she has any evidence to show me herself, does she?
