# The Bottom of Things

Zhouliang: Ugh... I'm beat. Finally, I can take a break.
Zhouliang: *sigh* I wonder if I took things a little too far... A few people seemed scared out of their minds.
Traveler: Who are you?
Zhouliang: Huh? Hey, you shouldn't be here!
Zhouliang: *sigh* Never mind. I assume you overheard me anyway.
Zhouliang: I work here pretending to be a ghost, but now's my break time, so I took off my costume. I get all hot and stuffy wearing that thing...
Traveler: So there are no real ghosts here?
Zhouliang: Of course, how could there be real ghosts here?
Zhouliang: No one wants to see a real ghost, neither us nor the participants.
Zhouliang: They just come here for the atmosphere, or should I say, the chance... Everyone wants the chance to feel the thrill of excitement.
Zhouliang: When people find themselves in a scary situation, they'll say things that they'd never dare to otherwise. That's what the Test of Courage is all about.
Traveler: I think I understand.
Zhouliang: *sigh* Okay... I should get back to work now. Hope you and... whoever you're here with have a fun time.
Traveler: (Chongyun will be very disappointed.)
Traveler: It's all planned to scare people, right?
