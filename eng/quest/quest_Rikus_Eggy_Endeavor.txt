# Riku's Eggy Endeavor


## Talk 1

Traveler: You want some Bird Eggs?
Riku: If I had some eggs, I could be their mommy bird and hatch them into little birds. Then I'd have loads of bird friends to play with...
Riku: So, did you get the 8 Bird Eggs that I mentioned in my commission?
Traveler: Here they are!
Traveler: Not yet.
Riku: Aw, alright. Well, hope they get here soon.

Riku: #Wow, thanks {M#mister}{F#lady}! I'll be super careful with them, I promise.
