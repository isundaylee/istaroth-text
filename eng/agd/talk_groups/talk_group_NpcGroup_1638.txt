Traveler: How goes your forged blades? Are they worthy of battle?
Schulz: I am far from perfecting my craft, but the blades are better than before. They're still not sharp enough, though...
Schulz: Here, take these. They should serve well to protect you. Besides, I cannot give any of them to Herman...
Schulz: I must forge a far better sword, one deemed worthy of Mr. Herman's kindness.

## Talk 1

Schulz: Looking to buy a weapon? You should talk to Wagner.

Schulz: What do you sell here?
Schulz: Take your pick from this selection. All Master's own handiwork, so you won't find any second-rate items here.

Schulz: About Stormterror...
Schulz: *sigh* It's meant we've had a huge number of orders in from the Knights of Favonius... I was worried Master wouldn't be able to cope with all of them. So I tried to help out...
Schulz: ...But the ones I made... at best, they were blunt, and the worst one was so brittle that it broke on the first swing.
Schulz: Master gave me quite a scolding. "We can't give them junk like this," he said. "Not only does it put the customers at risk, it'll destroy my reputation."
Schulz: I came to my senses after that. He was right — some things you only make worse by rushing into them.
Schulz: I think I need a bit of hammering into shape myself, just like my swords do...

Schulz: What are you doing?
Schulz: I'm an apprentice. Name's Schulz.
Schulz: Master's work is pure perfection. I never tire of watching him work.
Schulz: I usually help master out with odd jobs on the shop floor. Getting some downtime, where I can just watch him work his magic, is reward enough for me.

Schulz: About your master...
Schulz: You'll have spoken to Wagner before I'm sure? Bit curt, eh?
Schulz: I'd be hard-pressed to find a better mentor though. Just look at the weapons he makes, a true testament to how hard he works.
Schulz: As long as there's mutual respect between us, I can't ask for more.
Schulz: To be honest, I think Master would get lonely without me here. Last time I took a trip back home, for example...
Schulz: ...Actually, never mind. Yeah... Don't bring that one up with Master.

Schulz: Any of your own masterpieces to show me?
Schulz: I have tried... The results are usually less than perfect, though. Master normally melts them back down again and redoes them.
Schulz: There was this one I was quite proud of... But Master wouldn't let me sell it from his shop — said it'd damage his reputation.
Schulz: So I took it out the side gate and gave it a few swings. Ended up sticking it in the ground there.
Schulz: There's a group of kids who hang out over there, seems to have got them interested... Anyway. I digress.

Schulz: Anything in the works yourself?
Schulz: Herman wants a sword for his daughter. I hear him talking about it all the time.
Schulz: He can't afford one of Wagner's, so I figured I'd make one for him myself, for free.
Schulz: I wouldn't call it an act of charity, it's not like my work is worth anything anyway.
