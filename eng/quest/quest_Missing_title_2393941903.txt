# Missing title (2393941903)


## Talk 1

Sluasi: What do you consider "closest to the sun in color"?

## Talk 2

Sluasi: Ah, so this is what they call "Cor Lapis."
Sluasi: Ah, it is so warm... it smells so good and feels so soft — it truly is as gentle as the sun itself. Surely, humans must use these to make food? Anyway, thank you so much. I will remember this item.
Paimon: How... were you able to see all that?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh. What are you doing here all by yourself?
Sluasi: Gah! Don't suddenly talk to people while standing behind them! You almost made me scatter this powder...
Paimon: Powder? Err, what's this stuff?
Sluasi: Gems!
Paimon: Gems? But why would there be any here?
Sluasi: Wouldn't it be stranger to not find them here? I mean, this is my workshop, in which I process gems... Although I must admit that it doesn't have an official name yet.
Sluasi: I did consider calling it "Studio Sluasi" in the past, but I'm not sure if using my name so directly is such a good idea.
Traveler: What do you mean by "processing gems"?
Sluasi: That means that I turn gems into various pretty ornaments... and stuff?
Sluasi: Unfortunately, I won't be able to take new commissions for a while. I need to concentrate on making paints... Well, I am still using gems for that, though.
Paimon: You're gonna make paints out of gems? Are you serious?
Sluasi: Yes. What's wrong?
Paimon: Um, well, it just feels like a waste... You could just give them to Paimon...
Paimon: But still, why do you need to make paints? Paimon's pretty sure there's no such step in using gems to make ornaments, right?
Sluasi: Well, a child who loves painting came to ask me if I could make paints as shiny as gems and as bright as the sun.
Sluasi: Moreover, she recently saved my younger sister when the village was shaking very violently.
Sluasi: That's why I've decided to try to fulfill her wish by creating a "paint as bright as the sun" and giving it to her as a thank-you gift.
Traveler: Wait, you must be referring to...
Paimon: Is the girl who enjoys painting you spoke of named Mamere?
Sluasi: Hmm? Yes... Do you two know her?
Black Screen Text: You tell Sluasi about your previous experiences with Mamere...
Sluasi: So... So the two of you are the esteemed ones who saved Puca alongside Mamere?
Paimon: Esteemed ones...?
Traveler: Yes, that was us.
Sluasi: Thank you. Thank you both so much! If it weren't for you, Puca might have been...
Sluasi: Please, take these... If you don't mind, that is!
Traveler: (Beautiful jewels...)
Paimon: #Can we really take them, {NICKNAME}? They look really expensive...
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't think Mamere would go commission people of her own accord...
Sluasi: Well, she didn't really commission me to do anything, did she? She just asked if I could do it. In fact, she ran off before I could even reply...
Paimon: That... Yeah. That sounds like something she would do.
Sluasi: #Speaking of which, esteemed {NICKNAME} and Paimon...
Sluasi: What would you call "the closest thing to the sun in color"?
Sluasi: I have tried to observe the sun myself, but I am not sure what materials I should use to recreate its tones...
Paimon: Hmm... "closest to the sun in color," you say...
Traveler: ...Gold, perhaps?
Sluasi: Well, Canotila did tell me once that "gold is the tears of the sun," or something like that...
Paimon: But wouldn't that be way too luxurious? There has to be something more normal we could use...
Paimon: Just think. We have to have seen something that most "resembles in the sun in color" and that can be found just about anywhere...
Traveler: ...The sun?
Sluasi: ...That is true. The closest thing to the sun is indeed the sun itself.
Sluasi: But how do I grind the sun into powder, I wonder...
Paimon: What? Are you seriously discussing something this ridiculous?
Traveler: In that case, you could probably use my hair...
Sluasi: ...Hmm?
Paimon: C'mon, you can't use hair to make paints!
Traveler: Thank you.
Traveler: I wouldn't call us the "esteemed" anything...

## Talk 4

Sluasi: What do you consider <color=#00E1FFFF>"closest to the sun in color"</color>?

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...
Sluasi: Whatever the case, thank you two for your help.
Sluasi: #However, I cannot simply take what is yours, esteemed {NICKNAME}. Thus, I shall simply learn the name of that material from you, and I shall later set out to find it myself.
Sluasi: Still, would you not say that this color is a bit too... intense?
Sluasi: The "color of the sun" should have a lighter touch, I think...
Paimon: Do you mean that it should lean further toward being "white"?
Paimon: Hmm, that's true. The "sun" is more "white" than it is "gold"...
Sluasi: "White," you say? However, I am not sure what materials we must use to achieve this lighter shade...
Traveler: Couldn't we just add water?
Sluasi: I have tried that in the past... but it did not turn out so well. Colors produced that way turn out rather murky — they lack the striking brilliance the sun has...
Sluasi: So it would be best if we could use some other material...
Paimon: That said, we can find all sorts of bright, white things around, can't we?
Traveler: Perhaps we could go with Paimon's hair...
Paimon: You can't make paints outta hair!
Paimon: And even if you could, you can't just pluck Paimon's!

## Talk 6

Sluasi: "Something <color=#00E1FFFF>white</color>"... What is that?

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...
Sluasi: Ah, I see, so this is the color that you call "white," yes?
Sluasi: I cannot help but feel that this is the exact opposite of what the "sun's color" is. Would its opposite, then, not be more suitable?
Paimon: Its "opposite"... You mean black?
Sluasi: "Black"... Yes, that must be it. "Black." A brilliant solution, esteemed Paimon. That must be the sun's color indeed!
Traveler: This feels kinda wrong somehow...
Paimon: But why black, though?
Traveler: Well, the sun is golden...
Sluasi: In that case, could I ask one more thing of you two?
Sluasi: Please, bring me something that is "black." That way, I shall know what material I must use to create "a color as radiant as the sun."
Paimon: Do we really have to look for that? Paimon thinks we're starting to veer further and further away from anything associated with the sun...
Paimon: But since she's asked us to... Let's go find her something that's "black," shall we?
Traveler: So if it was the sun at night...
Paimon: The sun doesn't become black at night! Never mind that, there isn't even a sun at night!
Traveler: Wonderful and befitting of you, esteemed Paimon.
Paimon: Hey, you cut that out!

## Talk 8

Sluasi: If I see something <color=#00E1FFFF>black</color>, I will be able to mix a color as radiant as the sun...

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...
Sluasi: Thank you very much. With this, I'm sure I shall be able to make pigments "as bright as the sun," which I may then give her as a gift.
Paimon: Will this really work...?
Paimon: Or rather, can you really make "bright colors" using such base materials?
Traveler: I suspect not.
Paimon: But Sluasi sure does look happy, though...
Sluasi: Whatever the case, I thank you two for your help.
Sluasi: Please, take these as my thanks...
Paimon: Sh—Shiny gems — and components, too!
Sluasi: Hehe. I am glad you like them. If you desire any ornaments in the future, you know where to find me.
Traveler: It's not utterly impossible...
Paimon: That's true, the colors Mamere uses are pretty weird too...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Sluasi: Ah, so this is what they call "Cor Lapis."
Sluasi: Ah, it is so warm... it smells so good and feels so soft — it truly is as gentle as the sun itself. Surely, humans must use these to make food? Anyway, thank you so much. I will remember this item.
Paimon: How... were you able to see all that?

### Additional Talk 2

Sluasi: Ah, so this is the thing you call a "Nilotpala Lotus."
Sluasi: Hmm. How strange. Why is it named for the moon, when it should be the thing "closest in color to the sun"?
Paimon: Well, are the sun and moon really that different in color?

### Additional Talk 3

Sluasi: Ah, I see, I see... This is the "Berry" you spoke of.
Sluasi: It is cold and hard, yet supple... and it stings the eyes like the sunlight of a winter afternoon. Surely this must be a metal that humans forge to make their weapons! Thank you very much. I shall remember this item.
Paimon: How... were you able to see all that?

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Y'know, wouldn't "a metal painted white" simply be a "White Iron Chunk"?
Paimon: Huh. Come to think of it, considering the price difference between stone and metal, there might actually be some unscrupulous people who might paint stone to sell it as White Iron...

### Additional Talk 5

Sluasi: Wow! It's so beautiful! And it even has a light scent to it...
Paimon: Gathering them could be quite tough... But would that be a problem?

### Additional Talk 6

Sluasi: Ah, it's a pearl! But it feels a little different from the ones I've seen before. I sense a... coldness from it, of a sort.
Paimon: Hehe. This is no ordinary pearl. It's a Sango Pearl, which means "coral pearl"!
Sluasi: Hmm. Can corals produce pearls too? The outside world is truly fascinating...
Paimon: Err... That's not exactly true. It's called that because they grow near corals.

### Additional Talk 7

Sluasi: This is... an ordinary Iron Chunk. I see, so this is what you would term "black"...
Paimon: Well, its shade is a little off, but Paimon reckons it'll work just fine.

### Additional Talk 8

Sluasi: Is this a bone from some creature? I see, I see. You mean to show that the "blackness" of the sun is all that remains once something has become bereft of all life...
Paimon: Don't say that kind of weird stuff! Anyway, Sand Grease Pupae aren't bones, they're just the shells left behind by Quicksand Eels!
Sluasi: Ah, like taking off old clothes? I see. They are very beautiful clothes, though. Now, if only I could sew together something similar...
