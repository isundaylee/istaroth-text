Hushang: If only I could break into the Liyue market...

Traveler: What are you planning?
Hushang: It's about the toy trade. I hear that toys from Snezhnaya sell very well in Liyue, and now I'm feeling some regret.
Hushang: If I could have seized the opportunity to bring my handmade toys to Liyue, they'd definitely be more popular now than anything from Snezhnaya!
Hushang: What could a frigid place like that know about a child's heart?

Traveler: See you.

Hushang: I won! As a toy maker, I'm practically a colleague of these card makers and of course I understand how things work!
