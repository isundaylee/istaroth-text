# The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?


## Talk 1

Yanbei: With the improvements to their internal structure, the organizers should be able to attract more sponsors and expand to at least three times this size after just a few more events...
Yanbei: #Hey, if it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon! I've heard so much about you. What a pleasant surprise to see you guys here!
Traveler: And you are...?
Yanbei: I'm just an ordinary clerk at the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs. I'm on a business trip to Sumeru and came by to check out the competition.
Paimon: Paimon didn't think we'd run into friends from Liyue! Are you competing?
Yanbei: Haha, I'll pass this time. I still have work to do. Being able to watch the event from the audience is satisfying enough already.
Yanbei: Although the event isn't as exciting as a real festival, I think it has potential. Maybe the organizers will make some internal adjustments in the future and attract more sponsors.
Yanbei: When that time comes, the Beast Tamers Tournament should be able to grow and maybe even become mainstream.
Paimon: More sponsors? Don't they already have that wealthy merchant, Elchingen, already?
Paimon: His wealth may not be as mind-blowing as a successful merchant from Liyue, but it's substantial nonetheless.
Yanbei: There will always be some doubt when you put all your eggs in one basket.
Yanbei: I don't know Mr. Elchingen's background too well, but according to the information I've gathered, the origin of a large portion of his Mora remains unknown.
Yanbei: Hosting an event with funds of questionable origin may not sit well with some people.
Yanbei: But I'm not from Fontaine, and it'd be impossible for me to know everything about every single Fontaine merchant. Maybe Elchingen earned his fortune gradually by doing business, and his peers didn't take notice of him.
Paimon: You have a point. It wouldn't hurt to be a little more cautious...
Traveler: That's a very thoughtful way of looking at it.
Yanbei: Thanks! Anyway, I'm just sharing my own thought process. If I were an employee working for the organizers, I would search for multiple sponsors to minimize the risk.
Yanbei: I hope what I said didn't ruin your mood.
Traveler: Improve internal structure?
Yanbei: Yep. The way I see it, many of the organizers are capable individuals, but they, unfortunately, don't have a say in anything. Almost everything is decided by that researcher, Kautilya.
Yanbei: This event would undoubtedly be much better if he were to allow those individuals to make some decisions.
Paimon: Th—That's so complex... Paimon's having trouble following...
Yanbei: Haha, that's alright, everyone has their own area of expertise. It's actually my job to analyze commercial events. Ordinary people should just try to enjoy the event for what it is.
Traveler: I'll let you get back to it. Goodbye...
Yanbei: Sure. You two seem like you have a lot to do as well. Let's grab a cup of tea when you have the time!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hee-hehe, Paimon's a Fungi-naming expert! Every one of these will sound really cool when you call them out in the arena!
Traveler: The names you came up with for the second Fungus...
Paimon: The round hat on this little guy's head kinda looks like a drum, don't ya think? The first thing that came to Paimon's mind when she saw it was... If you hit it on the head, it's definitely gonna go "bing bong"! Hmm... How does the name "Bongo-Head" sound?
Traveler: Hmm, I think "bing bong" is optimistic.
Paimon: But look how happy it looks! That means it likes the name. Okay then! Bongo-Head it is!
Paimon: Aw, Bongo-Head's just like a little puppy... Paimon's never seen this side of a Fungus before.
Paimon: From now on, we need to look out for each other, Bongo-Head!
Paimon: Okay, let's go catch some more Fungi and make a team for Bongo-Head!
Traveler: Probably more like a "squelch."
Traveler: All three suggestions were the same...

## Talk 3

Haniyyah: This is where you'll capture your Fungi. The Fungi in this area are highly compatible with the Wisdom Orb, and they're ideal for training and competing with.
Haniyyah: The Wisdom Orb can capture and store Fungi. It also serves as a controller.
Haniyyah: I recommend giving each Fungus a code name to make commanding them easier. For example, this one next to me is Pyro-1, which means "Pyro Fungus No. 1."
Paimon: You just go off their element and then number them? Hmm, seems kinda boring to Paimon... Uhh, this Fungus looks pretty lively. Why don't we call it "Bouncy Happyshroom"?
Traveler: Paimon is the best at coming up with names.
Haniyyah: Uh... Thanks, but no thanks. I've got my own way of naming them and I'm gonna stick with it. It's simple, straightforward. It helps me with managing them.
Paimon: Yeah, you're probably used to calling it Pyro-1 anyway... Alright, we'll stop, but wait until you hear the great names we come up with for our Fungi! You might want to reconsider then.
Traveler: I also have some suggestions if you're interested.

## Talk 4

Kautilya: Welcome, contestants, to the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament! I am Kautilya, a senior Amurta researcher and the organizer of today's tournament.
Kautilya: I'm sure you're probably all very intrigued by the idea of fighting Fungi and excited at the prospect of our amazing prizes. But at the same time, you may well have some concerns about the safety of this tournament.
Kautilya: Worry not! The Wisdom Orb we've developed exclusively for this event makes use of Amurta's most advanced "Intellectual Boost" technology. It is absolutely reliable and safe!
Kautilya: So please, cast your reservations aside and enter the tournament with confidence!
Kautilya: Also, it gives me great pleasure to announce that this event is sponsored by Mr. Elchingen, a renowned businessman from Fontaine who has generously provided a grand total of sixty million Mora for our prize fund!
Kautilya: And if anyone is able to prove themselves capable of carrying out Mr. Elchingen's philosophy by passing the Ultimate Trial, he will be willing to give to them his entire fortune!
Kautilya: The only other condition is that the winner must agree to carry on Mr. Elchingen's legacy by hosting the "Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament" in the future...
Paimon: Whoa! Paimon can't believe that rich guy threw sixty million Mora at this event, just like that! And, what was all that about inheriting his entire fortune if you promise to keep his beast-taming tournament going...?
Paimon: Also, hosted by an Akademiya scholar, huh? Whoa, pretty official. Uh, might be a little inappropriate if we just barged in and tried to shut it down...
Paimon: So, um... Why don't we enter the tournament and see if this "Wisdom Orb" thingy actually works?
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: No, that's not it! It's just... now that everything in Sumeru has finally settled down, don't you think it'd be a little unfair to Nahida if we keep picking trouble with the Akademiya?
Paimon: And he sounded really confident. Paimon's curious about how this mysterious Fungi-taming device works!
Traveler: And what if it works really well?
Paimon: Although they've caused us trouble in the past, the Fungi aren't just aggressive monsters, right? They're more like... wild animals with bad tempers.
Paimon: Since there's no longer any safety concerns, we don't need to worry. Maybe we can even try becoming friends with the Fungi! Paimon thinks that would be fun!
Paimon: Besides, if we do well in the tournament, we'll be able to earn some extra Mora. There are basically no drawbacks!
Traveler: Alright, let's see what all the fuss is about then...
Paimon: Yep! That's the way we roll!
Paimon: Looks like we sign up over there. C'mon, let's grab a Wisdom Orb and enter the tournament!
Traveler: But we should stay cautious, just in case...
Traveler: What will you do to the Fungi?
Traveler: You just want the prize money, don't you?

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh, looks like the people ahead of us are still signing up. Let's wait our turn.
Haniyyah: #Golden Comet {NICKNAME} and Silver Companion... So. You're competing too?
Paimon: Huh? You know us? But... what's with those names? We've never heard them before...
Haniyyah: You're a tough duo, if the posters are to be believed. Some mercenaries who managed to escape from you painted your portraits, warning others to avoid messing with you at all costs.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't know whether to be flattered or to try and explain that we aren't as scary as the rumors suggest...
Haniyyah: Unfortunately, the rules of this tournament state that beast tamers aren't allowed to use their weapons, or even fight each other directly. Your impeccable combat skills won't be any use to you here.
Haniyyah: The tournament is about capturing Fungi, training them, and commanding them in combat. There's no way of knowing whether commanding Fungi is a skill you'll be able to master in time.
Paimon: That's true... We've never captured a Fungus before, and wouldn't know anything about how to get them to fight.
Paimon: Wait a second, you don't look like a staff member. What are you lecturing us for? Who are you anyway?
Haniyyah: The name's Haniyyah. I used to work for the Eremites, taming grumpy Sumpter Beasts. Ended up with a reputation for being a beast tamer, so they got me involved with testing the Wisdom Orb early on.
Haniyyah: Anyway, my name ain't worth remembering — I'm just an illiterate nobody, all I'm good for is doing odd jobs for Eremite mercs. Just think of me as another contestant.
Haniyyah: I do have a lot of experience taming beasts, though. Want me to teach you?
Traveler: You want to team up with us?
Haniyyah: You guys are worth me getting to know — as allies or opponents, 'cause either way, you can get rid of some obstacles for me in this competition. Of course, I'd prefer allies if possible.
Paimon: Well, that was blunt... but also quite honest.
Paimon: It's definitely better to have an expert teach us than figure everything out on our own, right? What do you think, should we take her up on her offer?
Haniyyah: Alright then. Take this Wisdom Orb and let's go catch some Fungi at the designated area.
Paimon: She gets right to the point, doesn't she?
Traveler: You want to size us up?

## Talk 6

Haniyyah: Great, you've now collected all four Fungi. The next step is to use the "Floral Jelly" provided by the organizers to boost your Fungi's abilities. That way, they'll be able to unleash powerful skills during combat...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe we're making progress so quickly. It's all thanks to your help, Haniyyah! Alright, let's all return to the arena now...
Paimon: Huh? Look, someone's staggering along with a Fungus running circles around her... Is she being attacked?
Paimon: She's collapsed! Let's go see what's happening!
Layla: *whimper*... I can't go on... too weak...
Paimon: Are you hurt? How bad is it?
Traveler: Watch out!
Haniyyah: Pyro-1, take it out!
Layla: Wait... it's not an enemy! It's my shroom buddy!
Layla: I'm j—just a little too tired to walk right now... But I still need to find three more shroom buddies to qualify for the tournament...
Traveler: "Shroom buddies"?
Paimon: You mean... you're a contestant too?
Layla: I wasn't counting on running into other contestants here... Maybe this is the end of the road for me. Twirly-Whirly on its own is no match for you...
Layla: Look after Twirly-Whirly for me... take him with you to the top!
Paimon: Hey, don't give up! It's not like we're a bunch of Eremites trying to steal your Fungi... uh, your shroom buddies. We're better than that!
Paimon: You should at least hang in there until we're in the arena, so we can compete against each other properly!
Paimon: Haniyyah over here is a professional beast tamer. And despite knowing that we might be her fiercest competitors, she still gave us lots of help and advice!
Haniyyah: ...Was that supposed to be a compliment?
Traveler: Take it as a compliment.
Paimon: State your name and mission! Golden Comet and Silver Companion shall gladly come to your aid!
Layla: R—Really? Then... could you please help me collect the rest of the four shroom buddies I need? Does this mean my luck is finally starting to change...?
Layla: Um... my name is Layla. I'm just a student in the Rtawahist Darshan, so I don't have any impressive titles or anything... And my goal is to, uh... to make it into the quarterfinals.
Layla: If I can make it to the quarterfinals, I'll get to take my shroom buddies home and delegate some of my physical labor to them. Of course, I'll take good care of them too.
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon read that in the rules somewhere. All quarter-finalists get to take home any Fungi of their choice...
Paimon: But, what do you mean, "physical labor"? You're a student. Shouldn't you be busy with coursework and writing papers?
Layla: Aah, this is pretty embarrassing, but uh... so I must have some sort of congenital sleep disorder or something, 'cause I can never seem to get enough sleep, and I'm always really low on energy.
Layla: Even the smallest amount of exercise makes me... Well, you saw me just now. I get so tired, I collapse from exhaustion. So when I said "physical labor"... I just meant basic stuff like moving books around or fetching things I need from the store...
Paimon: #Ah, you don't need to be embarrassed about that, it's totally normal! Paimon delegates chores to {NICKNAME} all the time.
Haniyyah: First she calls them "buddies," then she talks about wanting to live with them... Ridiculous. She sounds just like Elchingen.
Traveler: (I wonder what Haniyyah's so annoyed about?)
Haniyyah: Well. Looks like you've mastered everything already, and moved on to helping others. I'm delighted for you.
Haniyyah: I'll see you around. Good luck.
Paimon: Huh? Why is Haniyyah leaving all of a sudden?
Paimon: We haven't thanked you or Pyro-1 yet, Haniyyah! Let's at least go get something to eat together...
Layla: What's wrong? That beast tamer, is she... angry?
Paimon: Hmm... probably not? She's pretty blunt and doesn't make a great first impression, but she's definitely not a bad person! Otherwise, why would she have helped us?
Traveler: Maybe she has something urgent to do...
Paimon: Yeah, we'll see her again, and when we do, let's give her some gifts to show her our gratitude!
Paimon: In the meantime, let's follow her example by doing our best in the tournament, helping other contestants, and making sure Layla gets to compete!
Layla: Thank you so much! I'll try my best to contribute, too. I don't want to be a burden to you guys.
Black Screen Text: You help Layla find three more shroom buddies to complete her set...
Paimon: Nicely done! Now that we've put together Layla's team, she should be eligible to take part. Let's head back to the arena and confirm with them.
Traveler: We'll see her again at the tournament...
Traveler: Paimon's really getting into this.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Let Paimon see how the qualifying rounds are looking... Great! We're in a different group from Layla, so we won't have to compete against each other in the early stages of the competition!
Layla: Actually... I hope I don't have to fight you guys in the later stages, either...
Yae Miko: Oh? Hello there, little ones.
Yae Miko: Sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. You two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
Paimon: M—Miko? What are you doing here? Is Paimon hallucinating?
Yae Miko: Hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in Inazuma. They even handed out flyers in front of Yae Publishing House.
Yae Miko: Don't you think a tournament like this makes a perfect candidate for light novel treatment?
Traveler: It does seem like a good place to find source material.
Yae Miko: Yae Publishing House is working on a bestseller that, if all goes to plan, will stay a bestseller for the next fifty years. The theme is "friendship and rivalry," so we decided to bring our up-and-coming author, Souka here, to gather some inspiration.
Yae Miko: I, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. So, I will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
Yae Miko: Here's my little partner in crime. Souka named it "Blitzara" — I think it's rather good. Very distinctive.
Paimon: Who knew there'd be such a big turnout? Even Miko's here...
Yae Miko: Souka, come say hi to the little ones. They are set to be some of the fiercest competition you face in the tournament. You should put them in your novel as major characters.
Souka: Yes, Chief Editor!
Souka: For the s—sake of my readership, I... w—won't back down! I'll b—b—beat... b—beat you!
Traveler: See you in the arena!
Paimon: Yeah! Just 'cause you're with Miko doesn't mean we'll go easy on you!
Yae Miko: Ooh, yes, more of that! Do you feel that, Souka? Declaring a challenge to your arch-enemy-in-the-making before the competition begins is a key plot device that helps build dramatic tension.
Souka: I—I wouldn't say I'm feeling that, exactly! J—Just thinking about competing against Her Excellency's Hanamizaka tour confidante is m—making me so nervous, I'm losing my, m—my, my m—mind...
Yae Miko: Hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. This'll make excellent source material, too.
Layla: She's... terrifying... but she also seems really dedicated to her craft. I hope we can be friends.
Yae Miko: And who is this softly spoken little lady?
Paimon: She's our new friend, Layla. We met her while we were out capturing Fungi.
Paimon: Layla's entering the tournament 'cause she wants to take her trained Fungi back home to live with her. Her goal is to make it to the quarterfinals!
Yae Miko: Training Fungi... and then domesticating them?
Yae Miko: How fascinating... You must be full of secrets. There's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
Yae Miko: I'm Yae Miko, a light novel editor — purely out of personal interest, and right now, what I'm most interested in is you... Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine.
Layla: Uhh... I have no idea how to respond to that...
Layla: Traveler, Paimon, I really appreciate all your help!
Layla: But, I wanna get to know my four shroom buddies a little better and prepare for the qualifiers, so... I'll go do some training now!
Paimon: Don't push yourself too hard, Layla! You'll end up collapsing from exhaustion again!
Paimon: Miko, what are you doing, scaring our new friend off like that!
Yae Miko: Oh? Am I really so terrifying? Well then, I'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up...
Yae Miko: But that can wait... Judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
Traveler: What are you really doing in Sumeru?
Yae Miko: I'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. Unfortunately though... it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
Kautilya: Guuji Yae! What an honor to finally meet you! We're so privileged that our tournament is your first destination in Sumeru!
Paimon: Huh? Isn't that the organizer? And that super-rich businessman is here too...
Yae Miko: Goodness, I presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? Otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
Kautilya: How you jest, Guuji Yae! Those such as your esteemed self deserve nothing short of the most lavish reception Sumeru has to offer.
Kautilya: I see you've already had the chance to try out the Wisdom Orb? What are your thoughts on the future prospects of this technology? You know, with your blessing, it can be introduced into Inazuma, allowing you to swiftly resolve the situation of—
Yae Miko: Ahem... Right now, I am nothing but an ordinary editor-in-chief. I'm here to enjoy my vacation and gather some inspiration along the way, and if I can at all help it, I'd rather not concern myself with such weighty topics as the future fate of nascent technologies...
Elchingen: Don't be so pushy, Mr. Kautilya. Droning on about the Akademiya's business ambitions is hardly respectful to our honored guest who has traveled all the way from the Land of Thunder to be here.
Elchingen: Not to mention that Guuji Yae is busy catching up with her friends. I daresay it was both unnecessary and discourteous to interrupt their conversation like this.
Yae Miko: A most pertinent remonstration coming from you, Mr. Elchingen. You do conduct yourself in such an unobtrusive manner... much as you have in your entire career, quietly amassing an enormous fortune while remaining almost entirely unknown...
Elchingen: Why, to hear such high praise from the great Guuji Yae is more prestige than I could ever hope for. Please, should you require anything at all, do not hesitate to seek my assistance. I will do everything within my ability to make your stay in Sumeru an enjoyable one.
Elchingen: Also... To have the renowned Traveler here at the tournament is an unexpected delight. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you in action.
Traveler: Um... Thank you...?
Paimon: Miko, they're here to do business with you, right? Should you really be turning them away like this? Especially the rich guy? Paimon thinks working with him could have a lot of advantages for Yae Publishing House...
Yae Miko: Promoting an entirely new event throughout all of Teyvat so rapidly would be an impossible feat for any ordinary businessman. I, for one, do not wish for Yae Publishing House to be the subordinate partner in a business relationship with him.
Yae Miko: Besides, the tournament has only just begun. Who knows whether it will go on to be a success? I want to focus on trying to enjoy myself, while keeping one eye open for potential liabilities.
Traveler: Potential liabilities...
Yae Miko: Fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. Letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
Paimon: So it wasn't just us! Yeah, we started out with some safety concerns about this event, but the Wisdom Orb seems pretty amazing!
Paimon: At least, all the Fungi we used it on have been very well-behaved, like our Bongo-Head here. Seems we don't need to be too nervous after all.
Yae Miko: Oh, Paimon, you're just as carefree and enthusiastic as ever. Well, it's about time for me to get into character. As a contestant, I need to go and get ready for the tournament...
Yae Miko: See you in the qualifiers. Blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
Paimon: Coming here was a great idea! Look at us, making new friends, bumping into Miko... This competition is shaping up to be a whole lot of fun!
Paimon: Come on, let's go get some Floral Jelly for Bongo-Head's training, like Haniyyah suggested!
Traveler: So you've noticed.
Traveler: What's going on behind the scenes of this tournament?
Traveler: There are lots of stories you could tell about this.

## Talk 8

Balfour: Ah, the champions-to-be, here at long last! Come on now, use the Floral Jelly and awaken your Fungi's true potential!
Paimon: Champions-to-be? Hehe, thanks for the compliment! So you've heard about us too?
Balfour: Of course, I was standing right next to you when you collected your Wisdom Orb. I couldn't find a convenient opportunity to introduce myself, as Haniyyah was busy explaining the tournament to you...
Balfour: With an expert mentor like Haniyyah, I'm sure you'll become excellent beast-tamers in no time!
Paimon: If even the staff are singing her praises, Haniyyah must really know what she's doing! Well, all the more reason to give it our all!

## Talk 9

Traveler: We want to train Fungi.
Balfour: Okay, make sure to use the Floral Jelly according to the instructions in the recipe.

## Talk 10

Traveler: We want to train Fungi.
Balfour: Okay, make sure to use the Floral Jelly according to the instructions in the recipe.

## Talk 11

Aratani: Hello there, distinguished guests of Lady Yae and the Almighty Shogun.
Traveler: And you are...?
Aratani: Eh? Have you seriously forgotten who I am?
Aratani: I'm Yae Publishing House's planner, the de facto organizer of the "This Novel Is Amazing!" event. We've met before.
Paimon: Paimon... kinda remembers...
Aratani: That's alright, I'm sure you'll remember me after this encounter.
Aratani: After all, with this new experience, I'll be able to inject some incredible, never-before-seen creativity into Yae Publishing House's next event! I'll become a renowned planner... Ahh, I truly am spectacular!
Traveler: About your travel itinerary...
Aratani: Right, the plan is to visit as many famous spots as possible.
Aratani: I hear there are quite a few scenic places inhabited by all sorts of fantastic animals here in Sumeru, where inquisitive researchers and noble Forest Rangers alike come and go, along with those mysterious, dangerous, yet alluring mercenaries.
Aratani: Writers should be able to find inspiration around every corner here.
Aratani: I recommended that Lady Yae bring more writers here to gather materials for their work, but she replied, "Quality is far more important than quantity," and selected Souka at random after flipping through the list.
Aratani: In truth, Souka hasn't published any successful pieces yet. But I added her to our backup roster because of her great writing skills and her ability to quickly become immersed in stories.
Paimon: Hmm... so that's how Souka was selected... It does feel a little random, to be honest... But it fits Miko's style.
Traveler: Maybe Miko wants to try to personally train someone new.
Aratani: Wow! That's a really accurate guess!
Aratani: Lady Yae once said, "To discover a newcomer's potential while heading in the most interesting direction should be a unique experience."
Aratani: Now, being that senior writers mostly have their own writing style and habits, a newbie might have an advantage when it comes to incorporating foreign elements into a novel.
Aratani: Lady Yae is as insightful as ever! It would seem Souka really is the best candidate for the trip to Sumeru!
Traveler: About Yae Miko...
Aratani: Mhm, you guys are more concerned with the whereabouts of Lady Yae after all.
Aratani: Unfortunately, the schedule that Lady Yae put together for us only covers a few specific days. We're free to do as we wish in our free time.
Aratani: Take me, for instance. I'm thrilled just looking through the details of the Beast Tamers Tournament.
Aratani: As for what Lady Yae does during her free time... Well, that's personal. It's not something a planner like me would have the privilege of knowing.
Paimon: Well, come to think of it, Miko isn't someone who would enjoy a packed itinerary.
Traveler: Have a good time!
Aratani: You too! Good luck with your competition!

## Talk 12

Souka: Are the two of you... here to train Fungi as well?
Souka: #Even with the ability to take down thousands of bandits single-handedly, {NICKNAME} still continues to train and work as hard as ever... That really does put a lot of pressure on your opponents!
Traveler: What happened to your stutter?
Paimon: Hey, now that you mention it, how are you speaking so fluently now? Is it because you're not scared of us anymore?
Souka: Erm... Uh... Ahem... Umm...
Souka: Even though I have the utmost respect for you two, that doesn't mean I'm scared to talk to you.
Souka: You're not the reason I was stuttering before... It's a little complicated.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows why! You're afraid of Miko because you always miss your submission deadlines!
Paimon: And you tremble with anxiety when you're reminded of an impending deadline whenever Miko is standing next to you!
Traveler: *whimper* There's so much work...
Souka: P—Please keep your voice down!
Souka: Even if you were right, you didn't have to say it out loud...
Paimon: Don't worry, our lips are sealed.
Paimon: Well then, good luck, Souka!
Traveler: What kind of weird nicknames are these...?
Souka: Ahh, do you not like them?
Souka: The authors occasionally talk about you guys when they eat. They would come up with nicknames for you guys, and there would always be a nickname or two that could receive a standing ovation...
Paimon: Paimon actually finds it pretty interesting. The nicknames that the authors came up with really are something. They have just the right vibe for important characters in a novel!
Paimon: Souka, are you gonna name your Fungus something similar as well? Paimon remembers you were the one that named Miko's Fungus, right?
Souka: To be honest, I was planning on naming it something more casual.
Souka: However, Lady Yae said, "Since you're writing a passionate and intense novel, you should break free from all restraints and be as hyperbolic as necessary."
Traveler: The mercenaries seem to be doing the same.
Paimon: #Hmm, you're right. The nicknames the mercenaries gave Paimon and {NICKNAME} do sound pretty ridiculous!
Paimon: Golden Comet is crashing down——boom! And Silver Companion is close behind with a combo——ba-bam!
Souka: It's said that a "name" is an expression of anticipation. It allows people and things to move toward what the "name" means.
Souka: If the Fungus is named something cool, maybe it'll grow into something really powerful!
Paimon: Really? Then Paimon will have to call out Bongo-Head's name more frequently!
Paimon: That way, Bongo-Head's head will actually go "bing bong" when Paimon knocks on it later.
Traveler: I still think it'll sound more like a squelch.
Paimon: Hmph, care to make a bet!?
Paimon: Whoever loses needs to let Bongo-Head ride on their back for three days!
Traveler: "Bing bong" is the sound when you hit someone with a Mist Bubble.
Traveler: You can do it, Souka!
Souka: Thank you. I know they're just ordinary words of encouragement, but I feel so honored!

## Talk 13

Ajilenakh Dash: Ha! The clear speed was even faster this time! Nice!
Traveler: You are...?
Ajilenakh Dash: Are you also participating in the Nilotpala Cup? How could you not know who I am...
Ajilenakh Dash: An empty-headed outsider with a flying white mushroom... Pfft... You guys look so weak!
Ajilenakh Dash: Wait, I don't think that's a mushroom... Ah well, makes no difference.
Traveler: Paimon, you're a shroom buddy now.
Paimon: That's not the point! Argh, she is so cocky!
Ajilenakh Dash: What are you talking about? This is what you would call an intimidating aura!
Ajilenakh Dash: I, Ajilenakh Dash, was the first to become an adult in the Ajilenakh Nut Gang! My lackeys all look up to me!
Ajilenakh Dash: I work the fastest, earn money the fastest, read the fastest, and run the fastest. I'm faster than everyone else...
Traveler: Do you eat Ajilenakh Nuts the fastest too?
Ajilenakh Dash: That's right! Everyone tells me that I can eat Ajilenakh Nuts as fast as lightning! If there was an Ajilenakh Nut eating contest, I'd win it even after drinking a couple tanks of water!
Paimon: Haha, what a straightforward nickname. But it looks like you're the one that's empty-headed!
Ajilenakh Dash: You! I've got my eyes on you, Flying White Mushroom! Just make sure you don't start bawling when I defeat you!
Ajilenakh Dash: Then again, I might forget who you guys are by then. After all, there are so many people in the competition, and you guys hardly make an impression!
Ajilenakh Dash: Just pray that you don't cross paths with me, Ajilenakh Dash, or you'll be beaten into the ground by my Fungi.
Paimon: Arghh!!! We should've definitely used those two awesome nicknames!
Traveler: Speed?
Ajilenakh Dash: That's right! My Fungi and I have come up with a speedy strategy that can't be beaten!
Ajilenakh Dash: On my command, my Fungi will immediately swarm the opponent, and there's no way out of it!
Paimon: Um, isn't that the same as blindly charging at your opponent?
Paimon: If there's a mismatch in overall strength, wouldn't you just lose immediately?
Ajilenakh Dash: Wh—What are you talking about!? Everyone's Fungi have relatively the same strength. It's obvious whoever's faster will win!
Ajilenakh Dash: Stories of instantly defeating four opponents of the same skill level only exist in fairy tales!
Ajilenakh Dash: Flying White Mushroom, I dare you to try next time if you don't believe me.
Ajilenakh Dash: You're all just... extra practice for me before I become champion anyway!
Paimon: There are quite a few contenders! Paimon wouldn't bet on us remembering who you are either!
Paimon: Besides, there's nothing to gain from beating you... Paimon really can't find any motivation...
Ajilenakh Dash: Heh! Assuming you can beat me, even though it's highly unlikely, I'd be willing to recognize your strength and treat you to some most delicious Candied Ajilenakh Nuts!
Paimon: Eh? The most delicious Candied Ajilenakh Nuts? Paimon wonders how they taste...
Traveler: Be careful out there...
Ajilenakh Dash: Hmph, speak for yourself! Don't get yourself hurt!

## Talk 14

Thabit: Such is life...
Traveler: You are...?
Thabit: Oh, I'm just a nobody. You'll probably run into a good handful of Eremite mercenaries like me on just a short trip to pick a Sumeru Rose outside the city.
Thabit: Haniyyah probably doesn't remember me either. Although she did help someone as insignificant as me back then.
Paimon: Huh? Do you know Haniyyah as well?
Thabit: Technically, I know her, but she doesn't know me. She saved my life before, and I haven't been able to repay her for it.
Paimon: But Haniyyah said that she's just an ordinary beast tamer. Could it be that she's actually really strong?
Thabit: Well, it was indeed her remarkable beast-taming abilities that saved my life.
Thabit: Back then, I was in charge of receiving Sumpter Beasts that belonged to enemies. The Sumpter Beasts were submissive only to their original owners and nearly crushed every bone in my body.
Thabit: Thank goodness Haniyyah was there when it happened. She used a special technique to calm the enraged Sumpter Beasts before they sent me to the afterlife. Haniyyah said she was just doing her job, and she even refused my thank-you gift.
Paimon: Wow... Paimon never would've expected something like that to happen...
Traveler: That was very kind of her!
Thabit: Yeah, on top of that, some Sumpter Beasts were once bewitched by the hilichurls and became extremely hostile toward humans. Sumpter Beasts can also become enraged if their feed is laced with suspicious mushrooms.
Thabit: Haniyyah's our only hope whenever something like that happens. She seems to always befriend the Sumpter Beasts, turning them into gentle giants after just a half day of training.
Paimon: Who would've thought that the work Haniyyah only briefly mentioned had such a great impact! She really is amazing!
Thabit: Gentle Sumpter Beasts are worth quite a bit, whether you're selling to the Eremites or ordinary merchants. However, Haniyyah's fees remain extremely cheap.
Thabit: She seems to really enjoy communicating with animals, and her passion for beast taming is far greater than any desire to make money. And... that's exactly why I have no idea how to repay her...
Traveler: We're curious too.
Paimon: Hmm, Haniyyah's also helped us in the past. We want to do something for her in return too!
Thabit: Ha! Well then, let's work together and see if we can get to know our beast-taming friend a little better!
Thabit: However, it's been a while since I've seen Haniyyah. She seems to have changed... I wonder if she's still as approachable as before.
Traveler: Don't be sad...
Paimon: Ah, did something upset you? Don't worry. Bad things will pass and your time will eventually come!
Thabit: Wow, I would've never thought that someone like me would be able to attract the attention of renowned individuals like you guys.
Thabit: I'm not sad, I'm just reflecting on some things, that's all. Maybe it isn't such a bad thing, after all...
Thabit: I suppose it would be beneficial for Haniyyah's career if she were to be a little more insistent at times.
Paimon: Haniyyah? Be more insistent?
Thabit: Long story short, as a talented beast tamer, sometimes she needs to command a certain level of "respect" to prevent people from trying to scam her.
Thabit: Haniyyah used to be an energetic and happy person. She wore her heart on her sleeve, and she never had the slightest intention of hiding her emotions. I often worry if someone with ill intent will take advantage of her.
Thabit: But looking at how she is now, she must've experienced something that changed her. Her thoughts aren't on display anymore. It puts my mind at ease.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't really understand... But Paimon kinda knows what you're saying.
Traveler: I didn't understand either.
Thabit: My apologies for blabbering to myself. Just... see it as a useless guy worrying about a young girl he's indebted to.
Traveler: That makes sense.
Traveler: Are you a competitor as well?
Thabit: No, but you can think of me as a spectator with a stake in the competition.
Paimon: A stake in the competition? That sounds serious!
Thabit: It is, actually. I may lose my job over this competition.
Thabit: You may have already heard about that Kautilya guy. He wants to use trained Fungi to replace some of the mercenaries in protecting important areas or performing dangerous tasks.
Thabit: However, the situations that mercenaries face are often complex. They require a large amount of experience and split-second decision-making to get the job done. It's not so much whether the Fungi can fulfill the task or not — it's the possibility that the Fungi might be taken advantage of by criminals.
Paimon: Really? We've never heard of that before.
Paimon: But no one in their right mind would send their Fungi companions into combat with other monsters, right? What is that Kautilya guy thinking...?
Traveler: ...
Thabit: I would have been able to casually enjoy the show if I hadn't heard that.
Thabit: Hopefully, the wealthy merchant that sponsored the competition has a good head on his shoulders. There's a domineering quality to his movements. It's safe to assume he's been through quite a bit as well.
Thabit: He should know that people are always more reliable than trained beasts or monsters during critical moments.
Traveler: Let's leave him alone...

## Talk 15

Najah: Who would've thought that heathen would be capable of something like this?
Traveler: Heathen?
Paimon: You must be pretty angry to use a word like that. Who are you talking about?
Najah: Ahem, since you asked so earnestly, I'll have to share my complaints with you!
Najah: It's about the organizer, Kautilya... that arrogant and self-indulging researcher. Don't you guys find him repulsive?
Traveler: (You remain silent but curious.)
Paimon: Huh...? Wha...? Oh! Yeah!
Paimon: We haven't really spoken to him before... But isn't it a little rude to talk about someone in public?
Najah: Oh, you don't need to worry about that! I was his student and experienced my share of his tyranny along with countless others!
Najah: Man, that Kautilya guy knows nothing about respect. He summoned his students like servants, making us do all sorts of chores for him for free...
Najah: And when it came to our theses, he would either brush us off by telling us that he was busy with work, send them back, reject them, or sometimes just refuse to look at them. He's ruined the academic futures of more than a few students!
Traveler: That's terrible!
Paimon: That's terrible!
Najah: Thankfully, he went off to focus on some research project later on, and another researcher took over our theses. If that didn't happen, my future would've been ruined as well...
Najah: I wasn't surprised when I heard that his sour reputation followed him everywhere he went! He's even rude to people more distinguished than him. I'd be shocked if someone with a personality like his ever made it anywhere!
Najah: When he was speaking on the podium, he said, "the winner carries on Mr. Elchingen's legacy..." In some places, you could only say something like that about someone who had already passed away.
Najah: How could anyone bear to listen to him? He accepted Mr. Elchingen's generous donation and immediately spoke about him as if he were dead. Wouldn't you be irritated if you had to work with him?
Traveler: There's no need to get so upset...
Paimon: Yeah, you said you don't need to listen to him at all anymore, so there's no need to get so angry. You should be happy now that you have nothing to do with him!
Najah: Hmph... I suppose you do have a point.
Najah: I was planning on badmouthing him a little more, but from the looks of things, there's no need to torment myself over it anymore. I should be celebrating!
Najah: Thank you, I feel much better now...
Traveler: (You give Paimon a signal with your eyes.)
Traveler: Capable of what?
Najah: Ahem, since you asked so genuinely, I shall share it with you.
Najah: This competition's "Floral Jelly" is pretty neat. It's basically a gel concocted from a special type of plant. Not only can it store nutrients and potions Fungi need for an extended period, but it also makes it easier for the Fungi to absorb them...
Najah: The skills that the Fungi gain from using the Floral Jelly are only temporary and won't deal lasting damage to their opponents. Any wounds will automatically heal shortly after the competition is over.
Najah: You know, Fungi don't exactly "eat" anything. Instead, they "absorb" nutrients from a specific environment through a unique process. So, as you can see, it would be pretty troublesome to have the Fungi consume something solid...
Paimon: "Absorbing" doesn't sound any different from "eating"...
Najah: "Absorbing" and "eating" are two completely different things!
Paimon: Take it easy... We're not being nitpicky... It's just, "eating" sounds simpler and it's easier to understand...
Traveler: Don't be upset...
Najah: Erm... I'm sorry, I don't mean to take it out on you... It might be because my thesis has been scrutinized too many times, and I've picked up some bad habits along the way.
Najah: I can't let myself turn into Kautilya. I have to be zen... Have to be zen...
Najah: Anyways, I have no idea how that guy managed to make something as amazing as Floral Jelly. From an academic perspective, he truly created something great.
Najah: Hmm... Maybe I can recreate it using the same method as to make a pudding with flour and other ingredients...
Traveler: Paimon didn't mean anything bad...
Traveler: Let's leave her alone...

## Talk 16

Paimon: Look no further! The first ever Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament is about to begin! We anticipate your arrival!
Traveler: Training Fungi to fight each other?
Paimon: But Fungi are monsters! We can't let this go ahead! It's way too dangerous...
Paimon: Let's go check out the tournament. If it's as dangerous as it sounds, at least we'll be there to stop things from getting too out of control.
Traveler: That's a very unexpected mode of entertainment...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Balfour: Greetings, the two of you. Do you want to train your Fungi, or are you looking for someone to answer your questions?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We want to train Fungi.
Balfour: Okay, make sure to use the Floral Jelly according to the instructions in the recipe.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: The name, "Floral Jelly"...
Balfour: Ha, I know what you're gonna say!
Balfour: I hear that the Vahumana researchers studied manuscripts from all over Teyvat and came to the preliminary conclusion that using certain suffixes in a name makes it sound extremely cute. I have to say, I kinda agree!
Balfour: Kautilya repeatedly emphasized that his research is "glorious and ground-breaking," and that it needed a name that's out of this world... But Mr. Elchingen rejected all of his proposals.
Balfour: Mr. Elchingen believed that since most people find Fungi to be cute little creatures, it would only be fitting if the official names used in the competition followed suit.
Balfour: After several heated debates, the name "Floral Jelly" was retained, along with the easy-to-understand name, "Wisdom Orb."
Balfour: But Mr. Elchingen did let Kautilya decide the other names. It's a good thing that most of those names are only used to communicate with future collaborators and aren't used by the contestants.
Paimon: What's with this Kautilya guy? It seems like he's always trying to show off how amazing he is. It seems like he's really pushy.
Traveler: He shouldn't do that, even if he truly is amazing.
Balfour: You think so too, huh?
Balfour: He doesn't get along with many of the staff. Even Mr. Elchingen has to make compromises with him at times.
Balfour: If it weren't for his irreplaceable technology and Mr. Elchingen continuously comforting the staff... the team of organizers probably would've fallen apart a long time ago.
Balfour: It's obvious why Kautilya kept running into dead ends before Mr. Elchingen sponsored him financially.
Traveler: Elchingen is clearly more reasonable.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: About the competition...
Balfour: You can go and take a look at the promotion board if there's anything else you're unsure about!
Balfour: The staff will update the progression of the competition on the promotion board. I hear that they're planning to include interactive events as well. The events will begin once the popularity of the competition reaches a certain point.
Balfour: They might even start to sell a competition highlight "film" after the competition progresses to a certain point.
Traveler: What determines if the competition is popular enough...?
Paimon: That sounds like a pretty harsh requirement, don't you think? The competition venue isn't exactly outstanding. You sure it's gonna work?
Balfour: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that at all. The center of Sumeru commerce, Wikala Funduq, is right next to the arena, and the bridge to the harbor is not too far off either. Any traffic that moves through the area will definitely be able to see the venue.
Balfour: Besides, we've also put up a promotional poster on the bulletin board in Sumeru City. Many of the competitors and audience are here because they saw it.
Paimon: Ohh, we saw it too! So you were the one that put up the advertisement on that bulletin board!
Balfour: Haha, it's pretty good, right? I must say, writing marketing material is one of my strong suits!
Balfour: I'm doing some of the reporting for the competition too. I'll do my best to describe your performance excitedly!
Paimon: It feels like you're in charge of a lot of the work that's being done here. From managing the Floral Jelly and organizing the events to writing promotional material and reporting...
Balfour: Oh, it's nothing compared to the salary that Mr. Elchingen is paying me. I'm being paid ten times what I was making before... Ahem!
Balfour: Anyways, Mr. Elchingen said it best! He said that those capable should take on more responsibility. I'm more than willing to give my all to a boss like him.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: See you.
Balfour: I'll see you next time! Good luck!
