Wagner: There's nothing to be said. Dragon or no dragon, I'll be here.
Wagner: As long as there's life in me, the fires of Wagner's smithy will not go out.

Wagner: The tempest is precisely the time to practice perseverance. If one were to be terrified at a little wind, then forging a respectable weapon is simply out of the question!
