Nami: This is an important sea route. There are tons of ships passing in and out, so I have to be vigilant in standing guard...

Traveler: You seem pretty anxious.
Nami: Uh... Ahaha, is it really that obvious...
Nami: Actually, I've always been the nervous sort. Maybe it's because I've always had sharp eyes. The more you can see, the more pressure you feel, you know?
Nami: I can see a long way out from here. The last time I looked out from here to the sea, I saw an outlander vessel with people on it dressed all fancy. They had masks, too.
Nami: ...Were they the Fatui? I have to be more careful. We can't let them reach the shore willy-nilly.

Traveler: Goodbye, then.

Traveler: That's definitely something worth looking out for.
Nami: See? I knew I was right.
Nami: I've been more strict with people coming in and out from the harbor recently as well. We don't just need to stop Shogunate operatives from getting in, but we need to guard against smuggling and stowaways as well.
Nami: Harbors are transport hubs, after all. Can't ever be too careful.

Traveler: You should really relax a bit.
Nami: I've been trying, you know? I've tried all sorts of methods that a friend recommended to me, like bathing under a waterfall, jogging at midnight... and things like that.
Nami: But I don't feel like any of these measures have worked. I've asked that friend before, and he just says that I need to "bear with it for a while," and that I'll be fine once I "surpass my limits."
Nami: What does that even mean?
