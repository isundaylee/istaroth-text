Traveler: Grand Conservator?
Nizam: Simply put, it's the director of the House of Daena in the Akademiya.
Nizam: Everyone is free to request knowledge from the Akasha, but the access to some important texts and primary sources requires the approval of the Grand Conservator.
Nizam: So the scholars of the Akademiya are very concerned about this matter.
Nizam: It doesn't matter to me... But Vikram and I had drinks together, so I can't support him, or else it may look rather suspicious.
