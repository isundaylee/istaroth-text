Traveler: Shikanoin Heizou's Message
Observe Sign-In Board: Itto, I've received your invitation letter. Everyone's happy for you.
Observe Sign-In Board: We believe that you've got a good head for event planning. If you work a little harder, I'm sure you'll stop having to report to us all the time.
Observe Sign-In Board: So please, take these Lavender Melons with compliments from the Police Station.
Observe Sign-In Board: Oh, yes. Madam Kujou Sara also wishes us to pass this message along on her behalf: "The Tenryou Commission is watching you. Do not forget that."
