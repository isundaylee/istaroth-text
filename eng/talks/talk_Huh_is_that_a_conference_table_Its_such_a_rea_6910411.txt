Chasca: Huh... is that a conference table? It's such a reassuring presence. Once both sides of an argument are willing to sit down and talk, there's a good chance things will finally move forward.
Chasca: It can take a lot of work just to get to that stage. Some people are so stubborn, you pretty much have to drag them kicking and screaming to the negotiation table.
Chasca: So although this is where people formally reach an agreement, most of the groundwork is usually laid away from the table.
