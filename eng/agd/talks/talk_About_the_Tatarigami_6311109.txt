Traveler: About the Tatarigami...
Kujou Masahito: If we were able to gain more an upper hand during the war, we could have used this matter as a bargaining chip.
Kujou Masahito: But since the peace talks are over, there's no point considering that what-if now.
Kujou Masahito: I must say that Sangonomiya Kokomi really is quite impressive...
Kujou Masahito: If a such a great disaster happened under another leader's watch, it would surely have hurt their image and restrained their next steps...
Kujou Masahito: But she rooted out the people who performed the inside job and punished them swiftly and severely. If anything, this whole disaster became a way for her to consolidate her position.
Kujou Masahito: Considering that we were up against such a frightening foe... All the more do I not regret negotiating a peaceful settlement.
