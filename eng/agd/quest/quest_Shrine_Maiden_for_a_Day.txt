### Additional Talk 1

Maki: I hope your omamori will bring our visitors good luck.

### Additional Talk 2

Inagi Hotomi: I pray that the Electro Archon will bless that lady and her granddaughter...
Traveler: I wanted to ask â€” does she have vision problems?
Inagi Hotomi: Oh, you noticed? Yes, she can't see very well. We always get a little worried for her safety every time she comes up the mountain.
Inagi Hotomi: But she always refuses our offers to help. She insists that she knows the route like the back of her hand after walking it so many times in her life...
Inagi Hotomi: Luckily, there are shrine maidens along the way who can at least keep an eye on her.
Inagi Hotomi: May the Electro Archon watch over her and her granddaughter on their respective journeys...

### Additional Talk 3

Yae Miko: What's that? You want to open it now?
Yae Miko: Hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
