### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon's never seen a stone like this before, so Paimon can't tell what it is.
Paimon: All Paimon knows is that it's dangerous. Best we put it away for now.
Paimon: Okay, we've got it! Now let's get out of here.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: That was close! Paimon almost got blown away!
Paimon: Luckily Paimon managed to grab hold of your hair! Thanks.
Traveler: Good thing you didn't pull my hair out.
Paimon: Just what was that? Paimon thought we were gonna get eaten.
Paimon: It definitely has something to do with that weirdo who was talking to the dragon...
Traveler: I can't believe dragons exist in this world...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon gets why you're worried...
Paimon: Oh? What's that?
Paimon: There's some kind of shiny red thingy on the big rock over there...
Paimon: Let's go take a closer look.
Traveler: Is talking to dragons normal?
Paimon: Of course not!
Traveler: Good thing the dragon didn't notice us.
