Ohtli: Careful, next time might be when we find out who the winner really is.
Itotia: Couldn't look forward to it more.
Itotia: Let's hope you won't say "What a shame, it's a draw" again. I'm sick of hearing you say that.
Ohtli: It's not my fault that you can't beat more bad guys than I do.
Itotia: Allow me to remind you what the meaning of a draw is. It means I could say those words right back at you.
Ohtli: Then there's no point in fighting like this, is there? Let's just keep working hard, y'know? I mean, as opponents.
Itotia: What are you talking about? Of course we're opponents. I haven't reached the point where I need to team up with you yet.

Ohtli: ...What a shame...
Itotia: Stop, stop!
Ohtli: ...Another draw.
Itotia: You just have to fight me, don't you?
Ohtli: The day you beat me, I'll shut up for as long as you want.
Ohtli: But until then, I'll speak my mind.
Itotia: ...The day will come. So long as we're both standing here breathing, the day will come when we find out who the winner is!
Itotia: Not only am I going to make you shut up, I'm gonna make you take off that mask! And then we'll see whether you're wearing it because of all the scars underneath.
Ohtli: That'll depend on how good you are. Try killing half an enemy more than me, for starters.
