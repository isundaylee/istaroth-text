## Talk

Xiao: #...It's you, Traveler.
Xiao: Did something happen?

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Xiao: ...
Xiao: There are no ominous things here. It's a quiet place.
Xiao: But...
Traveler: But?
Xiao: It's too comfortable.
Xiao: I will protect this haven. For your sake.
Xiao: I know that I can never have a peaceful and carefree life.
Xiao: ...Still, your kindness is accepted.
Traveler: Not used to it?
Xiao: ...Yes.

## Talk

Traveler: *Want to chat?*
Xiao: ...Idle chatter?
Xiao: ...If you wish, I'll accompany you.
Traveler: I thought you'd refuse.
Xiao: Hm?
Xiao: To make a request but prepare yourself for rejection...
Xiao: Human interaction really is troublesome.
Xiao: Generally, I don't partake in activities like "chatting."
Xiao: But if it's with you... I'll try.
Traveler: How have you been?
Xiao: Are you asking about the effects of my karmic debt?
Xiao: ...No issues.
Xiao: It is of my own doing, so I alone will bear the consequences.
Xiao: ...I don't know if it's related to you, but recently, the pain from my karmic debt has been less excruciating.
Xiao: It's much easier to bear than before.
Xiao: As for any excess concerns... Best to leave that for yourself.
Traveler: You seem a bit reluctant.
Xiao: That's not it.
Xiao: I didn't expect you to make such a request.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Xiao: If you have free time, we can go to Liyue Harbor together...
Xiao: If not... never mind.
Traveler: Of course we can.
Xiao: Uh... alright.
Xiao: I have no intention of getting close to the lives of mortals.
Xiao: But I know that you often enter and leave the city, walking amidst the crowd.
Xiao: The stories of these times, or their joys... If I don't experience such things myself, it'll be hard to understand your thoughts.
Traveler: So... you're doing this for me?
Xiao: Yes, to understand you.
Xiao: I had a feeling that it would be difficult, but after having such thoughts, I can't simply sit back and do nothing.
Xiao: I will control myself while I am in the city.
Xiao: I'll try to speak... as little as possible.
Traveler: I'll be with you.
Xiao: Hmm...
Xiao: Let me know when you're ready to go.
Traveler: You can say whatever you want. I'll bail you out.
Traveler: Finally decided to integrate into city life?
Xiao: Ahem...

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Xiao.
Xiao: ...Morning.
Xiao: If you encounter a difficult situation, don't be stubborn. Call my name. I will make it right.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Xiao.
Xiao: Today...
Xiao: ...Forget it, it's nothing. Good night.

## Talk

Xiao: Short and squat wooden houses, sparsely scattered... Sometimes, a village like this can be easier to guard than a city.
Xiao: When hunting demons, I just want bystanders out of the area, so I can focus on fighting.
Xiao: ...So this is what human construction looks like up close.

## Talk

Xiao: The kitchen here is furnished just like Wangshu Inn's.
Xiao: Looking at the ingredients here... could you recreate that dish I'm familiar with? I assume you know the one...
Xiao: ...It's just an idle thought... I'm not expecting anything.
