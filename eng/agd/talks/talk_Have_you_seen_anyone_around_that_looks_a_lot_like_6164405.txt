Traveler: Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Helen: Oh, you're looking for someone, huh? Off the top of my head... no, nothing springs to mind.
Helen: I've duly noted your appearance, though. In the future, whenever I'm performing from somewhere high up, I'll keep an eye out for this missing person.
Helen: That's another advantage of being high up, in case you didn't know. You can see really far.
