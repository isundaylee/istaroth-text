Traveler: And why do you say that?
Apoxpalon: Let me give you a practical example. Say that on a certain date, a long time ago, ta-da! You were born into the Children of Echoes.
Apoxpalon: Good news â€” the lands of the tribe are rich in valued minerals. Everyone can make a living by mining stones. Between making jewelry, forging weapons, and conducting business with other peoples, there's tons of fun to be had.
Apoxpalon: The bad news, of course, is that this land also produces nothing but stones. If you want anything else, you'll have to trade for it... using stones.
Apoxpalon: What do you think? Simple and easy to understand, right?
