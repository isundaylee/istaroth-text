# Suspicious Crepes Suzette

Crepes with fillings. The first bite is so bland you wonder if you've lost your sense of taste. The second bite is so unbearably sweet that you wish you actually had lost it... Such a stimulating culinary experience is like riding a waverider into a storm: Even if you make it to the shore, you'll be traumatized.
