Traveler: This place looks like a library.
Osse: Well, more of an archive, but your description isn't off either.
Osse: Ancient theatrical scripts, music scores, all the stories of things that have and have not happened... All of them were penned down and stored here.
Osse: Someone once believed that if all the possibilities in every story were exhausted, the secrets of fate would be unveiled...
Osse: But the truth was not as complicated as he believed. Each person's fate is charted by their wishes, and the possibilities are not so great in number in the first place.
Osse: Perhaps he, too, understood that in the end...

Traveler: Tell us about your relationship to this castle...
Osse: You've guessed it already, I reckon. In the past, when I could still change my form freely, he... and I, and many of our companions dwelled here.
Osse: In those days, a new nation had just been born, and as far as we were concerned, the possibilities were yet endless.
Osse: Here, we organized the classics, researching music theory and magic, in the hopes that we might tame this perilous power and use it to open up a brighter age.
Osse: But... These possibilities would quickly become lost to us, and I alone remained...
Traveler: Osse...
Osse: It's fine. These things happened a long time ago.
