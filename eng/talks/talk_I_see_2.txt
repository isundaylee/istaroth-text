Vimeur: Um, it seems that Lady Furina has left the Palais Mermonia and no longer involves herself in trials.
Vimeur: Oops, I guess it's easy to slip into old habits when addressing her... Well, not that it matters. Whatever the case may be, she has dedicated herself to serving Fontaine for hundreds of years.
Vimeur: And even if she's not present, the trial will proceed without issues. You should have faith in the impartial judgments of our judges.
