Traveler: The cook?
Vasco: Listen to me. When you venture out to the sea, you don't want to be the heaviest person around!
Vasco: I'll skip the details, but you get it, right?
Vasco: Anyway, the captain "jettisoned" me, too, when we got back to the dock.
Vasco: To prevent myself from the cook's fate, I'm considering getting a diving certificate from Fontaine before adventuring again.
Vasco: But I heard the water in Fontaine is different from here, so it won't be a useful endeavor.
Vasco: Maybe I should just stay on land?
