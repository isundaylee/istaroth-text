## Talk

Kujou Sara: #We meet again, Traveler.
Kujou Sara: Huh. This place seems in good order.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kujou Sara: Though it is not as extensive as the Kujou Clan's estate, I find it comfortable enough.
Kujou Sara: So everything here was built according to your designs? I did not know you possessed such abilities.
Kujou Sara: If we ever need to expand the Kujou Clan residence, I'll be sure to find you.
Traveler: Uh, no need...
Kujou Sara: What's the matter? Are you unwilling to assist?
Kujou Sara: Heh, either way, I'm not here to twist your arm. You needn't worry.
Kujou Sara: In fact, there is little that can be changed about the Kujou Clan residence. I mean, it would never become a place like this, at least.
Kujou Sara: I've never visited a place filled with such vitality and happiness...
Traveler: I'm up to the challenge!
Kujou Sara: I have not yet mentioned any specifics and you already agree so readily?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kujou Sara: Seeing as I have nothing better to do, I'll comply.
Kujou Sara: I suppose I have grown accustomed to spending most of my time in solitude. I seldom have the opportunity to speak with others, so perhaps it'd be better for you to start and I answer.
Kujou Sara: Alright, ask away.
Traveler: This kinda feels like taking an exam, it's making me nervous.
Kujou Sara: Hmm?
Kujou Sara: Interesting. Your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.
Kujou Sara: But I should remind you that I've never viewed you as a subordinate.
Traveler: Uh...
Kujou Sara: *sigh* It's difficult to converse with me, isn't it?
Kujou Sara: To be honest, I've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.
Kujou Sara: However, there are many subtleties in communication, it is difficult to grasp in such a short time.
Kujou Sara: If mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then I am confident I can improve with more practice.
Traveler: Yes, you will certainly get better with practice.
Kujou Sara: Hm. Good.
Kujou Sara: In that case, I select you as my training partner! You can come talk to me as often as you like. Is that alright?
Traveler: Don't you have anything you'd like to ask me?
Kujou Sara: I do, but if I ask, then you must reply.
Kujou Sara: If you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. Have you made up your mind?

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Kujou Sara: For as long as I can remember, I've been accustomed to handling various matters myself...
Kujou Sara: Though I once did have the thought of raising pets, due to various circumstances, I was never able to...
Traveler: What kind of pet are we talking about here?
Kujou Sara: Nothing in particular. I just thought it would be nice to have a companion.
Kujou Sara: The commission is a whirlwind of people and unexpected complications, so I often relish opportunities to get away for assignments in the field.
Kujou Sara: Whenever I think about it, I can only conclude that I have no time to care for a pet. Please, forget that I ever mentioned it.
Kujou Sara: But growing up without a companion is not a pleasant experience... Everyone is the same in this regard — pets, people, even tengu.
Traveler: You could have a pet. Why not just keep it here?
Kujou Sara: Hah, I suppose you are right.
Kujou Sara: If I were to keep a pet here, I would certainly need to consult you first. What kind of pet do you think would be best?
Kujou Sara: I know! How about a Red Horned Lizard? It's a solitary creature and doesn't require much interaction.
Traveler: Perhaps a cat would be better...
Kujou Sara: A cat? How could I tell whether it's in a good or bad mood?
Kujou Sara: I have no experience in this matter. I'm not entirely sure if I'm qualified to be a pet's "master."
Kujou Sara: However, because this is a matter between the two of us, you must also hold up your end of the bargain.
Kujou Sara: Hm, to make things easier for you, I will take responsibility for the most difficult part... playing and interacting with it.
Traveler: So you mean that I'll have to take care of its...
Kujou Sara: Exactly. You will be responsible for feeding and cleaning up after it. That's all.
Kujou Sara: Oh, but first and foremost, we must come up with a memorable name for our pet.
Kujou Sara: There is no rush, we can discuss it further when we have some ideas to share.
Traveler: Perhaps a dog would be better...
Kujou Sara: A dog? You can determine their mood just by looking at their wagging tail, right?

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Sara!
Kujou Sara: #Morning, Traveler.
Kujou Sara: I have already completed five sets of bow exercises. If you are up to it, I would not mind accompanying you for another five.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Sara.
Kujou Sara: Going to bed at this hour? Perhaps there is something on your mind?
Kujou Sara: If so, there is no harm in telling me. If not, then all the better. There's no reason for you to worry needlessly.
Kujou Sara: #If there's nothing else, then... good night, Traveler.

## Talk

Kujou Sara: Impressive. This courtyard is every bit as striking as the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission.
Kujou Sara: Maintaining an orderly residence incentivizes us to adhere also to the rules that give order to our lives.
Kujou Sara: I must commend you for your insight in having discerned this principle.

## Talk

Kujou Sara: At first glance, this camp seems organized along arbitrary lines. But on closer inspection, the underlying principles become clear. I would even say they are rather inspiring.
Kujou Sara: Was this an accidental achievement on your part? Or have you studied the art of war in great depth?
Kujou Sara: Either way, in accordance with established military convention, those who demonstrate outstanding capabilities ought to be rewarded.
