# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Sigewinne: Yes! This place is so bright and open — it's nothing like living underwater. Plus, the layout really reflects your personality. It feels novel but also comfortable.
Sigewinne: I took a look around. There doesn't seem to be a production zone, and no one's busying themselves earning Credit Coupons... It's the sort of place where you can relax your mind and body.
Sigewinne: But I guess that means nutritious meals aren't an imperative around here... Hmm, I'll just have to find some other way to look after everyone's health, then.
Traveler: You don't need to worry about work here.
Sigewinne: Hehe, it's no problem. It doesn't feel like work, anyway. You could say it's more of a hobby or a passion... Maybe a bit of both!
Sigewinne: Let's see... How many years has it been...? Well, I might not know how long I've been working, but I do know I've enjoyed every second of it！
Sigewinne: Of course, an empty infirmary makes me happier still, because that means everyone is healthy!
Sigewinne: Oh, that reminds me, my medicine kit is almost empty!
Sigewinne: Would you mind purchasing some ingredients for me the next time you're out? Here's the list.
Sigewinne: Oh, and here's some Mora, too. Tell me if it wasn't enough, okay? I'll be sure to make up the difference.
Traveler: There's no need to exchange Mora between us.
Sigewinne: Huh...? Oh, I see... We'll use Credit Coupons, then!
Traveler: "S—Some other way"?
Sigewinne: Yep! You don't need to worry, though. Figuring out what that method should be is my job!
Sigewinne: I'll be sure not to cause any trouble. You won't even notice anything!
