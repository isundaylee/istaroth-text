Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Yaoyao: Hmm... Are you interested in finches? I think they sing very beautifully.
Yaoyao: And I can sing too, by the way, hehe!
Traveler: Oh, really?
Yaoyao: Yeah! In the past, while my parents busied themselves planting herbs, I would often run off into the hills and forests to play...
Yaoyao: And there was one time I encountered a large finch teaching a smaller finch how to sing.
Yaoyao: The big finch would sing a line, the small finch would follow along, and so would I. ♪ *whistle*~ ♪
Traveler: You should come over to play more often in future!
Yaoyao: Sure, can't say no to that!
Yaoyao: And to thank you for "taking me under your wing," allow me to teach you the song of the finches.
Yaoyao: Don't worry, it's waaaay easier than learning to use a spear!
Traveler: Actually, I use a sword...
Yaoyao: Oh, don't worry, Master taught me this thing called... ah, "understanding by analogy"!
Yaoyao: I want you to see this as just us having some fun, not studying a difficult class or anything.
Yaoyao: So let's do it like this: I'll sing a line, and you'll follow after me.
Yaoyao: Don't sweat the other stuff. I'll make the arrangements!
Traveler: Most fascinating...
Yaoyao: Isn't it? This is what they call, um, "finding joy in the little things"!
Yaoyao: And I wanna share this little bit of joy with you.
