## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Haddo: It might be more exciting if we had made the rail tilt a little more... It's about the rotation angle in the air... *cough*
Paimon: Oh, Haddo!
Haddo: It's you... *cough* Enjoying your days in the Veluriyam Mirage?
Traveler: We've had a lot of fun!
Haddo: That's good... *cough* It's good to hear that you're having a good time.
Haddo: Oh, speaking of which... *cough* Would you like to try one of these test mini-carts?
Paimon: Test? Do carts even need to be tested?
Haddo: Yeah. See the site behind me? That's where Choo-Choo Carts are tested. Hehe, do you remember the Torrential Twister?
Haddo: This is where that rail line was born... *cough* Even with the Preprint and the Streaming Projector, a properly designed route is essential to the whole process.
Haddo: So it's important that we design and test the rails in advance so we can collect feedback for future iterations... Right now it's just... just more or less... what Jeroney calls "overstimulating."
Haddo: The test site for small carts has three rails for gradient testing. *cough* Choo-Choo Carts can go a bit faster on these rails...
Haddo: They are called... *cough* "Meh, It's Okay Rail," "Kinda Dizzy Now Rail," and "Aaaah! Please Slow Down Rail." Oh, if you're wondering, Ferdinand came up with the names.
Paimon: Hey, how's Ferdinand doing?
Haddo: He's alright. He just needs some, um, fresh air...
Haddo: Anyway, since all three are faster than... *cough* All three tests are faster than the rails outside, so I recommend that you begin with the "Meh, It's Okay Rail."
Haddo: Whaddaya say? Brave enough to give it a go?
Traveler: Let's do this!
Haddo: I like your confidence! Go find the Hydro Eidolon in charge of the three test rails. It'll be happy to activate the test for you.
Traveler: Nope, I've got other plans...
Haddo: No hurry. *cough* The Hydro Eidolon in charge of the three test rails is always there. Feel free to come test whenever you've got time...
Traveler: Is your cough getting better?
Haddo: *cough* I'm not expecting it to get better. But it's alright, a cough can't stop my passion for designing tracks...
