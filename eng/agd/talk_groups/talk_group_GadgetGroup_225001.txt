Please have a seat, and let our fine establishment serve you the finest teas of Qiaoying Village, washing away your fatigue and soothing the body and mind!
Message: "The tea is actually pretty good, but the storytelling is terrible. What was that story I heard last time...? Fujin's Three Captures of the White Snake?"
Message: "That's nothing less than a story about the Great Adeptus Fujin! How can it be revised so haphazardly? Alas, moral and artistic standards are degenerating by the day, and the character of people today is far inferior to that of their ancestors..."
Reply: "There seems to have been a misunderstanding, dear customer. "Three Captures of the White Snake" is a famous old tale from Liyue Harbor. We couldn't change it even if we wanted to."
Reply: "If the story is not to your taste, we'll be telling "Jade Tales" in two days time. We hope you'll return to patronize our establishment."

Message: "Listen! When I was out on a field investigation a few days ago, I saw a huge beast, it was beautiful, absolutely stunning!"
Message: "Although there were several mountains between us, the moment I went to grab my Kamera, it jumped up and just disappeared... Could it have been one of those Adepti that I've heard about in the legends of Liyue!?"
Reply: "Adepti have always gathered at Chenyu Vale since ancient times, and meeting an Adeptus isn't a miracle that only happens once every thousand years."
Reply: "If this is true, your destiny seems to be entangled with the adepti. Why don't you ascend to Yilong Dais and offer a stick of our famous Crane Crown Incense to them to pray for your good fortune to last?"

Unsigned Poem: "Beside a bamboo bridge with flowers floating on flowing clear waters, a jade mist lingers on Mt. Xuanlian. The Adepti have been riding the clouds for thousands of years, while the jade pendant rests against the islet."
Unsigned Poem: "The fog is thick, the stone path is far from Lingmeng, the spring is cold, and the pine forest is embroidered with snow. Who would have thought that the moss looks just the same as in the past."
