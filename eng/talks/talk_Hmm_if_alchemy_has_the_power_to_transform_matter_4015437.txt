# Talk Dialog

Venti: Hmm, if alchemy has the power to transform matter... I wonder if it could also be used to turn water into wine?
Venti: Wouldn't it be amazing if all the water in Cider Lake turned into actual cider?
Venti: In that case, at least, no matter how short on Mora I am, I'd never be short on liquor, haha...
Traveler: How about I treat you to a drink instead?
Venti: A fine alternative, haha. Who would I be to refuse such a generous invitation?
Venti: We'll go as soon as your work is finished. How does that sound?
Paimon: You really haven't changed at all... Just the mention of alcohol practically has you chomping at the bit!
Venti: Well, it's not everyday I get the chance to reunite with such dear friends. What's a reunion without a generous serving of wine?
