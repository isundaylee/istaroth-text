Traveler: Well, you look pretty young.
Copa: Ah, when it comes to age, there's always someone older than me, and always someone younger.
Copa: Really, I'm not that old, nor do I lament my age. Have you met that kid named Cadmael?
Copa: He's a few years younger than me, and I'm one of his maternal cousins by relation.
Copa: Hasn't been smooth going for that kid lately, I'll tell you what.

Traveler: Are you worried about him?
Copa: ...Yeah. But some might consider my concern one-sided.
Copa: On the one hand, I hope he doesn't give up on flying tests so easily. After all, he's still young, and it's not as if he's talentless.
Copa: But on the other hand, I don't want him to waste too much time failing and hope he can find a career for himself soon that will bring him a sense of both satisfaction and achievement.
Copa: You see, not even I can wrap my head around such life choices. If I ever figure it out, I'll go give him some guidance.
