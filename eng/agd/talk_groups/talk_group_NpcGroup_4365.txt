Baharak: The previous adventure failed... But it's not the right time to give up!
Baharak: Now that we have the sponsorship from Mr. Vikram, it's bound to be successful this time!

Traveler: The previous adventure?
Baharak: The last time, the time before, and the time before before... It's always for the traces of King Deshret's kin!
Baharak: You are here at Caravan Ribat. I presume you have heard of the legend of King Deshret among the desert inhabitants?
Baharak: The true "God of Wisdom" in the ancient times who was long forgotten... I don't know if this is true or not, but sounds like King Deshret was a god with many followers, right?
Baharak: So even if King Deshret doesn't exist anymore, there could still be some kin left... Like a dragon or something?

Traveler: Best of luck to you.
Baharak: Thanks!

Traveler: ...Or perhaps a fox?
Baharak: Ugh... Fox? Doesn't seem formidable to me...
Baharak: An adventurer should have high expectations. Let's say, dragons, top of all elemental creatures!
Baharak: ...Of course, you can set a bigger goal. But better address the actual problem first.
Baharak: Anyways, my first little goal is... not to get lost outside Aaru Village just yet. The young lady in the village is quite kind, but it'd be embarrassing to trouble her all the time...

Traveler: The young lady?
Baharak: Well, she's a nice person. She helped me out when I was lost in the desert.
Baharak: When we first met, I was in shambles. She didn't recognize me in my green adventurer suit. She took me back to the village and gave me food and water after I explained to her what happened.
Baharak: And after that... I bothered her several times, hehe.
Baharak: So if you're in danger in the desert, head to Aaru Village for help.
Baharak: She has a different color in each eye. You'll know at the sight of her.

## Talk

Traveler: Mr. Vikram?
Baharak: Yes, a generous Vahu{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}mana researcher. He's very interested in the legends of King Deshret, and has helped many adventurers.
Baharak: My adventure this time has been sponsored by him. I'm here helping him look for someone at Caravan Ribat and pass on a message.
Baharak: But the girl he's looking for seemed to have received the Dusk Bird and gone to Sumeru City already. Did I get it wrong...?

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

Baharak: That was fun! Don't worry, I'm sure you'll beat me someday soon.

Baharak: I'm impressed! You're really good at this. Would you mind teaching a newbie some tricks?
