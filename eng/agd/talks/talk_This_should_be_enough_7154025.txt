# Talk Dialog

Eula: This should be enough...
Traveler: Eula, this gift envelope is for you.
Eula: #This is... for me? Thank you, Traveler! This is the first time I've received something like this.
Eula: I didn't expect to run into you here. Amber and I just split up to go shopping. We're bringing back gifts for everyone at the Knights of Favonius.
Traveler: What did you get?
Eula: Some small trinkets and toys. Oh, and some tea for Jean. It's from Qiaoying Village.
Eula: I heard that tea also has an energizing effect, so I thought it might be a nice change of pace for her.
Eula: Still, the brewing process for this kind of tea is pretty complicated. The vendor had to spend a lot of time explaining it to me.
Eula: Thankfully, I already knew a bit about tea etiquette, so I caught on relatively quick.
Eula: Here, this tea cake is for you â€” it's from Qiaoying Village. Amber really liked it, so I decided to buy some.
Eula: We're going to check out the Mingxiao Lantern later. Maybe we'll ask someone to take a picture for us.
Eula: I would do it myself, but unfortunately, neither of us brought a Kamera.
Traveler: See you.
Eula: Goodbye! Happy Lantern Rite!
