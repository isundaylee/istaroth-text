# The Millennial Mountains


## Talk 1

Stone Tablet: (This small stone tablet has the following words inscribed on it...)
Stone Tablet: ..."During the battle at The Chasm, I lost the use of my four limbs and thus was forced to dictate these words for someone else to record and carve here."...
Stone Tablet: ..."I survived that fierce battle, but each night where I thought of our fallen comrades was a sleepless one. And with my body in this state, oh, how I detested the fact that I was not privileged to join them."...
Stone Tablet: ..."I attempted to join them, only to have Rex Lapis hear of it and reprimand me, waking me from my stupor."...
Stone Tablet: ..."Alas, for I can no longer make use of his gift of Millelith armor and equipment. They shall only accumulate dust if left in my keeping, and so I leave them here for someone fated to come and claim them."...
Stone Tablet: ..."Everyone, though we can no longer do so in this life, let us be comrades again in the next. Let us then share the wine of sworn brotherhood once more, and defend Liyue from its foes!"...

## Talk 2

Wang: Oh, wow, you really found it! So... this is the "treasure of the Millelith," then?
Wang: Now, I've got no clue what's in there, but I'm sure that the soldier who left that treasure behind would be pleased to know that it was found.
Wang: It's been five hundred years since that disaster... When I think about how this place was once the site of such an intense battle, one in which countless forebears of ours sacrificed themselves, I can't help but wonder...
Wang: Did any of those people who went into battle alongside the Lord of Geo think that they would be remembered by people across the centuries?
Wang: Did they ever doubt or falter in their duties? And as for those who never gained a Vision, how did they remain loyal to a god who never showed them favor, even until death?
Traveler: Their god never left their side.
Wang: ...
Wang: Yes, you're right. Those with Visions, those without... We are all working towards a future with limitless potential. I mean, that's what they call motivation, am I right?
Wang: We're the same. We're not here for the good times in the past, or for some self-realization in the present... But we do this to support one another in leaving something of ourselves behind in the times we live in.
Wang: Maybe someday in the far future, The Chasm will also become our memorial.
Wang: The pits and the valleys, the sweat of generations of miners... They all bear witness to the tough road we have chosen.
Wang: Just like this memorial, this place will be here a hundred, even a thousand years from now, as testament to the fact that the sacrifices made here were not in vain.
Wang: Hehe, well, I'm not going to live to see that happen, obviously, but if someone does come here someday to toast us poor miners long after we're gone, that would be more than enough.
Traveler: They were loyal to their own decisions as well.

## Talk 3

Wang: The items you need to find are the Helm, the Feather, the Cup, the Sundial, the Flower, and the Spear.
Wang: That said, no one's found them all to this day, so...

## Talk 4

Wang: Tell me about the "Flower of Farsight."
Wang: It is said that the Flower of Farsight will only make itself known to those with such lofty desires that they might seem crazy to some, and thus is not something ordinary people can witness. Hmm, I wonder what sort of flower that would be?

## Talk 5

Wang: Tell me about the Skyfeather.
Wang: I've heard that the Skyfeather can only be obtained from an eagle on a certain mountaintop. That said, never in all my years have I seen someone who can pluck a feather from an eagle...

## Talk 6

Wang: Tell me about the Sundial of Ages.
Wang: They say that the Sundial of Ages would be remembered by all, such that time's passage would not cause it to lose its luster. Perhaps it has never been forgotten or lost after all?

## Talk 7

Wang: The items you need to find are the Helm, the Feather, the Cup, the Sundial, the Flower, and the Spear.
Wang: That said, no one's found them all to this day, so...

## Talk 8

Wang: Tell me about the Cup of Commons.
Wang: I've heard it said that the Cup of Commons will regain its dignity someday, even if it is obtained by bandits and crooks, or becomes a lowly guest at a humble table... But what does that even mean?

## Talk 9

Wang: Tell me about the Helm of Warding.
Wang: The Helm of Warding is said to rest in the room of an ordinary person, yet may not be summoned forth by anyone but a hero... Well, this was a story I used to fall asleep to, so...

## Talk 10

Wang: Tell me about the Warrior's Spear.
Wang: The Warrior's Spear is rumored to have been set up on a lone cliff, awaiting a valiant soul equal to it. Only then will it be content to once again enter time's eternal flow... Hah, what an exaggerated legend...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: See you...
Wang: Yes, see you... But take care now. The Chasm is still quite a dangerous place.
