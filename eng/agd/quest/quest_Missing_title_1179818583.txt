# Missing title (1179818583)

Traveler: ...Good luck to you.
Ulfr: Someday, I'll invite Flora to board a dandelion boat that I built by my own hand... It's just such a shame that my last few attempts all sank on the maiden voyage...
Ulfr: ...But every cloud has a silver lining. My swimming ability has improved greatly as a result!
Ulfr: Last time, I even had several crabs grab onto my eyelids. But I still managed to swim back to shore, even though I couldn't see.
Ulfr: Oh, and several more ended up in my pockets too... Here, you can have them. Now, I have a boat to build!
