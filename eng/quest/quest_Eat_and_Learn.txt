# Eat and Learn


## Talk 1

Jafar: You seem to be in a rush, my friend. What's bothering you?
Traveler: Lots of things...
Jafar: Ah... Indeed, I can see that you are tired and pressed for time.
Jafar: You must have something on your mind that needs to be resolved as soon as possible.
Jafar: Rather than rushing about, I'd like to invite you to have a delicious meal with me if you are willing to wait but a little while.
Jafar: Haste is indeed a normal part of life, yes... but as we often put it, even a raging river must sometimes flow peacefully through a serene stream.
Jafar: You must take a little break every now and then.
Jafar: Hmmm...
Jafar: Why don't we enjoy some Minty Bean Soup together?
Jafar: You don't have to pay me any Mora. Just help me find a sprig of Mint.
Jafar: Ah, yes â€” and don't be too picky when you search for that mint sprig.
Jafar: Remember, you are just looking for a regular sprig. You aren't looking for troubles of any kind.
Traveler: I'm alright, actually.
Jafar: Oh, that's good, that's good.
Jafar: Still, your steps are hurried. You seek to fix some problem or another, perhaps?
Jafar: Well, I don't know what problem it is that you seek to solve, but I have a suggestion...

Jafar: My pleasure. Enjoy your meal!
Jafar: To me, eating means leaving all my exhausting work and research behind for a time...
Jafar: I let my mind flow peacefully through that serene stream... this is how I relax.
Jafar: Well, enjoy your meal to the fullest. I hope that it can also put your mind at ease.
