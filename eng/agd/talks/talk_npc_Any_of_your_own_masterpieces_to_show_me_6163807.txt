Schulz: Any of your own masterpieces to show me?
Schulz: I have tried... The results are usually less than perfect, though. Master normally melts them back down again and redoes them.
Schulz: There was this one I was quite proud of... But Master wouldn't let me sell it from his shop â€” said it'd damage his reputation.
Schulz: So I took it out the side gate and gave it a few swings. Ended up sticking it in the ground there.
Schulz: There's a group of kids who hang out over there, seems to have got them interested... Anyway. I digress.
