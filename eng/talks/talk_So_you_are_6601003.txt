Traveler: So, you are...
Chanca: I'm the owner of the Weary Inn, and I also run a food stall at the entrance.
Chanca: Speaking of this place, I even stayed here for free back when I was a contestant. Who'd have thought I'd be the one in charge now, huh?

Chanca: If you did, that would make things a lot easier. You could stay with them, and you'd dine and bunk on the house â€” all you can eat, too!
