# Show Canceled


## Talk 1

Paimon: Well said back there, Nilou!
Nilou: I felt that I might have said a bit too much...
Nilou: Anyway, we better start preparing now. First, let's see what everyone thinks about the situation.
Paimon: Alright, time to poll everyone's thoughts!

## Talk 2

Paimon: He really seemed to care a lot about the theater...
Nilou: Once you get to know him, you'll realize that he's actually a big softie at heart. He'll even help out with furniture repair and painting the stage!
Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't think he had that in him at all!

## Talk 3

Paimon: "Her"?
Nilou: My teacher. She was an excellent dancer, but she's retired now.
Nilou: If we have time later, I'd be happy to tell you more about her.

## Talk 4

Nilou: I feel like the pieces are starting to fall into place...
Nilou: Let's head back to the theater and organize our thoughts.
Paimon: Sounds good! Inayah should also be back soon.

## Talk 5

Farhad: You're here! Is the theater actually closing!?
Hushang: He's been worried sick for a while now. He wouldn't stop talking the whole way back.
Farhad: H—Hey, you too!
Jut: What exactly happened? Did someone come down from the Akademiya?
Nilou: Yes. He told us that we have to shut down the theater within thirty days, and that it's going to be demolished...
Farhad: What the heck!? That came with no warning!
Afshin: *sigh* They're messing with us again.
Farhad: Don't tell me you'll have to listen to him?
Hushang: C'mon, you know the answer to that.
Farhad: Yeah, it IS a direct order from the Akademiya...
Nilou: There's no need to worry, though. I'm preparing for a public debate with the Akademiya.
Nilou: If I win, we might be able to overturn things and change their minds.
Jut: Really? That's terrific. You have my full support, no doubt about that.
Afshin: Mine too! So, what was their excuse, anyway? They still not a fan of the theater's programs?
Nilou: Yeah, something like that...
Farhad: Good thing they have the power to make rash decisions about things they don't even understand, huh?
Hushang: Yeah, they need to touch more grass, not books.
Afshin: Exactly. They want to look down on us? Haha, we'll look down on them first!
Jut: Don't worry, everyone here has your back. The Akademiya's recklessness won't get them any praise.
Farhad: Right. They might think that some forms of knowledge are more valuable than others, but everyone can equally appreciate art.
Farhad: If they don't believe that, send 'em my way. I got them beat on this subject.
Hushang: Maybe you can prepare some questions on the details of dance performance to make things harder for them at the debate?
Nilou: Hmm... Sounds like a good idea. Maybe that's something I should do.
Farhad: Ignore him — he's joking. Just do things your way.
Farhad: No matter what, we will always support you.
Nilou: Thank you all so much! Your understanding and support make me feel a lot better.
Jut: There are always more solutions than problems. If you need help during the debate, just shout and the entire Grand Bazaar will be at your beck and call.
Afshin: Heh, gotta show them who has the people's support!

## Talk 6

Nilou: There are signs that someone had stayed here very recently...
Paimon: But we can't confirm if it was Inayah or not.
Paimon: Let's take a look around first!
Inayah (???): Aaah—!
Paimon: Did you hear that?
Traveler: I heard a voice.
Nilou: I heard it, too. Let's investigate.
Traveler: Is it Inayah?

## Talk 7

Nilou: (No, there should be something else that's more relevant.)
Nilou: (Not quite right, but it's close. I almost have it...)
Nilou: (I can't seem to make a connection here.)
Rekhar: The most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Khasani: Art must first be appreciated by others to confer value.
Nilou: (Mr. Zubayr has been meticulously managing the theater. Everything checks out.)
Nilou: (Everyone is free to appreciate art — no form of art is inherently superior.)
Nilou: (Inayah really wants to win. She doesn't wanna lose anything else because of her painful past.)
Nilou: (The theater carries everyone's feelings, and serves as the bond that connects us all.)

## Talk 8

Paimon: It sounds like we're getting closer. The voice is coming from over there!
Nilou: Yeah, we're almost there!

## Talk 9

Sheikh Zubayr: ...Looks like this situation is really affecting her.

## Talk 10

Inayah: Stay back!
Paimon: It's Inayah! She's being attacked by wild animals!
Nilou: Inayah, don't be scared! We're coming to help!

## Talk 11

Sheikh Zubayr: Just notify the customers when you have time. There's no rush.

## Talk 12

Nilou: Abhi, have you seen Miss Inayah?
Abhi: No, Miss Nilou! Miss Inayah isn't back yet.
Paimon: Wasn't she just passing on a message? Does she really need this much time?
Traveler: Could she have started arguing with her father again?
Nilou: ...
Nilou: Ahhhh... Oh no.
Nilou: #Traveler, Paimon! I think I've messed up big time...
Nilou: What if Inayah never planned to come back?
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Calm down.
Nilou: It's just a gut feeling, but knowing her, she probably feels like she's completely responsible for what happened.
Nilou: She probably thinks that all of this happened because she was staying here.
Paimon: Oh right, as soon as her father showed up, she said that her father was targeting her. So she's felt like that this whole time...
Nilou: She has a long-standing conflict with her father. That's why she ran away from home.
Nilou: She doesn't think that we can win the debate, and she doesn't want to implicate us, so she thought leaving was the best thing to do...
Traveler: So, even after we decided to go for the debate...
Paimon: Mhm, and then she just quietly left afterward...
Traveler: She's too harsh on herself.
Nilou: Exactly. She's being too pessimistic. How will you know if you don't try?
Nilou: Anyway, first things first, we have to get her back!
Paimon: ...But where should we start? Sumeru is huge!
Nilou: I think I might know. Let's start by looking outside the city.
Nilou: Before I brought her to Zubayr Theater, she was staying at a remote campsite. She got a fever from drinking unclean water, so I carried her back.
Nilou: If she has nowhere else to go after leaving the theater, she might go back and strike out on her own again.
Paimon: Then let's go take a look!
Nilou: Yes, let's hurry.
Traveler: No one should bear all the blame.
Traveler: She still couldn't bring herself to support it.
Traveler: Please explain.

## Talk 13

Khasani: Although we can find a form of beauty in regret and disappointment, it makes no sense to just accept this world's tragedies.

## Talk 14

Nilou: Mr. Zubayr, we're trying to put together a list of arguments that might be useful. Any ideas?
Sheikh Zubayr: It won't be difficult to explain our position. They're in the wrong, and they know it!
Sheikh Zubayr: I have meticulously managed this theater's affairs for years, and I have abided by every procedure and obtained every permit.
Sheikh Zubayr: I did all of that to protect ourselves if something like this were to occur. I didn't expect them to disregard the rules altogether...
Traveler: This might have something to do with Inayah.
Sheikh Zubayr: Yes, I know. But anyone who's staying at the theater is one of us.
Sheikh Zubayr: If I can't even protect the members of the theater from outside pressure, then I have failed in my duty as a manager.
Sheikh Zubayr: In summary, you need sufficient confidence and strict adherence to the rules. At least for now, they don't have the authority to demolish the theater.
Sheikh Zubayr: As long as you double down on that point and force them to concede it, you'll gain an advantage.
Nilou: Alright, got it!
Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* I've seen many situations like this before. The Akademiya sure likes to get its nose into everyone's business...
Sheikh Zubayr: While you prepare for the debate, I will also prepare the theater for the potential aftermath. It's best to prepare for the worst outcome.
Sheikh Zubayr: Once you're done chatting, do me a favor and tell our customers that we're canceling all of our shows.
Paimon: Do we really have to...?
Sheikh Zubayr: Right now, no one's in the right frame of mind to perform. I have to consider both our staff and our customers. This is the only way.
Sheikh Zubayr: ...Nilou, you are incredible.
Sheikh Zubayr: With your talent and youth, you had the least to lose out of all of us. And yet, you were still the first to take a stand.
Nilou: I've never thought about leaving your theater, Mr. Zubayr. I truly love this place, and I want to keep dancing here.
Nilou: I also want to keep dancing with everyone else.
Sheikh Zubayr: You're becoming more and more like her...
Sheikh Zubayr: Do your best. We'll do all that we can, and leave the rest to fate.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Inayah: Th—Thank you...
Inayah: There weren't so many big animals in this area before. They chased after me for a long time...
Inayah: Sorry, I'm causing trouble for you again...
Nilou: Why did you leave by yourself?
Nilou: You really don't think we have a chance at winning the debate?
Inayah: No, I just thought it would take too much effort.
Inayah: Everything happened because of me. If I'm gone, then the situation will resolve itself.
Traveler: But everyone else is trying so hard.
Paimon: Yeah! Everyone's working together towards a happier ending. No one should be singled out for blame.
Inayah: It's alright if it's me. As long as the theater won't get demolished...
Inayah: You guys are the kindest people I've ever met. You shouldn't suffer so much because of me.
Nilou: Listen to me, Inayah.
Nilou: Even if you were the reason that all of this happened, no one would blame you.
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr said that you're one of us, so that means we will protect you.
Nilou: No matter what happens, we'll stand as one.
Inayah: Nilou, there will always be a victim, whether it's me or the theater. You can't eat your cake and have it, too.
Inayah: You can't win a debate against the Akademiya, especially since your opponent will be my father.
Traveler: Why are you so sure of this?
Inayah: My father is an extremely demanding man.
Inayah: He's always wanted me to become an exceptional researcher and his academic successor.
Inayah: I tried my best to meet his expectations, and did everything I could.
Inayah: But he still wasn't satisfied... or rather, he had just never been satisfied with me.
Inayah: I'm no genius, but whenever he berated me, it was always as if he was asking me, "Why aren't you a genius?"
Inayah: Yeah, like I'd know...
Paimon: So that's why you ran away from home?
Inayah: At first, I thought that Father would slowly come to terms with reality, but he just wouldn't stop berating me.
Inayah: For one exam, I earned the third-highest score.
Inayah: I thought that all my hard work had finally paid off, that I could finally make Father feel some modicum of joy.
Inayah: I even used the embroidery skills I learned at school to make a commemorative gift for him.
Inayah: I thought... "Even this daughter can make her father happy sometimes, right?"
Nilou: I see... When we were embroidering your gift before, I didn't feel like you were new at it.
Inayah: Yeah, sorry for not bringing it up. These are not pleasant memories for me.
Inayah: I was tired of him yelling at me every day. All I wanted was to see him smile at me.
Inayah: But... He was more angry than ever before once I'd given him my embroidery and told him my score. He flung my present to the side.
Inayah: "You think you should be proud of third place? Reflect on why you weren't first!"
Inayah: I forgot how long I had cried for. I only remember my parents arguing. My mother also thought he went overboard.
Inayah: They argued for such a long time. My father eventually stormed out and slammed the door behind him. I didn't get a single sentence of apology, or any words of comfort...
Inayah: I've completely given up. We're destined to never understand each other.
Nilou: How horrible...
Inayah: I don't think you can beat him in a debate, because he doesn't even understand what kind of place a theater is.
Inayah: He can never understand the relationship performers have with their audience. His life is devoid of camaraderie or friendship.
Inayah: He just wants everything to happen according to his wishes, as if the world revolves around him.
Inayah: What we cherish — our little place in this world — means nothing to him...
Paimon: It sounds like your past has had a huge impact on you.
Nilou: I understand now, Inayah.
Nilou: But, when we were preparing for the debate, I heard something quite wise. Maybe it'll help you.

### Additional Talk 2

Inayah: Well, I'm off to meet with him. Please wait here for me.
Nilou: Okay. Looking forward to your good news.
Nilou: Phew, that should be everything. The only thing left to do now is to wait until the debate.
Nilou: I'm not sure why, but I'm getting nervous again.
Paimon: You were great, Nilou! Your words won over Inayah.
Paimon: Talk like that during the debate, and you'll get an easy win!
Nilou: Thanks for that, Paimon.
Nilou: But I still feel like it'll be an uphill battle. I need to be calmer, cooler, and more collected.
Traveler: We haven't broken any rules.
Nilou: Yeah. I'm acting as everyone's representative, so I'll need to act brave, even if I won't feel like it.
Traveler: There's still one problem left unsolved.
Nilou: Huh? What's left?
Traveler: The theater's existence...
Paimon: Huh? What a strange question...
Paimon: Isn't a theater just a theater? Why would it need to be anything else?
Nilou: Wait... You're not asking what the theater DOES, but what it IS.
Nilou: Lemme think... Um, how can I put this? Hmm...
Traveler: Is it only for art and performance?
Traveler: Lots of people are rooting for us.

### Additional Talk 3

Jut: As things stand, there actually isn't much to worry about.
Hushang: Everything will work itself out.

### Additional Talk 4

Nilou: Ms. Rekhar has gone through a lot in her life, but she told us that she's very happy to live at the theater now.
Nilou: Although she ran into misfortune, it led her down a new path in life. She sees that as a blessing.
Nilou: She told me that the most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Inayah: Interpret it...?
Nilou: I can sympathize with your unhappiness at home, but after you ran away, you ended up at the theater and became one of us.
Nilou: Those unhappy experiences allowed you to really cherish your bonds with everyone, and also gave you the opportunity to become friends with us.
Nilou: Don't let your past suffering keep you from the new life that you've worked so hard to find.
Inayah: Oh...
Paimon: Let the past stay in the past.
Traveler: You don't have to be so hard on yourself anymore.
Inayah: When I ran away from home, I swore that I would leave my family conflict behind...
Inayah: But you're right, all I'm doing now is falling right back into it...
Nilou: Maybe you'll disappoint him, but that doesn't matter. You have a new future waiting for you.
Nilou: Don't let go of the answer you've worked so hard to find.
Paimon: That's right! If we put our heads together, there's bound to be a way!
Inayah: You're right, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Inayah: I'm not trying to meet his expectations, so why should I give up because of him?
Inayah: I can't afford to lose anything more... We have to win.
Inayah: The debate will not only protect Zubayr Theater, but also allow me to settle things with Father.
Traveler: That's right.
Paimon: That's the spirit!
Inayah: Let's go. I'll tell my father about the debate.
Inayah: I know him very well. Even if he looks down on us, I know how to make him accept.
Nilou: Alright, let's go.
Traveler: This is your new beginning.

### Additional Talk 5

Nilou: Ah, got it!
Nilou: When we were trying to find a way to save the theater, we heard many stories not of the theater, but of the people whose lives have been touched by it.
Nilou: Zubayr Theater is our reason for coming together. It connects us all in unique ways.
Nilou: In other words, it's like a bond!
Paimon: A bond?
Nilou: The theater provides money for Ms. Rekhar and her children, inspiration for Mr. Khasani, and enjoyment for the people of the Great Bazaar.
Nilou: It also gives Inayah shelter from her family... It has brought us together after taking care of every single one of us.
Nilou: And its story won't end here. In the future, many more people will come to the theater and receive its blessing.
Nilou: And we'll all be there for them. Our warm, welcoming community will show them the same kindness we were shown in the past.
Nilou: Aside from the delivery of performances, isn't this another reason for Zubayr Theater's continued existence?
Paimon: Yeah, that makes sense! We definitely felt that warmth during the preparations for the event.
Paimon: But, Paimon doesn't see how this will help in the debate.
Traveler: Inayah said that her father doesn't care for interpersonal relationships.
Paimon: Oh, gotcha. No matter how strong an opponent is, they'll have to go on the defensive if pressed on a weak point!
Nilou: I feel like that's another prong in our attack. Thank you so much.
Paimon: Paimon also feels a lot more relieved. Let's show him what we got!
Inayah: Sorry for the wait. I'm back.
Inayah: Things went a lot more smoothly than I expected. It didn't take long for him to accept the debate, and is set for two days from now.
Inayah: ...Why are you all smiling so much? Did something good happen?
Paimon: We realized that your dad might not be as scary as we had thought.
Nilou: Hee-hee, we've just finished our prep. Rest easy, it will all turn out well!
Nilou: We have to win... No, we WILL win, Inayah.
Inayah: Hehe, fingers crossed!
Traveler: This may be his weak point.

### Additional Talk 6

Farhad: This just came out of nowhere. What'll happen next?
Hushang: Beats me. Everyone else must also be at a loss.

### Additional Talk 7

Noticeboard (Zubayr Theater Billboard): Due to special circumstances, all theatrical performances have been cancelled and the resumption time has yet to be determined. Sorry about the inconvenience.

### Additional Talk 8

Noticeboard (Zubayr Theater Billboard): Due to special circumstances, all theatrical performances have been cancelled and the resumption time has yet to be determined. Sorry about the inconvenience.
