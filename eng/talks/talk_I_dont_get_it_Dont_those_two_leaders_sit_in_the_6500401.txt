Jacquetta: I don't get it. Don't those two leaders sit in the same office — in fact, don't they sit at adjoining tables? Why are their views different?
Isadora: It might be a communication issue...
Jacquetta: And every time I try to get a signature, if they aren't both missing, then one will ask me to get a second opinion from the other. I mean, would it kill them to get their story straight first!?
Isadora: Then maybe they don't have a good relationship...
Jacquetta: Also, more and more people are growing dissatisfied with the Palais's inaction regarding the "prophecy." One of the construction teams has even gone on strike...
Jacquetta: I mean, prophecies can't really be verified — we've got more practical problems to deal with!
Jacquetta: Yeah, that's true...
