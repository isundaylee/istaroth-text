# Hunters' Gathering


## Talk 1

Clorinde (Game Master): As you approach the tavern, you find a plainly-dressed woman standing nearby. She appears to be rather troubled about something.

## Talk 2

Clorinde (Game Master): As you venture further into the city, the streets appear largely empty. An elderly woman walks past. You see her shake her head as she puts away her wrinkled wallet.
Clorinde (Game Master): A nearby merchant folds his arms and gives you a disdainful look. You get the impression that he's someone who has long gotten used to the sight before him.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Should we try to go somewhere with more people?
Navia: Ooh, how about the city square! Follow me!

## Talk 4

Furina: What? A critical success? Your luck is through the roof today....
Clorinde (Game Master): ...
Clorinde (Game Master): As you begin to survey the man's condition, you're immediately able to see past the crude dressing on his leg and assess the inside of his wound.
Clorinde (Game Master): You've seen many such injuries before. If not properly treated, the man will likely fall victim to serious illness for the rest of his life.
Clorinde (Game Master): Seeing your serious expression, the man's brow begins to furrow.
Traveler: I'm a doctor by trade — please let me redress your wound. You don't have to suffer like this.
Clorinde (Game Master): You apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the gash, and carefully redress the wound. The man regards you first with bewilderment and then with guilt.
Guard Captain: Thank you, friend. I'm sorry for misjudging you earlier. Please accept my apology.
Furina: Don't worry about it! That misunderstanding is all in the past now.
Paimon: So, do you know where we can find the monsters? We're here to defeat them.
Clorinde (Game Master): He informs you of the locations of the monsters, and a glimmer of hope returns to his eyes.
Guard Captain: Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. Our soldiers are too young to be of much help, and now I'm out of commission as well...
Guard Captain: But... But if the legendary Marechaussee Hunters are prepared to lend us their strength, then perhaps there's still a chance to turn the tides, after all!
Navia: Just take it easy and leave the monsters to us! Fighting them is what we do.
Guard Captain: I'll place my trust in you, then. You have my gratitude.
Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck.

## Talk 5

Clorinde (Game Master): Before you lies the city's central square. You see a man with a slightly anxious look on his face pacing back and forth, his head hanging low.

## Talk 6

Lyney: Ah, a critical failure. Unlucky timing...
Clorinde (Game Master): The captain of the guards reluctantly allows you to assess his condition. Right as you're trying to get a closer look at his leg, your hand slips, and collides against his wound with great force...
Guard Captain: ARGH!
Paimon: That sounds like it hurt...
Traveler: I'm sorry... My skills are a little rusty.
Clorinde (Game Master): The captain recoils and takes a half step back. He stares down at you, panting heavily, his eyes full of anger.
Guard Captain: I don't care what you have to say, or why you're here. You are not welcome in this city.
Guard Captain: Get out of my sight. Now!
Navia: I understand that you're upset, sir! We'll leave soon, I promise. It's just, if we don't know where to find the monsters, we won't even know where to go...
Guard Captain: Hah, don't tell me you're actually considering fighting one of those things?
Guard Captain: You know, put any other group of young people in your place, and I might have tried to stop them, but since you're the ones asking...
Clorinde (Game Master): He informs you of the locations of the monsters with a disdainful tone, as if he's certain you have no chance of making it out alive.
Paimon: Phew, that was scary... Paimon was worried that critical failure meant we weren't gonna learn anything!
Navia: It's all thanks to Clorinde's quick thinking!
Guard Captain: Well, are you leaving or not?
Lyney: We're leaving, we're leaving！

## Talk 7

Paimon: Based on what the captain said, the monsters should be right up ahead!
Paimon: Let's go. Hopefully we're not too late.

## Talk 8

Clorinde (Game Master): With some suspicion, the captain allows you to survey his condition after you announce yourself as a trained doctor.
Clorinde (Game Master): Unfortunately, you're unable to adequately assess the source of his injury, much less come up with a way to relieve his pain.
Traveler: I'm sorry... My skills are a little rusty.
Guard Captain: Well, this is no ordinary wound... it was inflicted by a monster. Now, tell me, are you truly... a Marechaussee Hunter?
Clorinde (Game Master): He regards you with suspicion for quite some time, before shaking his head. Perhaps he's finally accepted that you're here to help.
Navia: Sir, we were indeed in the city earlier, but our purpose was only to gather information on the monsters. We're here to help this city and all the people within it.
Navia: Your guards are still fighting the monsters as we speak. They could be seriously wounded and in grave need of support. You need all the help you can get!
Clorinde (Game Master): The man regards you with doubt and concern. After a period of inner struggle, he lets out a long sigh, and informs you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
Guard Captain: Some of our new recruits have never even dealt with a petty thief, and now they're out there fighting monsters... *sigh* If it weren't for this cursed leg...!
Navia: Please, sir, don't get too worked up. You need to focus on your recovery. Just leave the monsters to us — we're Marechaussee Hunters, after all.
Clorinde (Game Master): Hearing you say that, a glimmer of hope flashes in his eyes. But, it disappears almost as quickly as it came.
Guard Captain: Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. But... if you insist on going, I won't stop you, either.
Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck...

## Talk 9

Clorinde (Game Master): As you approach the battlefield, you see numerous people lying by the side of the road. They appear to be dressed like guards.
Clorinde (Game Master): Their faces are filled with desperation and terror. Some are screaming and cursing in vain, as if still trying to banish the monstrosities they saw from their minds.

## Talk 10

Clorinde (Game Master): The next battle round begins... now.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Let's take a look around, like that guy said...
Clorinde (???): You there! Outsiders! Halt!
Paimon: Whoa! Wh—Who's there?
Clorinde (Game Master): An armored man approaches you. He has a tall, muscular build and a determined expression in his eyes. Just one look, and you can tell he's fought in his fair share of battles.
Clorinde (Game Master): Although he's trying his best to conceal his current state, his uneven gait and the sweat dripping down his forehead make it obvious that he's been wounded and is in serious pain.
Guard Captain: I'm the captain of the guard. I saw you sneaking around the city earlier, so I'll only ask this once...
Guard Captain: State your purpose, or it's off to the dungeons for the lot of you!
Paimon: Wow, it's been a while since someone's been this suspicious of us...
Guard Captain: I said talk! Not whisper between yourselves!
Furina: Er... Have you ever heard of the Marechaussee Hunters?
Guard Captain: Marechaussee Hunters? Hah, that fairy tale, you mean? What, you expect me to believe you're one of them?

## Talk 12

Traveler: I'd like to do a medicine check to see if I can help him...

## Talk 13

Traveler: I'd like to do an insight check to tell what he's thinking...
Clorinde (Game Master): While everyone is talking, you begin to carefully observe the captain's mannerisms.
Clorinde (Game Master): Every so often, you see him glance toward a particular direction with a pained expression on his face, as if an invisible thread is tying him to an unknown place.
Clorinde (Game Master): As you follow his gaze, you vaguely recall that the location he seems fixated on is known for its difficult terrain. Any battle that breaks out in a place like that is likely to be prolonged and devastating.
Traveler: Is that where the monsters are? Outside the forest, in the area with the difficult terrain?
Clorinde (Game Master): The captain is taken aback by your sudden question. Still, his shock only lends credence to your theory.
Guard Captain: You're... looking to fight the monsters?
Navia: Well, we're Marechaussee Hunters, after all. You could say that's basically our job!
Clorinde (Game Master): He shakes his head and continues to regard you with skepticism. In the end, he decides to inform you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
Guard Captain: Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. But... if you insist on going, I won't stop you, either.
Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck...

## Talk 14

Traveler: We're counting on you, Navia!
Navia: Sir, we were indeed in the city earlier, but our purpose was only to gather information on the monsters. We're here to help this city and all the people within it.
Navia: Your guards are still fighting the monsters as we speak. They could be seriously wounded and in grave need of support. You need all the help you can get!
Clorinde (Game Master): The man regards you with doubt and concern. After a period of inner struggle, he lets out a long sigh, and informs you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
Guard Captain: Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. But... if you insist on going, I won't stop you, either.
Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck...

## Talk 15

Traveler: We used to be doctors.
Traveler: I've been studying medicine ever since I was a child. I want to do my part to eradicate these monsters and use what I've learned to heal others.
Navia: Welcome, welcome! When we face the monsters, I'll make sure to charge in front to give everyone some cover. You can take care of the healing at the back!

## Talk 16

Paimon: This is the place he mentioned... right?
Clorinde (Game Master): You see broken iron swords scattered all around you and downed trees riddled with terrifying claw marks.
Clorinde (Game Master): All the signs point to one thing — a truly devastating battle just took place here.
Navia: Be on your guard, everyone. The monsters might still be around...
Clorinde (Game Master): Before you can finish your sentence, you hear rustling sounds from the surrounding bushes. The monsters have emerged.
Clorinde (Game Master): They close in on you without fear. You get the impression that, in their bloodthirsty eyes, you're just another meal for them to devour.
Paimon: Argh! L—Little help here! This thing wants to eat Paimon!
Clorinde (Game Master): Your battle round begins... now.

## Talk 17

Traveler: I'd like to do an insight check to tell what he's thinking...
Clorinde (Game Master): While everyone is talking, you begin to carefully observe the captain's mannerisms.
Clorinde (Game Master): Every so often, you see him glance toward a particular direction with a pained expression on his face, as if an invisible thread is tying him to an unknown place.
Clorinde (Game Master): As you follow his gaze, you vaguely recall that the location he seems fixated on is known for its difficult terrain. Any battle that breaks out in a place like that is likely to be prolonged and devastating.

Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck...

## Talk 18

Traveler: We used to be chefs.
Traveler: I've been studying the culinary arts since I was a child. I hope my delicious food can help boost people's spirits.
Furina: That's wonderful. I'll be looking forward to your cooking during our adventures together.
Lyney: Well, if we're all here for the same commission, why don't we take some time to confirm what we need to do?

## Talk 19

Clorinde (Game Master): You open your envelopes at the same time. The message reads...
Clorinde (Game Master): "To the honorable and trustworthy Marechaussee Hunters: our kingdom is currently facing a grave crisis."
Clorinde (Game Master): "The lands outside the capital have been overtaken by monsters, and our people are being led astray by forces of wickedness. We beseech you, please help us resolve this crisis, and return peace and stability to our home."
Paimon: Huh, the layout of this city looks super familiar... It kind of reminds Paimon of Mondstadt!
Navia: The script writer must have used a real-world city as a reference when coming up with the map.
Clorinde (Game Master): Ahem... As experienced Hunters, the layout of the city reminds you of places once traveled. You recall the sight of tree-lined streets and the gentle tranquility of days gone by...
Clorinde (Game Master): Yet, as you regard the city in front of you, it appears to be little more than an empty shell. Its hollow gates are open to you, beckoning you to come forth and bring salvation back to the town.
Lyney: I carefully read every line of the letter and turn my attention to the signatures at the bottom. Who issued this commission to us?
Clorinde (Game Master): You see a long string of unfamiliar names. It would seem that many of the residents of the city issued this commission together. They sensed that things were not right within the kingdom and sent a distress signal to the outside world.
Furina: Hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
Navia: Good idea! We might be able to get some leads on the monsters and bad guys we're after!
Clorinde (Game Master): You look up and see a tavern nearby. It appears to be open for the day.
Furina: Why don't we go check out that tavern? If the novels I've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.

## Talk 20

Clorinde (Game Master): The monsters let out a terrifying roar of anger and resentment, before dissipating into thin air.
Navia: Phew... Thank goodness it's over!
Lyney: We're lucky the Marechaussee Hunter class came with all those preset skill points. Otherwise, we would've been in some real trouble.
Furina: I never knew the Fateometer even determines the amount of damage you inflict... If you get unlucky, isn't it just game over right then and there?
Navia: Hehe, that's part of the fun! The uncertainty of fate is what gives these games their appeal.
Clorinde (Game Master): Just as you begin to celebrate your victory, a suspicious lump on the ground catches your attention.
Paimon: A suspicious... lump? Wait, could it be... the thing that appears after every battle...!?
Navia: I walk up to it, crouch down, and begin to carefully examine it. I've still got my right glove on, so it should be fine for me to touch it, right?
Clorinde (Game Master): As you investigate the mound, you discover that the exposed portion appears to be made of wood. It was previously obscured by the large form of the monsters.
Clorinde (Game Master): With the monsters gone, the small protrusion now awaits your discovery, poking out of the ground like a shy flower bud.
Paimon: Woah! It's a treasure chest!
Traveler: Let's dig it up!

## Talk 21

Clorinde (Game Master): Using your knowledge of medicine, you're able to deduce that the injury on his calf was a monster's doing, and the wound has already begun to fester. As you check him over, he looks at you with suspicion and retracts his injured leg further back.
Traveler: I'm a doctor by trade — please let me redress your wound. You don't have to suffer like this.
Clorinde (Game Master): The man appears somewhat disgruntled at having been exposed, but soon relents and raises his leg for you to take a better look.
Clorinde (Game Master): He allows you to apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the wound, and it appears to bring him much relief. The tension in his brow eases.
Guard Captain: Alright... Guess you lot might actually be real Marechaussee Hunters, after all. In any case, you've successfully treated my wound. So, what do you want to know?
Paimon: Do you know where we can find the monsters? Or the other guards who are fighting them?
Clorinde (Game Master): He informs you of the various locations where monsters have appeared. He looks in that general direction with a pained gaze, as if a thin, invisible thread is pulling on his wound.
Guard Captain: Some of our new recruits have never even dealt with a petty thief, and now they're out there fighting monsters... *sigh* If it weren't for this cursed leg...!
Navia: Please, sir, don't get too worked up. You need to focus on your recovery. Just leave the monsters to us — we're Marechaussee Hunters, after all.
Clorinde (Game Master): Hearing you say that, a glimmer of hope flashes in his eyes. But, it disappears almost as quickly as it came.
Guard Captain: Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. But... if you insist on going, I won't stop you, either.
Guard Captain: I just hope all the guards will be able to come back to their families alive. I wish you the best of luck...

## Talk 22

Clorinde (Game Master): With everyone's help, you successfully excavate the wooden chest from the ground.
Clorinde (Game Master): Even without opening it, you can tell from the mora and jewels scattered around the chest that it must contain quite the fortune.
Paimon: Makes sense! We worked hard for this! Let's open it, and we can share what's inside!
Lyney: Haha, I can understand your excitement, Paimon, but think about it... Doesn't it seem like there are people out there who need this treasure more than us?
Navia: Yeah! Think about all the people suffering in the capital or all those guards who got hurt fighting the monsters... Wouldn't it be better if we gave the treasure to them?
Paimon: Wait, is that how it works? Paimon thought, since we were the ones to dig it up, we could just take it for ourselves...
Navia: Well, let's put it this way... Any decision you make during a roleplaying game can impact the future course of the story.
Furina: But, would the people really believe us? It's hard enough for us to prove we're Marechaussee Hunters. What if they think we procured the treasure illegally? They might get even more suspicious of us...
Lyney: That's definitely something we should consider. Maybe we can come up with an explanation in advance...
Paimon: Well, if donating it could cause that much trouble, why don't we use it to buy some gear and fill up on good food? Then, we'll be ready to fight even more bad guys!
Clorinde: Looks like you're facing a difficult choice once again.
Clorinde: Well, it's getting late. Why don't we call it a day for now.
Furina: Wow, where did the time go...
Lyney: Haha, I'm not sure if it's because I'm having so much fun with you all, or because the story is particularly enticing... But, I feel like I could almost keep going.
Navia: Hear, hear! Ooh, how about we play through the night!
Furina: Huh!? Oh, um... I'm not sure I'll have enough energy for that...
Lyney: Yeah, that won't work for me, either. Lynette will give me an earful if I get home too late.
Clorinde: I understand how you feel, Navia, but we have to change venues for the next part of the story, anyway.
Navia: Huh? Another location?
Clorinde: Mhm. There's a special note for the GM at the end of this section that says to proceed to an indoor set for the next part of the script.
Navia: Woah, they really pulled out all the stops for this new script!
Paimon: Well, even if we end the game for the day, we can still stay a little longer and hear Clorinde finish her story, right? Paimon wants to hear more about the history of the Hunters...
Furina: Hmm, something tells me you just want to finish the free desserts before we break for the day...
Paimon: Th—That's just a coincidence, okay? Besides, to Paimon, not finishing free food feels even worse than having to buy her own!
Paimon: And anyway, Paimon really does want to hear more about Clorinde's master!
Navia: Well...
Traveler: If the story doesn't have a happy ending...
Clorinde: It's nothing. I appreciate the concern, but it's all in the past. It won't do any harm to share these things now.
Clorinde: My earliest memories are of living with Master. According to her, she saved me from certain people of ill repute. My birth parents had left me behind some time before that.
Furina: (What a heavy beginning for a life story...)
Clorinde: Master was a fascinating individual, if... inexperienced in the ways of raising children.
Clorinde: My first ever toy was a short sword. Although, I suppose it wasn't so much a toy as something Master removed from her waist and handed to a noisy child in need of distraction.
Furina: Wait, so she... handed an actual sword to a child? Isn't that dangerous!? Did you hurt yourself?
Clorinde: Of course I did. I cut my palm, and bled quite a lot. But Master was not concerned. She just stood there and casually lectured me about it—
Clorinde: "See? That's what you get for not holding the sword properly," she told me. She then crouched down next to me and said, "Give me your hand. I'll teach you to bandage this wound. After that, it's time to learn how to truly hold a blade."
Lyney: Excuse me for asking this, Clorinde, but... how old were you, exactly, when all of this happened?
Clorinde: Probably around... three? Give or take.
Furina: Three!? Isn't that when most kids are still struggling to hold a fork?
Clorinde: As I said, Master was... rather inexperienced in the ways of raising children. She believed trial and error was the best way to teach a child what they're capable of.
Lyney: (I'm not so sure this is a question of "experience"...)
Clorinde: I didn't see anything wrong with her ways at the time, and, anyway, children don't get to choose how they're raised... Oh, she did bring me back a pet from Liyue once. It was a Geovishap Hatchling.
Paimon: A Geovishap Hatchling!? For a pet!? That seems even more dangerous!
Clorinde: What she said was this — "Make sure to get along, you two. If you really can't agree on something, just settle it with a fight. Whoever loses is the real pet."
Lyney: Uh... And how old were you when this happened?
Clorinde: Five.
Furina: Well... Did you win?
Clorinde: No, I lost.
Paimon: So you're saying... You actually became... the Geovishap's pet?
Clorinde: Yes, but only for a week. By the end of that week, I defeated it in combat, and we've shared a cordial relationship ever since.
Furina: (That really doesn't sound like the kind of childhood someone should have...)
Clorinde: Later on, I gradually understood that Master most likely didn't know any other way to raise a child. She was a Marechaussee Hunter, but I never heard her bring up her own parents.
Clorinde: Thanks to her, I learned how to navigate the forest by the age of six, and could hunt monsters in the wild by myself the year after that.
Clorinde: Even though the training she subjected me to was strict, she always made sure to take me traveling when she had the time. We met many of her friends during those days... That was also how I met Mr. Callas and his family.
Navia: I still remember the first time we met. You were too scared to join our picnic and hid behind Ms. Petronilla the whole time.
Clorinde: I still... hadn't really met many children my age at that time, so I didn't know how to interact with others.
Navia: After that, though, you started coming over a lot. You loved challenging people to shooting competitions, remember? I don't think many members of the Spina ever beat you in one of those.
Clorinde: I had a lot of fun during those days.
Navia: Hehe, I enjoyed them too! Oh, do you remember that one time we went exploring around the Spina together? We overheard Papa call your Master Fontaine's "Protector of Justice."
Navia: We tried to pretend like we never heard anything, but you nearly let it slip that one time, hahaha...
Furina: "Protector of Justice"? Wait, you mean... that vigilante hero from twenty years ago? The one who was always active at night?
Clorinde: Yep, that would be her. She would often put on a black cloak and go out at night. I never knew where she went or what she was doing... until, like Navia said, we overheard the truth from Mr. Callas that night.
Furina: Twenty years ago, huh... I still remember the Gardes leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on Neuvillette's desk.
Clorinde: My apologies.
Furina: Oh... There's no need to apologize! You had nothing to do with it. And, anyway, everything she did was for a good cause.
Furina: Although, calling herself the "Protector of Order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law...
Paimon: Huh? When did the "Protector of Justice" become the "Protector of Order"?
Furina: Oh, she had a bunch of codenames. I heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked...
Furina: Later on, she probably got sick of answering those questions and decided to stick to just two — the "Protector of Justice" and the "Protector of Order."
Clorinde: That sounds like her, all right. I bet she forgot which of the two she'd used by the time she got back each night.
Lyney: Well, she certainly sounds like a fascinating individual. With her strong sense of justice, it's no surprise her student followed in her footsteps.
Clorinde: It's true. I always wanted to become like her. Someone powerful, independent, and with a strong sense of conviction... But...
Lyney: But...?
Navia: ...
Clorinde: ...She suddenly disappeared the night I turned ten years old.
Paimon: Disappeared!? What happened?
Clorinde: I have no idea. She didn't even leave a note. I was never able to find out where she went.
Clorinde: That night, I was celebrating my birthday at Navia's house, but Master never came to pick me up. When I returned home on my own, it was to an empty house.
Clorinde: When she still didn't appear after a few days, I went to Mr. Callas' house to ask about her whereabouts, but he only shook his head.
Navia: Papa probably didn't know, either. I know he sent a few people to investigate the matter in secret, but... they never found any credible leads.
Clorinde: Don't worry, I understand. To be perfectly honest, given Master's personality and way of doing things, it all made a lot of sense. If I had to guess, I'd say she probably used it as an opportunity to force me to become independent.
Clorinde: Just like how... when a litter of kittens reaches a certain age, the mother willingly leaves them behind.
Furina: Were... Were you upset, Clorinde?
Clorinde: I was at first, but not anymore. I don't believe Master would suddenly disappear for no reason. There must have been something she just had to do.
Paimon: Well, despite everything, you still managed to follow in her footsteps and become the greatest Champion Duelist in all of Fontaine! You're practically a living symbol of law and justice!
Clorinde: Hmm, I suspect my position would be far too "by-the-books" for her. Master always did whatever she pleased. But... you're right. I suppose I do take after her in some ways.
Furina: (Who knew Clorinde had such an interesting past... I never had the chance to ask her about it before.)
Furina: (I wonder.. If Clorinde's master were the Champion Duelist back then... Would that duel against Mr. Callas have gone differently?)
Furina: (Oh no... Judging by the atmosphere, Clorinde and Navia are probably thinking something similar. The mood just got super awkward all of a sudden...)
Navia: Well, anyway! Would you look at the time? It's getting dark, so we should probably call it a day for real this time. If we keep talking like this, we really will be here all night!
Lyney: I had a great time today, Miss Clorinde. Thank you for being our GM.
Clorinde: Anytime.
Navia: The script was good, but I've got to say, your childhood stories were even better!
Navia: Hey, you should tell us more about that fight against the Geovishap some time! Maybe your master was onto something, hehe!
Clorinde: Hm, you could be right.
Furina: (What does she mean, "onto something"? I certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
Furina: Guess I'll head back as well. I need to save my energy if I want to continue enjoying the story tomorrow.
Clorinde: You're that excited to hear about my fight with the vishap?
Furina: I was talking about the script!
Traveler: It's okay not to finish it...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: How about I cook something? Right here, right now!
Clorinde (Game Master): ...Are you sure?
Traveler: Positive!
Clorinde (Game Master): In that case, please refer to the Fateometer.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa, it was a success!
Clorinde (Game Master): You remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. The woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
Clorinde (Game Master): After some time, a rich aroma begins to fill the air. Even a passing cat can't help but stop in its tracks and look up in anticipation.
Traveler: Please have some food. Who knows, maybe you'll feel better after eating something delicious?
Navia: Woah, that's amazing!
Furina: (Wait... So, as long as you pass the check, you can pretty much do anything, and it won't be seen as absurd?)
Melancholic Young Woman: Thank you...
Melancholic Young Woman: Hah... You were right. This food really did make me feel better...
Paimon: So, what had you so worried earlier? Could you tell us a bit more about it?
Melancholic Young Woman: *sigh*... Okay, let me fill you in...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? We failed the check...
Clorinde (Game Master): You remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. The woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
Clorinde (Game Master): Perhaps your skills have regressed due to lack of use, but, soon, the unpleasant smell of something burnt fills the air.
Traveler: Oh no... I screwed it up.
Navia: It's all black around the edges!
Melancholic Young Woman: I appreciate the... thought, but I think I'll pass.
Lyney: Ahem... Miss, we'd love to learn more about the "monsters" you mentioned. If you're willing to open up to us, we might just be able to help resolve the troubles you're facing.
Furina: (You weren't even the one that learned "persuasion"...)
Melancholic Young Woman: My troubles, you say... *sigh* I'm not sure they're so easily resolved, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to share them with you.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Eh? A critical success!?
Clorinde (Game Master): You remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. The woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
Clorinde (Game Master): As the soup gently simmers, steam rises from the pot and a hearty aroma begins to fill the air. All trace of sadness is wiped from the woman's expression, replaced by a look of barely-suppressed anticipation.
Traveler: Please have some food. Who knows, maybe you'll feel better after eating something delicious?
Melancholic Young Woman: Ah... Thank you so much.
Melancholic Young Woman: This is the best meal I've had in a long time... probably since my husband left to fight the monsters.
Paimon: Is your husband a Marechaussee Hunter, too?
Melancholic Young Woman: A Marechaussee Hunter? No... My husband is just one of the guards from the capital.
Melancholic Young Woman: A horde of monsters suddenly appeared near the capital recently, so all the guards were dispatched to fight them.
Lyney: Do you remember when those monsters appeared?
Melancholic Young Woman: ...I'm not completely sure. All I know is that my husband was dispatched to fight them three days ago.
Furina: Do you know where he was sent?
Melancholic Young Woman: It all happened so fast. When we said our goodbyes, he couldn't even tell me where they were sending him.
Navia: Don't worry, we'll find him! Just try to remain optimistic and wait for good news!
Traveler: And don't forget to eat.
Melancholic Young Woman: Thank you all so much. And I will... I will...

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: S—Seriously!?
Navia: (Uh-oh! A critical failure!)
Clorinde (Game Master): You remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. The woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
Clorinde (Game Master): Splash... Swoosh... Clang.
Paimon: Clang!?
Clorinde (Game Master): You're unable to maintain control over the force of your stirring and accidentally knock over the entire pot. Hot soup spills all over the ground. You see evidence of your failed creation splattered on the surrounding furniture and across the hemline of the woman's skirt.
Traveler: Oh no... I screwed it up.
Melancholic Young Woman: ...Excuse me. What is the meaning of this?
Traveler: Ahh, I'm so sorry!!
Navia: #He just wanted to cook something delicious to cheer you up! He really didn't do this on purpose.
Furina: (Is this situation salvageable at all?)
Melancholic Young Woman: ...Hmph.
Melancholic Young Woman: Please, leave me be. I just want to be alone.
Lyney: But, Miss...
Melancholic Young Woman: Please, don't force me to repeat myself.
Navia: Ahahaha... Well, at least let us help clean up.
Lyney: Critical failures are bound to happen... Don't be discouraged. Let's try and ask someone else.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: I'd like to do an insight check to see what's troubling her.
Clorinde (Game Master): The results of insight checks aren't disclosed to the players, so I'll be the one consulting the Fateometer.
Clorinde (Game Master): You recall all the lessons you've learned in your time and begin to carefully observe the woman's mannerisms.
Clorinde (Game Master): You notice that when she's quiet, she has an empty look in her eyes, as if her thoughts have drifted to a place far, far away. And when she speaks, she often subconsciously reaches out to touch the ring on her left hand.
Traveler: Did something happen to your husband?
Melancholic Young Woman: Ah... So you noticed. That's a little embarrassing, haha...

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Um, any help here, Lyney?
Lyney: Ahem... Miss, we'd love to learn more about the "monsters" you mentioned. If you're willing to open up to us, we might just be able to help resolve the troubles you're facing.
Furina: (You weren't even the one that learned "persuasion"...)
Melancholic Young Woman: My troubles, you say... *sigh* I'm not sure they're so easily resolved, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to share them with you.

Lyney: Do you remember when those monsters appeared?
Melancholic Young Woman: ...I'm not completely sure. All I know is that my husband was dispatched to fight them three days ago.
Furina: Do you know where he was sent?
Melancholic Young Woman: It all happened so fast. When we said our goodbyes, he couldn't even tell me where they were sending him.
Lyney: You have our thanks, friend. We'll find and defeat those monsters as soon as possible. We sincerely hope your husband will be able to return to your side soon.
Melancholic Young Woman: Thank you...
Navia: Don't worry, we'll find him! Just try to remain optimistic and wait for good news!
Navia: We don't always get to choose what happens to us, but we do get to choose the little things, like what we eat and how we respond to the things life throws our way. I hope that, one day, you too will recognize the power of something as small and inconsequential as a delicious dessert!
Melancholic Young Woman: I... I'll do my best.
Clorinde (Game Master): You bid farewell to the woman and continue your journey further into the city.
