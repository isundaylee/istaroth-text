Traveler: Has Qiqi's been using that medical fund of hers?
Herbalist Gui: Yes, of course. For patients who are strapped for cash, that money is a lifesaver.
Herbalist Gui: We even received quite a few anonymous donations afterwards. It seems that people heard of Qiqi's good deed, and wanted to do the same.
Herbalist Gui: It's just a shame that Qiqi has no recollection of what she did. Still, she seemed very happy when I told her that she'd helped a lot of people.
Traveler: She "seemed"?
Herbalist Gui: Heh, well, Qiqi's not the best at expressing herself. But if you spend enough time with her, you get a feel for how she's feeling too.
Herbalist Gui: Perhaps an example might help. She was as happy to hear that as she is when drinking coconut milk.
