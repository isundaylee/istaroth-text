Traveler: Knock eight times
Conspicuous Stone Wall: The Stone Wall does not react at all...

## Talk 2

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you have anything to share, be it brooding or joyous, distressing or hilarious, write them down on our Message Board! Cat's Tail is all cat ears!
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Am I the first one here? That's quite an honor. Since this is anonymous, I'll share something embarrassing."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Slimes have always looked very delicious to me. Pyro Slimes look hot in temperature but sweet in taste. Dendro Slimes might have the delicate taste of licorice."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "A glass of Slime smoothie must be wonderful on a hot, sunny day! This thought pops up so often in my mind that I'm not afraid of these monsters anymore."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "But since no one eats them, I didn't have the guts to tell people what's on my mind. It's so soothing to have this Message Board to confide in!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: That is indeed something hard to get off your chest. But there's no right or wrong when it comes to personal preference. Come to Cat's Tail, and we'll make you Slime flavored drinks.
Paimon: The taste of Slimes...

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "To be clear, I don't like reading books. I borrowed "Along with Divinity" simply because I wanted to know the girl working at the library."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "The book is really hard. I wanted to borrow a book that was deep to show how smart I am, but..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "And since I wasn't able to keep reading it, I simply put it down. I've been busy ever since, so I forgot about it. I haven't been to the library since then, and the book is most likely overdue."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I just remembered yesterday, it's been due for over a week! Legend has it, whoever dares not return their books to the library will be struck by lightning. Let's just say I dare to go back even less."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: It sure seems like a serious issue. If you need a drink that will fill you with determination, we have exactly what you need at Cat's Tail, but...
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: May the Wind guide you.

## Talk 4

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you have anything to share, be it brooding or joyous, distressing or hilarious, write them down on our Message Board! Cat's Tail is all cat ears!
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "It's my first time here in Mondstadt. What an interesting place. It's different from other places I've been, like Sumeru and Liyue... The atmosphere here is so calm and relaxed, so slow and comfortable."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I recently went to the Thousand Winds Temple in the east. I heard it was a sanctuary where people used to worship the wind a long time ago. Pretty cool huh? I can't really imagine how our ancestors were able to build such a magnificent structure."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "However, there is a gigantic Ruin Guard inside â€” absolutely frightening. At first, I thought it was an abandoned ancient structure, but when I got close it swiftly stood up and prepared to attack me. Needless to say, I ran for my life."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "There's a crazy monster in the precious ruins that can fire homing missiles! Hurting people is bad enough, but imagine what that could do to the ruins! Anyway, if you insist on going to the Thousand Winds Temple for a tour, look out for missiles!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: We really hope you'll like our city. If you are willing to take the time to come by, Cat's Tail will make sure to welcome you with an exquisite drink, cleansing you of all the bad mojo you encountered on your journey.

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Ahhhh! I can't take it anymore! What a colossal idiot! After so many years of visiting his shop daily, why couldn't he take the hint!?"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "He's obviously a nice, reliable man that started running a business at a very young age. Why would such a man be so stupid! I've been waiting all this time..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Love... You've just got to let the wind guide you.
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you two don't mind stopping by, maybe we have an elixir that can turn idiots into men who understand the hearts of women.

## Talk 6

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I noticed a few months back, my receding hairline is getting worse. I don't have a mirror at home, so I never noticed."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I have cats and dogs at home, so I always thought it was them shedding. Until..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "When Stormterror swept in, I felt chills on the crown of my head. Is this the reason why my juniors didn't look me in the face when we were talking?"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I have long since passed the age of caring about my appearance. It's just, I don't know why but it keeps me up at night... If only there was some kind of product against hair loss."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: We're sorry, but we do not currently have any products that can cure hair loss in stock. However, if you're looking for something to help you forget your misfortunes temporarily, we certainly can help you!

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I came with a caravan. On our way to Mondstadt, something inexplicable happened!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I saw a strange boy when I was scouting. Initially, I believed him to be someone living in the area, but then I remembered that people weren't supposed to live there."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "It was a dangerous place called Wolvendom. Legends say that it has belonged to the wolves since ages ago. I tried to warn him, but he only overlooked me from the faraway mountains like a beast."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "When I recollected myself, the boy was gone... Come to think of it, it could have been just an illusion, but if he was an actual child from a local family... They should keep children away from dangerous places."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: We indeed have heard about these rumors. No matter. If you came with the merchant caravan, you are our guest, so why not come in and try Cat's Tail's famous wine?

## Talk 8

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "I am an official member of the Adventurers' Guild! Ad astra abyssosque, towards the stars and the abyss! Isn't it a wonderful motto!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "But, I don't understand why. I've been unlucky my whole life. I wasn't like the others, I never went out there looking for an adventure, all I ever did was stay at home and do nothing, but even then, the adventure would still come for me. Ha!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "It can be annoying sometimes. All my fellow adventurers would tell me something along the lines of: "Just being around you is dangerous, I guess it's still too early for me to go on an adventure" and they eventually all left the guild, one by one."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "In the end, I'm the only one left to take care of the elders. It's not that I don't want to, it's just that doing everything alone can be hard sometimes..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you feel burdened by the hardships of life, why not come to Cat's Tail and try our wine? In our tavern, adventurous tales are always popular. Who knows, you might even find another adventurer like you.

## Talk 9

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "When did Cat's Tail hire such a great bartender? She's not only pretty, but also amazing at her job..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "But... why would praising her enrage her? I just can't wrap my head around it..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Please don't dwell on the reasons behind it... If you wish to support her, what better way than to come here often?

## Talk 10

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you have anything to share, be it brooding or joyous, distressing or hilarious, write them down on our Message Board! Cat's Tail is all cat ears!
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Listen up, that girl in red... and everyone else!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "This is my official challenge! I shall be the Gliding Champion in the next Ludi Harpastum! I shall crush anyone that stands in my way in the contest fair and square!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Who are you supposed to be again?"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: We wish you the best of luck in taking home the Gliding Champion Cup and present it to your beloved. We shall look forward to your achievements and your next visit as usual.

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Take my motto, for example..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Hard work is all there is to the craft! Just like love!"

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "There was a strange girl at the last Ludi Harpastum. She was wrapped in bandages. Was she sick or something?"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "She didn't look like a local, and was a bit gloomy. I really wanted to see her laugh and smile like the other kids of her age. I haven't seen her for a while."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Dunno why I suddenly thought of her while going through the messages here. Hope she recovers soon and lives a good life free of those bandages."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: I saw that girl in bandages too. She must have a reason to wear them, and a serious one at that. No one can truly shoulder a burden for someone else, but...
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Although no one can truly shoulder the burden for someone else, coming to Cat's Tail for a relaxing elixir may just be the right remedy for you!

## Talk 13

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: If you have anything to share, be it brooding or joyous, distressing or hilarious, write them down on our Message Board! Cat's Tail is all cat ears!
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Darn! I lost the bet again, so they forced me to propose to Flora!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "But those idiots didn't say how I was supposed to propose, so here I am! No one would know who I am. I'm such a genius! Take that, you idiots!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Anyway... Flora, I like you. There you go."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Finally, a proposal of love on the message board! We're touched, and wish you the best, no matter who you are.
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: By the way, we have the perfect thing for you at Cat's Tail if you ever decide you need the courage to propose face-to-face. With love.

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Because of my efforts, I have been chosen by the Sage of Sumeru. I leave Mondstadt first thing tomorrow morning to begin my training with the Sage."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "It's a long journey ahead. I've never left Mondstadt in my life, so I'm frightened and excited at the same time. I wonder what Liyue and Sumeru are like."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "The training will take years. I've never left my parents... By the time I get back, they will have grown old. This is what pains me the most."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "That said, I am eager to finally begin my journey as a full-grown man. I feel guilty for feeling like this though."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Best wishes and good health to my parents and everybody here at Mondstadt."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: No need to feel guilty. It's just part of growing up. I'm sure your parents are proud of you.
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Now that you are a man, you deserve a grown-up's drink! Come, and we'll throw you a farewell party at Cat's Tail!

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Surely I'm not the only one? Dealing with the Fatui is such a chore. The Acting Grand Master must be exhausted."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Coming to Mondstadt with their big heads of theirs... Even telling us to accept their rule... Shameless scum. They wouldn't dare try this kind of thing with Boreas..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "For the freedom of Mondstadt, I shall do my best. Though I am just a guard, I still have my pride as a child of Mondstadt!"
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: For Mondstadt's freedom, for Mondstadt's freedom! It's the cause we strive for! Cheers!

Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Even I sometimes reminisce about the carefree and happy days of the past. The warmth of the Knights, my friends, my father... Everything was perfect. But one can never return to the past."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "For the sake of the future, I cannot keep on dreaming in memories. Or should I say, someone has to wake up to face the darkness before dawn so that others may continue to dream."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Rationally, I know there are some things that one must let go of, yet emotionally this is much harder to do. Sometimes my heart is agonized by this..."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: "Hope the business goes well. It's a battlefield out there in the liquor business."
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: Life is like wine. It needs refinement and fermentation to mature.
Cat's Tail Tavern Message Board: But the door of Cat's Tail is forever open to anyone, even to our business competitors! People can never return to their former lives, but they can always return to Cat's Tail to set their worries and sadness aside.
