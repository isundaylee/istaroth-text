# Moonchase Charm

These jade talismans have been placed in various areas by the Adventurers' Guild. They are made from crystal-clear and gently lustrous Plaustrite Shards. It is said that these talismans contain the essence of the bright white moon and store the reminiscences that people have of festivals past.
