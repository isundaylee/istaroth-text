Jiewu: There was also a poet from Mondstadt who had a drinking contest with a few young men in the village.

Jiewu: He elbowed his way through the crowd and began to scribble furiously. But as a chilling gust swept past, the poet was stunned for a moment, only to topple over with a resonant thump.
Jiewu: Once he sobered up and took a look at the "secrets of the world" he'd attained the previous night, the first sentence began thus â€” "Peel apples before eating them."
