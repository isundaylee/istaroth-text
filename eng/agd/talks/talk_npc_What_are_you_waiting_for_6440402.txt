Traveler: What are you waiting for?
Raef: To tell you the truth, I'm not sure either.
Raef: It might be those who left the village to buy some daily essentials, and it might also be the goods that our Eremite friends are sending over.
Raef: Who knows? We might even receive guests from Shamaniyya.
Raef: Alright, alright. In truth, my role is that of a lookout. I warn people of hazards that arise from the desert.
Raef: That said, though, the desert around Aaru Village is a place of relative quiet, so what I usually end up reporting is the arrival of goods from outside the village.
Raef: But thanks to that, I also get to hang out and chat with those who often travel outside, you know, maybe ask them to get me some seeds or a pot of flowers.
