# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Unfinished Task


## Talk 1

Grainville: All relevant labor regulations and procedures must be followed in the production zone — that means safety first. If you've got no questions, then don't disturb my work.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh? What's a Kamera doing here?
Nelly: "Where there's news, there's Kameras." Have you never heard that before?
Traveler: I think I have.
Nelly: But I just made that up, so where did you hear it?
Nelly: Well, there really isn't anything new under the sun, anyway. No matter what I say or write, it is always but a parody of others.
Traveler: The Kamera is here, so where's the news?
Nelly: Well... News is like fishing. It requires patience and making the right judgment at the right time. That's how you hook really big fish...
Nelly: Oh! I mean... That's how you hook a scoop. Hmm? Wait, that doesn't sound right! Ugh! Forget it!
Traveler: That sounds a bit amateurish. You're not a journalist, right?
Nelly: Then you've misjudged me, heh. I'm an amateur journalist!
Paimon: Anyway, what's an amateur journalist like yourself doing here?
Nelly: I'm here to complete the project assigned to me — to capture the most vivid moments of the Fortress of Meropide guards at work with my Kamera!
Nelly: But I spent too much time completing the required compliance documents... Just take a look and you'll understand.
Black Screen Text: Nelly takes out a stack of documents, all packed with various contractual clauses and signatures. Just looking at them makes you feel dizzy...
Nelly: By the time I completed all the procedural paperwork, I missed the guards at work during their shift! Or in fishing terms, there aren't any fish in the water right now...
Paimon: Huh? But there are guards on duty here right now.
Nelly: But I want to hook a Platinum Collection. I don't think an Initial Configuration or Water Body Cleaner has enough impact... That way, even if I complete my project, other photographers might not think it worthy of praise.
Traveler: Stop being so picky if you don't want to return empty-handed.
Nelly: You're right. I need to come to terms with my own limited abilities, and stop trying to catch fish that are beyond me... *sob* I'm such a useless angler... Oh, wait, I mean amateur journalist.
Nelly: Alright, no more wallowing in self-pity. Time to cheer up! If it's alright with you... Could you do me a small favor? Please! I'll pay you!
Paimon: Whoa! That was fast... Well, it depends on the favor. So, why don't you tell us what it is first?
Nelly: The guard over there, Grainville. Based on my judgment, his news value among guards is equivalent to that of a Situation Controller among maintenance meks...
Nelly: I should be able to write a good report with him as my subject... Well, I can keep myself from getting criticized, at least.
Nelly: But he just refuses to come over here! So, could you bring him to a suitable spot for me to take a snapshot?
Traveler: Why don't you just explain it to him yourself and get him to come over that way?
Nelly: Knowing about the Kamera will make him focus on it and stiffen up, that would make the photo too staged!
Nelly: Let me think. It's best if we turn off the loudspeaker, report it to Grainville as a malfunction, and ask him to come have a look.
Nelly: Then I'll definitely be able to capture a vivid moment of a Fortress of Meropide guard at work!
Nelly: My project's completion depends on this! I'm counting on you! Please help me!
Paimon: #It doesn't sound difficult, {NICKNAME}. Maybe we should help her out.
Traveler: Can't you just take your Kamera over to him?
Nelly: Well... The view is better here. And if he sees the Kamera, I'm sure he'll focus on it and leave me with nothing but a bunch of stiff poses to work with...
Traveler: Well, you keep on waiting then. See ya!
Nelly: You're just leaving? Really? Aren't you going to help me?
Paimon: Well... It's not like we can just magically conjure up the Platinum Collection you want!
Traveler: Never mind the news, I like fishing too.
Nelly: Really? That's perfect! Actually, I'm just a novice angler, and I've got a bunch of questions but didn't know where to turn for advice. For example, if you hook a maintenance meka and it bites... What would you do?
Traveler: Just release it.
Nelly: I see, I see, so that's how you'd choose to handle it. Hmm, it's a very valuable reference. I will commit it to memory.
Nelly: Huh!? How did we end up talking about fishing? You're really good at steering the conversation!, huh? It seems I have much to learn as an amateur journalist...
Paimon: But it was you who brought up fishing!
Traveler: Beat it up and show it who's boss.
Traveler: Cook it for Paimon.
Paimon: #Whoa! Paimon really believes in your cooking, {NICKNAME}, but no matter how you look at it, those just aren't edible!
Traveler: Nope.
Nelly: Oh! Well, you've heard it now! Don't forget that if you do happen to use it anywhere else, you must cite the source — namely, me!

## Talk 3

Nelly: I must take a photo so good that all the other photographers will gain new levels of respect for me!
Nelly: I still want the Platinum Collection though... Agh...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hi, we found a loudspeaker that seems to be malfunctioning... It's over there.
Grainville: Again? That's strange... I just got Clynes to repair it. Looks like he's not even as good at fixing things as I am. I mean, all you gotta do is give machines a couple of good smacks, right?
Grainville: Anyway, thanks, I'll go have a look.
Paimon: Thanks for your help!

## Talk 5

Grainville: What's wrong with it? Hmm...

## Talk 6

Nelly: I've finally completed my project! I'm a journalist in my own right now! Thank you!
Paimon: You must have snapped a really excellent picture.
Nelly: Yeah, take a look at this.
Traveler: It doesn't look very vivid, but it's artistic alright.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't understand art at all...
Paimon: Will it really be okay to just use this one?
Nelly: What's wrong with it? I think it's a great shot! I'm sure no one would have expected me to snap a shot like this one! They will all be so surprised...
Paimon: Paimon really doesn't get your standards for artistic critique...
Nelly: Oh, it's called "symbolic meaning over substance." I'm sure all experienced photographers will understand once I submit it!
Nelly: Anyway, thank you. This is for you. Hehe, it would be great if we could chat at a fishing spot next time!
Traveler: It's so vivid it almost seems like it will start moving any moment now.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon might get dizzy if she looks at it any longer...
