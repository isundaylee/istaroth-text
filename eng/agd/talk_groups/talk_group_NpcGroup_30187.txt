Bertrand: Heh! If that's the amount I'm getting for one of these, then I just need to sell 20,000 of them to pay off my debt!
Bertrand: #What's up, Traveler? Is there something wrong?

Traveler: So about the creation process...
Bertrand: Ah, sure. I can explain that again, no problem.
Bertrand: You have to collect the materials needed for the three processes while carrying the Collector on your person.
Bertrand: The first step is "Source Material Collection." Ore, fruits, flowers, and the like can serve as such base materials.
Bertrand: The second step is "Elemental Charge," which can only be achieved by staying affected by the elements for a certain duration.
Bertrand: Finally, we have "Core Activation," which can be done by defeating some elemental life forms to achieve the motive force required to start the core up.
Bertrand: After this, the Material Collector should have finished collecting all we need. Then, it just needs to be placed into the Great Machine to begin production.
Bertrand: If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.

Traveler: I'd like to pick a toy to keep.
Bertrand: Oho! Have you toy models you'd like to redeem? Just roll up with your redemption voucher, then... Though as we said before, you can only redeem four...

Traveler: No, nothing at the moment.
Bertrand: Well, then keep flexing those creative muscles of yours! Honestly, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what else you'll make!
