Yareche: Uh... What type of tone should I take when talking to Saurians? ... My teacher manages it quite well...

Traveler: What's happened, exactly?
Yareche: Well, here's the thing: You know this place got trashed by the Abyss, right? My teacher, Matzil, was wounded in action and is recuperating at home.
Yareche: She's entrusted these little Saurians to my care in the meantime, and... *sigh*...
Yareche: Sorry, please don't get me wrong. I don't hate them. I just don't know how to communicate with them.
Yareche: How can my teacher chat with them so easily when they clearly don't speak the same language...

Traveler: Try treating them like little kittens or puppies.
Yareche: Hey, how did you know that? My teacher does the same.
Yareche: But even if I can imitate a cat's meowing, it's not like that'll help the cat figure out what I'm trying to say...
Yareche: Could it be that they can communicate with each other using only the tone of voice?
Yareche: Hmm, that's just like what happened when my teacher shouted at me for failing to stabilize my altitude during a flight! I couldn't hear what she was saying, but I sure could understand what she meant...
Yareche: Ah, sorry. There I go, talking to myself again.
Yareche: ...Hmm. Might it also be that talking to a Saurian is no different from talking to yourself?
