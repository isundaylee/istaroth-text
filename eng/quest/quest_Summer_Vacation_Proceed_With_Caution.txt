# Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ahh... The weather's so nice. Still feels like Paimon's dreaming.
Paimon: Good morning! Wh—Wha, what's with everyone's clothes!?
Barbara: Hehe! So, how do we look?
Barbara: We changed into summer clothes! Although we didn't come here to have fun, we don't want to miss out on a beautiful summer day by the sea!
Jean: Th—This doesn't look weird, does it?
Jean: Such light and summery clothing definitely doesn't suit me... Ah, hehe... pardon me.
Traveler: No, not at all.
Jean: Really...? Thank you, Traveler.
Paimon: It's surprising that Master Jean would specially pack summer clothes.
Barbara: Oh no, my big sister would never pack these herself. Lisa and I picked them out for her.
Paimon: Blurting out "big sister" and not even realizing it... Barbara's drunk on summer already!
Jean: There's quite a story behind these summer clothes...
Jean: I thought Lisa's pouch was to be used for an emergency. I didn't expect it to contain a set of summer clothing.
Paimon: All these accessories, too... Definitely Lisa's handiwork.
Jean: Everyone in the Knights of Favonius is always trying to have me take leave. I suppose I do push myself too much...
Klee: Everyone, come over here!
Jean: That's Klee's voice!
Klee: I saw something weird.
Paimon: Huh? What's going on? What do you mean by something weird?
Klee: Look at the ocean!
Klee: See? There's something weird floating on the water!
Jean: That narrow device... It seems to be a buoy.
Barbara: But we didn't see anything when we arrived here yesterday...
Klee: Dodo-King must have put them there!
Paimon: Strange devices that just appear overnight... Something doesn't add up.
Klee: Well, since he hasn't revealed himself to us, does that mean he's changed his mind? Or maybe...
Klee: Maybe these buoys are a clue and he's waiting for me to find him!
Barbara: So could that be why these buoys have suddenly appeared?
Traveler: Let's take a closer look and find out.
Paimon: Right, we won't solve anything by guessing on-shore.
Barbara: Is it okay to go out there though?
Jean: Perhaps, but we must investigate the buoys regardless.
Jean: It's hard to say what will be waiting for us at sea. Just in case, prepare yourselves for combat.
Jean: Once you are ready, please assemble here, and we'll head over on the boat together.
Traveler: That's our Master Jean!
Jean: N—Not at all. This is... just my duty.
Jean: Now then, I'll entrust the preparation efforts to all of you.
Traveler: She's reliable even in summer wear.
Traveler: You look marvelous!

## Talk 2

Jean: What could those buoys possibly mean...?
Traveler: About this archipelago...
Jean: These islands are isolated from the outside world, like a secret Domain crafted by nature itself.
Jean: We were guided here by the letter and with the assistance of Venti and Dvalin... Everything seems a bit too serendipitous. I'm a little concerned.
Jean: But I'm here to protect you all, so please don't worry. Come what may, I will face it head-on.
Traveler: About your summer clothes...
Jean: Ah... Su—Summer clothes, they're, uh... They were a surprise that Lisa prepared for me. My guess is that it was originally Barbara's suggestion.
Jean: Barbara said that it's so rare for us to get a chance to come to an island, we should change into summer clothing to set the atmosphere.
Jean: However, I'm not used to this style of clothing. *sigh* I hope wearing this doesn't look too odd.

## Talk 3

Jean: Have you finished your preparations?
Traveler: Not yet.
Jean: There is no need to rush. Take your time organizing your things. I will wait for you all here.
Traveler: I'm ready.
Jean: Great, then let's head to the <color=#00E1FFFF>boat</color>.

## Talk 4

Barbara: Hmm? Is there anything I can do?
Traveler: About this archipelago...
Barbara: I just want to say that the ocean here is beautiful!
Barbara: Sea and sun — a summer dream come true!
Barbara: I really want to have a seaside performance! It would be amazing, I just know it!
Traveler: About your summer clothes...
Barbara: How do I look? Not bad, right?
Barbara: I wanted to surprise everyone, so I specifically chose an outfit complementing an island atmosphere.
Barbara: Oh, but please don't worry! Even if I'm wearing summer clothes, I'm still just as reliable in battle!

## Talk 5

Klee: Hmm, I need to bring Jumpy Dumpties, Dodoco, and... myself!
Traveler: About the buoys...
Klee: Dodo-King must have placed those things in the ocean! He's a bad guy!
Klee: But I will bravely face him and do my best for Dodoco!
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, thank you for helping me.
Traveler: About summer...
Klee: I like summer! But not just summer.
Klee: I also like fall. Oh yes, and I also like spring and winter!
Klee: Even though winter's very cold, I have Jumpy Dumpty. Whenever I feel cold, I blow something up.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Ah, what's going on here? This part of the ocean is way too mysterious!
Barbara: This whole stretch of land just rose out of the water!
Klee: Dodo-King, Dodo-King, I'm gonna catch you! Hehe!
Paimon: Looks like Klee's as energetic as ever.
Jean: Before the ground started shaking, I heard the sound of machinery. I believe there may be an immense mechanical structure under this region of the ocean.
Jean: With the entire archipelago situated on a mechanical framework, it could be activated to raise each island from beneath the water.
Barbara: Something like that would be nothing short of a miracle... Could it be the power of the Anemo Archon, Barbatos?
Paimon: Hmm, probably not. Paimon feels like this is more likely a deliberate set-up...
Jean: It's incredible, no matter how you think of it. Using a letter to draw us here and these challenges involving various mechanisms... This so-called Dodo-King is no amateur.
Traveler: I agree with Jean.
Barbara: Aw, there goes the holiday mood...
Jean: ...
Jean: Well, either way, I will do my best to remain vigilant.
Paimon: Wow! Master Jean's so cool when she's determined!
Traveler: Paimon and I will also exercise increased caution.
Jean: Thank you for your understanding.
Klee: I found him! It's Dodo-King!
Klee: He's over on that island! Hee-hee, gotcha!
Klee: You wanted Klee to come find you, so here Klee comes! Jumpy Dumpties, get ready~! Let's go!
Barbara: Is that... <color=#00E1FFFF>a platform in the middle of the ocean</color>?
Jean: Something has appeared. Everyone, we can take a closer look, but please be on guard.

## Talk 7

Jean: Everyone, please be careful!
Paimon: Huh? Is that a really tall person?
Barbara: It resembles a human, but something's not quite right.
Klee: Dodo-King, I see you! You can, uh, Arb... Arbi...
Paimon: Arbitrate!
Klee: Right! You can arbitrate Klee!
Paimon: Ugh! What is this kid saying!?
Jean: She obviously doesn't understand what that word means...
Klee: Hey, Dodo-King! Why are you ignoring me?
Klee: Is it because I took too long and made you angry? Then... I'm sorry!
Barbara: Huh, and now she's apologizing? I didn't see that coming...
Klee: Hello! Dodo-King!
Barbara: It looks like they're not interested in Klee at all.
Jean: It's some kind of humanoid machine. No response... It must be damaged.
Barbara: Oh, do you recognize it?
Jean: No, I can only guess. It looks completely out of place on this island... Look at its clothes. It appears like it came from Inazuma.
Paimon: Inazuma? But isn't that really far away?
Traveler: So this machine isn't from around here?
Jean: It would appear so. This area of the sea is independent and does not border any country, so it certainly seems out of place here.
Jean: But given Inazuma's current situation, how could something like this occur...?
Paimon: An abandoned machine... Weird! Did someone bring it here?
Klee: Oh no! Dodo-King isn't moving anymore!
Jean: Klee, maybe Dodo-King is tired.
Paimon: Right, right, Dodo-King is probably asleep. He was waiting so patiently for you and then *yawn* — nap time!
Barbara: Let's go with Klee to play elsewhere and come back once Dodo-King wakes up.
Klee: Really?
Barbara: Of course!
Klee: Hm... No, I get it now!
Klee: This isn't Dodo-King. The real Dodo-King is somewhere else.
Jean: Huh? I—Is that right?
Klee: I won't give up. Dodo-King, just wait! We'll find you!
Paimon: And there she goes again... Whew, she's got a lot of spirit.
Barbara: Klee, wait for us!

## Talk 8

Barbara: Honorary Knight, look here!
Paimon: Huh? What's this?
Barbara: Look at these stacked-up stones and small flowers...
Barbara: It feels like a memorial for someone.
Traveler: You're very perceptive.
Barbara: Hey, you're embarrassing me...
Paimon: But the only other thing around here is that machine in Inazuman clothing.
Barbara: Could the memorial be for the machine?
Jean: Perhaps it once performed some deed that merited a memorial.
Barbara: ...
Jean: Everything we've seen here indicates that there was once a human presence in these waters. Still, there isn't enough for us to infer what kind of civilization it was.
Jean: And up to now, we still have yet to see any people or gravestones.
Klee: Master Jean, can I go over there and have a look?
Jean: Yes, but be careful!
Klee: Okay!
Traveler: How many secrets do these islands hold?
Jean: Klee is too young to have a proper sense of danger. Traveler, the rest of us must stay alert to the situation.
Jean: Honestly speaking, I thought that letter was only a prank at first.
Paimon: That's what we thought.
Barbara: I suspected as much too, but who would send a prank letter to a child?
Jean: A letter that guides us to activate mechanisms on a deserted archipelago... It's bizarre.
Jean: It makes me wonder whether this isn't some kind of trap, long in the making. We must keep our guard up.
Klee: Miss Barbara!
Barbara: Klee, what's wrong?
Klee: Do you think that Dodo-King doesn't want to see Klee?
Barbara: Why would the Dodo-King not want to see you, Klee?
Klee: Dodoco loves me, an—and I love Dodoco, so Dodo-King can never separate us. That's why Dodo-King doesn't want to see us...
Klee: *whimper* Klee doesn't want him to separate us.
Barbara: ...
Barbara: Hey Klee, do you know what this is?
Klee: It's a harpastum!
Barbara: I heard my big sis— Uh, Master Jean say that Klee always wanted to play harpastum, right?
Klee: Yeah! Klee was just thinking about Ludi Harpastum!
Barbara: I made this harpastum especially for you. Now every day can be Ludi Harpastum, hee-hee!
Klee: Yay!
Traveler: The kindness of a deaconess...
Barbara: So keep your chin up, Klee! After we meet Dodo-King, we can all help you convince him to let you and Dodoco stay together.
Klee: Okay!
Traveler: Let's double our efforts. We have to find him.
Klee: Yeah!
Paimon: Leave it to us Klee. This Dodo-jerk can't hide forever.
Paimon: Even if it takes a thousand years and a thousand searches... uh, w—we'll get him! Ahem...
Paimon: But until then, let's have a good look around the area!
Traveler: That's a deaconess's intuition, alright!
