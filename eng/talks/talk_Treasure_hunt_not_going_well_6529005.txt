Traveler: Treasure hunt not going well?
Urville: Yes, indeed. I actually tried diving to search for clues before that could lead to treasure, but I was too weak.
Urville: Ball Octopuses are so hard to deal with...
Urville: But I won't give up. Someday, I'll defeat them on my own terms. Only then can I continue moving forward.
