Araesha: More delicious riddles are needed, before Festival Utsava. Still not enough...

## Talk

Traveler: Something on your mind?
Araesha: Ah, Nara friend.
Araesha: Nara friend knows not about Festival Utsava, thus knows not about Araesha's worries.
Araesha: When Festival Utsava starts, every Aranara returns to Vanarana, and many of them come to Araesha for riddles...
Araesha: But Araesha doesn't have enough riddles for everyone to eat...

## Talk

Traveler: About riddles...
Araesha: Seeing Aranara failing to solve the riddles, Araesha feels happy.
Araesha: If Aranara solves the riddles, Araesha feels happy.
Araesha: All in all, riddles make Aranara happy.
Araesha: But Araesha has never provided a riddle for Nara. Araesha should think again, what happy riddles will Nara like?

Araesha: #Araesha knew it. Nara Traveler ate many fresh riddles thus ate up all Araesha's riddles.
Araesha: Araesha wants a riddle match with little Nara.

## Talk
