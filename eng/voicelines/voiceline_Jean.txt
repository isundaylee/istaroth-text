# Jean Voicelines

## Hello
I am Jean, the Dandelion Knight, requesting approval to join your party. From this day onwards, my honor and loyalty lie with you.

## Chat: Operation
It's time to move on, we shouldn't stay here.

## Chat: Knights of Favonius
I do hope the Knights of Favonius are all working hard...

## Chat: Target
Onwards! We have work to do.

## When It Rains
The rain won't slow me down.

## After the Rain
This weather is perfect, we should move out.

## When It Snows
Huh, snow. Remember — tend to your boots when we return.

## When It's Windy
Such fine weather.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Legend has it the wind was unusually strong on that day, too...

## Good Morning
A successful day starts from the morning. Let's give it our all today.

## Good Afternoon
We've still got work to do. Let's keep going.

## Good Evening
Huh, it seems I'm immune to coffee now. Perhaps I need to ask Lisa for something... a little stronger...

## Good Night
Training is finished for today. Great work, you've earned a good rest.

## About Jean
Today I had no choice but to cut down five Ruin Guards to protect the people of our city... Ugh, I must continue to work harder. Though hostile, destroying such precious artifacts is still a loss to us all. I must find a less destructive way to bring them down next time...

## About Us: Creed
You have my complete and full support. Of course, if your path ever deviates from justice, I will not hesitate to point it out.

## About Us: Oath
I swear by this sword, victory shall be yours.

## About Us: Quest
Our work will not handle itself... But, I suppose the occasional short break is warranted. Let us rest for a couple of minutes.

## About the Vision
For Mondstadt, as always is the Gunnhildr family motto. Every time I use my Vision, I am reminded of my mother and the hopes of the people of Mondstadt. For Mondstadt, for freedom — that is what I fight for.

## Something to Share
On behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I would like to extend my gratitude to you for all you have done for Mondstadt. Please remember to rest from time to ti... Did I miss something? What are you laughing at? Did I say something odd?

## Interesting Things
"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." Who knows, the wind might take it all the way to Celestia.

## About Barbara
Barbara is a hard worker, but I feel she's too hard on herself sometimes... What? You ask me how I know all of this? It's because the order also manages the Church.

## About Lisa
When Lisa is around, I always have peace of mind.

## About Amber
I must say that Amber's development has impressed me recently. I hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale.

## About Kaeya
Is that right...? Kaeya also gave you some suggestions. He is an excellent knight after all — this is a fact no one can deny.

## About Klee
Though it may be said that it is in a child's nature to play, the things Klee plays with are far from toys. I can never take my eye off her.

## About Albedo
Sometimes I feel that terms like "genius" were originally created for Albedo.

## About Varka
Grand Master Varka is the legend of his generation. On the day of his triumphant return, I shall be sure to personally introduce you to him. I'm sure you too will be in awe of his greatness.

## About Noelle
Noelle... She puts enormous effort into trying to become a Knight of Favonius. However, I fear she is not quite ready for the dangers that lie beyond Mondstadt's walls.

## About Rosaria
Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help, to which she simply replied that doing so would be even more bothersome. I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt.

## About Diluc: Disillusion
Master Diluc has his reasons for being so critical of the Knights of Favonius. I am not proud of the way things went, but I cannot change the past. All I can do is keep working hard, in the hope he may one day see us in a better light... This is my duty.

## About Diluc: Respect
Master Diluc is my senior, and I have the utmost respect for him. Though we have gone separate ways, I can sense we share the same strong commitment to protecting Mondstadt at all costs.

## About Sucrose
Sucrose is also a rare talent in the field of alchemy. Under Albedo's mentorship, she is sure to flourish. I am sure her future will be bright. The only thing is... Ahem, I was momentarily lost in thought. It is nothing. Nothing bad, anyway.

## About Eula
Eula? Um... Please, do not hold her unfortunate background against her. The Knights of Favonius evaluate each person impartially. Eula has a clear sense of right and wrong and is more talented than most. The controversial statements that she makes from time to time are just a product of her personality. For instance, she always mentions wanting to challenge me, but I don't mind.

## About Mika
The Grand Master placed Mika on the front line of the expedition team not simply because he met the requirements of the mission — more importantly, he was impressed by Mika's hardworking and grounded nature. From my own perspective, I feel very honored to work with someone like him.

## More About Jean: I
I shoulder the knights' trust and the people's hope. It is for this reason, I must stay vigilant.

## More About Jean: II
Vennessa's title — "Dandelion Knight" — has been passed down from generation to generation. Countless great knights were awarded with this honor and I will not bring shame to this name. Thus, I must keep going. I must become the sword and aegis of the people.

## More About Jean: III
Only glorious victories are recorded in legends and history books. Surely even the great knights of old must have had their struggles?
Wind, please show me the path.

## More About Jean: IV
When I'm wholeheartedly devoted to my work, all of my troubles and even my sense of time seem to just slip away. Hmm, Grand Master Varka did say to me: "Jean, there is no better candidate for this task"...

## More About Jean: V
As I walk with you, the path ahead becomes clearer. It's almost as if I have finally found someone I can trust. I wonder if...
No, this must mean that I am still lacking in strength... I must not give up, I will not — I cannot fail the Knights and the people of Mondstadt. Still... thank you.

## Jean's Hobbies
Maybe we can discuss the tales of legendary heroes. Have you heard the story of the heroic king of Khaenri'ah?

## Jean's Troubles
If only there was some kind of mysterious potion that could keep me awake forever... I need to have a talk with Lisa tomorrow.

## Favorite Food
It's been ages since I had pizza at Cat's Tail. If only they delivered...

## Least Favorite Food
A true knight can't afford to be a picky eater.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Not only is the taste magnificent, but you've also made sure it was healthy. You have my gratitude.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Hmm yes, I feel a lot more energetic now, thanks to you.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Ahem... all in all, I appreciate the effort.

## Birthday
Today is a day worth celebrating. If you must ask why, well, let me remind you that today is when you, the one who is blessed by the wind, came into the world. Since this is your birthday, I'll allow you to take it easy.
Ahem... ♪Happy birthday to you...♪
Uh... Please forgive my presumptuousness. I hope this gift is to your liking.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Good. On to our next objective.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
As the wind continues to blow, so too shall I continue to fight.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
Although we have peace, we must not become complacent. As the Acting Grand Master, I must remain vigilant.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I am still not good enough. Ever since I met you, I have been indebted to you for your assistance. My gratitude...
Wind, please forgive my selfishness. Not as the Acting Grand Master, but as Jean — I hereby swear that my sword shall always go with you.

## Elemental Skill: I

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
I hope the others find some.

## Low HP: II
My companions... need me...

## Low HP: III
I can not give up...

You're injured... get to safety!

## Ally at Low HP: II
I'll take over.

## Fallen: I
Mondstadt...

## Fallen: II
Everyone has their limits...

## Fallen: III
I have failed...

Ugh! Barely a scratch!

We may leave at any time.

## Joining Party: II
Ready for anything.

## Joining Party: III
Let the wind lead.
