Traveler: About the "Wondermaid"
Paimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!
Traveler: "Little Life Tips?"
Paimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or something that you can't get clean, no matter what you do...
Paimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name to the skies:
Paimon: "Noeeeelle!"
Paimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.
Traveler: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt?
Traveler: Pretty impressive...
