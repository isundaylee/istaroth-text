Traveler: And what did you do?
Choneaux: Hahaha! I made a handsome profit off it, that's for sure! But I'm not totally without moral scruples. Once someone buys a story from me, I won't turn around and try to sell it to someone else under a different name.
Choneaux: Alright, I've talked enough. I need to think about how to make this report connect with more readers.
