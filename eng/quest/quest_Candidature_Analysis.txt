# Candidature Analysis


## Talk 1

Bolai: Look, your asking price for this batch is just too high. I can't buy in at this price. How am I supposed to turn a profit?
Qiping: Come on, hear me out. I'm telling you, this is the single best batch of Sunsettias ever. You won't find anyone who disputes that.
Qiping: I accidentally dropped one into a well, and even the water turned sweet!
Bolai: Even so...
Qiping: Shhh, alright, alright, I'll let you in on a little secret. The boss of Second Life also wants to buy from me, but I haven't responded yet.
Qiping: If you won't take them, I'll just have to partner with them instead, and neither of us wants that.
Bolai: Okay, well, when you put it that way... I'll accept your asking price. I'll take all your stock. Don't sell a single one to Second Life!
Black Screen Text: The trader who was negotiating with Bolai leaves...
Bolai: Oh, what are you doing here?
Bolai: And to be clear, these Sunsettias are mine. I got to them first, don't get any ideas!
Traveler: Knock yourself out...
Paimon: Actually, we want to ask you about a guy called Zhiyi. Have you heard of him before?
Bolai: Zhiyi? Yes, he's quite well-known.
Bolai: I've heard a story about him. They say he was born into poverty, his parents died when he was young, and he was treated cruelly by the local community.
Bolai: One of his neighbors was terribly rude to him all the time, but Zhiyi never retaliated — and when his neighbor went bankrupt, he even helped support the family.
Bolai: He returned cruelty with kindness, injustice with peace offerings... A gentleman of talent and character and— Oh... how did I not notice him sooner? In fact, maybe I'm not too late. If I could hire him to be the brand ambassador for Wanyou Boutique...
Paimon: He sounds like a decent man! We can finally breathe a sigh of relief!
Bolai: Why are you asking about him, anyway? You aren't... looking for a brand ambassador too, are you?
Bolai: Well then, in that case, the higher bidder takes the... Hmm? Ah, that's Zhiyi right over there. Why don't we go and talk to him?
Paimon: Where, where?
Yelan: #It's him alright. Looks like he's chatting with Linlang, {NICKNAME}... Come on, let's follow them and listen in.
Yelan: Try not to let him see you. We want this information to be as truthful as possible.
Bolai: I'll just go and fetch an employment contract... And hey, don't try and cut me out of this! Heeey!
Traveler: I've got more than enough in my bag...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm... Zhiyi seems to get along really well with everyone.
Paimon: Are you satisfied now, Yelan? Seems like everyone thinks Zhiyi's a great guy.
Yelan: We shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. Let's go check out the wharf where he usually goes fishing.
Paimon: Ugh, do we have to...
Paimon: Wait, you're not just trying to dig up some dirt on Zhiyi because you wanna be Tianshu yourself, are you?
Yelan: Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. But hey, if I do become Tianshu, I'll look out for you guys.
Yelan: You'll be able to try all the finest food for free. How does that sound?
Paimon: We will!? Well come on, off to the South Wharf we go!

## Talk 3

Yelan: The wharf is as busy as ever.
Yelan: I hear the anglers here sometimes sell their fish to the nearby fishmongers. Hmm, let's see what Uncle Sun has to say.

## Talk 4

Uncle Sun: Welcome, what would you like to buy today?
Traveler: We're here to ask you about someone.
Yelan: Sorry to interrupt. We're actually members of the, uh... Liyue Anglers Association, and we just wanted to ask a few questions about someone.
Yelan: We've heard about this young man called Zhiyi who's supposed to be a fantastic fisherman. Just wondering if you happened to have heard of him?
Paimon: Whoa... Yelan made up a whole fake identity without batting an eyelid...
Uncle Sun: Ah yes, Zhiyi. He's been making quite a name for himself recently. I've got some friends who travel all over the place, and they tell me everywhere they go they meet someone who's heard of him.
Uncle Sun: Apparently, he had a rather tough time growing up. Had to work several jobs alongside his studies to make ends meet.
Uncle Sun: How does that saying go — what doesn't kill you makes you stronger? Well, if there's anything to that logic, he's sure to be phenomenally successful one day.
Paimon: Yeah, we think so, too!
Uncle Sun: But I'm afraid your Anglers Association might be in for a disappointment.
Yelan: Oh, why's that?
Uncle Sun: He's good at a lot of things, but fishing isn't one of them. He fishes at the wharf, and sells what he catches to me on occasion.
Uncle Sun: His catches are always mediocre. Not terrible, but equally nothing to write home about. If you're looking to recruit some new members, though, I do know a few top anglers I could put you in touch with...
Yelan: That sounds fantastic. I've got a couple of other things to attend to right now, though, so... why don't I come back some other time, and we can chat over a drink?
Uncle Sun: Sure thing. See you!
Yelan: "Everywhere they go, they meet someone who's heard of him." Hmm... C'mon, let's keep asking around.
Traveler: We're here to buy some... information.

## Talk 5

Uncle Gao: Here to buy some fish? It's 300 for one or 3 for 1,000!
Uncle Gao: You better hurry, when they're gone, they're gone!
Yelan: Hello, we're from the Society for Fish Price Research. We'd just like to ask a few questions.
Paimon: Wow... She switched identity again...
Uncle Gao: Society for... Fish Price Research? I haven't done anything illegal, stay out of my business!
Yelan: Please don't worry, we're just here to conduct a simple survey.
Yelan: We've heard about a certain Zhiyi who's been selling fresh fish at low prices in this area recently. Do you know anything about this?
Uncle Gao: So this isn't about me. You should have said something, you know. I know the guy, I can tell you what I know.
Uncle Gao: I haven't heard anything about him selling fresh fish at low prices, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was him.
Paimon: Oh, why's that?
Uncle Gao: Because he's so poor. His parents died when he was very young and his alcoholic father still owed a huge amount of debt. No one wanted to have anything to do with him.
Uncle Gao: He was still a kid when he first came to the wharf. His clothes were ragged, and he had a bandage wrapped around his head.
Uncle Gao: He managed to survive thanks to Uncle Tian, who gave him some food. But still, to this day, he doesn't have a lot of Mora to his name.
Uncle Gao: I mean, he can afford to eat and everything, but you'll often see him haggling with others over just a few Mora. So I wouldn't be surprised to find out he's been selling a few fish.
Uncle Gao: It's not like he catches much anyway, so it's not going to affect my business. Oh... Don't tell him I said that.
Yelan: You'd rather he didn't know?
Uncle Gao: Well... I spoke to him once, briefly, and I just had a feeling that he really cares what other people think of him.
Uncle Gao: I think he has pretty low self-esteem... But hey, it's hardly my place to say anything. What he's achieved already puts most people to shame.
Uncle Gao: Nobody's perfect. I just wouldn't want to upset him, that's all.
Yelan: I see. Well, thank you for sharing that with us.
Uncle Gao: Not a problem. And just for the record, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the price of my fish!
Paimon: The more times you say it, the less convincing it becomes...
Yelan: "Doesn't have a lot of Mora to his name"... Okay, let's keep going.

## Talk 6

Dugu Shuo: Hey, it's you guys. Wait, what's the phrase... Oh yeah, "Honored to meet you!"
Dugu Shuo: What brings you to me?
Yelan: The truth is, we are but newcomers to this territory. We heard tell of a great martial artist, Master Dugu, who knows everything there is to know. Hence, we sought you out to ask for your guidance.
Dugu Shuo: R—Really? People said... I know everything there is to know?
Yelan: But of course. We also heard that Master Dugu is a kind and virtuous swordsman who never turns away anyone who comes with questions.
Dugu Shuo: Great... Ahem, so, what do you wish to know? Nothing happens on this street that I don't know about.
Paimon: Ugh... Now she's lying to a kid!
Traveler: But it seems to have made his day...
Yelan: So, Master Dugu. Have you heard of one by the name of Zhiyi?
Dugu Shuo: Sure have! You mean that guy that all the grownups are talking about these days?
Dugu Shuo: ...I've heard many tales of Zhiyi. For example... um... I can't remember...
Dugu Shuo: Probably 'cause it's nothing that important. I prefer stories about sword-fighting heroes!
Yelan: Oh, I can completely understand that. Then let me ask you this... Do you remember roughly when the grownups started talking about Zhiyi?
Dugu Shuo: Ooh, yeah, I know that! It was about two or three months ago!
Dugu Shuo: Before that, people always used to talk about Zhiyi in a kinda nasty tone of voice... but two or three months ago, suddenly everyone started to like him.
Dugu Shuo: Sometimes, he gives me candies. So I'm glad that people are starting to like him now!
Yelan: Just as I thought...
Dugu Shuo: Huh? What do you mean?
Yelan: I mean, just as I thought, Master Dugu is indeed as kind and virtuous as the legends claim.
Dugu Shuo: Heh... I'm not THAT great...
Dugu Shuo: Oh yeah, one other thing. These days, there's a lot of people I've never seen before talking about Zhiyi's stories in the street. They seemed like nice people.
Yelan: Oh, definitely.
Dugu Shuo: Great! So next time I see them, I'll say hi! And... I guess I can share some of my candies with them, too.
Yelan: Certainly! You can also tell my friend in Yanshang Teahouse about what they're up to. I'm sure my friend would also like to say hi to them.
Dugu Shuo: Thank you, Ma'am!
Yelan: You're welcome! Well then... Fare thee well, Master Dugu.
Dugu Shuo: Until we meet again!
Yelan: Any of that sound strange to you?
Traveler: Yes, I heard it.
Paimon: Strange? What was strange about it?
Paimon: Zhiyi seems to have a great reputation. Uncle Sun and Uncle Gao spoke highly of him, and Dugu Shuo seems to like him, too...
Yelan: True, but the issue is... where did his sudden celebrity come from? It almost seems too good to be true.
Paimon: Sudden? Too good to be true? What do you mean?
Yelan: So he returns cruelty with kindness, and had to work to support his studies... These are the kinds of things that make someone well-known in their hometown. But Uncle Sun said even his friends who travel far and wide hear about him wherever they go. That's a little over the top, if you ask me.
Yelan: Do you remember what Dugu Shuo said about Zhiyi's stories? Clearly they left him with a good impression of the guy, but beyond that he wasn't interested in the details. That's the reaction I would expect from any normal person.
Yelan: Plus there's the fact that all this praise of Zhiyi has only been happening within the last two or three months.
Yelan: His childhood, his studies, the thing with his neighbor... None of these are recent events. So why are these stories only going around now?
Paimon: When you put it like that, it is kinda strange...
Yelan: Of course, if that's all there was to it, I wouldn't look into it any further.
Yelan: Zhiyi was born into a poor family. Paying people to get his stories out there is within the rules of the game, as far as I'm concerned.
Yelan: The problem is... do you remember what Uncle Gao said about him? He's stayed poor his whole life. Everything he's earned, he's either spent on studying, traveling, or paying off debts. I don't think he has the Mora to pay for a publicity campaign.
Traveler: Someone's helping him.
Yelan: Right, and that changes everything... It could mean a powerful faction is trying to gain influence over the Liyue Qixing.
Yelan: That's the worst-case scenario, but all too often, the most pessimistic speculation turns out to be the closest to the truth.
Paimon: Someone's trying to gain influence over the Qixing? That sounds serious. What should we do?
Paimon: Even if we asked Zhiyi about it, surely there's no way he'd admit it.
Yelan: First we need to find out who's supporting him... Don't worry, I've got a plan.
Yelan: Remember the Current Affairs and Planning stage of the assessment? Since the successful candidate is duty bound to implement their plan after taking office, their manifesto tells us their stance on key issues.
Yelan: Whoever is secretly helping Zhiyi must be seeking to benefit from his actions after his appointment. So we should be able to find some hints in Zhiyi's manifesto on who we're dealing with.
Yelan: Come on, let's get back to Yanshang Teahouse.
Traveler: Maybe he's working with someone.
Traveler: I'm completely lost right now.
Traveler: I guess it's a white lie...

## Talk 7

Yelan: Zhiyi's manifesto covers a huge range of topics. Looking for details that don't add up will be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
Yelan: I'll divide the reports into two piles. You take one, I'll take the other. When we're finished, we'll put our heads together.
Yelan: Officially, the assessment is already over, and I'll be expected to announce the results before long. So we have to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can.
Paimon: Yikes! We'd better hurry.
Yelan: Whatever else Uncle Tian might think of Zhiyi, the fact remains that he's one of his favorite students.
Yelan: Any evidence he's left is not going to be immediately obvious. We'll have to look carefully, and think critically.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whew... Even though Yelan took half, this is still a lot to get through...
Paimon: Well, we gotta start somewhere.

## Talk 9

Shanghua: Aha, looks like I'm the first one back, as usual.
Paimon: Oh, hey, it's one of Yelan's little helpers, Shanghua!
Paimon: If you're back, that means... that means you've finished investigating Qianwei, right?
Shanghua: You betcha. I visited all the commerce guilds and gathered a wealth of information. Every time they asked me to leave, but I always had another trick up my sleeve...
Yelan: Don't drag this out. Just tell us your findings.
Shanghua: Yes, Lady Yelan.
Shanghua: To summarize my findings, most people who've had interactions with Qianwei will start out complaining about how proud and arrogant he is, but then go on to give a generally positive appraisal of him.
Shanghua: The young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild said that Qianwei appears arrogant, but he's very scrupulous in the way he works.
Shanghua: Once he signs a contract with somebody, he treats them fairly regardless of their background.
Paimon: Who'd have thought!
Yelan: Is it possible that his reputation is fake? Is there any way you can check the accounts of the businesses under his name?
Shanghua: In theory, that should be very difficult. But here's the thing... I asked around and found out that almost all of Qianwei's accounts are open to the public.
Shanghua: Where he buys from and sells to should be confidential business information, but he doesn't seem interested in protecting it at all.
Shanghua: Qianwei often sees business opportunities that others don't. But once he's made enough Mora off of it, it's like he gets sick of it and releases all of his trade secrets.
Shanghua: It's like he wants people to know that they still can't beat him even if he shares all of his secrets. The fact that someone like that can still make Mora is pretty infuriating when you think about it!
Paimon: What a strange guy. It's like he's not doing business to make Mora, but instead...
Yelan: To validate his theories. No wonder his manifesto contains so many insights — it's all the result of his firsthand experimentation.
Wenyuan: I'm back... Huh? How come you're here?
Shanghua: Why do you think? Obviously, because I possess superior skills and am always one step ahead of the competition... Well, when you're the competition, at least.
Wenyuan: You... Whatever, I'm not getting into an argument with you. If I hadn't had something else to take care of on the way, I would've been back long before you.
Wenyuan: Lady Yelan, I have finished investigating Mingbo.
Yelan: Well, we're all ears.
Wenyuan: The Ministry of Civil Affairs says that Mingbo struggles to get his words out when he gets nervous, especially when he's chatting with strangers.
Wenyuan: But after a few days of getting to know him, you can pretty much have a normal conversation with him. On the whole, the feedback from the Ministry of Civil Affairs was very positive. He always considers the things that everyone else overlooks.
Yelan: In your opinion, was the Ministry of Civil Affairs' appraisal of Mingbo at all exaggerated?
Wenyuan: I don't believe so. Mingbo is someone who has slowly but surely earned the reputation he has today.
Wenyuan: According to Ms. Yu, the Ministry often gets Mingbo to take a final look at projects before they're implemented. People feel much more confident in something if it has his stamp of approval.
Wenyuan: Oh, and also, there was once someone in the Ministry who was lying and cheating to try to advance their career. Mingbo gave them the scolding of a lifetime. Apparently, he can be terrifying when he loses his temper... I haven't seen it for myself though.
Paimon: Whoa... That's hard to imagine...
Yelan: Like I said before: Things are not always as they appear.
Paimon: Ah, so that's what you meant by that. Paimon's starting to get it now...
Yelan: Thank you both. You're free to go now.
Yelan: #So, have you finished reading the manifesto, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: We still have a bit left, hehe.
Black Screen Text: You finish reading the manifesto with Yelan.
Yelan: Hmm... I can't see any immediate problems looking at the individual entries.
Yelan: The only one that strikes me as a little unusual is the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan.
Traveler: What's that?
Yelan: Qingxu Pool has always been home to many secrets. Plus, Azhdaha once wrought havoc there, so there are even more secrets buried deep underground.
Yelan: At some point, a rumor began to go around that there is great treasure buried beneath Qingxu Pool.
Yelan: A long time ago, with the approval of the Qixing, a mining team conducted an exploratory excavation there.
Paimon: So... did they find any treasure?
Yelan: None. The ruin was completely impenetrable. The only way they could have gotten through the solid rock would've been by blowing it open with a special kind of explosive.
Yelan: The technology wasn't mature enough at that time, so the excavation project was shut down, and the "treasure" became a mere legend.
Yelan: Zhiyi's manifesto focuses on solving problems, and this treasure hunt seems extremely risky. It seems out of step with the rest of his plans.
Yelan: Still, this one fact alone doesn't tell us much. Everyone wants to get their hands on this treasure — the Treasure Hoarders, the Fatui, even local Liyue factions...
Yelan: Did you find anything?
Paimon: #"Excavation," "project," "treasure"... Did we read anything similar in our half of the manifesto, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: The Blackcliff Forge...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Zhiyi said the Blackcliff Forge workers should get right of first refusal if any suitable projects come up!
Yelan: Did he now? Well, that makes everything much clearer... So Zhiyi wants the Blackcliff Forge to excavate the treasure of Qingxu Pool.
Paimon: Does that mean the Blackcliff Forge is Zhiyi's secret supporter?
Yelan: No, not likely. I've looked into the Blackcliff Forge before. They aren't involved with any powerful factions at present.
Yelan: They do possess some specialized explosives, but it would seem more trouble than it's worth to put so many resources into a risky project like this.
Yelan: Still, since the clues are pointing toward the Blackcliff Forge, we should see where they lead. We may well find something new.
Traveler: The "Rock" chapter.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Sooooo... anything strange been going on recently?
Iron Shoulder: ...Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean, strange how?
Paimon: Uhhh... just... y'know, stuff that when it happens, you think to yourself: "That was weird!"
Iron Shoulder: ?
Yelan: I don't think we're going to get anywhere asking questions like that. Let's just take a look around.

## Talk 11

Paimon: What's this? A diary?
Yelan: From the back, it looks like a ledger. But it seems they also use it as a site log.
Yelan: We don't know who wrote it, but it's interesting, don't you think? These newcomers... Who could have sent them?
Paimon: You think they're suspicious?
Yelan: Yes. Look, it says right there: one of them's already been promoted to team leader.
Yelan: At this rate, by the time the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan is ready to roll, they'll be the technical backbone of the team.
Yelan: That'll give them the chance to take a lot of liberties... They can copy any secret texts or steal any treasure they find underground.
Yelan: Imagine if we didn't suspect anything. By the time Zhiyi recommends the Blackcliff Forge for the excavation project, at most we would maybe do a fresh background check on the place.
Yelan: No red flags if all they did was change some key staff. And even if we decided to vet the staff individually, they'd have had more than enough time by then to come up with fake identities.
Yelan: That's the advantage of planning this far in advance... It was a clever move.
Paimon: When you put it like that, it all makes sense... If we hadn't found this out, someone else would've stolen the treasure!
Paimon: So who's really behind all this?
Yelan: That's a question for the newcomers. But let's start with that worker over there for now.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Uh, excuse us... We wanna ask you about the newcomers!
Iron Shoulder: *sigh* You want them to teach you or something?
Iron Shoulder: I gotta say, these newcomers are in tip-top shape. Fast learners, too. They're picking up all the skills unbelievably fast.
Iron Shoulder: My only complaint is that they're always going out drinking at night, but they never let us join them.
Iron Shoulder: I guess they just need some time to adjust. I'm sure we'll get to know each other over time.
Yelan: They go out drinking? This area isn't exactly renowned for the nightlife. I'm guessing it's a long trip to the nearest tavern?
Iron Shoulder: You got that right. They tell me they go all the way back to Liyue Harbor to drink at Wanmin Restaurant.
Iron Shoulder: It rained after work today, so they actually stuck around at the site for a while. But as soon as the rain stopped, they went out drinking again right away.
Iron Shoulder: Hey, you're only young once, right? I say, if they can hack it, let 'em at it, haha.
Yelan: #Interesting. Let's go talk somewhere else, {NICKNAME}.
Black Screen Text: Yelan takes you to a quieter place...
Yelan: Looks like our hunch was on the Mora. These newcomers are very suspicious.
Yelan: Drinking in Liyue Harbor, huh? Some cover story. I'll wager they've been going to intelligence updates...
Yelan: Good thing it rained today — it means they'll leave footprints... I doubt they'd give themselves away that easily, but let's follow them and try our luck.

## Talk 13

Yelan: The footprints stop here.
Yelan: But judging from the direction, I'm guessing their destination was that abandoned house.

## Talk 14

Yelan: Looks like we were too late.
Yelan: This has gotta be where the newcomers rendezvous with whoever they're working for. But all the evidence has been destroyed.
Yelan: Look at these ashes. Someone was burning documents not long before we arrived.
Paimon: Could there be anything left? Maybe the wind could've blown the fire out before everything was finished burning?
Yelan: The odds of that are very slim. It's practically impossible. I've checked — all the paper's been burned. There's only ash left now.
Paimon: Why don't we wait for them back at the Blackcliff Forge? They've gotta go back there sooner or later.
Yelan: We can't count on that. Clearly, they were based here at one point, but it's mysteriously abandoned now.
Yelan: To me, that says that whoever's behind this has moved them somewhere else to throw our investigation off course.
Paimon: Darn... Guess this is where our trail runs cold!
Yelan: Make no mistake, the purpose of our trip wasn't to find any solid evidence. We just need to figure out who's behind Zhiyi.
Yelan: I smelled something peculiar the moment I came in.
Yelan: Those newcomers probably thought they'd be safe as long as they burned the letters. But what they failed to consider is that paper and ink from different regions produce different odors when they're burned.
Paimon: #Really? *sniff* Paimon can't smell anything! Do you smell anything, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I smell a very gentle fragrance.
Yelan: There is a certain place with a freezing-cold climate where there's nothing but ice as far as the eye can see.
Yelan: Some wealthy people there put floral fragrance in their ink as a way of injecting a little romance into their writing.
Yelan: When that fragrant ink is burned, this is the exact odor that it leaves behind...
Traveler: Snezhnaya...
Yelan: Exactly. The evidence will soon be blown away by the wind, so it's nothing we can arrest anyone with.
Yelan: But it's all I need. Now I know who we're dealing with, I can plan our next move.
Black Screen Text: You leave the abandoned house with Yelan...
Wupei: Lady Yelan! Oh, thank goodness I finally found you! *sob* ...I thought I'd never see you again!
Paimon: ...Um, who are you?
Yelan: Don't be alarmed, this is Wupei. He's Wenyuan and Shanghua's colleague.
Yelan: I sent him to look into Zhiyi's regular contacts. Since Zhiyi likes fishing, Wupei thought he might know some of the fishermen and sailors, so he took a boat out to sea to ask around.
Yelan: I left him a note at Yanshang Teahouse telling him to look for me at Blackcliff Forge when he got back. If there'd been an ambush waiting for us there, it means we'd have had some backup.
Yelan: So, what did you find out at sea?
Wupei: *sigh* Forgive my incompetence. I'm afraid I've come up empty-handed.
Wupei: I asked all the fishermen multiple times, but none of them had had any interactions with Zhiyi before. Then the waves got so choppy I ended up falling overboard. Fortunately, someone managed to drag me out.
Wupei: When I got back, I heard that you'd gone to Blackcliff Forge and might need backup, so I went straight there as fast as I could. Didn't even stop to change my clothes.
Yelan: Oh? Well, Uncle Tian said that Zhiyi once bought a recipe from one of the fishermen. Did you hear anything about that at all?
Wupei: What? That's news to me.
Wupei: No, that's not possible... It's absolutely not possible! Lady Yelan, I'm telling you — I spoke to every single fisherman out there, and none of them mentioned anything about a recipe.
Yelan: Interesting... Then I wonder how that "even more wonderful" fish soup came about?
Wupei: Fish soup? What fish soup?
Yelan: Nothing. Our priority right now is to find a way to get our hands on some solid evidence.
Yelan: Well, any suggestions?
Traveler: Send someone to tail them?
Yelan: Not a bad idea. Wupei, what do you think?
Wupei: Honestly, I've already tried following Zhiyi. But the guy's too cautious. Never meets with anyone suspicious.
Paimon: Okay, so tailing's out...
Yelan: No, we'll still need to tail him. But first, we need to do some groundwork.
Paimon: Groundwork?
Yelan: When you've worked in intelligence for a long time, you'll understand that no one can stay on high alert forever. Especially... when he thinks he's about to win.
Yelan: Tomorrow morning, I'll announce his victory at Yuehai Pavillion. Take a guess, what do you think he'll do next?
Yelan: Be sure to arrive on time. You won't wanna miss the show.
Traveler: Catch them red-handed when they meet...
Traveler: The Fatui!

### Additional Talk 1

Yelan: Made any discoveries?
Paimon: Not so far... But we're still looking!

### Additional Talk 2

Yelan: Try not to let him see you. We want this information to be as truthful as possible.
