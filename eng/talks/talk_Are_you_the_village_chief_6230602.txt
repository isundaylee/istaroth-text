Traveler: Are you the village chief?
Granny Ruoxin: Actually I'm not. But after doing the same kind of work as a village chief for so long, it's what everyone calls me.
Granny Ruoxin: Ours is a gentle and peaceful village surrounded by clear waters and beautiful mountains. Life is pleasant here, and we don't want for food or water.
Granny Ruoxin: The only problem is that because it's too quiet here, the young people have all moved away to Liyue Harbor or elsewhere in Teyvat. We've not enough people left to share the work of the village.
Granny Ruoxin: We old folks have the responsibility of tending to the fields and looking after the grandchildren, so that our sons and daughters can work in whatever far-flung place they want without needing to worry about the family.
