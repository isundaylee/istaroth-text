# Pigeon, Duck, and Child


## Talk 1

Timmie: Argh! YOU again! You've scared all my pigeons off... again!
Timmie: I was feeding them. What do you have to say for yourself?
Traveler: Oops...
Timmie: Hmph. Well, Mommy always tells me that if someone's really sorry, they will show it with their actions, not their words.
Timmie: The bridge pigeons are my friends. I feed them all the time.
Timmie: But these days the ducks are coming and stealing their food, and the pigeons never have enough to eat anymore.
Timmie: I want you to find three wheats for me and feed them to the ducks. While you're doing that, I can make sure the bridge pigeons get enough to eat.
Timmie: Once both sides have had enough to eat, maybe everyone can become friends.
Traveler: Sure.
Timmie: Thank you.
Timmie: If you treat the animals well, maybe you can become friends with them too.
Traveler: I seek not the friendship of pigeons.
Timmie: Whether you want to be their friend or not... You owe them an apology!
Timmie: So hurry up and get that wheat!

## Talk 2

Timmie: Found the wheat yet?
Traveler: Yep.
Timmie: It looks like enough.
Timmie: Take it down to the lake and feed it to the ducks.

## Talk 3

Timmie: I'm sure they'll all get on much better after a nice meal.
Timmie: Next time you're passing by, please try not to scare off the pigeons. It's hard work to get them to come back again.
Traveler: I'll be more careful in the future.
Timmie: Alright. I forgive you. Here, have a Mondstadt hash brown â€” they're my favorite!
Timmie: Mommy says you should always be kind to others.

## Talk 4

Timmie: Have you found the wheat yet?
Traveler: Still looking...
Timmie: Fine. But make sure you find it before the ducks get back!
Timmie: The pigeons? They're not here yet. Don't you worry about them, they'll be here.

## Talk 5

Timmie: Why aren't my pigeons here yet...

## Talk 6

Timmie: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!? I saw that, you... you... Those poor ducks...!
Traveler: It was for the pigeons...
Timmie: Go away! I never want to see you again... EVER!
Timmie: *sobbing* I'm telling Mommy...
