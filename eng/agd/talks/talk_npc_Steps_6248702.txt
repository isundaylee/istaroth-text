Traveler: Steps?
Yougui: The elevation differences in Yilong Wharf are too great, and the water-powered lift is only used to transport large items. It doesn't run often, either.
Yougui: Sometimes we just have to take the stairs when we get a job that needs delivering quickly.
Yougui: The paths between the upper and lower wharf are designed to be long and winding. Stops them from being steep, but that's extra work for us.
Yougui: I've heard that the Communications Office is planning on building several small lifts... That will improve the situation, no doubt about it.
