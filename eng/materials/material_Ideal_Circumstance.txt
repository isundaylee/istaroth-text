# Ideal Circumstance

Alhaitham's specialty. A dish created through the fusion of vegetables and meat prepared in a patterned frying pan. Improvements were made to the recipe, making it taste quite different from the original dish. The words on the food mean "contemplation." In the words of the creator: "Ideally, everyone should be capable of contemplation, but practically, it doesn't seem very possible."
