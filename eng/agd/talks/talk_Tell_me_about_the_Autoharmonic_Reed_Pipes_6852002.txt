Traveler: Tell me about the Autoharmonic Reed Pipes...
Osse: Ah... Well, as their name implies, they are machines that can play music by themselves.
Osse: Our ancient civilization was founded upon music, and many such devices have survived to this day.
Osse: However, unlike the music box in your hands or the devices used to play the "symphony," this sort can only play a few simple chords. As such, their strength is correspondingly weaker.
Osse: We should encounter more such instruments later, but they will not prove much of an obstacle for those who can already wield the power of the "symphony" power as we do.
