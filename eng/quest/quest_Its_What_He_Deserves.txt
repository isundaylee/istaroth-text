# It's What He Deserves


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Hey, Traveler, come here! Have a look at this!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look, there's a fallen guard over there! Paimon sees some Society members, too!
Wriothesley: After them.

## Talk 3

Wyler: It's Wriothesley! Run!

## Talk 4

Secaille: Ah, the door's open! Maybe it's His Grace. I'll go take a look!

## Talk 5

Ielmini: Your Grace, Your Grace!
Wriothesley: What's the matter?
Ielmini: We couldn't find any Society members in the other areas. It also seems like none of the equipment in those rooms were ever used — all the signs of wear and tear are fake.
Ielmini: The limescale, the layers of dust... they were all deliberately added.
Ielmini: We also investigated the members' residences, and weren't able to find anything. Their neighbors all say that they haven't returned home for ages.
Wriothesley: Oh... Is that right...
Paimon: They're gone? That could only mean...
Traveler: The Society put a lot of effort into building a front.
Wriothesley: Indeed. As long as he allowed Society members to mingle with others, even with threats of censure, Dougier knew that he could not stop all of his members from speaking out.
Wriothesley: Meanwhile, this marvelous "gathering place" will lose all of its value as soon as a whistleblower sounds the alarm.
Wriothesley: So instead of being his real base, this is just an elaborate performance. The rest areas, the fancy equipment, even the members that we saw... they were merely a part of the front.
Wriothesley: And only the most docile and well-trained members were selected as his "performers."
Paimon: But then... where can we actually find him?
Wriothesley: Let me think...
Wriothesley: Dougier must be holding all the rest of his members in another place. And if the overseer of my Fortress Guard has never alerted me to anything of the sort...
Wriothesley: He must be in Dougier's pocket.
Traveler: Let's go find him.
Wriothesley: I'm of the same mind. Let's go. You too, follow me.
Traveler: He can tell us where the real headquarters are.
Traveler: Their real headquarters are elsewhere.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Did that person flee here?
Wriothesley: That's the most likely scenario to me. He's probably already caught wind of Dougier's declaration of war against me, and has fled to seek his protection.
Wriothesley: Let's keep heading down. There are some abandoned areas in there. Since he needs space, I'd guess Dougier probably converted them into his headquarters.
Wriothesley: We should be on the right track. Now, we just need to find that turncoat.
Wriothesley: Let's go. We can take this path, you guys take the other.

## Talk 7

Wyler: Those blasted guards!
Gouzien: *panting*... *panting*...
Wriothesley: Did Dougier send you? Why did you attack that guard?
Wyler: ...
Paimon: C'mon, it's time to talk! Can't you see that he's trying to help!?
Wriothesley: I will take your cooperation into consideration when it comes time to hand out sentences.
Wyler: Mr. Dougier, h—he... didn't want this guy to expose our true location...
Wyler: We were just about to dispose of him when you caught up to us.
Wriothesley: So, in other words, your headquarters should be this way?
Gouzien: Y—Yes, it's just down this way. You'll make it there once you've seen and passed through a large drainage pipe.
Traveler: Now that's more like it.
Wriothesley: Guards, take them away.
Wriothesley: Let's go. It's about time that we find out what Dougier's really after.

## Talk 8

Gouzien: *panting*... *panting*...
Wriothesley: Did Dougier send you? Why did you attack that guard?
Wyler: ...
Paimon: C'mon, it's time to talk! Can't you see that he's trying to help!?
Wriothesley: I will take your cooperation into consideration when it comes time to hand out sentences.
Wyler: Mr. Dougier, h—he... didn't want this guy to expose our true location...
Wyler: We were just about to dispose of him when you caught up to us.
Wriothesley: So, in other words, your headquarters should be this way?
Gouzien: Y—Yes, it's just down this way. You'll make it there once you've seen and passed through a large drainage pipe.
Traveler: Now that's more like it.
Wriothesley: Guards, take them away.
Wriothesley: Let's go. It's about time that we find out what Dougier's really after.

## Talk 9

Paimon: There's so much space down here...
Wriothesley: Yeah, these are all former work areas. They've been left abandoned due to a lack of funds.
Wriothesley: There are usually guards on patrol here... *sigh* It would seem that all of those guards have been bought as well.
Wriothesley: Stay sharp. He's got a ton of surprises waiting for us, I'm sure.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey, are you okay?
Wriothesley: You're safe now. Just follow the guards and leave this place.
Paimon: Who knew that there'd be Gardemeks here... Dougier really prepared for everything.
Wriothesley: That would explain the strange decommission requests I received, as well as account for all the Gardemeks that had mysteriously gone missing.
Wriothesley: Seems like he's prepared for an all-out confrontation with me.
Paimon: Hey, what's this?
Wriothesley: Seems like some kind of handbook. Let me see...
Wriothesley: Ah, this should be the Society's real rulesbook. It lists all the rules that they are expected to follow...
Wriothesley: Members are not permitted to speak to each other, or to leave without formal permission...
Wriothesley: Five members shall form a group, and the whole group will be punished for any single member's wrongdoings...
Wriothesley: Anyone who reports a fellow member's misbehavior shall be rewarded with food and water.
Wriothesley: ...I see, so it's much as I expected.
Paimon: But that's just cruel and unreasonable...
Wriothesley: To obtain food and water, prisoners are forced to snitch on others, and in the process, cause pain to those around them.
Wriothesley: To avoid punishment, they learn to stop talking with one another. This leaves the wounds they've already received to fester, however, and so resentment builds, until every prisoner has become an island.
Wriothesley: Finally, isolated and without hope, they accept their fate as Dougier's slaves.
Traveler: That's terrible.
Wriothesley: Do you remember what happened to Paimon? She rejected all the snacks in the box once she was spooked by that black gem.
Wriothesley: She's usually all for tasty snacks, but she chose to go against her instincts after a negative experience.
Paimon: Ugh, is that the best example you could come up with? Anyway, Paimon still thinks she made the right decision. It never hurts to be careful...
Wriothesley: No, your decision was valid. However, it's also valid to interpret that as a decision that you only made under emotional duress.
Wriothesley: The human heart is like a raft in a vast and empty ocean. We convince ourselves that we're in control, but in truth, a single wave could sweep us off course, and send us crashing into the path of a storm.
Wriothesley: Those who use fear to lead others astray must pay for that crime.
Traveler: The whole thing is an affront to human dignity.

## Talk 11

Wriothesley: If I'm not mistaken, the space ahead should be the central area of this place, but the door's been locked.
Wriothesley: Rather than confront Dougier, I think it's more important right now for us to rescue as many Society members as possible.
Wriothesley: You guys should wait here. We'll try to open the door and check out some other spots.
Paimon: Open the door... Would we have to do something to this mechanism here? Ugh, Paimon doesn't get it at all...
Paimon: Forget it, Paimon's just gonna do some trial and error.

## Talk 12

Wriothesley: These should be the prison cells.
Wriothesley: Hmm... Lots of empty cells in here. Dougier's probably moved them elsewhere already.
Paimon: Let's still rescue the ones who got left behind, though. Every person counts!
Paimon: Hey, it's alright now! You can leave this place!
Eclancher: No... No! I won't try to leave anymore. I'll never try to leave again!
Eclancher: Don't get close to me. I don't want any trouble!
Paimon: No, we're not gonna do that. Please calm down, we're not bad people!
Wriothesley: We won't be able to get through to her right now. Not with the stress response in the way.
Wriothesley: I'd also guess there are many others here who are more or less like her. Let's let the guards take care of them for now, and keep pushing forward.
Traveler: Avice and Faissolle are still in danger.
Paimon: ...Alright. Let's search for an exit first.

## Talk 13

Wriothesley: I leave this area to you. Make sure to bring everyone out safe.
Secaille: Understood, and please take care as well, Your Grace. We'll return here right away and await your orders.
Wriothesley: Mm-hmm, just focus on the tasks you've been given. I already have reliable help over here.
Wriothesley: Let's go back. We have unfinished business, do we not?
Wriothesley: That mechanism from the first room... Maybe we'll also need to hold it in place using the same device to open the door that leads to the central area.
Wriothesley: Don't forget to bring these along.

## Talk 14

Dougier: I must confess to being furious. To think that there are still some of you who find it permissible to spit upon our rules.
Dougier: Remember their names: Faissolle and Avice. They've betrayed you — betrayed us!
Dougier: And today, you will see with your own eyes what will happen to those who betray our cause!
Dougier: Go on, Avice. Pierce his skull with the thorn in your hands, and then push in the Aqua Doloris.
Dougier: Of course, you will do it one drop at a time. Let it do its magic again and again, and don't stop until you've pushed all of it in!
Avice: Faissolle... I'm sorry...
Faissolle: It... It's okay. I'll... find a way to endure...
Dougier: Oh, shut your wretched mouths. When did I give you permission to speak!?
Dougier: My rules are the paramount law of this place. Only more pain will come to those who dare to disobey!
Wriothesley: That's enough, Dougier. Your rabid screams have been beyond nauseating.
Deparis: !!!
Fidelin: Is that... His Grace!?
Dougier: Ah, Wriothesley... I knew you would come, but I didn't expect you to be so quick.
Dougier: Must you still refuse to let me be? Did I not spell everything out for you already? What's so blasphemous about sharing a slice of the cake with me when you've already got the entire fortress at your feet?
Wriothesley: It would seem that you can't see the difference between "sharing" and "looting," and on top of that...
Wriothesley: Look at your people. Are they not starving as you wolf down your cake?
Dougier: You...! Stop acting all high and mighty like some hero of justice!
Dougier: Have you forgotten? Nobody in this blasted Fortress is innocent! We are all irredeemable monsters who have destroyed something that others held dear.
Dougier: What's so wrong about punishing those who deserve to be punished? It's what they've always deserved!
Dougier: And please, are you really going to tell me that you care about their lives and well-being when you just need a supply of labor to keep this place running? Isn't that all you need to keep your cushy life?
Wriothesley: Sadly, you're wrong on both counts. Unlike you, I've never seen them as currency.
Wriothesley: The Fortress is not only a place for confinement, but also a place for rebirth.
Wriothesley: Just as people are free to give in to the darkness within their hearts, they are also free to seek redemption and a new beginning. Our bodies have limits, but our spirits will always remain free.
Wriothesley: They may have made mistakes, but they are still human beings with people and things that they cherish...
Wriothesley: And most importantly, they should always retain the freedom to choose their own path once they've reflected on their past misdeeds!
Wriothesley: But you... You're destroying their spirits with fear! Taking their freedom away, so that they will become slaves who'll never again feel or think!
Wriothesley: And you say that's what they've always deserved? You're nothing compared to them.
Paimon: He... He's really mad!
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Dougier: You think me arrogant, Wriothesley? Well, I think you're too young and naive. You understand nothing of the world.
Dougier: Nobody actually sees this Fortress as any kind of just or wonderful place. See it for what it is — a dumping ground of pain and misery, irredeemable now, and irredeemable forever!
Dougier: No prisoner will listen to you out of gratitude of their hearts. The whip is the only way to make them obey!
Dougier: Had you been just one step slower, I would have already taken control of all the Gardemeks in this place.
Dougier: Your Vision gives you strength, but how long will it hold against these powerful constructs?
Wriothesley: Hmph, you talk big, but in the end, you know nothing outside of power and control. In that case... let me give you a small taste of what real power looks like.
Traveler: Honestly, he's been keeping it in until now.

## Talk 15

Black Screen Text: The guards rescue the Society members who have been imprisoned at the true headquarters.
Black Screen Text: Wriothesley spends much time with each member, comforting them and extending his personal apologies.
Black Screen Text: Following that, he makes arrangements for follow-up medical care and cleanup work.
Black Screen Text: And thus does the Beret Society debacle truly come to an end.

## Talk 16

Wriothesley: Sorry for taking so long. Did I keep you waiting?
Paimon: No, not at all! Paimon didn't know you were so considerate.
Wriothesley: Heh, if you ask me, I'd say I actually feel very helpless. There's no way that I could truly empathize with the fear that the members felt every day.
Wriothesley: I could comfort and compensate them all I want, but it might still not be enough to repair the damage that has been done.
Wriothesley: I have to take responsibility for it, as does the Fortress.
Traveler: At least we were able to stop it before it got any worse, right?
Wriothesley: Yeah, it's the least that we could do.
Paimon: So, do you have a plan for how you're gonna deal with him yet?
Wriothesley: Oh, Dougier? I've already got an idea.
Wriothesley: For now, I think I'll do nothing.
Paimon: Huh? Why?
Wriothesley: I think it's a very fitting punishment for him to have to imagine the sorts of punishments that will be soon coming his way.
Wriothesley: He'll be left in the dark with regards to both the dates and the details of his punishment.
Wriothesley: Of course, that's not to say that I'll be letting him off scot-free. It's not often that I actually get the chance to be creative with my punishments...
Wriothesley: I'm going to talk to the members of the Society. He'll get a chance to experience everything that he's ever inflicted on them.
Traveler: Good idea.
Paimon: Paimon didn't know you could also be so harsh... Looks like she should watch her tongue when she's around you in the future.
Wriothesley: Why do you think I'd do that kind of thing to you? You offend me, Paimon.
Wriothesley: Anyway, jokes aside, thank you so much for all of your help. There's still a lot for me to take care of, so...
Wriothesley: How about this? I'll treat you to a meal in two days at the Coupon Cafeteria. We should have a better handle on things by then.
Paimon: Uh... No, Paimon's had enough of that place...
Wriothesley: Don't worry, it won't be the same old Welfare Meal. I'll make the necessary arrangements.
Paimon: Oh, then you've got yourself a deal!
Traveler: I suppose this is a kind of punishment that only the Fortress can mete out.
Traveler: Maybe you should give a more formal apology.
Wriothesley: You're right. Besides formal apologies and reprimands, I also probably need to head upstairs to have a talk about how best to manage the guards.
Traveler: You sound more serious than usual.
Wriothesley: Even I wouldn't be able to find humor in a situation like this.

## Talk 17

Wriothesley: Ah, you're here.
Paimon: #Paimon never forgets about meals! Even if Traveler forgets, Paimon will remind {F#her}{M#him} for sure!
Traveler: You say that as if I haven't been feeding you or something...
Paimon: Ah, that's not what Paimon meant at all! Wriothesley, you got what Paimon meant, right...?
Wriothesley: Mm? I'm a little confused, actually.
Paimon: Hey, not you, too!
Wriothesley: Jokes aside, I've got some good news. After taking a look, the doctors have let me know that it shouldn't be too difficult to extract the thorns.
Wriothesley: Which means that everyone should be able to recover after a period of rest.
Wriothesley: As for their mental recoveries, most are making good progress as well. We've added a few who were more severely affected to a special observation list.
Paimon: You've sure got everything taken care of, Wriothesley!
Wriothesley: I try my best. After all, it's my duty to take care of everything that happens within my territory.
Traveler: I have a question for you, actually.
Wriothesley: Please go ahead.
Traveler: Your flashbacks when you picked up the gem...
Wriothesley: Ah, that's a bit of a long story...
Wriothesley: I once had a similar experience. It had to do with the host family I lived with as a child...
Wriothesley: I was an orphan adopted by a couple with a great deal of love in their hearts. I had many siblings, and we all adored each other.
Wriothesley: Once we were older, Mom and Dad would turn us over to be individually adopted by families of greater means, and go on to adopt more young children...
Wriothesley: They were perfect parents — or so I thought.
Paimon: And then...?
Wriothesley: And then I found out we were merely raised as livestock. Once we had reached a certain age, our "parents" would bring us to the market for sale.
Wriothesley: All children that were sold would leave the house, and nobody would know what became of them. As for those who didn't sell... they were merely "disposed of."
Wriothesley: Did you know? I once considered myself an extremely lucky child. And all of my friends — all of my siblings — they all felt this way as well...
Wriothesley: I was also not the first to find out about the truth. All those who found out before me were simply added to the disposal pile.
Wriothesley: I could never shake the feeling of irony every time I juxtaposed their tragic ends against our parents' adoring smiles.
Traveler: That explains a lot...
Wriothesley: Yes, like the Society, my parents created a facade of joy, lied to satiate their desires, and even employed incredibly cruel methods to keep their grasp on power.
Wriothesley: They did all of that, but never considered how their actions would utterly ruin all the children they took under their wing. Worse, perhaps they never cared about that at all.
Wriothesley: —But I did.
Wriothesley: So, in the end, I killed them, and set all of the remaining children free. I was convicted for my crimes, and exiled to the Fortress of Meropide.
Paimon: Oh...
Wriothesley: My methods were extreme, yes...
Wriothesley: But I was still a teenager at the time. I'd been betrayed by those I trusted most, and I didn't think that more "moderate" ways would solve the problem.
Wriothesley: My doubt and helpless anger pushed me forward until I got what I deserved.
Traveler: I have to... take some time to process that.
Wriothesley: It's alright, you don't have to tell me what you think. I've already committed to this path, regardless of what anyone may say about it.
Wriothesley: The least I can do is to make sure that the same tragedy will not happen again in my new home.
Avice: Sorry to disturb you, everyone...
Paimon: Oh, it's Avice and Faissolle! Are you two feeling better yet?
Faissolle: It was all because you arrived in time. I managed to escape unscathed.
Traveler: Glad to hear it.
Avice: We came here on impulse today, because we were hoping that you'd be able to lend us a hand, Your Grace...
Wriothesley: Please go on right ahead. I'll do my best to help — within reason, of course.
Faissolle: It's... Erm... I'd like to be wedded to Avice here at the Fortress...
Paimon: You're getting married!?
Faissolle: Yeah, we met each other through the Society, and both fell into Dougier's trap.
Faissolle: But even during our time there, we never doubted each other. We always believed that Dougier was manipulating us, trying to make us mistrust each other.
Faissolle: And after this incident... We've come to believe that we've found "the one" for the rest of our lives.
Avice: Hehe, you could say we managed to make the best out of a bad situation. He didn't abandon me, and I didn't forsake him either.
Avice: But we're still both prisoners, and we also aren't sure if the Fortress is the best place to host something so celebratory...
Avice: So we are just wondering... Is our request a bit too out of line?
Wriothesley: Hmm, you're right in that the Fortress has never hosted a wedding before...
Wriothesley: But that's no reason to say no, is it? I'll help you make the arrangements. If you need anything special shipped in from the surface, just say the word.
Faissolle: We can't thank you enough, Your Grace!
Faissolle: We are actually also planning to stay here after the conclusion of our sentences.
Avice: Yeah, we've already made tons of special memories here, so now, it'd be too hard to leave.
Avice: And we have full confidence in the Fortress' future with you at the helm, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: Your trust is the highest form of praise.
Paimon: Hey, loosen up a bit. Shouldn't you be the happiest man in Teyvat to hear that people would like to stay of their own free will?
Wriothesley: Yeah...
Wriothesley: I'll always take a genuine expression of faith over any obligation to obey.
Traveler: I don't really know what to say.
Traveler: Your anger when you confronted Dougier...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Secaille: The guards from the Fortress of Meropide have already taken control of this area. You're safe now.
Eclancher: *whimpers*

### Additional Talk 2

Wriothesley: All this time, he's been treating them like animals.

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: This seems to be something like a console...
Wriothesley: This is a surveillance terminal. The information collected by the surveillance ports we found previously will be sent here.
Wriothesley: I'm sure Dougier really enjoyed sitting here and making his people dance like puppets on strings.
Paimon: Grrr... That makes Paimon even angrier!
