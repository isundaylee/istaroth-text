Traveler: Why is that?
Innam: A few days ago, a young man who'd not been here long asked Matari to change shifts, and happened upon a sea monster warning.
Innam: After the warning was withdrawn, the Inspector came to look into the situation at the harbor and questioned the young man. The poor lad could not answer.
Innam: The Inspector checked the roster again, and found out there was a shift change. Now she's been paying extra attention to this matter and no one dares to break her rules.
Innam: *sigh* I just want to finish work early and go to the bar for drinks.
