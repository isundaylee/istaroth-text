# Talk Dialog

Lisa: Ah, I'm much more suited to leisurely days like these...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Lisa: I'd love to, cutie. Hmm, too bad I can't offer you some tea.
Traveler: About Varka...
Lisa: I was quite surprised to learn that the Grand Master had written a private message just for me.
Lisa: And I was equally surprised to find out that Razor's been on his mind this whole time.
Lisa: Especially given how demanding he is of Jean... He left her to figure out the whole Weinlesefest on her own, and didn't give her a single word of acknowledgment.
Lisa: I'll have to have to a stern word with him on Jean's behalf when he returns.
Traveler: About Razor...
Lisa: It's funny â€” I always thought the Grand Master was the one who gave him the name "Razor"...
Lisa: But it turns out his birth parents chose it all along.
Lisa: ...
Lisa: Anyway, Razor told me he heard the voices of his parents during the festival.
Lisa: "Like stepping on a rock in the sun. Warm, but also heavy."
Lisa: I'm sure he must think of them as both kind and dauntless people...
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Lisa: Originally, I only planned on having a glass or two. I thought I deserved a treat after being such a good teacher recently.
Lisa: But that was before I came to appreciate how truly exceptional the festival-exclusive vintage was...
Lisa: Before I knew it, I was already rather tipsy, hehe...
Lisa: I'm a bad example. Don't be like me, cutie.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Lisa: Alright, but remember, it's important to rest when you're feeling tired. It makes my heart ache to see you so busy all the time.
