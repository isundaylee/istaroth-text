## Talk

Raef: Not here yet, huh...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you waiting for?
Raef: To tell you the truth, I'm not sure either.
Raef: It might be those who left the village to buy some daily essentials, and it might also be the goods that our Eremite friends are sending over.
Raef: Who knows? We might even receive guests from Shamaniyya.
Raef: Alright, alright. In truth, my role is that of a lookout. I warn people of hazards that arise from the desert.
Raef: That said, though, the desert around Aaru Village is a place of relative quiet, so what I usually end up reporting is the arrival of goods from outside the village.
Raef: But thanks to that, I also get to hang out and chat with those who often travel outside, you know, maybe ask them to get me some seeds or a pot of flowers.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Raef: See you. Be wary of any changes in the environment when you are out in the desert!

## Talk

Traveler: Fond of planting flowers?
Raef: Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
Raef: She's never been the healthy sort, so she's always at home resting and can't come out often... But she always looks way better when she has some plants for company.
Raef: I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
Raef: Many times, those flowers that do get sent over don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
Raef: That's why I ask my fellow workers to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.

## Talk

Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: The night is much cooler than the day, which makes it all the more reason to take better care of your health. Besides, you should stay where there's more greenery...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: Look at you! You're so young, but already sound like my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very beautiful. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry for not taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!

## Talk

Traveler: Sha-what-yya?
Raef: Oh? Are you interested?
Raef: According to legend, they are a group of people who dwell in the depths of the desert.
Raef: Some say that they were not on good terms with the Akademiya, and thus fled deep into the desert to avoid them.
Raef: Others say that they are an investigation team sent into the desert by the Akademiya.
Raef: As for the details, I'm not very sure, but it's all hearsay. No one has ever seen them.
Raef: But between you and me, I do hope that this legend is in fact real. It would be nice to see them and hear their tales from far away someday, you know?

Traveler: Fond of planting flowers?
Raef: Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
Raef: She wasn't well previously and is still resting at home even now, so she rarely goes out. But she really does love flowers — she looks much better whenever she is around them.
Raef: I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
Raef: Many times, those flowers that do get sent over to me don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
Raef: That's why I ask my colleagues to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.

## Talk

Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: But isn't the difference in temperatures between night and day precisely the reason you need to take care of yourself? You've only just recovered... You should spend a bit more time resting...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: And well, look at you! You're still a young man, but you already sound as old as my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very lovely. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry, I haven't been taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!

## Talk

Raef: Agh, there's just no time at all...
Raef: And no one will swap shifts with me, either. What do I do now...
Raef: Eh? Traveler? Um... Traveler, please hold on a moment!
Traveler: What's going on?
Raef: I'm sorry for taking up your time, but I'd like to ask you if you're free... and if you could do me a favor...
Traveler: Well, let's hear your story, then...
Raef: You'd help me! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Raef: Here's the situation: I ordered a flower pot from Azalai's shop, alongside a batch of seeds.
Raef: Originally, I had asked a friend to help me get them...
Raef: But he suddenly told me that he had a mission to attend to and wouldn't have time to help me out. There was too little time for me to find someone else...
Raef: So Traveler, could you please help me collect my purchases from Azalai's? I hear that he should be at the entrance to the village right now, waiting for goods to come in.
Traveler: What did you buy all this stuff for, anyway?
Raef: They're for my girlfriend, Nermin.
Raef: She's in poor health, so she's been convalescing at home.
Raef: I mean, you've seen it too. Aaru Village is in the middle of the desert, so there's not much greenery to go around. Can't say this is the best environment, can you?
Raef: So I bought some plants to place in her house, but always staying in her room has kept her in a bad mood.
Raef: I'm also very busy at work, so I basically can't go to see her in the day. We only have time to talk to each other at night...
Raef: That's why I thought that perhaps I could get her to raise some flowers herself, if only just to help pass the time and take her mind off her illness.
Raef: I didn't expect things to get complicated like this...
Traveler: I'll go on your behalf.
Raef: Thank you so much! Just bring them straight back to me once you get them.
Raef: I need to sow those seeds, loosen the soil, apply some fertilizer...
Raef: But Nermin's constitution isn't that great. Will all this work just tire her out...?
Traveler: I'll get you your things.
Traveler: If you've got the pay, I've got the time.
Raef: Eh? Well... I do have some savings, so you don't have to worry about that...
Raef: But either way, thank you so much for agreeing to help.
