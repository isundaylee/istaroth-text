# The Warm Rhythm of the Streets


## Talk 1

Paimon: ...Paimon's starting to understand how you got so many things.
Nilou: Y—Yeah... Everyone has their own way with words, and it's really hard to say no...
Nilou: Let's go to the next store.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, the atmosphere here is so nice...
Paimon: Let's take a break, and immerse ourselves in this warmth!

## Talk 3

Afshin: Nilou, good timing! I have the textiles you ordered.
Afshin: If you took any longer, the Sumpter Beasts might've gobbled them up.
Nilou: You and your jokes! Sumpter Beasts won't eat those kinds of things, Mr. Afshin.
Paimon: Jut said that some Sumpter Beasts ate his spices. Were they yours?
Afshin: Oh, uh, haha... Yeah, really sorry about that. Nilou, if it weren't for you, I would've lost half of my profits that month.
Nilou: Trying to pull anything out of a Sumpter Beast's mouth is like playing a game of tug-of-war...
Paimon: So they really do eat anything, huh.
Traveler: At least they work after eating.
Paimon: Eh? What's that supposed to mean!
Afshin: Hahaha, come now. You know, Sumpter Beasts sometimes eat not because they're hungry, but because they like gnawing on things.
Afshin: The textiles you ordered are highly durable and woven from the finest thread.
Afshin: So, even if a Sumpter Beast got snacky, it'd still have to chomp on it for a full day.
Paimon: ...You've tested this before?
Afshin: But of course! How else could I be so trustworthy? ...Well, that one time was an accident.
Afshin: I wouldn't dare experiment with such a precious product.
Paimon: True, it does sound like some good fabric...
Afshin: Oho, have I piqued your interest? If you want to buy some, now's a good time: Buy two bolts and get 20% off!
Paimon: #Ooh, that's a pretty good discount. What do you think, Traveler?
Nilou: No thanks, Mr. Afshin. You can't use that kind of tactic on her. Look, you've already sucked her in.
Paimon: Uh... Tactic? So you mean, everything he just said to Paimon was a lie?
Nilou: Ah, I wouldn't go that far... It's just that Mr. Afshin is really good at spinning stories. A word from him, and you'll find yourself buying things you don't actually need.
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr gave me a huge lecture the last time I bought too many things...
Traveler: Vendors shouldn't use manipulative tactics.
Afshin: C'mon, don't look at me like that... All she got was a talking-to from Zubayr, while I was nearly fed head-first to the Sumpter Beasts.
Afshin: My philosophy is that stories give value to merchandise. That's why my business started with such a boom.
Afshin: Our Nilou here is an extraordinarily good listener. Back then, she believed anything I said.
Afshin: After a while, I began to feel guilty selling things to her because of how happy she looked... Though she enjoyed the stories and I the Mora, I knew she didn't need to buy that much...
Afshin: Anyway, since then, I've come to realize two things: One, that stories should just be a means instead of an end, and two, that there's more to business than just selling goods.
Nilou: It's okay, we're all friends now. There's no need to dig up the past.
Afshin: Hmm, that reminds me... Some of the goods from my latest shipment aren't in the best condition.
Afshin: They're fine for general use, but my customers have high standards, and I don't have the time or resources to find new buyers right now.
Afshin: Nilou, why don't you take them?
Nilou: Huh? No no no no, I can't do that...
Afshin: Just think of it as a favor for me, alright? The theater can use them for props and whatnot.
Afshin: It costs me Mora to store or ship, so I'm just losing money every day continuing to hold on to them.
Nilou: Even so, let me buy them at market value.
Afshin: Nah, these goods are hard movers. Besides, if I let you pay, wouldn't it mean that I'm just using stories to sell my goods again?
Afshin: Just take them. If you really feel that bad about it, give me some theater tickets later.
Afshin: Oh yeah, you should also take some while you're at it. Adventurers are always in need of materials, right?
Paimon: Wow, even we get a share of this...?
Afshin: Hurry and take it. Just looking at it all is giving me a headache. Haha, thanks for the huge favor.
Traveler: The one thing that Paimon has in common with Sumpter Beasts.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Look, Nilou's back!
Paimon: Let's meet up with her. The event's probably about to start!

## Talk 5

Afshin: Thanks for the huge favor. *sigh* The most important thing about doing business is efficiently circulating merchandise...

## Talk 6

Hushang: About time, Nilou! Farhad here was snooping around your props!
Farhad: Please, I was only looking at them to get a better idea of what your new show may be about.
Hushang: Wouldn't spoiling yourself just ruin all the fun?
Nilou: Yeah, please wait for our official performance!
Hushang: Hmm, these two look familiar. I think I've seen them before...
Hushang: Weren't they at the Sabzeruz Festival?
Nilou: Yeah, and they're coming to today's celebration, too.
Hushang: The more folks the merrier! I was actually just talking to Farhad about also stopping by tonight.
Nilou: Oh yes, please do! I'm sure Ms. Rekhar and Miss Najia would also love to have a chat with the two of you.
Hushang: We even prepared a small gift — let me show it to you. Ta-da, it's a flower wreath!
Hushang: I really think we should wear some of these to give the event a more celebratory feel.
Nilou: Wow, it's beautiful! Did you make it?
Hushang: Farhad did most of the work. What a surprise, eh? He actually knows a lot about crafts.
Paimon: That is pretty surprising...
Farhad: Hey, why can't I have a little side hobby? I worked really hard on that!
Hushang: I know, I know, I watched you make it. I wasn't making fun of you.
Hushang: Alright, why don't you also try some on? We've got some wreaths in your size.
Nilou: It fits perfectly.
Paimon: They're so pretty! Is there one that Paimon can wear?
Farhad: Unfortunately, we already gave out all the child-sized ones. I wasn't expecting the theater to invite such a fascinating guest.
Paimon: "Fascinating"...? That sounds kinda weird, but Paimon will let it slide.
Farhad: Oh, you all sure got a lot of stuff there. Let me help you carry some.
Farhad: I'm a porter by trade, so this is what I'm best at.
Paimon: That'd be great! Please and thank you!
Traveler: Weren't you going to help out?
Paimon: But we have a pro now...
Nilou: Thanks for the help, Mr. Farhad, but let me make one thing clear first: Don't try to ask about what's in the new show.
Nilou: Otherwise, I may not be able to hold back Mr. Zubayr this time.
Hushang: Hahaha, you're so obvious that even Nilou saw right through you!
Farhad: Shut it!
Farhad: Fine! It's not like I want to get on his bad side, either.
Farhad: Including Hushang's things, though, we'll each need to carry a box if we want to move everything in one trip. Even my strength has its limits.
Nilou: Paimon looks like she doesn't want to, so I'll carry a little extra. Hehe, although I may not appear super strong at first glance, I actually do a lot of strength training on the regular.
Nilou: Strength and balance are both really important for a dancer!
Paimon: No, no, let Paimon! Paimon will help carry things!
Paimon: The Traveler's right. Paimon shouldn't freeload...
Traveler: After all the free food and materials...

## Talk 7

Hushang: I still have some stuff to sort through. Catch you later.

## Talk 8

Farhad: Phew, that sure was a lot of stuff. Looking forward to the event later!
Nilou: Thank you, Mr. Farhad.
Paimon: Thank you, Sumpter Man...
Traveler: Thank you, Paimon.
Paimon: Phew... Paimon's definitely going to eat it all back later!
Farhad: Alright, I'll leave you all to it.
Nilou: See ya.
Nilou: Good thing we had Mr. Farhad with us, or else that would've taken way longer.
Traveler: The atmosphere here is so nice...
Nilou: Of course, because everyone's working here together.
Nilou: We're all like neighbors, so we're always helping each other out. It's easy to forget that everyone's running a business.
Paimon: With this many freebies being thrown at you, you probably don't need to work...
Nilou: Hehe, I felt so guilty at first, like I always owed someone something. I was always thinking of ways to repay others.
Nilou: Later on, I realized that it's actually like what Mr. Afshin said — by taking the freebies, I was helping everyone out and saving them money.
Nilou: When you order the wrong item or make too much of something, sometimes the best way to maximize the value of those goods is to give them away.
Nilou: That's why there's no need to stress over the freebies. All of us repay others by helping them when they need it.
Paimon: Oh, that actually makes a lot of sense!
Nilou: This has become our norm, and no one keeps track of the back and forth anymore.
Nilou: So really, don't worry about it.
Nilou: Alright, I have to bring all of this to Mr. Zubayr and do a little bit of prep.
Nilou: Feel free to hang out here for a bit. It'd be nice if you could also get to know some other people at the theater!
Traveler: You sure you don't need any help?
Nilou: Nope. Mr. Zubayr's really on top of everything.
Nilou: You two are our guests, so please just relax and look forward to the celebration.
Traveler: Is everyone always this friendly?

## Talk 9

Rekhar: Hey there. I saw you two helping Nilou move some stuff.
Rekhar: Are you two also here for the celebration event?
Paimon: You got it!
Rekhar: My name is Rekhar. Najia and I are this theater's prop engineers. I also help out with some other tasks, like housekeeping.
Rekhar: The little ones causing a ruckus are my children, Sohrin and Abhi. I hope they aren't bothering you.
Rekhar: They always get really excited every time we hold a celebration event.
Traveler: They're adorable.
Rekhar: Yes, they are. Everyone here takes great care of them.
Rekhar: There's good work here, the pay's always on time, and Nilou and the others will often volunteer to play with the kids...
Rekhar: I'm quite content with this current way of life.
Paimon: Um, do you mean your life wasn't nearly as good before?
Traveler: Paimon...
Rekhar: It's alright, it's all water under the bridge now.
Rekhar: My husband and I were both adventurers, but he passed away from an accident.
Rekhar: Material struggles can always be overcome, but ever since then, I haven't been able to spend much of my energy on anything else...
Rekhar: But I still consider myself lucky. Mr. Zubayr has helped me a lot, and the atmosphere here is tolerant and kind.
Paimon: Sorry for bringing up such sad memories...
Rekhar: Oh, it's alright, I don't mind.
Rekhar: Once the event starts, you'll be able to see for yourself the kind of atmosphere I was talking about.
Traveler: They're so lively.

## Talk 10

Rekhar: There's still some time until the event. Feel free to look around.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey there!
Khasani: Hm... Ah, a newcomer.
Khasani: Doesn't look too bright.
Paimon: Hey! Talk about judging a book by its cover!
Khasani: You, on the other hand... Hmm, you're a special one.
Khasani: How would you describe the concept of "art"?
Traveler: "Art"?
Khasani: Mere curiosity, is all. It makes no difference whether you answer or not.
Traveler: It is a tangible manifestation of human sentiments?
Khasani: So that's what you think, huh...
Khasani: Unremarkable. Better than an average person's thoughts, but nothing exceptional.
Khasani: Is art a product that we create and bring forth, or is it a naturally existing resource?
Khasani: I, for one, believe it to be the latter.
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon doesn't follow...
Khasani: I've been staying here for a long time. On occasion, I'd assist them in penning lines of dialogue, but most of my time, I just stand back and watch.
Khasani: I prefer to abstain from writing, as it spoils the viewing experience.
Khasani: The existence of the theater, of Nilou, and of humanity itself... All of these can be considered as forms of art. It is not some intangible construct beyond the horizon.
Paimon: How does that have anything to do with us?
Khasani: Let me ask you this: What do you think is the meaning of art?
Traveler: I dunno.
Khasani: Haha, I suppose that question was a little too difficult for you.
Khasani: To chance upon a spark of inspiration, I have been closely observing you, the players on the stage, and those watching in the audience.
Khasani: Art is already all around us.
Traveler: To serve as an answer to your questions?
Traveler: It is an expression of our aesthetic ideals?
Traveler: Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

## Talk 12

Khasani: Unparalleled splendor without peer...
Khasani: Maybe even worthy of being considered one of Sumeru's greatest treasures.

## Talk 13

Paimon: *pant* *pant*
Paimon: Paimon can't fly anymore...!
Nilou: Are you okay, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon's good to keep going! But Paimon now understands when people say there's no such thing as a free lunch!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Hello!
Inayah: Wh—Wha!?
Inayah: Who are you? You can't just go on the stage as you please.
Traveler: Relax.
Inayah: Ah, I see... Sorry for my overreaction.
Inayah: I'm just, uh... making a prop. No time for chit-chat.
Paimon: Is that embroidery?
Inayah: No... Well, yes, but not really. It's a prop.
Inayah: It's just, uhh, some fabric. An ordinary piece of fabric that will be used in a show.
Inayah: Sorry, I really do need to focus and start working on it.
Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Paimon: What an oddball. Is prop-making something to be that jumpy about?
Paimon: Oh well, it's none of our business.
Traveler: We won't disturb you, then.
Traveler: We're here with Nilou.

### Additional Talk 2

Inayah: Sorry, I need to focus.

### Additional Talk 3

Sohrin: I just saw Miss Nilou come back with Tahchin! There's gonna be Tahchin!
Abhi: Are you sure?
Sohrin: Duh! And even if I didn't see it, I smelled it! It's gotta be Tahchin!

### Additional Talk 4

Najia: Prop check complete. All that's left is to discuss some dates with Rekhar...
Najia: Oh yeah, Farhad is coming... Maybe I should hide the key props...

### Additional Talk 5

Kourosh: It's finally over! I'm saved!
Kourosh: Oh, sorry, I was just letting off some steam because I'm so relieved... Please don't tell Mr. Zubayr.

### Additional Talk 6

Nilou: Sorry for the wait! Preparations for the celebration are finally done.
Nilou: I'll call everyone over, and then we can start.
Paimon: Let us give you a hand!
Nilou: Hee-hee, thank you.
Black Screen Text: Everyone gathers together, and the event finally starts. Participants prepare to exchange their presents.
Paimon: Maybe we really should have prepared a gift. Then we could also be a part of the exchange!
Paimon: As it is, all we can do is wait and watch...
Inayah: Umm... Maybe we shouldn't do this after all?
Inayah: I didn't do that great of a job, and who would even like it?
Nilou: Don't think like that! Remember our promise? We're going to give everyone a pleasant surprise.
Nilou: And besides, you've never attended a celebration event before, so this will be a great opportunity. Everyone will love you!
Inayah: I'm still... not really sure about this...
Nilou: There's nothing to be worried about! Just take a step forward, and give yourself a chance.
Nilou: There aren't any scary people here, right?
Inayah: Right...
Nilou: Hmm, alright, maybe this will help.
Nilou: Everyone, over here! Inayah has something great to tell you all!
Inayah: W—Wait, wait!
Inayah: I've already said that I'm not ready yet... Agh, what should I say...
Nilou: Take it easy and relax. Deep breath, in and out. Once you've taken a long exhale, calmly tell everyone what you want to say.
Nilou: If you don't say anything, then all the hard work we've put into embroidery practice would have gone to waste.
Inayah: Using it as a gift, though? It really isn't that good...
Paimon: So when Inayah was talking about making a prop, she was actually preparing a present.
Traveler: She looks really nervous.
Paimon: Yeah, it feels like she still doesn't really see herself as part of this community.
Paimon: But it looks like Nilou's trying to ease her through.
Nilou: Actually, Inayah had prepared a special present for everyone before this celebration kicked off.
Sohrin: Woohoo!
Abhi: We're gonna get our first present from Miss Inayah!
Sheikh Zubayr: Pipe down. The louder you all are, the more nervous she'll become.
Sheikh Zubayr: You've worked on it for so long, so have some confidence. Don't be afraid.
Paimon: You've got this!
Inayah: ...
Sharif: Is Mr. Zubayr here?
Sharif: Sheikh Zubayr, this is an urgent notice from the Akademiya. This celebration — or whatever it is — must stop at once.
Paimon: What a condescending guy... What's his deal?
Black Screen Text: Everyone follows Sheikh Zubayr to the space below the theater.
Sharif: Since Zubayr Theater has long violated the Akademiya's policies and orders, we have decided to demolish it.
Sharif: As its manager, you must halt all operations and dismiss all staff members within thirty days, after which you will report to the Akademiya for further punishment.
Nilou: Why...? Why force us to do this all of a sudden?
Sharif: Little girl, this is not the first time you've been issued a warning.
Sheikh Zubayr: I didn't hear anything about demolition the last time I asked, and now I suddenly only have thirty days?
Sheikh Zubayr: We have more shows planned, but it's impossible to do anything in just thirty days. How am I supposed to explain this to my customers and staff?
Sharif: That issue is of no concern to me, Mr. Zubayr.
Sharif: You seem to understand the situation quite clearly. Perhaps you can reflect on the reasons why you have failed to prepare for the scenario in advance.
Paimon: ...Demolition? Why do they wanna demolish this place?
Nilou: The Akademiya has never liked us, and they've never respected our work. To them, what we do is all a waste of time.
Nilou: This isn't the first time they've come by. They had asked us several times in the past to improve the quality of our performances by only putting on shows they consider to be sufficiently intellectual.
Nilou: But our audience isn't the Akademiya — it's the people of the Grand Bazaar.
Nilou: If our shows are too difficult to understand or too removed from everyday life, nobody would watch them anymore...
Nilou: Changing our content would not only mean turning our backs on our vision, it would also directly lead to the loss of our livelihoods.
Traveler: If the theater actually gets demolished...
Nilou: Yeah... The theater is very important to each and every one of us.
Paimon: The way they're doing things is so scummy!
Nilou: But... I also don't know how we can stop them.
Sharif: I do not wish to explain everything again from the beginning. Time is of the essence, so you should act with haste instead of asking frivolous questions.
Sheikh Zubayr: But none of us plan to accept this. Such an abrupt notice is contrary to established policy.
Sharif: Ask whomever you will — the answer will remain the same. We have already given you sufficient notice.
Inayah: Enough.
Inayah: Does your audacity know no limits, Father!?
Paimon: Huh? Father? They're family!?
Inayah: What Akademiya? This is all because you don't like Zubayr Theater. You're just using the Akademiya's name to threaten us!
Inayah: Let me tell you: Even if you manage to tear down this place, nothing is going to change.
Inayah: You've always been awful, but even I never thought my father would sink this low!
Sharif: This is strictly business. It has nothing to do with where you are, what you do...
Sharif: ...Or what you think.
Sharif: I hope you all have not been irrevocably blinded by folly. I will not waste more time on pointless arguments.
Sharif: Wrap everything up and make preparations to shut down at once.
Inayah: ...
Inayah: Why is he always like that!?
Sheikh Zubayr: This is quite the misfortune, but there's nothing we can do.
Sheikh Zubayr: That's it for today, everyone. Let's clean up.
Sheikh Zubayr: I'll go talk to them again tomorrow. *sigh* The storms that come out of the blue are always the hardest to deal with.
Traveler: Many people would become displaced.
Traveler: She's not very good at expressing herself.

### Additional Talk 7

Sheikh Zubayr: Hmph, they get more and more unreasonable with each passing day.
Sheikh Zubayr: I have to think of something...

### Additional Talk 8

Sohrin: Is this place gonna get torn down?
Abhi: Nooo, I don't want that to happen...
Rekhar: Shh, don't cry... That man was just trying to scare us.

### Additional Talk 9

Kourosh: Why couldn't he just have a good faith discussion with us? There's always room for compromise.
Najia: Well, if there really was, then we wouldn't be in this predicament.

### Additional Talk 10

Khasani: The carefree warmth of summer will always give way to the bleak futility of winter.
Khasani: Man is even more fickle than the seasons.

### Additional Talk 11

Inayah: Sorry, my father is always like that.
Inayah: Ugh...

### Additional Talk 12

Nilou: Sorry, I invited you thinking this was going to be a happy occasion. I didn't know that things would turn out like this...
Paimon: There's no need to apologize, Nilou! No one could've seen this coming. *sigh* Paimon just wishes she could've at least gotten to the food...
Paimon: Is what that guy said true? The Akademiya has already given you many warnings?
Nilou: Yeah, I guess you could say that. They've always seen us as being meaningless.
Nilou: Knowledge is king in Sumeru, and their pursuit of it leaves no room for the arts.
Nilou: But if that's all it is, there's also no reason to go so far as to demolish the theater.
Traveler: So it really has something to do with Inayah.
Nilou: After Inayah ran away from home, I brought her here, to Zubayr Theater.
Nilou: She rarely talks about her family. All I know is that she didn't get along with them.
Nilou: I never expected it to blow up like this...
Paimon: If you did nothing wrong, then there's no reason to listen to the Akademiya, right?

### Additional Talk 13

Paimon: Who cares, let's just take them in a fight!
Traveler: That won't solve the underlying problem.
Paimon: That's true...
Nilou: I'll try to think of something. We can't just let everyone suffer in a perpetual state of fear and uncertainty.
Nilou: What to do, what to do...
Paimon: Can you pretend to shut down, but secretly continue to hold your shows somewhere else?
Paimon: Or we could go through a list of customers, and try to see if anyone in there might be willing to help out... Ugh, that also doesn't sound like it'll work.
Traveler: I think a scholar once told me that...
Nilou: A debate? Hmm... Well, scholars do love to use them to solve their problems, but... how would that work in this case?
Traveler: We just need to prove...
Paimon: Oh, if we can prove to Inayah's father that the Akademiya's position doesn't hold water, then they won't have a reason to demolish the theater!
Nilou: I see. Defeating him in a debate...
Nilou: It's a good idea, but which one of us could hope to win against a researcher...?
Nilou: Huh? Me?
Nilou: Nonono, I'm the literal worst at arguments.
Nilou: I can't debate...
Traveler: Debates aren't arguments.
Paimon: Nilou, you are only so stressed out right now because you care so much about protecting the theater!
Nilou: I...
Nilou: This theater holds a special meaning in all of our hearts — it's irreplaceable.
Nilou: But I just don't know... Can I really take on such a huge responsibility?
Traveler: You'll be fine as long as you prepare.
Paimon: Paimon will help, too! You'll feel a lot more confident after doing some prep work. Believe in yourself!
Nilou: Thanks, you two.
Nilou: Alright, I've decided!
Nilou: Even though I may fail, I'll do my very best for everyone's sake!
Paimon: That's our Nilou! We're rooting for you!
Nilou: Okay, let's head back and tell everyone what we came up with.
Traveler: I'll do my best to help.
Traveler: You debate to prove that you are right.
Traveler: That the theater's existence has value.
Traveler: Differences can be settled through a debate.
Traveler: We won't always be here.

### Additional Talk 14

Farhad: This just came out of nowhere. What'll happen next?
Hushang: Beats me. Everyone else must also be at a loss.

### Additional Talk 15

Noticeboard (Zubayr Theater Billboard): Due to special circumstances, all theatrical performances have been cancelled and the resumption time has yet to be determined. Sorry about the inconvenience.

### Additional Talk 16

Hushang: About time, Nilou! Farhad here was snooping around your props!
Farhad: Please, I was only looking at them to get a better idea of what your new show may be about.

Inayah: W—Wait, wait!
Inayah: I've already said that I'm not ready yet... Agh, what should I say...
Nilou: Take it easy and relax. Deep breath, in and out. Once you've taken a long exhale, calmly tell everyone what you want to say.
Nilou: If you don't say anything, then all the hard work we've put into embroidery practice would have gone to waste.
Inayah: Using it as a gift, though? It really isn't that good...
Paimon: So when Inayah was talking about making a prop, she was actually preparing a present.
Traveler: She looks really nervous.
Paimon: Yeah, it feels like she still doesn't really see herself as part of this community.
Paimon: But it looks like Nilou's trying to ease her through.
Nilou: Actually, Inayah had prepared a special present for everyone before this celebration kicked off.
Sohrin: Woohoo!
Abhi: We're gonna get our first present from Miss Inayah!
Sheikh Zubayr: Pipe down. The louder you all are, the more nervous she'll become.
Sheikh Zubayr: You've worked on it for so long, so have some confidence. Don't be afraid.
Paimon: You've got this!
Inayah: ...
Sharif: Is Mr. Zubayr here?
Sharif: Sheikh Zubayr, this is an urgent notice from the Akademiya. This celebration — or whatever it is — must stop at once.
Paimon: What a condescending guy... What's his deal?
Black Screen Text: Everyone follows Sheikh Zubayr to the space below the theater.
Sharif: Since Zubayr Theater has long violated the Akademiya's policies and orders, we have decided to demolish it.
Sharif: As its manager, you must halt all operations and dismiss all staff members within thirty days, after which you will report to the Akademiya for further punishment.
Nilou: Why...? Why force us to do this all of a sudden?
Sharif: Little girl, this is not the first time you've been issued a warning.
Sheikh Zubayr: I didn't hear anything about demolition the last time I asked, and now I suddenly only have thirty days?
Sheikh Zubayr: We have more shows planned, but it's impossible to do anything in just thirty days. How am I supposed to explain this to my customers and staff?
Sharif: That issue is of no concern to me, Mr. Zubayr.
Sharif: You seem to understand the situation quite clearly. Perhaps you can reflect on the reasons why you have failed to prepare for the scenario in advance.
Paimon: ...Demolition? Why do they wanna demolish this place?
Nilou: The Akademiya has never liked us, and they've never respected our work. To them, what we do is all a waste of time.
Nilou: This isn't the first time they've come by. They had asked us several times in the past to improve the quality of our performances by only putting on shows they consider to be sufficiently intellectual.
Nilou: But our audience isn't the Akademiya — it's the people of the Grand Bazaar.
Nilou: If our shows are too difficult to understand or too removed from everyday life, nobody would watch them anymore...
Nilou: Changing our content would not only mean turning our backs on our vision, it would also directly lead to the loss of our livelihoods.
Traveler: If the theater actually gets demolished...
Nilou: Yeah... The theater is very important to each and every one of us.
Paimon: The way they're doing things is so scummy!
Nilou: But... I also don't know how we can stop them.
Sharif: I do not wish to explain everything again from the beginning. Time is of the essence, so you should act with haste instead of asking frivolous questions.
Sheikh Zubayr: But none of us plan to accept this. Such an abrupt notice is contrary to established policy.
Sharif: Ask whomever you will — the answer will remain the same. We have already given you sufficient notice.
Inayah: Enough.
Inayah: Does your audacity know no limits, Father!?
Paimon: Huh? Father? They're family!?
Inayah: What Akademiya? This is all because you don't like Zubayr Theater. You're just using the Akademiya's name to threaten us!
Inayah: Let me tell you: Even if you manage to tear down this place, nothing is going to change.
Inayah: You've always been awful, but even I never thought my father would sink this low!
Sharif: This is strictly business. It has nothing to do with where you are, what you do...
Sharif: ...Or what you think.
Sharif: I hope you all have not been irrevocably blinded by folly. I will not waste more time on pointless arguments.
Sharif: Wrap everything up and make preparations to shut down at once.
Inayah: ...
Inayah: Why is he always like that!?
Sheikh Zubayr: This is quite the misfortune, but there's nothing we can do.
Sheikh Zubayr: That's it for today, everyone. Let's clean up.
Sheikh Zubayr: I'll go talk to them again tomorrow. *sigh* The storms that come out of the blue are always the hardest to deal with.
Traveler: Many people would become displaced.
Traveler: She's not very good at expressing herself.

### Additional Talk 18

Traveler: Did you run into any trouble after your dance?
Nilou: You mean when I danced at the square right in front of the Akademiya? Hehe, not a single person came after me. I left really easily.
Nilou: After that, no one came to the theater to scold me, either. We actually gained many new customers... And, they were all Akademiya students.
Nilou: From what I can tell, in the past, if a student were to put off their studies to watch a show or dance, they'd be called foolish and irresponsible.
Nilou: But now, it seems like this attitude is changing. People are starting to believe that engaging with the arts can help them balance their moods, and through that, improve their research efficiency at work.
Nilou: Anyway, it seems like people have to personally experience something to gain a good understanding of it.
Paimon: They should thank us for opening their eyes!
Traveler: Hopefully, they'll appreciate the arts more.
Nilou: That'll probably take some time... They're still droning on and on about "experimentation" and "proof." Will they really gain more appreciation for the arts if they continue to think of everything like that?
Nilou: Hehe, anyway, all that aside, are you thinking about coming to our event?
Paimon: Paimon thinks it'll be a great time... What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Nilou: Alright, then let's head to the theater...
Nilou: —Wait, I completely forgot about this pile of stuff!
Paimon: Whoa! Did you buy all of this, Nilou!?
Nilou: Just one box. The rest were given to me. I really don't know how it came to this much...
Paimon: That's way too many freebies! Many vendors give out samples for free, but Paimon's never seen this much...
Nilou: All I know is that whenever I start chatting with people, my hands would get more and more full until I can't hold everything anymore. This seems to happen every time...
Nilou: I was planning on making a few trips to bring everything back, before continuing on with my shopping... but I don't think I'll have the time.
Paimon: So this isn't even all of it!?
Traveler: Let me help you.
Nilou: A—Are you sure?
Paimon: #Of course! Carrying stuff is a piece of cake for him. Right, Traveler?
Nilou: Ahh, I'm so sorry to trouble you like this... I meant to invite you to our celebration, but now, you're helping me instead...
Nilou: Well, let's hurry up and grab the last few things, so we can get back to the theater.
Traveler: Sure, we have some time right now anyway.

### Additional Talk 19

Traveler: I can ask Nahida to lend a hand.
Nilou: Nahida... Ah!? You mean, Lesser Lord Kusanali!?
Paimon: She'd probably help if she knew what was going on. No matter how nasty the Akademiya could get, surely they can't win against Lesser Lord Kusanali!
Nilou: Nononono, I wasn't doubting her ability... I just feel like we shouldn't bother her with such a trivial problem.
Nilou: Plus, if the Dendro Archon were to intervene... Then, it wouldn't feel like our victory was earned.
Paimon: That's true...
Paimon: Who cares, let's just take them in a fight!
Traveler: That won't solve the underlying problem.
Paimon: That's true...
Nilou: I'll try to think of something. We can't just let everyone suffer in a perpetual state of fear and uncertainty.
Nilou: What to do, what to do...
Paimon: Can you pretend to shut down, but secretly continue to hold your shows somewhere else?
Paimon: Or we could go through a list of customers, and try to see if anyone in there might be willing to help out... Ugh, that also doesn't sound like it'll work.
Traveler: I think a scholar once told me that...
Nilou: A debate? Hmm... Well, scholars do love to use them to solve their problems, but... how would that work in this case?
Traveler: We just need to prove...
Paimon: Oh, if we can prove to Inayah's father that the Akademiya's position doesn't hold water, then they won't have a reason to demolish the theater!
Nilou: I see. Defeating him in a debate...
Nilou: It's a good idea, but which one of us could hope to win against a researcher...?
Nilou: Huh? Me?
Nilou: Nonono, I'm the literal worst at arguments.
Nilou: I can't debate...
Traveler: Debates aren't arguments.
Paimon: Nilou, you are only so stressed out right now because you care so much about protecting the theater!
Nilou: I...
Nilou: This theater holds a special meaning in all of our hearts — it's irreplaceable.
Nilou: But I just don't know... Can I really take on such a huge responsibility?
Traveler: You'll be fine as long as you prepare.
Paimon: Paimon will help, too! You'll feel a lot more confident after doing some prep work. Believe in yourself!
Nilou: Thanks, you two.
Nilou: Alright, I've decided!
Nilou: Even though I may fail, I'll do my very best for everyone's sake!
Paimon: That's our Nilou! We're rooting for you!
Nilou: Okay, let's head back and tell everyone what we came up with.
Traveler: I'll do my best to help.
Traveler: You debate to prove that you are right.
Traveler: That the theater's existence has value.
Traveler: Differences can be settled through a debate.
Traveler: We won't always be here.
