Traveler: Is it your eyes?
Kuhimana: It's not exactly a problem with my eyesight. I'm just bad at remembering people's faces.
Kuhimana: Sometimes, I meet people who I've met many times before, even chatted with, yet I still can't remember their faces...
Kuhimana: I find it even harder when they're wearing different clothes or accessories.
Kuhimana: But then when it comes to animals, I'm sensitive enough to always tell them apart.
Kuhimana: Hehe, I've done a lot of sketches of them, and I've given each one a special label of their own!
