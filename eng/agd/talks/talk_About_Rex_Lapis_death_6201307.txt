Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Bolai: Ah, to think that the rumors of his passing would turn out to be true...
Bolai: Traveler. I hear that you came here from Mondstadt... In that case, I suppose you can feel the difference between our two nations now, yes?
Bolai: In Liyue, even bit players such as myself have received Rex Lapis' grace in some fashion or another.
Bolai: It was my honor to have been able to provide the Silk Flowers for his Rite of Parting.
Bolai: I am no Qixing, and I don't possess a Vision, so that was the only way I could've been of help there...
Bolai: *sigh* Let's not speak of it. I still have a business to run, and I can't run it with this frown on my face all the time, now can I?
