Traveler: A beautiful melody?
Loredan: Indeed! Just as my brothers and sisters have, organizing performances at the Opera Epiclese to endless plaudits and applause...
Loredan: That said, I'm not at their level. I must work harder, practice harder, to maintain the prestige of our family!
Loredan: That's why I've stayed in town, working for Master Giovanni on one hand, while honing my musical craft on the other.
Loredan: One day, people will surely say of me, "Ah, indeed, you are a descendent of the Vicentino family!"
