# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Lynette: ...
Traveler: ...Other than zoning out, I mean?
Lynette: ...If that isn't an option, then I can't really think of anything else to do.
Lynette: Would you like a cup of tea? I can go make one for you.
Traveler: You're the guest. Shouldn't I be the one making tea for you?
Lynette: It's no trouble. For me, making tea is a truly enjoyable activity.
Lynette: I make tea for everyone whenever Lyney receives a guest.
Lynette: Selecting the best tea leaves, testing the water temperature, and observing the steam as it rises from the water's surface... I very much enjoy the whole process. Only with absolute concentration can you brew the perfect cup of tea.
Traveler: Who would've thought the process is so complicated...
Lynette: ...Also, no one will drag me into a conversation when I'm busy making tea.
Lynette: And once the tea is ready, as long as you sit there holding the cup and maintain the appearance of sipping your tea in peace, nobody will try to talk to you.
Traveler: So the point is still to zone out, then.
Lynette: Hehe, I was kidding. Was that surprising? I can crack jokes every now and then, too. I just rarely see the need.
Lynette: But I really do enjoy brewing and drinking tea. I'm able to taste even the most subtle differences in flavor.
Lynette: Considering all the places you've visited, you must have tried many different flavors during your journey.
Lynette: You want to try one of my brews next time you're free? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
