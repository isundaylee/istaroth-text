# Garcia's Paean: The Echo of Someone


## Talk 1

Garcia: T—Traveler! You're just in time. I was just about to go back to work after this coffee break with Ms. Kaia. Allow me to introduce you...
Kaia: Ah, so you must be the Traveler Garcia's been talking about. It's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Kaia, a... um... well, I dance.
Traveler: Hello, Garcia mentioned you before, I believe.
Kaia: Hehe, is that so? I'm happy to hear that. I was beginning to think that he commits nothing but his machine and Lutong to memory.
Lutong: You can safely exclude me from this, Ma'am. I believe that this shall be to Mr. Garcia's liking, too.
Kaia: Now, that wouldn't do. Without you, Garcia would surely find himself penniless in the end.
Lutong: Forgive me, Ma'am, if I must disagree. I am certain that Mr. Garcia would save up for two cups of coffee, no matter what.
Garcia: Make that three cups!
Lutong: You display most astonishing empathy, Mr. Garcia.
Garcia: Well, b—back to business! Now, Traveler, I am still in need of the insignias that the Treasure Hoarders carry with them. Should you find any, do consider selling them to me.
Garcia: I have... earned some Mora recently. So you need not fret about your payment.

## Talk 2

Garcia: Did you get the insignias?

## Talk 3

Garcia: Hmm... These should suffice for my research.
Garcia: Here's your payment. Do accept it, if you would be so kind...
Garcia: Traveler, why are you giving me that look? You're making me nervous.
Garcia: Ahem! I am going back to work now. Yes, back to work...

## Talk 4

Garcia: Oh! These insignias look to be of high quality!
Garcia: Here's your payment. Do kindly accept this...
Garcia: Traveler, why are you giving me that look? You're making me nervous.
Garcia: Ahem! I am going back to work now. Yes, back to work...

### Additional Talk 1

Kaia: Hello? Um... What would you like to know?
Traveler: How did you get to know Mr. Garcia?
Kaia: Cutting straight to the chase, huh? As befits an adventurer, I suppose.
Kaia: I got to meet Garcia because... our troupe director hired him as an accountant.
Kaia: Haha, to be honest, I have never seen anyone quite so incompatible with our troupe.
Kaia: We were playing music, dancing, drinking, and singing, and there he was on the sidelines, doing his calculations in silence with Lutong.
Kaia: There was a time when I saw him in strange clothes that had some drawings on it.
Kaia: I was curious and asked about the drawing. He said that it was the blueprint of a machine.
Kaia: He said he drew on his outfit because he happened to have neither pen nor paper when he was telling someone about the machine.
Kaia: As such, he used coal to draw on his own outfit to demonstrate and explain the blueprint.
Kaia: Then we spent a lot of time talking about that outfit and his machine... And, of course, he did most of the talking, while I was the listener.
Kaia: Hehe, he really is a weirdo but... he is also quite the charmer.
