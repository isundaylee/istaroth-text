## Talk

Toda: Alas, O nation of Eternity...
Toda: ...Ah, hello. What can I do for you?

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Toda: My name is Toda. I am the liaison between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Toda: My daily work is to handle all the issues in the shrine, such as fund raising, allocating manpower, and such...
Toda: All trivial matters, I know. Still, it is my solemn honor to be working for the Kamisato Clan.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a little more about the Kamisato Clan.
Toda: Within the Kamisato Clan, the Commissioner Kamisato Ayato is in charge of all the Yashiro Commission's affairs. Miss Ayaka is in charge of everything in the mansion.
Toda: Inazuma's Tri-Commission have some really complicated relationships with each other. Although the Yashiro Commission is the least controversial among them, it is still very busy.
Toda: As such, Sir Kamisato doesn't really stay in the mansion too often. If you need something from the Kamisato Clan, it's better that you visit Miss Kamisato or Mr. Thoma.

## Talk

Traveler: You look very worried...
Toda: Ah, you noticed... I've heard from the shrine maidens that more and more people wish to abolish the Sakoku Decree.
Toda: If the Sakoku Decree cannot bring happiness to Inazuma, what kind of impact will it have on the other nations in Teyvat...
Toda: ...I don't really have a conclusion for now. But as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in the Almighty Shogun.
Toda: If it is the Shogun's decision, then it must be beneficial to Eternity...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Toda: Aye... see you!

## Talk

Traveler: You look very worried...
Toda: Well... I wouldn't call it "worry" exactly. With the Sakoku Decree's abolition, I'm sure that Inazuma will undergo some changes.
Toda: I can't be sure what effects this reopening will have on the other nations of Teyvat...
Toda: ...But though I can't say anything conclusively at the moment, as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in the Almighty Shogun.
Toda: If it is the Shogun's decision, then it must be meant to achieve Eternity somehow...
