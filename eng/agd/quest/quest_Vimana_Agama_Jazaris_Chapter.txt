# Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's so much bigger in here than Paimon thought!
Jazari: Of course it is! Wait, this is a moment for that famous phrase, is it not?
Jazari: "Behold. Thousands of years of ancient Khaenri'ah history lie before us!"
Jazari: Oops, got carried away there. This is a famous quote by Iskandar, a Vahu{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}mana sage. Wait. Haven't you read his biography?
Traveler: ...
Jazari: I've read about it countless times in books, but this is the first time I've seen it in person, and that's why I can't contain my excitement.
Paimon: Look at all these vines. It must have been a really long time since anyone last came here.
Jazari: According to the text named "The Review of Research on Issues Related to the Ruin Golem in Ancient Khaenri'ah," the last scholar who managed to get inside a Ruin Golem for systematic research was Pir Kavikavus.
Jazari: I'm sure you don't know this, but Pir Kavikavus was one of the greatest scholars in Kshahrewar's history. Kavikavus earned the rank of Herbad before hitting thirty — a genuine academic genius.
Jazari: With his achievements, he would have become a sage sooner or later. But he met with an accident during an expedition, and his research results were lost.
Jazari: Ever since then, Kshahrewar has gone downhill. If he had lived longer, perhaps I wouldn't be worrying about expenses day and night like this.
Jazari: By the way, it's my academic ambition to follow in Pir Kavikavus' footsteps.
Paimon: Well, forget your academic ambition for now. Our next step is to...
Traveler: Smash open the entrance.
Paimon: Uh-huh, then we need to activate this big guy first.
Jazari: Right. By activating the Ruin Golem, I can get valuable experimental data, which will then serve as the basis for a breakthrough in my research.
Jazari: One has to make some waves to outdo one's predecessors, after all.
Paimon: So let's get this thing working, then! There's got to be some mechanism here... You know, the kind of thing that lights up when pressed?
Jazari: Hmm... I do recall there being one. According to our records, once the Separation Valve in the steering cabin is turned on, the Ruin Golem will be activated.
Jazari: But as I told you before, all ruin machines are driven by the dark power of their cores. And the cores of the Ruin Golem have been sealed underground.
Jazari: Even if we got into the steering cabin, the conventional method will not work.
Jazari: In fact, we can't even start this lift right before us, so how will we get to the steering cabin at the top?
Paimon: Hmm, you're right... So what do we do now?
Traveler: Let's try hitting it.
Jazari: Wait! I do have the most authoritative research permit granted by the Akademiya, but that doesn't mean we can damage this machine as we please.
Jazari: As the saying goes, "when one door closes, another opens." And in any case, I'm positive that the people of Khaenri'ah surely took this scenario into consideration.
Jazari: The Akademiya's research shows that the early ruin machines also had a backup power system, perhaps because the techniques that allowed them to utilize this dark power were still in their infancy.
Traveler: Power system?
Jazari: Unlike the cores that supply almost unlimited energy, this power system comprises a series of small power relays.
Jazari: The power sources of these devices are energy blocks that store pure energy extracted from the Ley Lines.
Jazari: According to Vahu{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}mana researchers, this power system most likely had been in widespread use long before the first ruin machine was ever built in ancient Khaenri'ah.
Jazari: As I stated earlier, the Ruin Golem is an early model, so it must have one of those backup power systems.
Jazari: The core power cabin is at the bottom. Let's get down there first.
Traveler: Just tell me what to do next.
Jazari: Well, the core power cabin is at the bottom. Let's get down there first.
Traveler: You're implying that there's an unconventional route.
Traveler: Conduct academic research.
Paimon: Umm, did you forget that we're here to investigate the underground ruins? Academic research is important, sure, but we need to figure out how to get this big guy started first.
Traveler: Aren't you a Kshahrewar researcher?
Jazari: Well, knowledge is boundless. I do not intend to have my learning shackled.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow! It's starting up!
Jazari: What do you think? The machinery in the Ruin Golem, whether it's a relay or a trap door, can be powered by this Energy Block.
Paimon: But nothing seems to have changed at all...
Jazari: Well, because this backup system comprises a series of small power relays.
Jazari: In other words, we have to work all our way up from the bottom, and the system can only function when all the relays have been connected.
Traveler: All of them...
Jazari: Given the damage to the Ruin Golem, it will be quite difficult for it to run at full power.
Jazari: But just as you were activating this relay, I found this in the power room.
Jazari: It seems to be the blueprint for the Ruin Golem. Perhaps its maintenance crew left it here.
Jazari: According to this blueprint, we only need to connect several key relays to start this machine...
Jazari: At the very least, we'll be able to start this lift and go up to the steering cabin.
Paimon: That sounds questionable...
Jazari: Well, there's nothing else we can do, so we might as well try activating the lift first, yes?
Paimon: Wait, aren't you coming with us?
Jazari: I'll stay here and take pic— no, study the internal structure of the Ruin Golem. That's also important work.
Jazari: Besides, I'm a scholar. There's little I could do to assist you directly in your task. But if you have any technical problems, I'll be here for you.

## Talk 3

Jazari: Look at the ingenious machinery all around. What a masterpiece of human civilization!
Jazari: This is valuable information for research. I've gotta record all it down.

## Talk 4

Jazari: Back so soon? Well, I'm still studying the load-bearing structure of these components here. But it's impressive that you got the lift started!
Traveler: You were just guessing about the activation thing, weren't you?
Jazari: Well... Come on, I've only read about it in books.
Jazari: Just so you know, there are no more than three people in the entire Akademiya who can read this blueprint. So guessing it right does mean something!
Jazari: Anyway, now that the lift is working, we should be able to access the steering room above by activating the relays on the middle level.
Jazari: I see... The mid-level gear should be in the power room. We need to activate all four relay units.
Jazari: If we can't find an Energy Block that works, it is also possible to temporarily remove them from the device. It's fine as long as they're all connected in the end.
Jazari: I'll keep waiting for you here then.

## Talk 5

Jazari: Huh? What were you guys doing up there? I thought I heard a truly incredible racket while I was studying this inductive circuit.
Jazari: Well, whatever you're doing, please keep it down. If there's any trouble with the machine here, it'll be hard for me to explain it away in my report to the Akademiya.
Traveler: We met the pilot.
Jazari: Pilot? Are you joking?
Jazari: Even people of Khaenri'ah couldn't live for hundreds of years.
Jazari: Anyway, I assume you've got the relays in the middle connected, yes?
Jazari: I'm almost done here as well. Come. Let's go up to the steering cabin at the top.
Jazari: Just like before, we simply need to connect the power system to the steering cabin to activate the Ruin Golem's control systems.
Traveler: We met an old friend.
Jazari: Umm, are you and this child both... Alright, okay. You know what? I'll write two recommendation letters to the Akademiya. This way, the two of you can get along in future as well.
Paimon: Uh, that's not what's happening here at all!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Ugh... Besides this dark stone slate, nothing else here seems to be of value.
Jazari: Stone slate? Don't underestimate it. If we can get the control system running, then we can see the outside world through it.
Jazari: The control system here looks like it can still work. Ancient Khaenri'ah's creations really are amazing.
Jazari: I never thought I would have this chance in this lifetime. But now it seems that once I complete this research report, winning the Pir Kavikavus Prize is only a matter of time now...
Paimon: Then let's try and start this machine. Paimon can't wait!
Traveler: A capital notion.
Jazari: Now, now, we shouldn't rush anything. We need to follow the instructions!
Traveler: Yes, time's a-wastin'.

## Talk 7

Jazari: Let me see. According to these specifications, I should first press... Huh, which one is it...

## Talk 8

Jazari: And what did I say about following the instructions...?
Traveler: We didn't really get it to do anything...
Paimon: Its arm just, y'know, fell off! Paimon's pretty sure the machine itself is to blame!
Jazari: Fine, I'll record it as an experimental accident, then. Ugh... I do hope that this won't diminish my report in any way.
Jazari: Anyway, it seems like we won't be able to start the Ruin Golem again, so there's no point in me keeping you here.
Jazari: I know you're here to investigate the contamination of the underground ruins, but I'm afraid that the Ruin Golem won't be of much use to you now.
Jazari: Even so, you may see some unexpected progress as a result of what you did.
Jazari: Well, I shall not keep you any longer. I have my research to get done here, in any case.
Jazari: You can come and look for me once your work is done... if I haven't been disciplined for destroying the Ruin Golem yet.
Jazari: Once that happens, I can help you apply for the research project on the Chaos Cores.
Jazari: I'll be the one in charge of the project, of course. But don't worry, I'll give you half the funds.
Jazari: Anyone can embark on an academic career as long as they have the desire to learn, so go for it!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Looks just like the big robot Paimon once visited!
Jazari: Oh? You have been inside another Ruin Golem?
Paimon: Yes! In the desert, someone named Afratu asked us to look into machines just like this one.
Jazari: Afratu? Darn it, don't tell me he has also got his eyes on the title of "Well-known Ruin Golem Researcher."
Traveler: No, I don't think that's the case...
Jazari: I remember that guy to be a Vahumana Researcher, and this shouldn't interest him.
Jazari: That's not totally impossible, though.
Jazari: After all, that's where Iskandar, the sage saying "Behold. The thousand-year history of ancient Khaenri'ah lies before us!", comes from.
Paimon: Enough about the "well-known researcher" thing. Compared to the one we saw, this seems really deserted.
Jazari: Of course.
Jazari: According to the text named "The Review of Research on Issues Related to the Ruin Golem in Ancient Khaenri'ah," the last scholar who managed to get inside a Ruin Golem for systematic research was Pir Kavikavus.
Jazari: I'm sure you don't know this, but Pir Kavikavus was one of the greatest scholars in Kshahrewar's history. Kavikavus earned the rank of Herbad before hitting thirty — a genuine academic genius.
Jazari: With his achievements, he would have become a sage sooner or later. But he met with an accident during an expedition, and his research results were lost.
Jazari: Ever since then, Kshahrewar has gone downhill. If he had lived longer, perhaps I wouldn't be worrying about expenses day and night like this.
Jazari: By the way, it's my academic ambition to follow in Pir Kavikavus' footsteps.
Paimon: Well, so the next step should be...
Traveler: Smash open the entrance.
Paimon: Uh-huh, then we need to activate this big guy first.
Jazari: Right. By activating the Ruin Golem, I can get valuable experimental data, which will then serve as the basis for a breakthrough in my research.
Jazari: One has to make some waves to outdo one's predecessors, after all.
Paimon: So we'll start this big guy from the steering cabin, right?
Jazari: Well... generally, once the "separation valve" in the steering cabin is turned on, the Ruin Golem should be activated.
Jazari: But as I told you before, all ruin machines are driven by the dark power of their cores. And the cores of the Ruin Golem have been sealed underground.
Jazari: Even if we got into the steering cabin, the conventional method will not work.
Jazari: In fact, we can't even start this lift right before us, so how will we get to the steering cabin at the top?
Paimon: Hmm, you're right... So what do we do now?
