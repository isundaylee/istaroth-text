### Additional Talk 1

Contestant with Super OP Gear: Hey there! I'm back! So then, how's the Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp coming along...?
Paimon: Great timing, Yanfei!
Arataki Itto: My savior! Thanks for helping out with the permit! And for the sign with the epic artwork!
Arataki Itto: Wait, I know that look... Are you, uh, looking to flip some beetle too?
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Huh? Something wrong with that?
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I have a big client who does a lot of cross-border commerce — anyway, she showered me with gifts once after I helped her win a huge lawsuit, and among them was a very special Onikabuto.
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I didn't know how to look after it at the time, so I got Granny to look after it for a while. It's looking pretty buff these days...
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Mind if I join in? You're not worried I'll cramp your style, are you...?
Grandmaster Hanakado: We ought not dismiss your savior, Oni King. What she lacks in experience, she makes up for with one of the sturdiest-built and most awe-inspiring Onikabuto I have ever seen.
Arataki Itto: You make me an offer I can't refuse...
Arataki Itto: Alright, time to send in the Oni King's Right Hand with Crimson Staff. I know my compadre will stay cool under pressure!
Traveler: You betcha!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: #So it's me versus {NICKNAME}? Alright!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I haven't quite got the hang of this game yet, so apologies in advance for any blunders.
Traveler: Thanks for the vote of confidence!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Yanfei's Onikabuto is so strong! What has Madame Ping been feeding that thing...
Grandmaster Hanakado: See? Your savior's Onikabuto is a force to be reckoned with.
Grandmaster Hanakado: But just like last time, when my generals threw you a few curveballs, the mightiest blade cannot slay its foe except in the hands of a skilled swordmaster.
Arataki Itto: W—W—Wise words, Grandmaster... Ooookay... Good thing my compadre kept it together!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Wow, what a blast! I could get into this whole beetle-battling thing!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: This is so much fun! Thanks, everyone! I'm gonna stick around and play some more!
