Mtwa: How strange... It's like they can only be seen from inside Natlan...

## Talk

Traveler: You mean...
Mtwa: Yes, I speak of the unknown fragments that appeared in the sky during the battle against the Abyss.
Mtwa: At first, we thought they were Abyssal weapons, poised to descend upon us and bring destruction in their wake. But then, they just hung there doing nothing...
Mtwa: Later, someone said they resembled ancient relics from our western mountains. I went to see for myself, and they were indeed remarkably similar.
Mtwa: Oh dear, where are my manners? I haven't even told you who I am! I'm from the Natlan Saurian Relics Association and I'm out here doing fieldwork. Don't think for a second that this is a holiday!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Mtwa: Take care. And don't worry so much about the sky, it's far more important where you're putting your feet.

## Talk

Traveler: How's the research coming along?
Mtwa: Poorly, I'm afraid. It seems the more I look into it, the more questions I have. Why is it that as soon as one leaves Natlan, the fragments seem to disappear?
Mtwa: On the road here, I asked many an outlander, but all they gave me were funny looks. None of them seemed to know what I was talking about.
Mtwa: Then again, if I ran into a strange traveler from another land who was raving about a hole in the sky that I couldn't see, I'd probably think it was odd myself...
Mtwa: Well, not that I'm a traveler, obviously, I'm a researcher... That was just a hypothetical statement.
