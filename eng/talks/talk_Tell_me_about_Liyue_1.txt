Traveler: Tell me about Liyue.
Huixin: Not that there's any problem with that, we do not exclude anybody here in Liyue!
Huixin: On the contrary, with this being a commercial port, people get nervous if they see a decline in the foreign population.
Huixin: Thanks to the guidance of Rex Lapis, Liyue has gone from strength to strength in the last thousand years.
Huixin: Our forebears discovered the craft of producing glazes via firing. Trade with foreign lands grew, and Liyue prospered.
Huixin: Our biggest point of pride is that Mora, the coins used as currency throughout Teyvat, are cast right here in Liyue at the Golden House. More importantly, Mora are named after Morax, which is Rex Lapis' original name.
