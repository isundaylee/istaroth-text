# Suspicious Rose Custard

A dessert made from fermented milk. It appears to be fine, but as soon as you try some... your teeth will quiver due to the unbearable acidity. The lack of seasoning can still be made up for by adding more sugar. However, that lingering sourness is hardly something that can be easily forgotten.
