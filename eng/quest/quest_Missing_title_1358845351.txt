# Missing title (1358845351)


## Talk 1

Paimon: There are a few more letters here.
Paimon: #Take your pick, {NICKNAME}. Let's read one.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (VII)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: Per standard procedure, the Knights of Favonius needs to take a statement from all relevant parties.
Investigate: Recently, the Knights of Favonius have received reports from a number of eye-witnesses claiming to have seen the Darknight Hero in the vicinity of the Dawn Winery.
Investigate: The Grand Master has assigned the Cavalry Company to this mission. As such, I will be paying you a visit in three days.
Investigate: He seems to think that our relationship can be improved if we are forced to talk in person.
Investigate: Don't worry, though. My lips are sealed. This will be nothing more than a formality. Anyway, three days' notice should be enough for you, I presume?
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (VIII)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: The appearance of the Darknight Hero has indeed bought the Knights of Favonius some valuable time during the Abyss Order's last attack.
Investigate: This helped Jean convince the Knights of Favonius to stop focusing on trying to stop him.
Investigate: This will decrease the limits on the Darknight Hero's actions, but this doesn't mean that his situation will necessarily improve.
Investigate: Objects with too honed an edge tend to be damaged more easily. You, I'm sure, are aware of the great dangers that come with acting alone.
Investigate: That said, I would advise against such a course of action.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (IX)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: I heard that the Dawn Winery did not suffer any damage. Likewise, the Knights of Favonius only sustained minor injuries, and will recover quickly.
Investigate: However, an employee of a local merchant has gone missing, and their last known location just so happens to align with the Abyss Order's area of activity.
Investigate: The Knights have dispatched people to go to the rescue.
Investigate: Do be aware that the Abyss Order has become more dangerous as of late, even going so far as to organize multi-pronged offensives.
Investigate: Perhaps the Darknight Hero and the Knights of Favonius should team up. That might guarantee that things will go off without a hitch, hmm?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey, there's another bunch of letters here... Diluc must have read these ones recently, too...
Paimon: Which one shall we read first?
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (I)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: A storm is brewing within the Knights of Favonius. Varka's inner circle is preparing to investigate Eroch and his henchmen, and it's looking increasingly likely that Eroch is about to get unseated from that high horse of his.
Investigate: You might not be too pleased to see this letter of mine, but I mean to get this news to you as soon as possible.
Investigate: You don't have to reply.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (II)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: Even I was a little surprised to hear that you'd decided to leave on a trip.
Investigate: Jean wanted to write and try to dissuade you, but I advised her against it.
Investigate: As for Varka, I don't think he knows about this. Otherwise, he'd have probably sat you down for a talk.
Investigate: If you'd like to leave, do it now. The less the people know, the less the goodbyes you'll have to say. Leave at night, too, so things won't be too saddening.
Investigate: Take care.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (III)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: Some slightly bad news. Eroch won't be quite so difficult to bring down after all.
Investigate: The Grand Master's order to investigate has certainly dealt him a major blow, but I wouldn't call the problem "pulled up by the roots" yet.
Investigate: The matter's been handed over to Jean's jurisdiction. She'll take care of this, I believe. Eroch is an obstacle in her path, in any case.
Investigate: Just sit tight and wait for the good news.

## Talk 3

Vile: Huh? Why are you visiting me at this hour... not trying to buy intel from me, are you?
Vile: I've been very busy lately, you know. A major client has booked two full weeks of my time.
Traveler: A major client, you say?
Vile: Yes. I can't disclose any details, but suffice to say he's exceptionally rich — so don't even think about trying to out-bid him.
Paimon: Wait, but... shouldn't informants only share their intel with one person?
Vile: Maybe in an ideal world, but business is business at the end of the day, and if you only have one partnership, you'll eventually starve to death.
Vile: The Knights of Favonius are sticklers for principle, but even they have a practice of obtaining intelligence from a minimum of two sources during large-scale operations.
Vile: They've suffered badly from incomplete intelligence in the past. That's why people like me are so important — I'm there when they need the extra support, and I'm free to find other work when they don't.
Vile: Here's an analogy. Imagine the Abyss Order has set up an ambush in the wilderness — a single scouting team is unlikely to detect it.
Vile: Next thing you know, a knight on patrol passes by, completely unsuspecting, when suddenly "Waah!" A monster jumps out and clubs him over the head with a "bish" and a "bash."
Traveler: ...Why the sound effects?
Vile: Well, I just thought they might make the whole thing sound more realistic.
Paimon: Nope, not even close! Monsters go "Yaah!" not "Waah!" And it's a "swish" and a "smash," not a "bish" and a "bash"!
Vile: Don't be so single-minded... You can think what you want, of course, but it can't hurt to keep my version on file as alternative intel.
Paimon: Huh? Hmm, guess that kinda makes sense...
Vile: Anyway, to get back to the point... buyers are demanding multiple sources, and it's only fair that informants are free to serve multiple clients too, don't you think?
Traveler: You trade your time...?
Vile: Of course I do. All work is just selling your labor hours. The intelligence business is no different.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Another bunch of letters?
Paimon: #Which one do you think we should start with, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (IV)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: Recently, a group of businessmen returned to Mondstadt. Word is that the reason for their return is a downturn in business.
Investigate: According to my observations, their employees are regulars at Angel's Share. These people can also be found out in the more dangerous parts of the wilds around the city.
Investigate: Now, a few of them were a little careless and even dropped some pages of their notes on the ground. I took the liberty of returning these sheets to the Angel's Share. You know, out of the goodness of my heart.
Investigate: I think they might have something to do with you, seeing as how they were there. I also noticed that their notes were written in code. Information brokers, perhaps? Or some kind of secret organization?
Investigate: Whatever the case, it took quite a lot of effort to see those blurred words with only one eye, you know? Don't worry, I'll keep this a secret.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (V)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: I didn't try to hide it from you on purpose, you know. But I suppose you found out all the same, huh?
Investigate: I mean, not everyone who wears an eyepatch must be blind, right? Don't people also wear an eyepatch if they have a scar over their right eye?
Investigate: The long-awaited good news is finally here.
Investigate: Now, I'm going to bring a glass of wine when I go to watch Eroch pack his things and leave on his last day (good riddance, by the way). That should be fun, eh?
Investigate: I know you're not the type to do that sort of thing, but I am, so allow me.
Traveler: A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (VI)
Investigate: To D:
Investigate: Oh, my! No sooner did you get back than a mysterious character started popping up.
Investigate: I hear he's called the Darknight Hero. He has repeatedly fought off Treasure Hoarders and monsters in the Mondstadt area — and he's even attacked Abyss Order strongholds.
Investigate: So far, it seems like he is on Mondstadt's side, but the Knights of Favonius could never permit the existence of a vigilante.
Investigate: I get the feeling that the two of you would get along nicely. Why don't you find an opportunity to get to know him and give him some sage advice? You know, just so he doesn't get caught by the Knights?

## Talk 5

Mack: Hold it, I have to stop you right there. Sorry, the name's Mack.
Mack: The Knights of Favonius are carrying out a training exercise near Falcon Coast. Access is temporarily denied to the public.
Traveler: But I don't see any knights on the beach...
Mack: They're still rounding up the troops, but they'll be arriving shortly.
Mack: Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.
Traveler: But there are monsters on the beach...
Mack: Exactly. They will serve as targets for the knights participating in the training exercise.
Mack: Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.

## Talk 6

Harry: Hello there!
Harry: I'm Harry of the Knights of Favonius. This area has been deemed highly dangerous, and I have been ordered to keep the public away.
Harry: Vicious monsters have been reported around the Stormbearer Mountains.
Harry: We have yet to ascertain their precise location, but the Knights of Favonius are on their trail.
Traveler: I don't see any other knights here except you...
Harry: We need to confirm the monsters' positions before taking large-scale action. Otherwise, they'll see us coming and run off.
Harry: Hence, the search team is operating in smaller units. They are operating very discreetly and staying away from the public eye.
Harry: Please, for your safety, stay away from the Stormbearer Mountains.

## Talk 7

Paimon: There are two notes here. Which one shall we start with?
Traveler: Read the first note.
Investigate: It's been years since the ley lines last released such highly aggressive monsters during an anomaly.
Investigate: The Darknight Hero's timing was perfect. The way he lured the monsters a few at a time into the open to defeat them one by one... quite the strategy.
Investigate: And then he pretended to be seriously injured, luring out the Abyss Order's main forces and then meeting them head on. A truly magnificent counterattack.
Investigate: Still, this plan involved too many uncertainties. The Darknight Hero himself even said that he can't afford to take risks like this every time.
Investigate: Getting to the root of the problem and preventing these types of ley line disorders from happening is the safest approach.
Paimon: Paimon didn't follow all of that. Eh, but it seemed to be about a previous battle Diluc was in?
Traveler: Read the second note.
Investigate: Ley lines hold many secrets. We ordinary people do not need to concern ourselves with the way they work.
Investigate: But since the Darknight Hero will be fighting against the Abyss Order for the long term, it is in our best interests to gain a deeper understanding of them.
Investigate: I heard that the captain of the Knights of Favonius Investigation Team is a highly accomplished academic, but unlike Lisa, he is not especially close with the Acting Grand Master.
Investigate: We should be able to learn a few things from him without the Knights of Favonius finding out.
Investigate: Perhaps the Darknight Hero could ask him for input on the technical issues regarding the ley lines. I will deliver the letter to his camp on the mountain.
Paimon: Huh? Sounds like it was talking about Albedo. Did Diluc write a letter to Albedo?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Investigate: Dear Jean,
Investigate: Thank you for your concern, Acting Grand Master. It is as you say. That incident should no longer weigh heavily on my mind.
Investigate: Punishing Eroch for his malfeasance was the right way to correct the Knights of Favonius's past mistakes. This is an important step indeed for the Knights.
Investigate: As for my own personal safety, you need not concern yourself too much. The Knights of Favonius should focus their efforts where it counts by looking after those who need it most.
Investigate: May you also remain in good health.

### Additional Talk 2

Investigate: Dear Albedo,
Investigate: Thank you for the detailed explanation. I have read your paper and found it both enriching and easy to understand. It is a rare and well-written document indeed.
Investigate: I have written the relevant information down in hopes that it will be put to good use in the future.
Investigate: Guarding against danger is a very important skill. I will continue to keep watching over the Abyss Order, and use force against them where necessary.

### Additional Talk 3

Investigate: Dear Master Varka,
Investigate: You have my utmost thanks for your condolences and concern. My father would be pleased to have heard your compliments.
Investigate: I doubt that anything would have pleased him more than to have the acknowledgment of the Knight of Boreas.
Investigate: I am presently traveling, and by a stroke of fortune, your letter has indeed reached me safely.
Investigate: If nothing goes awry, I believe that I will not be rejoining the Knights of Favonius. However, I will not forget my previous experiences. I will commit everything the Knights taught me to heart.
Investigate: May this find you in good health.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: (There's something strange about this brick...)
Traveler: Take this brick off the wall
Traveler: (It's a secret compartment... with a box inside.)
Traveler: Open the box
Investigate: The objects in the box are all pretty old. One particular sheet of paper stands out.
Investigate: A piece of it has been burned away, and the remaining parts show signs of having been rescued from that same flame.
Investigate: Every line on this sheet of paper has a matching one right under it. From the handwriting, it looks like a child wrote on this first before an adult stepped in, held their hand, and taught them how to do it the second time.
Investigate: The writings are as follows: "Remember always that it was the Alberich Clan, who did not have royal blood, who stepped in as regents when the strength of the one-eyed king Irmin failed."
Investigate: "Though we could not restore Khaenri'ah to life, we of the Alberich Clan should lead lives as those who blaze like fire, rather than those who wallow in the embers."
Investigate: If you flip the paper over, there are other words there. You reckon these must be annotations of some sort.
Investigate: "I saved this one memento from the fire 'Father' made while he wasn't paying attention. This was in violation of our principles. Our clan's affairs should never be recorded."
Investigate: "For me, this sheet of paper cannot serve as any form of identification, and will not give me passage anywhere."
Investigate: "Now that I look at it, his handwriting was as grieving as a smoking ash pile. There is no way that I can write something like that, living in Mondstadt as I am."
Traveler: ...
Investigate: Moving the paper aside, you can see a cloth bag underneath it that contains an eyepatch of significant age. A sticker is attached to the side, and the text on it reads:
Investigate: "Hah! To think that all that play-acting as a one-eyed pirate would eventually end with one actual wounded eye."
Investigate: "I have never blamed Diluc for that. I suppose I must have been asking for it, telling him the truth the day my adoptive father died without expecting conflict to emerge somehow."
Investigate: "He seems to believe that I really was blinded, though that's not the case. Well, I've fooled him for a while, haven't I? Might as well keep going."
Investigate: Two letters lie beneath the bag, all of which have "D" as their sender. The letters are in great condition, and there is a time written on the back. This is most likely the time these letters were received.
Investigate: You can tell that the words have been written in a strong but elegant hand.
Traveler: Read the first letter.
Investigate: To K:
Investigate: Message received. Thank you.
Investigate: Also, I suggest that you stop mentioning eyes in your letters. Don't think that I don't know that your right eye wasn't blinded.
Investigate: A small paper bag lies next to these two letters. It contains nothing but a few seashells.
Investigate: They have lost most of their luster. It is unclear how much time has passed since they were picked up.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (It might be best to store this box and restore everything to how it was originally.)
Traveler: Read the second letter.
Investigate: To K:
Investigate: Thanks for the letter.
Investigate: Cooperating with the Knights has objective pros and cons, like two sides of a coin. I'm sure you understand that better than I do.
Investigate: No need to worry about my safety. Self-preservation is easy. Striving towards my goal is hard. Take better care of yourself instead.

### Additional Talk 5

Investigate: Dear Ms. Alice,
Investigate: I must admit that when I read the opening lines of this letter, I was not expecting it to have been written by you.
Investigate: It seems that I may have indeed failed to notice you despite your presence nearby. My apologies for that.
Investigate: Regarding Klee, I have heard that you are an extremely powerful witch, so I suspect that Klee would have been just fine even sans my presence.
Investigate: Even so, you sent me this letter, for which I am thankful.
Investigate: As you have said, traveling is my best option at present. I will go out and experience all that the world has to offer, just as you have suggested.
Investigate: My father's will shall find continuation through me.
Investigate: Klee is welcome to stay at Dawn Winery as a guest during my absence. Adelinde will prepare sufficient snacks and grape juice for such occasions. And if you don't mind, you are also welcome to drop by.
Investigate: I hope that you and Klee stay in good health.

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: These letters cover a whole load of different events. Paimon never knew Diluc's past was so complicated...
Paimon: We're really gonna have to study all the details to figure out how everything fits together.
Paimon: #Which letter do you wanna read next, {NICKNAME}?

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: A Letter With Elegant Handwriting
Investigate: Dear Diluc,
Investigate: Welcome back to Mondstadt, Sir.
Investigate: It has been some time since the incident. We discovered that Eroch had betrayed us, and he has been punished severely.
Investigate: I hope that this news will put your mind at ease.
Investigate: In other news, our people have discovered that the Abyss Order has stepped up its activities between Wolvendom and Stone Gate lately.
Investigate: Also — a mysterious individual that people are calling the "Darknight Hero" has suddenly started showing up out of nowhere all around Mondstadt City. He typically acts in the dead of night, and his intentions are currently unclear.
Investigate: Please stay safe, and notify the Knights as soon as possible should you see anything suspicious. We will send support immediately.
Investigate: Whether you are presently in our ranks or not, all faithful knights will remember your contributions to the Knights of Favonius.
Investigate: May you remain in good health.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: A Neatly Written Letter
Investigate: Dear Mr. Diluc,
Investigate: It is my pleasure to investigate the ley lines alongside you.
Investigate: As you know, my focus is on alchemy, so my knowledge of the ley lines remains quite shallow, and I fear that I will only be able to share what little understanding I have.
Investigate: According to many pre-existing documents, the ley lines can be seen as a medium for storing information. Under certain circumstances, they can record activities that occur in the area around them.
Investigate: All this information goes through a recording and storage process. After a certain period of time, they may be released once again by the ley lines.
Investigate: If I may be so bold as to make a guess, there should be a method to activate the ley lines. Those who grasp such methods can control the times at which ley line information is recorded and released.
Investigate: Judging from the runic symbols and some other clues, I surmise that there are particular members of the Abyss Order who may have a very small chance of being able to achieve this.
Investigate: If you believe that this requires further investigation, these entities may serve as your point of entry.
Investigate: I wrote a paper a few years ago in which I covered my brief foray into questions concerning the flow of ley lines and other such topics. You will find a copy of this paper enclosed.
Investigate: I hope that it can help to clear up some of your doubts.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: A Letter With Rough Handwriting
Investigate: Diluc,
Investigate: Jean wrote to me lately with shocking news. If I don't miss my guess, she wrote to you too. Her sentiments are those of the Knights as a whole.
Investigate: Crepus was a good man, and I thought very well of him. It grieves me greatly to know that he met with such a fate.
Investigate: As for the defeat of the drake, the honors for that accomplishment should go to your father. I do not accept Eroch's theft of the credit for that deed, which was bought with your father's sacrifice.
Investigate: Stolen credit will not be accepted within the Knights of Favonius under any circumstances. I will not permit it.
Investigate: I have already given Jean the authority to punish Eroch with all necessary severity. The Knights will inform you of the results.
Investigate: I've heard that you've been taking some time off outdoors and may not be easy to reach, so there is no guarantee that my letter will reach you. As such, I'll stop here for now.
Investigate: If it does reach you, then I wish you good health and safety in your travels. Contact us if you need anything.
Investigate: I hope that falcon of yours will help put this letter in your hands. I mean, I don't write in person very often, you know?
Investigate: These may seem like pointless words to you right now, but remember: even the greatest of disasters must come to an end.
Investigate: Mondstadt waits for your return, and if you're willing, the Knights will always welcome you. (If you're not, forget I said anything, yeah?)

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: A Tidily Written Letter
Investigate: To the heir of the Ragnvindr Clan,
Investigate: I apologize for sending this letter without notice. You may not remember me, but we've met a few times.
Investigate: We've met near the square, when I sat at the table adjacent to yours at the Good Hunter, and I've seen you in your tavern...
Investigate: You were always busy with a great many things, especially back when you were much chattier than you are now. You spoke cheerfully and often with your brother and friends then.
Investigate: It's probably no surprise that you did not notice me then. But I've always had my eye on you, child.
Investigate: I recall with crystal clarity how my little Klee once made a complete mess of your vineyard while she was trying to catch Crystalflies there...
Investigate: But you didn't get angry. In fact, you personally escorted Klee back and even gave her a few bottles of fresh grape juice.
Investigate: Now I think that might jog your memory, yes?
Investigate: Klee recently told me that she "hasn't seen that strange man with the red hair in aaages," so I decided to look into it out of curiosity.
Investigate: My deepest condolences regarding your father.
Investigate: In many of the stories I've been told, you are the model knight: proud, driven, a knight of noble character and lineage.
Investigate: But I know that you're gentler than you appear. If you weren't, you wouldn't have treated Klee the way you did.
Investigate: And since you helped my child out, I hope you won't mind if I treat you as if you were my own.
Investigate: Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will leave the dark place that you are presently in, and that you will not wallow in grief and remorse.
Investigate: Partings are most painful things, but they also encourage us to grow. A bird that has lost the roof over its head will fly further than others of its kind.
Investigate: Go out and see the world. That's the best course of action I can envision. Only by feeling, observing, and listening can your heart be healed.
Investigate: Parents all wish that they can accompany their children forever, and the skies, seas, and stars bear witness to that oath.
Investigate: Everything that was your father now finds new life with you. That which you will experience in this world may have been things that your father experienced once upon a time.
Investigate: I hope that the wind will bring you all manner of wondrous things in your journeys to come.
Investigate: In any case, keep your chin up, young child.

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: A Letter With Clear Handwriting
Investigate: Master,
Investigate: Master Kaeya took leave and stayed at Dawn Winery for a few days.
Investigate: In a rare turn of events, he decided to stay in his original bedroom. He would pace about the grounds when idle, and even asked Adelinde to make him his favorite dishes.
Investigate: Ah, it really does take me back.
Investigate: I shall be honest with you, but I was quite surprised to hear Master Kaeya say that he wanted to stay for a few days.
Investigate: We did not refuse him, however. We believe that even if you were here, you would not refuse him outright.
Investigate: Dawn Winery has always been a more quiet location, perhaps because all who stay here are rather peaceable people.
Investigate: The house is made by those who live in it, and Master Kaeya's uncommon arrival did end up livening the place up significantly.
Investigate: I hope that you are doing well in your travels abroad. Everyone here at the winery misses you.
Investigate: May you remain safe and in good health.

### Additional Talk 12

Traveler: A New Letter
Investigate: Dear Darknight Hero, the Knights of Favonius have stepped up the guard details throughout Mondstadt without making any major movements. The Abyss Order will not have noticed.
Investigate: I am scouting around Dragonspine. The monsters here are scattered and separated. Clearly, they haven't been assembled by the Abyss Order.
Investigate: There are no signs of enemy activity in the south of Mondstadt either.
Investigate: If you can confirm that the other locations are also free of monsters, we will be able to conclude that the Abyss Order has nothing to do with the recent ley line disorder.
