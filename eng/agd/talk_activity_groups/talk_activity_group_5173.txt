Traveler: Why can't I just work here?
Gou San'er: What? You're a new temp laborer, here to pick up odd jobs? Ha, then you're out of luck...
Gou San'er: Other than watching the door and stock maintenance, the main task here is just transporting goods.
Gou San'er: Hauling cargo between the docks and the warehouse ain't easy, and normally, we give all the daytime jobs to our comrades at the docks who've been formally employed there for years.
Gou San'er: Temp workers like you only get the night jobs. If you can't finish, someone else'll take care of it later.
Gou San'er: But a new guy joined our crew recently. Tall, strong, and he even wears red horns on his head! Works like a demon, he does.
Gou San'er: He just doesn't get tired — does the work of three men, even! He only has to work three hours per night to earn a decent amount of Mora.
Gou San'er: He's pretty reasonable, too. He explained everything when he arrived, saying that he's been pretty strapped for cash recently and is only gonna work like this for a few days. He won't be sticking around, so we won't need to worry about losing our jobs to him in the long term.
Gou San'er: So if you wanna work the night shifts and pick up work while he's around, there won't be much left for you.

Listen to the Next Breakdown: Well now, friend, have you come to take part in Boss Arataki's Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp as well?
Traveler: Leeeet's beetle battle!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Wonderful! Our previous duel was most exciting. Indeed, I was planning to review it quite carefully! In any case, let us go for another round, just like Boss Arataki would want!
Traveler: Tell me about the way of the beetle battler...
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Ah, a great question! Indeed, I could go on for quite some time about this!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Liyue has its own types of contests between insects, and like Onikabuto battles, each has its own unique features.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: For example, there are contests of agility, as well as competitions to see which bug can cry the loudest.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Each one of these battles has its own set of mysteries that, with a few flourishes of a pen, can transform into many a tale I can tell my regulars time and time again!
Traveler: Have a nice day!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: See you next time, then!

Buttercup of Terror: Would you like to play a round with me?
Traveler: Let's get to it!
Buttercup of Terror: Alright! I'm gonna learn how you fight, err, White... Melon-thing!
Traveler: Could you tell me about your nickname?
Buttercup of Terror: You mean "Buttercup of Terror"?
Buttercup of Terror: Oh, it came about because Daddy once gave me a buttercup flower, which I put by my windowsill every night. But by the next morning, it would have raced up to the roof.
Buttercup of Terror: Someone said that they saw my flower climbing the walls in the dead of night just like a cat...
Buttercup of Terror: It was later that we found that there was a cat in the city that had taken a liking to my plant, which led to it making off with the plant.
Buttercup of Terror: I don't know why, but as the story spread, it somehow became "The buttercup Changchang raised turned into a cat. Terrifying!"
Buttercup of Terror: Not that I mind, but... when that "Grandmaster Avocado" person heard about this, they thought that my nickname was really cool, and they even asked me to play this game...
Buttercup of Terror: And well, I'm having loads of fun, and I'd love to play more!
Traveler: See you!
Buttercup of Terror: Yup, I'll see you too!

Contestant with Super OP Gear: #Ah, Traveler, would you like to have another beetle battle with me?
Traveler: Let's go, let's go!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Hehe! Who knows? I might discover a little trick, and I'll have you backed into a corner before you know it!
Traveler: Been busy lately, Yanfei?
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Oh, I'm fine, I'm good!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I mean, even legal experts don't have business to attend to every day, you know.
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Which is just as well. While my fellow disciples are having their reunion, I'm going to be spending all my annual leave!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: I'll eat my fill, sleep my due, play to my heart's content — and then go back to my work refreshed and renewed.
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Now that's what they call a happy life!
Traveler: See you around, Yanfei!
Contestant with Super OP Gear: Sure. Swing by when you're free and teach me this game, alright?

No-Frills Instant Kill: Ah, it's you. Would you like to test yourself against me again?
Traveler: Let's go for it!
No-Frills Instant Kill: Good. Here I go, then.
Traveler: Oh, so you enjoy beetle battles too?
No-Frills Instant Kill: I wouldn't say that I "enjoy" it. I simply think that there is something to learn from many activities, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a go.
No-Frills Instant Kill: We often get a lot of non-combat-related requests mixed in with our high-difficulty commissions.
No-Frills Instant Kill: Solving mechanical puzzles, following clues to search for specific objects...
No-Frills Instant Kill: You never know when you might even encounter a commission that requires you to command other creatures to fulfill a certain objective.
No-Frills Instant Kill: I'm sure that you, of all people, would have experience with that?
Traveler: I shan't bother you for now.
No-Frills Instant Kill: Alright, you do you.

Grandmaster Hanakado: O Great Oni King's Right hand, is there anything I might assist you with?
Traveler: Get me an Onikabuto!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Of course! That is well within my abilities!
Grandmaster Hanakado: However, it takes some time to assess the compatibility between an Onikabuto and a mighty beetle battler...
Grandmaster Hanakado: I've been able to guess more or less which sort of Onikabuto would suit your fighting style based on our previous battles. Of course, that's been quite the test of my abilities, too.
Grandmaster Hanakado: The matter of where I should go to capture such an Onikabuto is something I must give much thought to...
Grandmaster Hanakado: I will have to ask for your patience in this matter. Next we meet, I'll have the perfect answer ready for you!
Traveler: So, about the gift...
Grandmaster Hanakado: Ah, you mean the gift we're going to give to that great master?
Grandmaster Hanakado: To be honest, I haven't thought of any good ideas just yet...
Grandmaster Hanakado: That master was able to create that incredibly intricate Bloom Pruner, so perhaps, we could buy some exquisite machine processing equipment and pack it into a gift box. That might be satisfactory...
Grandmaster Hanakado: That said, I only have 2 million Mora on hand, so I doubt I'll be able to get my hands on the best stuff — it certainly wouldn't be good enough to catch that master's eye.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Besides, I'm not sure how long I'll be here in Liyue, and how much Mora I'll need for my own expenses. Gotta find some way to deepen my pockets...
Traveler: 2 million isn't a small sum, you know...
Grandmaster Hanakado: A small portion of it is my regular savings, but most of it was given to me by my grandfather.
Grandmaster Hanakado: He used to be a great adventurer in the past, and he was blessed with good luck every time he took his Onikabuto with him, leading him to discover large amounts of treasure.
Grandmaster Hanakado: That's why he greatly supports my beetle-battling career. He deposits some funds for me every so often, and I don't spend it willy-nilly. One day, I want to use it on something super important!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Earlier, I saw that the Arataki Gang's finances weren't doing so hot, so I tried to support the Oni King with some funds, but he refused me every time, saying...
Grandmaster Hanakado: "Nope, ain't no way we're letting our allies pay! Me and the gang have backbone, I'll have you know!"
Grandmaster Hanakado: I respect that spirit, so when I do get that gift for that great master, I'll report those expenses to the Oni King... No matter how many millions of Mora it adds up to!
Traveler: Is that money all yours?
Traveler: See you around, Grandmaster!
Grandmaster Hanakado: And you too, Oni King's Right Hand!
