# Canned Knowledge "Swordfighting Techniques VIII"

Canned Knowledge labeled "Swordfighting Techniques VIII." It was bought from Dori's booth at the price of 100,000 Mora at Paimon's instigation. You have no idea where the first seven in the series are, but things like "Combat Techniques" will always be useful. Well, probably.
