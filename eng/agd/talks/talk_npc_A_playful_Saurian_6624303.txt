Traveler: A playful Saurian?
Kotimy: Oh, that's probably just Cacucu.
Kotimy: He's Ifa's, err... "brother".
Kotimy: Anyway, that's what he calls himself. He can mimic human speech, too! That's probably why Ifa calls him Cacucu...
Kotimy: Now, I don't know if he truly understands human speech, but he looks pretty cool and I love chatting with him.
Kotimy: But not for too long, or it'll get in the way of my daily training!
