Traveler: I'd like to know about Rukkhashava Mushrooms...
Farbod: Rukkhashava Mushrooms are great stuff! You know by the name that they must be something amazing growing only on old trees.
Farbod: I think... uh, they can serve as cooking ingredients, herbs... well, and maybe fertilizer?
Farbod: Well, I'm not sure. All I know is that as long as the Akademiya needs it, I can always make money from it.
Farbod: The only thing I do know is that it's a great ingredient for cooking. Here are some for you. Take a try.
