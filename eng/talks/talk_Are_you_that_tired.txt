Traveler: Are you that tired?
Hakan: Not so much tired as bored.
Hakan: Don't you think it's easier to fall sleep in noisy places like a theater or market?
Hakan: There's no one from the Akademiya around the theater, anyway, so I'm not under watch.
Hakan: When Azra isn't asking me to run after Swoof, and no students insist on taking pictures with Nilou, dozing off is all I've got left.
