Aikawa Susumu: Let the Aisa Bathhouse warm your heart. Experience the glamor of Natlan and feel your worries melt away.
Aikawa Susumu: Ahh, it's a traveler from afar. What a rare guest. Welcome! As luck would have it, our major shareholder is here too. I'm sure you two will have much to talk about!

Traveler: The glamor of Natlan?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it might be a little too much to call it "glamor"... Aisa Bathhouse is a hot spring inn in Inazuma that I founded after experiencing the volcanic hot springs in Natlan.
Aikawa Susumu: The healing power of a hot spring is unforgettable once you've tried it. After I returned home, I also wanted my friends in Inazuma to experience that same warm and comforting feeling.
Aikawa Susumu: I had no idea Aisa Bathhouse would become so popular. Even some big shots frequent this place, something that makes me regret setting the price so low. Haha.

Traveler: Major shareholder?
Aikawa Susumu: Indeed. While I was away in Natlan, I was inspired to return to Inazuma and open a hot spring hotel. As I didn't possess the funds myself, I began to look around for investors.
Aikawa Susumu: In the end, a clinical psychologist who had been living among the People of the Springs — none other than the venerable Yumemizuki Mizuki herself — caught wind of my endeavors.
Aikawa Susumu: She was very supportive of the idea of opening a hot spring hotel in Inazuma, so she invested a large sum.
Aikawa Susumu: While my neighbors in Inazuma City may have taken to calling me "Boss," the real boss of the Aisa Bathhouse is undoubtedly Miss Yumemizuki.
Aikawa Susumu: At most, I'm just a manager in charge of commercial operations. As for the key decisions on business and development, those are all taken by Miss Yumemizuki.
Aikawa Susumu: Once she returned to Inazuma, she made some changes and improvements to the hot springs' operations. The results have been nothing short of miraculous...
Aikawa Susumu: If you've been troubled by anxiety, you should have a word with Miss Yumemizuki. I'm sure she'll be able to work wonders for you!

Traveler: What's Natlan like?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it's nothing like Inazuma, which has oceans surrounding it. Natlan is a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate.
Aikawa Susumu: What I said might be a bit confusing, so here are some souvenirs I brought back. You can have them. Who knows, you might be able to get a sense of Natlan's scorching temperatures.

Traveler: Big shots?
Aikawa Susumu: By no means are they senior government officials... I meant those samurai from the Tenryou Commission. They often come here.
Aikawa Susumu: Some of them have become regular customers. I make a note of it and offer them a discount.
Aikawa Susumu: I guess it must be because they can see plainly and speak frankly while at a hot spring. That must do wonders for fatigue relief.
