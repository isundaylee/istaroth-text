## Talk

Tsarevich: Come on! How long do you expect a guy to keep waiting, huh!?

## Talk

Tsarevich: What's wrong?
Tsarevich: There are monsters in the gorge, so the Knights of Favonius wouldn't let me through. Too dangerous, they say.
Tsarevich: I've been waiting and waiting, and still no sign that they'll let us through any time soon. I would have expected a little more efficiency from the illustrious Knights of Favonius.
Tsarevich: You're an adventurer, huh? Well go on then, get in there and take out a few monsters for me, pronto!

## Talk

Tsarevich: Who are you?
Tsarevich: You've never heard the name Tsarevich before? Tsk... I would say I'm surprised, but you are an ignorant country bumpkin after all.
Tsarevich: I'm a very well-known merchant from Snezhnaya. I do business all over the seven nations. Mondstadt has proven to be the most eye-opening place for me... but don't get the wrong idea. I could not have imagined somewhere so abysmal without seeing it for myself.
Tsarevich: People here are so simple-minded, no business sense at all. If you gave me a week, I could raze this whole economic system to the ground.
Tsarevich: Then again, I don't know what I was expecting. If people here knew the first thing about business, this place obviously wouldn't be in the sorry state it is today.
Tsarevich: Why don't you and your minions go?
Tsarevich: Are you joking? Someone like me, getting down and dirty with the monsters? Fat chance.
Tsarevich: And my subordinates are under no obligation to make up for the knights' incompetence. They don't work for free. Are the Knights of Favonius going to cover my extra costs?
Tsarevich: They're a fickle lot. They're always making things difficult for me getting into the city, too. So now they want to take advantage of me, huh? Dream on!

## Talk

Tsarevich: Goodbye.
Tsarevich: Get rid of those monsters, you hear? I can only wait so long.
