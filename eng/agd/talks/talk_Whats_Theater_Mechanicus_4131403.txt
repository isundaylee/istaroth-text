Ruijin: What's Theater Mechanicus?
Ruijin: Theater Mechanicus is a new kind of board game that I just invented.
Ruijin: All you need to play is a table, a few game pieces, and a game master.
Ruijin: The objective of the game is to use various strategies to withstand the monster attacks. At least, that's the main idea for now...
Ruijin: But who knows, if any more good ideas come to me, I'd like to expand the game's content even more.
Ruijin: It'd be great to add things like exploring ruins, or solving evil plots... If all goes well, the game could potentially become like a true adventure in another world.
