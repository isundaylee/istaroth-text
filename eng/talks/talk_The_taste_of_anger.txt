Traveler: The "taste of anger"?
Arasaka: That taste, Nara Varuna once brought it up.
Arasaka: A taste of it would make you feel as if swallowed the flame of Vanagni. Eeek! Even the thought of it is terrifying.
Arasaka: But some Nara like that taste. They must be the bravest Nara among all.
Arasaka: #Brave Nara {NICKNAME} must like "the taste of anger," no?
