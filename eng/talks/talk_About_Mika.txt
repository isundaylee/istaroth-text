Traveler: About Mika...
Huffman: Oh? You've already met my brother? Then I don't think there's much to say.
Huffman: I was so worried about him when he went out with the Grand Master. But now it seems I was too worried.
Huffman: Although he is still prone to shyness, his ability to survey and do mapping has improved a lot, and his work is done in short order.
Huffman: I hear he's joining the Guerrilla Assault platoon next, and he probably won't be back in town for a while. I wish him all the best!
