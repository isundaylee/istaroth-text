# Concresoil


## Talk 1

Akim: I think I'm about to succeed...
Akim: Traveler! Hold on a second, Traveler!
Traveler: What's going on?
Akim: I'm looking for Slime Condensate!
Akim: Here's the thing. I've been mixing the different soils you brought previously in various proportions over the last few days.
Akim: I failed many times, but I did eventually work out a viable mixing ratio!
Akim: Concresoil with this ratio lacks plasticity before it hardens, but after that, it becomes strong and durable.
Akim: I might need to add more soil with Slime Condensate in it...
Akim: Traveler, could you please bring me three more portions of Slime Condensate?
Akim: With more Slime Condensate, I'm sure that I can definitely create the ideal soil!
Traveler: What are you looking for this time?

## Talk 2

Akim: Did you get the Slime Condensate?

## Talk 3

Akim: Great! This is it. Give me a sec. I'll get it done in no time!
Black Screen Text: A while later...
Akim: Hah, my guess was right.
Akim: As adhesive as it is, the moist soil breaks easily once it hardens. However, if we mix it with the Whopperflower soil, the solidified soil becomes more flexible.
Akim: It's just that the mixture can't really be molded before it starts solidifying...
Akim: But with the addition of the soil from the Slimes' habitat, the mixture can be molded much better before its solidification.
Akim: I don't know what happened, but if I have to describe the process, the soil became Slime-like...
Traveler: So, I guess we can call it "Slimesoil," hmm?
Akim: Some property of the Slimes seems to have affected the mixture in some way. That's why I was wondering if adding Slime Condensate would make it more effective.
Akim: And as it turned out, the mixture's plasticity and stability changed with the amount of Slime Condensate added.
Akim: Which means that it can make more than just building materials, but pottery and many other things as well!
Traveler: Congratulations!
Akim: Thanks. I suppose this is what those wise folks mean when they say "many a little makes a mickle."
Akim: We shouldn't underestimate this modest-looking soil. Someday, I might be able to build a tower to touch the skies with it!
Akim: I've also decided to call this mixture "Concresoil."
Akim: The next thing is to see what this Concresoil can make...
Akim: Ah, it seems that a possible solution to the problems that have plagued peoples' homes recently is within sight.
Akim: Thank you once again, Traveler. Please take these as your reward.
Traveler: Your efforts finally paid off.
Traveler: Sounds like something Paimon might enjoy.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon doesn't eat soil!
