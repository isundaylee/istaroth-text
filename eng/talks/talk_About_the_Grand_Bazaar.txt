Traveler: About the Grand Bazaar...
Paimon: The residents of the Grand Bazaar are all so talented!
Paimon: They sell their own woven goods, beautiful vases and jars, and delicious-smelling spices that make Paimon's tummy start rumbling...
Paimon: And they all sing and dance really well! Paimon wishes she could do that.
Traveler: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.
Paimon: What? Really?
Traveler: Well for starters...
Traveler: You won't trip over yourself...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!
Paimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!
Traveler: Aha, so that's what this is all about.
Traveler: Or accidentally step on someone else's foot...
Traveler: You have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.
