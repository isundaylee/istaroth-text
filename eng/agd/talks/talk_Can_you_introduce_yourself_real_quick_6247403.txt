Traveler: Can you introduce yourself real quick?
Fryslan: Hmm, your presence... I'm sure of it. You're a big boss here on business, aren't you?
Fryslan: Nice to meet you! I'm Fryslan, a tea merchant from Mondstadt, and I specialize in affordable tea leaves!
Fryslan: Tea leaves from Yilong Wharf are really popular! Each time I get back to Mondstadt, I sell out within two months!
Fryslan: As such, I'm considering purchasing some high-end tea leaves. That way, the customers get to enjoy them slowly, and I get to improve my profit margins...
Fryslan: Anyway, I'm a regular here. Same seat, same tea!
Fryslan: If you're planning to start a business in Mondstadt, you're welcome to work with me!
