Traveler: A carpentry workshop?
Master Lu: That's right! It began as my grandfather's grandfather's workshop and it's stayed in the family ever since.
Master Lu: Chang the Ninth's residence? The Fanmu Carpenter's built that. The village mill? We built that too!
Master Lu: Even the Qixing come to us when they need some new furniture built to order.
