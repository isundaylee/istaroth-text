Traveler: How's the war going?
Kujou Masahito: As you can see, the conflict is endless. We're in a stalemate. To be honest, if this keeps going on, it's hard to say which side has the upper hand.
Kujou Masahito: While I was thinking about stratagems lately, my mind would often turn to my discussions of government affairs with Kamaji, my younger brother, about whether the policies in Inazuma are really correct or not...
Kujou Masahito: Ah, forget it. There is no use in talking about this. And these matters are none of your concern, anyway. A commoner is better off staying far away from the battlefield.
