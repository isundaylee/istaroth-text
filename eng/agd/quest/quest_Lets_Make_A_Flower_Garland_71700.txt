## Talk 1

Traveler: About Silk Flowers...
Changchang: Huh? Did you see that thing I wrote? Wow, that worked better than I thought...
Changchang: So did you already finish gathering three Silk Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Changchang: Okay... But remember to bring them right back to me as soon as you've got 'em. I'm going to make a pretty garland.

## Talk 2

Changchang: These Silk Flowers should be just the right amount. My garland will be done in no time now!
Changchang: Thank you. Here, these are for you.
Changchang: I know Daddy will just love this pretty garland.
