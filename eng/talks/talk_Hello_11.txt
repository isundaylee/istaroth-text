Traveler: Hello.
Imatani Saburou: You must be an outlander, right? An outlander is a guest here. If you are not in a hurry, why don't you come on in, drink some tea, and take a break?
Imatani Saburou: Konda Village is a very nice place. Its environment is beautiful and quiet. It's a very suitable place to reside.
Imatani Saburou: My wife and I have been living here for decades. I still like this place.
