Nilou: Since we have some rest time, you should make sure to give your body and mind a proper break. Remember the relaxation technique I taught you previously? You know, the one where you blow your sleepiness into a balloon?
Nilou: Huh...? Too much sleepiness for one balloon? Okay fine, you can use mine instead. Come on! Imagine there's a huge balloon in my hands. Take a deep breath, and blow!
Nilou: There you go! See, now doesn't that feel better?
