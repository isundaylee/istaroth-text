# Tianqiu Treasure Trail


## Talk 1

Lan: *sigh* Seems like nobody can get to the bottom of it...
Traveler: The bottom of what?
Lan: The clue! ...Hmm, perhaps "rumor" is a better word... a rumor about treasure.
Lan: There's an adventurer who said that he found a clue to treasure in the vicinity of Tianqiu Valley... But he tried everything, and simply could not locate the treasure.
Lan: In the end, he gave up looking and reported it to the Guild instead, and now the Guild is offering a reward for anyone able to solve this mysterious so-called "clue."
Lan: Any adventurer who wants to give it a go can follow the clue and see where it takes them. If they solve the riddle and find the treasure, the Guild will offer a reward.
Lan: But so far, nobody has found even a trace of the treasure...
Traveler: Can I try?
Lan: Oh, well, if you think you're up to it.
Lan: If you really are interested, there's no harm in giving it a go.
Lan: I'll mark the location mentioned in the clue on the map for you, then you can go take a look.
Traveler: And if I find it...?
Lan: Well, like it says in the adventurer's code, finders keepers!
Lan: All the Guild wants out of it is experience in solving riddles like this. That is the most important thing for adventurers.

## Talk 2

Lan: So, did you find anything?
Traveler: I found this.
Lan: What's this...? I've never seen anything like it, where did you find it?
Traveler: Near Dunyu Ruins...
Lan: Dunyu Ruins? What would such an item be doing there?
Lan: Thank you for getting to the bottom of this for us. As per the adventurers' code, this item is all yours now. Along with your reward, of course.
Lan: I'll arrange for someone to head over to Dunyu Ruins to conduct a more thorough search.
Lan: So strange... The Dunyu Ruins area has been combed countless times... How did we miss this?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Is this a piece of paper? What's written on it? Let's have a look!
Paimon: Huh... seems like this is saying that...
Paimon: We have to look for treasure beneath an especially large tree, in the middle of a path, and... below a flight of stairs...

## Talk 4

Lan: I believe that for adventurers, experience is more important than wealth.
Lan: Don't forget that for most of the problems you encounter when adventuring, money is useless!
