The samurai was about twenty-five years old when they met at the festival
They met again ten years later
And remained friends
They spent time together drinking, traveling, and sparring...
When they had first met, they merely respected each other
But ten years later, they became best friends
After another decade, the samurai had reached the pinnacle of his swordsmanship
And won their duel by a narrow margin
Kamai was so astonished by his defeat
He gave up drinking and began training to become stronger for their next duel
However, another ten years later, Kamai did not meet the samurai
As it turned out, war had broken out in the South, and the samurai had gone to defend the border
Kamai was unconcerned, because ten years was nothing
In a youkai's lifetime
But when they met once again
Kamai discovered that the samurai was already sixty-five years old
He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the samurai's gray hair and scars covering his body
Hey, old friend. Can you still wield the sword?
I'm getting too old to fight
This time, I've come to say goodbye
I see
Then how about one last game of Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)?
Alright
The samurai gave his best effort during the game
But had to quit halfway through because he was too weak
After putting down his hagoita, Kamai remained silent for a long time
Before letting out a long sigh
*sigh* What a shame
