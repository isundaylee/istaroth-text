Traveler: And you are...?
Boyan: Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from Liyue" is the game.
Boyan: Our work's pretty tough, and risk is a constant companion, too. I haven't had a good night's sleep in several days now on account of that tea. Only now have I been able to heave a sigh of relief.
Boyan: *sigh* When will I be able to sit in a teahouse and just enjoy a cup of Chenyu Adeptea?
