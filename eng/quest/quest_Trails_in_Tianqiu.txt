### Additional Talk 1

Ancient Tablet: "At Tianqiu Valley the adepti's ancient trail grows cold, I fall down and weep at the ruins I see. Though defeated is mighty Azhdaha of old, there's no restoring this past land of beauty."

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Ugh... The words on this tablet are really hard to read.
Paimon: So this is a ruin, but it's also an adepti's trail. Which is it?
Paimon: Still, it says here that "At Tianqiu Valley the adepti's ancient trail grows cold." That means we can be sure that the event the stone tablet mentions must have happened at Tianqiu Valley.
Paimon: Guess we've got no choice but to have a look around. Maybe we'll find something.
