Traveler: Need help?
Reza: Thanks for asking, but some of the problems go a long way back and can't be easily changed.
Reza: According to new Sumeru regulations, foreign trading is limited to Port Ormos, but a lot of people have been doing business in the city for a long time...
Reza: It's just too hard to dissuade them from the old way of trading.
Reza: So it's not that we don't want to solve certain issues, but that we just don't know how.
