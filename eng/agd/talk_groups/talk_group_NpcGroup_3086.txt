Hiiragi Chisato: Since Ritou has been selected as the site for the Irodori Festival, the Kanjou Commission must take responsibility for the proceedings.
Hiiragi Chisato: Whether it be receiving the guests or setting the area up, nothing must be left to chance...
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah, yes, and then there's the matter of our guests' safety! We must strengthen our seaside patrols...
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah, I'm sorry, I was so preoccupied with my work, I almost forgot to say hello.
Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, Traveler, it's you. Hello! Do you need anything from me today?

Hiiragi Chisato: Mr. Kamaji...
Hiiragi Chisato: How can I be sure that my letter gets to you...

## Talk

Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, it's you, Traveler.
Hiiragi Chisato: I'm counting on you to deliver the letter to Mr. Kamaji then. Good luck.

## Talk

Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, it's the Traveler. Hello! Do you need anything from me today?

Traveler: How have things been lately?
Hiiragi Chisato: Thanks to you, I'm doing very well.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you for delivering the letter for me earlier! You know, it's very difficult for Kamaji and I to write to each other due to our respective positions.
Hiiragi Chisato: I believe that he must be very busy with the Kujou Clan's affairs. I don't want to bother him too often... Eh? He said that he wanted to visit me personally?
Hiiragi Chisato: Ah... I don't think it would be possible based on the bad blood between our clans. Still... I'm very glad to know that he'd do that for me.
Hiiragi Chisato: If it wasn't for you, we'd probably have been unable to reach out to each other for a long while. I'm most grateful to you.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hiiragi Chisato: Goodbye! Good luck to you.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Hiiragi Clan...
Hiiragi Chisato: My father's matters... I finally know the truth now.
Hiiragi Chisato: So that arrogant-sounding woman is...
Hiiragi Chisato: My elderly father is imprisoned. As his daughter, I am really worried about his condition.
Hiiragi Chisato: But... No matter who he is, as long as one makes a mistake, he must be held accountable for it.
Hiiragi Chisato: As for the outcome, we can only wait for the Almighty Shogun's judgment... Anyway, thank you for your concern.

Traveler: How've you been lately?
Hiiragi Chisato: Things at the estate are far more complicated than I could have anticipated. I haven't quite gotten the hang of it all just yet.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thankfully, everyone's been quite willing to listen to my suggestions, so I can start from the simplest matters and slowly sort everything out from there.
Hiiragi Chisato: The more I do this, the more I realize that these things are as urgent as they are laden with great meaning... and only I can do them.
Hiiragi Chisato: I'm glad we didn't end up sinking even deeper into the mire back there.

## Talk

Traveler: Keep it up!
Hiiragi Chisato: It's thanks to you and the Yashiro Commissioner. I won't let your goodwill go to waste.
Hiiragi Chisato: I've prepared a small gift for you. It's a small trinket that you can wear around. If you don't mind, please accept it.

## Talk

Traveler: What happened to the addendum to the announcement?
Hiiragi Chisato: The Matsuura Clan have already sent someone to handle that. Currently, everyone thinks that it was all a big misunderstanding.
Hiiragi Chisato: There are still some ill-favored rumors going about, but I believe that they will disappear given time.
Hiiragi Chisato: I will keep a close eye on that. Hopefully, nothing similar happens in the future.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about the wedding...
Hiiragi Chisato: Kamaji and I talked it over afterward. He was very supportive of my current course of action.
Hiiragi Chisato: "I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes," he promised me. I must say that I was greatly relieved to hear that.
Hiiragi Chisato: The ceremonial matters may have been pushed back, yes, but I believe that our hearts grew closer together. That is of great comfort to me.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Hiiragi Chisato: Goodbye! Good luck to you as well.

## Talk

Traveler: It's nothing worth mentioning.
Hiiragi Chisato: You don't have to be polite. Who knows... Maybe I'll need your help in the future.
Hiiragi Chisato: I've prepared a small gift for you. It's a trinket you can wear around. If you don't mind, please accept it.
