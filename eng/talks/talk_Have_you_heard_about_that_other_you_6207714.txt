Traveler: Have you heard about that other "you"?
Atsuko: Oh? You mean the one who was staying with my parents at one point?
Atsuko: Um, how should I put it... It's such a strange story...
Atsuko: That said, I'd love to meet "her" if I have the chance.
Atsuko: Who knows, "she" might be able to help me out a bit.
