Traveler: Please take care of yourself.
Grandpa Lu: Don't worry about me. I'm doing great. I can probably stir-fry tea leaves for another ten years, at least.
Grandpa Lu: But you... Always working, rushing from one place to another. Do you even have time to drink water? Let alone tea...
Grandpa Lu: The way I see it, you young people should be working hard, but not at the cost of your health.
Grandpa Lu: Come see me in the village whenever you're free. I've got several compressed teabricks that have been aging for decades, and I haven't sold them, no matter what price was offered. When you come back next time, we'll drink from that stash! How about that?
