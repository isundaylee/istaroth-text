# Yachimatahime's Trial


## Talk 1

Eki: I am Eki of the Jibashiri. Hero of Sangonomiya, I acknowledge that you are worthy to take on this challenge.
Eki: I am in charge of the trial of "insight." Go forth and solve all the puzzles to return the Flames of the High Gate to their respective places.
Eki: The battlefield is ever-changing. Only by keeping your eyes and ears wide open at all times may you grasp the situation and master all these variables.

## Talk 2

Eki: Have you completed the challenge, hero of Sangonomiya?
Eki: Use your insight and find all the Flames of the High Gate!

## Talk 3

Eki: Impressive. You cleared that trial with ease. I, Eki of the Jibashiri, acknowledge your great valor.
Eki: Your insight can be said to be sufficient to seek out an eel in the winter.
Paimon: And what's that supposed to mean, huh?
Eki: Breeding season unagi fry are very, very small. You must exert the greatest visual acuity to see them.

## Talk 4

Eki: I am Eki of the Jibashiri. If you are here on unimportant affairs, depart from this place.
