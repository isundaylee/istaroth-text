# They Call Him Raptor


## Talk 1

Amber: This is Springvale. There must be some clues about Raptor 'round here.
Amber: The Sister from the Cathedral put some secret Anemo markings on the artifact he took.
Paimon: Use your <color=#00E1FFFF>Elemental Sight</color> and keep your eyes peeled for clues.

## Talk 2

Amber: Hmm... a strip of cloth with Anemo markings on.
Amber: Looking at the design and the way it's woven, there's a good chance it came from a wind glider.
Paimon: Wow, Outriders have to be textile experts now!? It's a harder job than Paimon thought.
Amber: If this really belongs to Raptor, it must mean his wind glider is broken.
Amber: It appears that the elemental markings point this way.
Paimon: Huh. Well... D'you think he ran off ahead?
Amber: There's only one way to find out!
Amber: #C'mon {NICKNAME}, we should keep following the markings.
Paimon: Ooh, what's that? Looks like something's going on up ahead...
Amber: It sounds like there's a battle going on — could that be Raptor?
Amber: Quick, let's keep going!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hmm... How do we know if this was left by Raptor or an Anemo Slime?
Amber: Anemo Slimes are airborne creatures. They don't leave marks on the ground, unless someone stomped on one to take-off.
Paimon: Wait... Are you telling me people actually do that?
Amber: Either way, let's make a mental note of these markings. They're very clear.
Amber: It appears that the elemental markings point this way.
Paimon: Huh. Well... D'you think he ran off ahead?
Amber: There's only one way to find out!
Amber: #C'mon {NICKNAME}, we should keep following the markings.
Paimon: Ooh, what's that? Looks like something's going on up ahead...
Amber: It sounds like there's a battle going on — could that be Raptor?
Amber: Quick, let's keep going!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, look where we are...
Traveler: There are no more elemental markings ahead.
Amber: The elemental power on the artifact must have worn off.
Amber: Raptor must have realized the markings would give away his position, and sent his minions to slow us down.
Amber: That way, when the effect wears off, he can make his escape.
Amber: He won't get away with this! After him!

### Additional Talk 1

Farrah: Thank goodness, the Knights of Favonius have arrived! The hilichurls won't dare pursue me any longer...
Amber: What happened?
Farrah: I can't believe it but... the hilichurls attacked our carts. Luckily I outran them.
Amber: Hilichurls? But I thought the Knights of Favonius had cleared out most of the hilichurl camps around these parts?
Farrah: It's a small camp not too far from the village. The route I take on my delivery runs ensures I steer clear of it.
Farrah: But today... some crazy fellow suddenly fell out of the sky and landed right in the camp!
Paimon: Hmm... Now who does that remind me of...
Farrah: It really riled them up. They chased the funny-looking fellow as he fled, which brought them out into the open.
Farrah: I managed to get away, but they smashed my fruit carts to smithereens. I don't know what I'm gonna do when the merchant caravan gets here tomorrow—
Amber: ...Funny-looking? In what way?
Farrah: He was holding onto something. Must've been heavy, because he couldn't glide in a straight line to save his life... Maybe that's why he fell.
Farrah: Honestly, people like that shouldn't be allowed in the skies. It doesn't take a genius to know you're not supposed to carry heavy objects while gliding! I'm gonna report that idiot and make sure he gets his license revoked!
Amber: Heavy object... The artifact? This could well be our guy.
Amber: Tell me, did you see which way he went?
Farrah: I managed to catch a glimpse as I ran from the hilichurls. I think he went... that way.
Amber: #Seems like a strong lead. {NICKNAME}, on with the chase!
Amber: Oh, and don't worry — as soon as I get back I'll tell the Knights to mop up the rest of the hilichurls as soon as possible.

Farrah: If you're quick, you might be able to catch up with those weirdos.
