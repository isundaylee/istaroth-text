# Talk Dialog

Charlotte: Weird... Why can't I find any clues?
Traveler: Charlotte, this gift envelope is—
Charlotte: Huh? OH! Great Hero of Liyue! Perfect timing!
Charlotte: C'mon, I have so much to ask you! Don't worry — completely off the record...
Traveler: I—I'm just here to give you a gift envelope!
Charlotte: Ah, thank you for this — it's beautiful. Now, onto the real business at hand.
Charlotte: You know about the ritual Lady Tianquan conducted, right?
Charlotte: I've asked around, and everyone says it's one of this land's traditional ceremonies. But, I also heard it hasn't been performed in a long time.
Charlotte: Not to mention, as the ritual was starting, I saw a flock of birds scatter in the mountains near the harbor, and a strange light coming from the forest...
Traveler: How did you see that?
Charlotte: Ah, it's all thanks to my Kamera. I bought an ultra-telephoto lens not too long ago — definitely came in handy just now!
Charlotte: Unfortunately, it was super dark, so the photos are too blurry to make out anything...
Charlotte: #That's why I was hoping you could fill me in, Traveler. Is there anything you can tell me? Doesn't have to be right now — you can write me a letter if you remember something...
Charlotte: Here, take this. Think of it as... an advance.
Charlotte: I'll treat you to a meal back in Fontaine, too! How does that sound?
Traveler: Did you walk over there?
Traveler: D—Don't smile at me like that!
Traveler: Yeah. I'll, ah, see you around, I guess?
Charlotte: Bye! I'm going to ask around some more...
