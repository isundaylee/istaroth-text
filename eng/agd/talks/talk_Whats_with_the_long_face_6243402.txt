Traveler: What's with the long face?
Huixing: I'm the crew's navigator. Determining our heading and course is my charge, as is drawing up nautical charts.
Huixing: Our previous navigator was getting on in years, so I came to take his spot.
Huixing: He loved employing some unique symbols to mark his nautical maps, but he never bothered to explain the meaning behind them...
Huixing: ...But I suppose that might be a quirk endemic to navigators.
Huixing: I mean, it's quick and easy, if troublesome for anyone else.
