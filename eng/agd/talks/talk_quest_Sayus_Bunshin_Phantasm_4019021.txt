Traveler: Sayu's "Bunshin Phantasm"...
Yae Miko: Bunshin, huh... I'm not surprised she's interested in learning that ninjutsu. I suppose I could find an opportunity to teach her...
Paimon: Wait, you know how to make bunshin!?
Yae Miko: Well, if it's conjuring a body double to sit at the shrine in my place, that's child's play. I'm sure plenty of youkai can do the same.
Yae Miko: Ah, but best not let Nana find out... Pretend I didn't say anything, okay?
