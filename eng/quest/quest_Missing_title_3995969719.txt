# Missing title (3995969719)

Paimon: Hm... Paimon wonders what sort of treasure we'll find here.
Black Screen Text: The shelves are full of thin books. You browse through them, and find that they seem to be hospital documents such as medical records or financial statements.
You shut the door in disappointment.
Paimon: Paimon thought there would be some special treasure inside... Even the wooden barrels and crates we find on our adventures are better than this! At least those had cabbage or fowl inside...
Paimon: Eh? What's this? It looks like it fell out from over here...
Paimon: Let Paimon see... Maybe it'll lead us to treasure!
Paimon: Uhh... Eleazar is so scary...
Paimon: Hmm, what does the other document say...?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon didn't understand a thing!
Paimon: I didn't get it either...
Paimon: Paimon only understood the part that goes "God's voice guides me"... Does that mean there'll be unique voices guiding us here?
Traveler: It could be underground water flow or creature activity...
Paimon: Yeah! Who knows, there might be some underground ruins! Let's listen for any sounds and take a closer look when we hear something!
Traveler: Ignorance might be bliss here, to be honest...
Paimon: Eh? You understood it? Paimon only got the bit that goes "God's voice guides me"... Does that mean there'll be unique voices guiding us here?
