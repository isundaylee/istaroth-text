# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Aloy: Sure. Something new to share with me?
Aloy: You know, I've heard a lot of stories about you since arriving in this world.
Aloy: For example, the time that you helped the knights from Mondstadt to defeat a dragon.
Aloy: And the time that you teamed up with the adepti in Liyue to defeat an ancient god from the ocean.
Aloy: Gods and dragons... Can't believe they really exist here.
Aloy: But whatever the crisis may be, you always step forward and join up with those who want to fight back, don't you?
Aloy: It's because of people like you that both cities were able to survive and prevail.
Traveler: I only made a small contribution...
Aloy: If that's what you call a small contribution, I think it might take saving the whole world to count as a major one.
Aloy: Seriously, though, if the world ever does need saving, bring me with you.
Aloy: I've saved a world once before. I might be able to give you some pointers.
Traveler: Like "Never save the world on an empty stomach"?
Aloy: Ha, yeah, that's right. Trying to save the world when you can't stop thinking about food is pretty tough... The end of the world deserves your full, undivided attention.
Aloy: Seriously, though. Trying to save the world is exhausting, especially when you're not even sure who's trying to end it.
Aloy: The worst part is, once you find out who's responsible, they're always so full of themselves, making out like you're the one in the wrong.
Aloy: You can't reason with them. It always comes down to a fight. I guess that's just the way it is.
Traveler: Like "There's strength in numbers"?
Aloy: Maybe. But sometimes you need to take the world on your shoulders in order to save it.
