# The Ancient Azure Stars


## Talk 1

Fischl: Huh, we've returned here once more.
Paimon: Looks like the story's not finished yet. Let the adventure continue!

## Talk 2

Mona: I understand the governing laws of the universe, and have glimpsed secrets between heaven and earth. Observing it is enough for me, there's no need to force it to change.

## Talk 3

Fischl: What a magnificent view...
Oz: Lady Megistus, I believe this is the firmest evidence yet of your immense genius. You truly are the greatest archmage in the history of the Immernachtreich.
Mona: Thank you, although the Immernachtreich really doesn't have that much of a history...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Stars like diamonds, and the moon like a pearl. This is the most brilliant night sky I have ever beheld.
Xinyan: It's beautiful...
Xinyan: To call up such a mirage, Mona must have a vast and boundless sea of stars in her heart.
Mona: ...
Traveler: Mona, what's the matter?
Mona: ...I'm just thinking, these must be the things that we aspire to.
Mona: This night sky is incredibly beautiful. In fact, I might go so far as to say it's even more beautiful than what I usually see in divinations.
Mona: All the stars are in their rightful place.
Mona: ...This is definitely my mirage. Only here can I see extraordinary sights like these.
Paimon: Extraordinary? Why do you say that?
Mona: You know, the night sky of Teyvat is truly marvelous. All the answers in the world seem to have been hidden within.
Mona: "When is my missing son going to be found?"
Mona: "Do they love me or not?"
Mona: "Will I ever recover?"
Mona: As your stars move across the sky, they record all your life events in their path. And among all the people in the world, a considerable number will see their stars deviate from their path.
Mona: When your stars are on track, it means you will be healthy, happy, and at peace.
Mona: Conversely, if your stars go off track, everything will get worse.
Mona: The starry sky in my divinations would never look as perfect as this. Some stars would lose their way, and others would fall...
Mona: ...I wish everyone could be happy, and stay on track.
Mona: To this end, I offer advice and tell the truth.
Mona: I know it's useless. All fates are already revealed in the night sky, with mine, too, just another among them. I can't change anything.
Mona: Even so... outside of astrology, outside of the words of truth, I still cling to the wisp of an irrational fantasy.
Mona: We must all live within the confines of reality, but... call me presumptuous, but I still believe in miracles.
Mona: In this vast sea of stars, there are stars for you, for me, for everybody.
Mona: What are the chances of one star encountering another? Are these encounters not the most wonderful miracles in all of destiny? ...I don't know.
Mona: But within Teyvat, the stars in the sky will always have a place for us. Even if astrology is resolutely rational, fate remains arbitrary, cruel, but romantic.
Mona: ...
Traveler: Mona, you seem to have been deep in thought...
Traveler: Have you found the answer?
Mona: ...I think I have figured out what those stars are hiding.
Mona: "Now, I will seize my own destiny."

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're back here again. So... Are we completely out of the mirage?
Mona: How strange...
Mona: My mirage didn't contain any hints on the Fatui or the machine... Does that mean they had nothing to do with these mirages after all?
Mona: Or perhaps these mirages are a mere consequence, and not part of a process at all?
Paimon: Umm, Paimon's lost...
Mona: I mean, these mirages were not steps towards solving the mystery, but rather a direct effect of whatever is going on.
Mona: Someone did something to bring the mirages into being. As they were just passive side products, it was natural that they couldn't provide us with any useful information.
Xinyan: In other words, those mirages were only about ourselves.
Fischl: Hmm, pure materializations of ourselves... Interesting.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, maybe we should go back to where this whole thing began.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #During our first day on the island, Traveler and I checked out the Fatui camp together. We found a strange machine there, as well as some disoriented Fatui.
Traveler: This is correct.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The researcher who spoke to us claimed that the machine was just a Fatui industrial invention. He even promised to not disturb us.
Paimon: Right right, and the cappy-cap guy looked half asleep the entire time. He kept talking nonsense!
Kaedehara Kazuha: I wonder, is it possible that "madness" and "mirages" are two different outcomes of the machine's influence?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If so, everything can be traced back to that damaged machine — except for the difference in how it affects people. This, I believe, is caused by differences between the affected people themselves.
Mona: ...!
Mona: When you put it that way... it is indeed difficult to distinguish dreams and hallucinations.
Mona: So what you're saying is, the device affected us differently because we are different from the Fatui?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, and according to our observations over these past few days, I think... the difference is that we all have stronger willpower.
Xinyan: ...Yeah, I can get behind that.
Xinyan: People with strong willpower will hallucinate instead of falling into madness, but those who break too easily can't maintain a stable mirage.
Paimon: In other words, we should go back to the Fatui camp and destroy that machine right away.
Fischl: No, it should be repaired, rather than destroyed.
Oz: What mein Fräulein means is that rashly destroying a machine we do not understand may lead to more serious consequences. It would be better to find a way to repair it first.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Right, it pays to be cautious.
Mona: If my guess is correct, that machine is capable of influencing the human brain. So we'd better tread carefully.
Paimon: So let's go now! There's no time to waste!
