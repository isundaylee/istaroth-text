Traveler: Who is the watcher of the maze?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: It's said that when you reach *75* sacrificed souls, the watcher of the maze will wake from a deep sleep and appear at a *random place* somewhere in the maze. Killing it will get you a whole load of souls â€” enough to open the treasure trove. But it's a very powerful monster, so make sure you *leave yourself enough time to battle it*!
