Traveler: You are...
Moyan: I'm Moyan, the village accountant. I sometimes also help the others with odd jobs here and there.
Moyan: Our merchants often pass through here, and I ask after their businesses every day.

Traveler: About Qiaoying Village...
Moyan: We're already within Qiaoying Village's borders. Welcome to the home of Liyue's most famous tea!
Moyan: Qiaoying Village is not as bustling as Yilong Wharf, but a quieter, more relaxed place has value all its own.
Moyan: If you like tea, please give our Sunglo Tea and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea a try. You'll love them!

Traveler: Sounds really tough...
Moyan: Thank you for asking!
Moyan: My job's not that difficult, especially when compared to taking care of tea trees, drying tea, and stirring them in a hot pan. After all, tea is our most important commodity.
Moyan: The tea farmers get up while it's still dark and work year-round to make sure that people everywhere get to enjoy it at a fair price.
Moyan: I've never heard them complaining about their work, either.
Moyan: They love tea, and they make the most out of their days. That must have rubbed off on me, I guess, 'cause I'm pretty proactive myself.

Traveler: How are things lately?
Moyan: It's a long story...
Moyan: For some reason, the first harvest this year is yellower than usual, and didn't fetch a good price.
Moyan: Most of the villagers live off of the money we make growing tea, so we need to figure out what happened as soon as possible.

Traveler: About your income...
Moyan: It's not all stormy clouds. The first harvest wasn't great, but the second was better.
Moyan: When you grow things, you're bound to have a bad year here and there. I just hope next year will be better.
