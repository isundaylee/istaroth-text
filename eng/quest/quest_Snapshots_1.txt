# Snapshots


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the Kamera...
Xu: Have you managed to deliver the pictures?
Traveler: Done deal.
Xu: Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry for troubling you, but we're barely keeping our heads above the water here...
Xu: Ah, yes. Please take this Kamera as thanks for your help.
Traveler: I couldn't...
Xu: It's no problem. I mean, you did help us, didn't you?
Xu: This is not an exceedingly expensive object, either. It's just a sample that our partners in Fontaine gave us.
Xu: There are some differences between it and the official model... but the basic functions are all there. It'll definitely be enough for your needs.
Xu: And if you take a liking to it, you can also help us with some advertising here and there...
Xu: Ahem... Regardless, thanks for your help, and please, take this Kamera with you.
Traveler: This must be very expensive...
