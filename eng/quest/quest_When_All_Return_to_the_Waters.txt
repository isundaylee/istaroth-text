# When All Return to the Waters


## Talk 1

Paimon: Let's see what's written here... Nothing escapes Detective Paimon's eyes!
Paimon: Hmm, Callas... Navia's father! This seems to be an investigation report on him.
Traveler: It's probably related to his and Jacques' case.
Paimon: Mhm... hmm... Yep, it's about finding someone to assassinate Jacques and Callas, because of a lack of confidence that Jacques himself would go through with it...
Paimon: This should prove the existence of the "third person," right?
Traveler: Is there anything else?
Paimon: Hmm... "We have still not determined the exact content of the key information Callas has passed on to certain members of his organization."
Paimon: "The old dog's a real menace to deal with. Even if he abides by the promise he's made to us, he will still have the upper hand."
Paimon: "He can act whenever he wants to make our lives miserable. The only option left is to remove him from the picture entirely."
Paimon: "I concur. Let's send someone to kill him. He won't declare war as long as we don't touch Navia."
Paimon: Seems like we've got a bunch of correspondence between the higher-ups...
Traveler: They planned this well in advance.
Paimon: *sigh* They're all just so evil...

## Talk 2

Navia: (Something's not right... Let me think for a little while longer.)

## Talk 3

Traveler: (This isn't it... Better keep looking.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Finally found it... So this is the entrance that leads to the Sinthe production base... It sure doesn't seem out of the ordinary at all...
Traveler: Well, they don't want it to stand out.
Paimon: Ah, you're right... An important place like this is bound to have a ton of protective measures and mechanisms.
Paimon: Navia's probably arguing up a storm right now to stall for us...
Traveler: Yes, but I'm sure what we find inside will be "extraordinary."

## Talk 5

Neuvillette: It would appear that I must repeat my question again, Mr. Tartaglia.
Neuvillette: Do you accept the charge that you are the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case?
Childe: To be perfectly honest, I don't understand your country's complicated court system, or the reason why I'm being charged with something I've never even heard of.
Childe: However, I did hear that people who have been charged can choose to participate in a duel to clear their name. Is that right?
Childe: In which case, as long as I accept the charge, I can have an all-out fight with that Champion Duelist Clorinde, right?
Childe: I've gotta admit, that's one of the most enticing offers I've ever received.
Childe: When I privately sparred with her last time, she was obviously holding back... Real disappointing.
Furina: Hey, don't you understand? You're currently the prime suspect for a major case! This isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
Childe: Ooh? Sounds like the Hydro Archon wants to lecture me on the ways of the opera house...
Childe: Then why don't you duel me, too? I'm the kind of student that learns best in the heat of battle.
Furina: A—Ah, no no no, that's not what I meant...
Neuvillette: Alas, it would appear that communication with the defendant is going poorly, and we have made very little progress.
Neuvillette: In that case, let me explain everything from the very beginning again. The goal of this trial is to determine the culprit behind the serial disappearances case...
Navia: That case had nothing to do with him! You've got the wrong man!
Confident Audience Member: Huh!? What's going on?
Doubtful Audience Member: Why is she interjecting again?
Contemplative Audience Member: Hah, I told you it couldn't be one of the Fatui Harbingers!
Neuvillette: Miss Navia, this is the second time you've interrupted the court proceedings. I only tolerated your behavior last time because you were able to provide the court with a key eyewitness.
Neuvillette: But that was an exception rather than standard court protocol. I can very well charge you with contempt of court for your interjections.
Navia: Please, did you ever think I had any respect for this place's pointless theatrics?
Navia: We can put that discussion aside for now, I'm not here to argue with you. I'm here to charge the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case.
Navia: And if my charges prove true, then Tartaglia here will be proven innocent by default, correct?
Childe: Oh? A young lady has charged in and offered to clear my name, how fascinating. Well, I'd gotten half bored to death by all these rules and procedures anyway, so I'll take you up on that offer.
Childe: So, Your Honor, is there nothing else for me to do now?
Neuvillette: You may take a seat for now in the audience, but that doesn't mean the suspicions against you have been lifted.
Neuvillette: Now then, Miss Navia, who is the person you would like to charge instead?
Navia: That person is...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Whoa, there's so much Sinthe here! And so many bottles of ingredients that probably just contain the Waters of the Primordial Sea...
Traveler: There are so many...
Paimon: Hmm... "Mixing-in-Progress" ... "Ready-To-Drink" ... "Stock Sample" ... Huh, they've also got all the Sinthe pretty clearly labeled.
Paimon: Whoa, there's even fruit-flavored Sinthe!?
Traveler: Well, that definitely proves that this is where they produce Sinthe.
Paimon: Yep, it's super obvious!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Phew... After all that, we finally made it to the innermost sanctum.
Paimon: Though as expected, the mastermind isn't here...
Traveler: If I'm not mistaken...
Paimon: Ah, that's right! Then let's hurry up and find some evidence so we can get back to the Opera House and help Navia!
Traveler: He's being charged by Navia as we speak.

## Talk 8

Paimon: We've looked at almost everything here, and it seems like our theories were spot on! But...
Traveler: Who really is this "Vacher"...?
Paimon: Yeah, we haven't found anything that reveals his true identity...
Paimon: No wonder even Neuvillette wasn't able to find anything... Whoever it is probably destroyed everything to do with that name a long time ago...
Paimon: That way, even if we bring all of this back to the Opera, we won't be able to identify the true culprit.
Traveler: Clever...
Paimon: Sure thing! Paimon won't admit defeat to this guy either!
Traveler: But maybe not clever enough. Let's look again.

## Talk 9

Paimon: You take that side, and Paimon will take this side. Check everything carefully! We'll find something for sure!
Black Screen Text: After some time...
Paimon: Ugh, nothing at all! And Paimon can't even find snacks either!
Traveler: Paimon, I found it.
Paimon: Woah, really? Let Paimon see!
Paimon: "Vigneire"... Isn't that Vacher's lover's name?
Paimon: Then, you found her diary? Let's see...
Paimon: Aw, it's just a normal diary chronicling their love story. She was so sweet too, Paimon feels even worse for her now...
Traveler: Take a look at this page.
Paimon: So many... A whole page's worth! But they're all crossed out. Was she unhappy with all of them?
Paimon: The final name she decided on was...
Paimon: "Marcel"!?
Paimon: Wait, but Marcel's pretty old... Has this case been going on for so long that he's Vacher and Vigneire's grown son?
Traveler: I've figured it out.
Paimon: H—Hey! Paimon still hasn't figured it out yet!
Traveler: Let's go, Paimon.
Traveler: She made a list of baby names.

## Talk 10

Navia: And whose image do you see, Marcel?
Navia: Is it a man named "Vacher"?
Marcel: ...!?
Navia: Oh? So you do know that name.
Marcel: I'm merely surprised you'd suddenly say the name of someone I've never even heard of.
Navia: I was waiting for you to say that.
Paimon: Naviaaaa! We're baaaack!
Navia: As expected of my partner! I just knew you'd return in the nick of time!
Neuvillette: Just how often do you intend to flout the rules of this court...
Furina: It's alright, Monsieur Neuvillette. Given their confidence, I expect they've found the crucial evidence.
Traveler: You say you've never heard of Vacher...

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey, Monsieur Neuvillette, what's going on? Shouldn't he have been cleared already?
Neuvillette: Apologies, this is also the first time I've encountered such a situation. However, according to the rules established at the conception of Fontaine's court system, the Oratrice's judgment is the final verdict of the court.
Neuvillette: All I do is follow court procedure. As for why the Oratrice arrived at the conclusion it did, you should probably ask someone more knowledgeable than me.
Traveler: If even the Chief Justice doesn't know...
Furina: Ah... Wh—Why are you looking at me? I had nothing to do with it...
Furina: I—I don't know what happened there, either... H—Hey, stop staring at me...
Confident Audience Member: ...What does Lady Furina mean by that?
Contemplative Audience Member: She says she has no idea either? But that's impossible... Didn't she create the Oratrice herself?
Doubtful Audience Member: ...Yeah, so are the verdicts reliable or not? Can results like this really be called justice?
Furina: ...
Furina: Ahem... My dearest citizens, did you really think we'd allow an incorrect verdict to be handed out in this court? Did you really believe that the judgment could be mistaken, or be the result of some sort of random mishap?
Furina: Don't tell me... you thought even I had been blindsided by the Oratrice's result?
Paimon: Hmm... But the way she looked just now, it was pretty obvious she had no idea what was going on...
Furina: However, given the state of things, I shall give you an explanation. Everything that just took place — including my supposed shock and bafflement — was a part of an elaborate performance, with every action meant to stir up drama and excitement.
Furina: And of course, for every performance, there is a script. Everything has unfolded exactly as I expected from the very beginning. As the embodiment of the very concept of justice, the Oratrice shall never render an arbitrary judgment!
Furina: If you thought Childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence...
Furina: Everything he's done, not to mention the danger he poses, are beyond ordinary comprehension and completely unforgivable!
Furina: All shall be revealed in time! You will come to understand my noble intentions, as well as the absolute correctness of the Oratrice's verdict. Hahahaha...
Furina: ...Now, having said that, although I hate to leave things hanging in suspense, it is now time for this performance to end. As the lead actress, I shall be the first to take my leave. Toodle-oo~
Neuvillette: ...So she chose to make her escape after all, did she.
Paimon: Er... So you're saying we shouldn't put much stock in what she just said?
Neuvillette: Mm, she probably just put on that performance to save face. As for the truth, it's unlikely that she actually has any idea.
Traveler: Way to pull the rug out from under her...
Neuvillette: However, please be assured that I will continue to investigate this case in a personal capacity. Just as I promised, if the judgment has been incorrect, we will do our utmost to clear his name.
Paimon: Alright... Even though we feel pretty badly for him, we'll take your word for it for now.
Paimon: After all, he's done plenty of bad stuff, so he should have known he'd go to prison someday, right?
Traveler: ...Then we have no choice but to ask the Archon herself.

## Talk 12

Esmond: Hey, what are you doing!? Quick, stop him!
Marcel: #{NICKNAME}! Hey! {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Ahh! Marcel, what are you doing over here?
Esmond: Stop resisting arrest! Cease, or we'll add another charge to the list!
Marcel: #No, no, wait! I just wanted to ask {NICKNAME} something... I'm not looking to run away, please, please just let me ask this one small thing...
Neuvillette: ...Go on.
Marcel: Thank you... Thank you...
Marcel: I was being led away when I finally realized something... Where did you first hear the name "Vacher"?
Marcel: I erased all records of that name... So... Unless...
Esmond: Are you still trying to prove your innocence? Give it up, you've already been convicted.
Traveler: Yes...
Marcel: A—Ah... Really? You, you did? You're sure? You met her... But how could that be, how did you manage to do it!?
Traveler: It was around the Fountain of Lucine...
Marcel: The Fountain of Lucine!? Then... Then she's been so close to me all along!? And I just never...
Marcel: #Please, please give me a chance to talk to her again, just let {NICKNAME} take me to the Fountain to see her one last time... This is the last request I'll ever make in my life, you can do whatever you want to me afterwards, I don't care...
Esmond: What, give you an inch, and you wanna take a mile? Do you think serial killers get to make requests like that?
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon agrees! Why should we give him what he wants when he's only done a ton of super terrible things?
Neuvillette: This request, is it worth as much to you as your life?
Marcel: Of course! Wait, no, it's worth even more than my life...
Neuvillette: Humans... will they betray the instinct to live just to satisfy spiritual needs...?
Neuvillette: Very well, I will grant your request.
Esmond: Your Honor, I fear that...
Neuvillette: I will go with him. You do not need to worry about any escape.
Esmond: Ah... In that case, I shall leave him in your most capable hands, Chief Justice.
Marcel: Thank you... Thank you, Your Honor...
Traveler: Something to do with my sensitivity to the Hydro element...
Traveler: I met "her."

## Talk 13

Marcel: Is this the place...? You said she's here, but what do I need to do to see her?
Traveler: Back then, I drank Water from the Primordial Sea...
Paimon: Yeah, and even Paimon could hear her after drinking that thing! Didn't you just drink a lot of it on the stage as well? In that case...
Oceanid?: "Vacher..."
Marcel: !!!
Paimon: Yes, that's it! So you heard it too!
Marcel: Vigneire, it's me! It's me, Vacher!
Oceanid?: "Vacher... Vacher..."
Marcel: I'm here, I'm here... Where are you, Vigneire? I'm coming for you, I'm finally here for you...
Paimon: Hey, wait, be careful, hey, waaaaait!
Traveler: It heightened my sensitivity to the Hydro element...

## Talk 14

Marcel: Vigneire... Is that you? It's me, Vacher... Vigneire...!
Oceanid?: Vacher... Why did you come... Didn't I say... You don't need to look for me...
Oceanid?: You... You look a lot older than I remember... How long has it been?
Marcel: It's been... More than twenty years. I've suffered for over twenty years since the day you left...
Marcel: All this time, only the thought of bringing you back has kept me alive... Nothing else mattered to me...
Marcel: Ah, I must be dreaming... Who would have thought I'd get the chance to tell you all of my feelings like this...
Marcel: Vigneire... You are my everything... I really don't know... how I could live without you...
Oceanid?: But Vacher... If you ask me, this world would be better off without you.
Marcel: Wh—What are you saying?
Oceanid?: If not for you, I would have finished my law degree, and probably become a top-tier attorney one day...
Oceanid?: If not for you, I would have continued to pursue my love of the arts, and my works would have been displayed in the Palais Mermonia itself...
Oceanid?: If not for you... I would at least have been able to take care of my mother, and she would not have grown old and died alone, with nothing but the tears on her cheeks...
Oceanid?: It's all because of your selfishness, Vacher, it's all because of you!
Marcel: You... Wait, you are not Vigneire... Who are you!?
Oceanid?: You're right, I'm not Vigneire... I am... the "sacrifices."
Oceanid?: Every woman who died by your hand... as our bodies dissolved, our consciousnesses flowed back to the Primordial Sea.
Oceanid?: Our thoughts circulated endlessly within the Primordial Sea, and we were no longer individuals, but we became one, just as streams of water come together in the sea.
Oceanid?: I'm Crecy, I'm Lemonie, I'm Aisine...
Oceanid?: The only one I am not... is Vigneire.
Marcel: Why... But then, where is Vigneire!?
Oceanid?: She doesn't want to see you anymore... Every tendril of her consciousness is avoiding you.
Oceanid?: This is what you get for your selfishness! Your selfishness robbed us of our lives and our futures. You said time and time again that you'd do any and everything for her...
Oceanid?: But did you ever consider whether she'd want to see you do the things that you did? If she would despise you for what you became?
Marcel: I... I...
Oceanid?: You are a liar, a heartless murderer, and a cowardly narcissist.
Oceanid?: The only thing you're not... is Vigneire's beloved.
Oceanid?: From the moment your first victim died, and her consciousness merged with Vigneire's, she has had nothing but pure hatred for you.
Traveler: (It looks like I didn't meet Vigneire back then either... They must have wanted me to lure Marcel here from the very beginning...)
Marcel: No... Vigneire, she can't hate me... Let me see her, please, have mercy...
Oceanid?: You still don't understand? When I said, don't look for me... That came from the real Vigneire, she really doesn't want to see you anymore...
Oceanid?: But on top of that, she also said that because... it's her final drop of pity for you.
Oceanid?: She said that because she knew... That if you did come here, "we"... will show no mercy to you...
Oceanid?: "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"...
Oceanid?: "Drown."
Marcel: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh—
Black Screen Text: Later, the Gardes find that the culprit of the serial disappearances of young women case, Marcel, appeared to have lost his soul.
However, the final report from the physicians states that he died of a massive fright.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Finally, we have some time to do shopping! Gosh, it's really been a long time since we've been able to relax...
Traveler: Shopping is stressful in its own way, though.
Navia: Well met, partner! I knew something great was going to happen when I woke up in such a good mood today.
Melus: Even this weather can't put a damper on the Demoiselle's mood.
Silver: It's a pleasure to see you both again.
Paimon: Oh, hey, Navia! It's been a few days, Paimon's already started to miss you!
Navia: Oho, now that I believe! I'm easy to work with, and always bring home the bacon; who wouldn't treasure having a partner like me?
Paimon: Haha, sounds like you're really enjoying life these days, Navia! What have you been busy with since the trial?
Navia: Ugh, it's just been one thing after the other. I've been making non-stop trips between Poisson and the Court since then...
Navia: Everyone from Spina di Rosula organized a memorial for my father. We never held a memorial when he first died, since everyone knew that even if we held one back then, no one was going to come.
Navia: This time, though, everyone in Poisson and even many people from the Court all attended.
Paimon: Ah, so his name's definitely been cleared now! That's what we like to hear!
Melus: It's been the dearest wish of Demoiselle all along.
Navia: Hahaha... that blasted stubborn fool, I was right to put my faith in him. I'm so glad I didn't give up on the case all those years ago...
Traveler: Things turned out as well as they could have.
Navia: Oh, by the way... I ran into Charlotte just after I left the memorial service.
Navia: Well, maybe it'd be more accurate to say that I knew that she would be there, and there was no way she'd just let me go...
Paimon: Eh!? So you know Charlotte too? The Charlotte... journalist from The Steambird?
Navia: Yeah, way back when I first became the president of the Spina di Rosula, she was all over me, wouldn't take no for an answer...
Navia: I believe the story was called "The True Heart of Darkness: Secret Tales of the Yellow Rose."
Navia: To be fair, though, it was a really flattering feature, hahaha... So we've been on pretty good terms ever since.
Navia: She was trying to lean on our friendship to get me to do an exclusive piece on the serial disappearances case.
Paimon: Oh, yeah, she told us about that... She's always been super interested in that case, so now, her wish has finally come true too!
Navia: Anyway, I told her to make sure that when she writes about you guys entering the Opera House with the critical evidence that you both sound really cool.
Paimon: Hehe, now that's another thing to look forward to! We trust Charlotte's skills with a pen for sure!
Navia: Oh, and in other news, I also took Clorinde out for a meal.
Paimon: Oh? Are you two on better terms now?
Navia: Hmm... While you were investigating Vacher's headquarters, Clorinde gave testimony on my father's behalf.
Navia: It was thanks to her that we were able to turn the tide, I wanted to thank her... I mean, there's also no point in being awkward all the time... so, we took the chance to reconcile with each other.
Paimon: Oh, that's great! Paimon also thought Clorinde wasn't actually a bad person. It's always good to have more friends.
Navia: Anyway, now that the case has finally been solved, perhaps it will slowly begin to fade from the public consciousness.
Navia: Oh, actually, there's still one last thing I need to do...
Paimon: What is it?
Navia: ...I should pay a visit to my father's grave, and tell him the truth of what happened, as well as how it all ended.
Navia: And on top of that, just how much people still look up to him to this day...
Navia: ...That includes me, too.
Silver: Miss Navia...
Melus: Indeed.
Traveler: ...Can I come, too?
Paimon: Mhm, we want to go, too! We also think Callas is a really admirable person.
Navia: Sure thing. I'd like you two to share the moment with me. After all, without you, there might not have been such a positive ending.
Melus: Then in that case, everyone, let's be off. Considering the recent weather, we'll be lucky if we can reach Poisson before dark...
Navia: Yeah, you're right... It's been raining non-stop for a few days now.
Traveler: My legs are killing me...

## Talk 16

Navia: Marcel, the head of Confrerie of Cabriere!
Confident Audience Member: Huh? What confrerie? Never heard of them in my life.
Contemplative Audience Member: I've heard of them, but... weren't they Spina di Rosula's sister organization?
Scornful Audience Member: Ooh! Is this going to be friends-to-enemies type situation!?
Neuvillette: Please let me remind you, Miss Navia, that charging someone is an incredibly serious matter. Committing to the charge also means taking on the legal responsibilities associated with it.
Neuvillette: And if the charge fails, depending on the circumstances, you may also be charged with the crime of making a false accusation. Knowing this, do you still wish to charge this man?
Navia: Yes, I do.
Neuvillette: In that case, I declare the charge to be valid. Miss Navia and attorneys, please take your places on the court.
Neuvillette: Members of the Gardes, please contact Mr. Marcel right away so that he may stand trial.
Black Screen Text: After some time, a shocked and confused Marcel is brought to the stands.
Neuvillette: Mr. Marcel, you will not require an attorney, is that correct?
Marcel: Ah... Apologies, it all just happened so quickly, I still haven't figured out what's going on.
Marcel: I think an attorney won't be necessary. This is probably just a misunderstanding between me and Navia.
Neuvillette: Very well. In that case, since both sides have now arrived, Miss Navia, please present your charges.
Navia: I would like to take everyone back to three years ago, to the case of "Callas the Unfaithful."
Navia: Only through elucidating what really happened in that case can we connect all the dots for the serial disappearances case.
Marcel: Navia, do you really think I was the one who killed your father?
Marcel: Come on, why would I do that? Callas was my benefactor, and remember, both you and I only ran to the scene when we heard the sound of a gun.
Marcel: If that's enough to make me a suspect, wouldn't that make everyone at that banquet a suspect as well?
Furina: I, uh... I think there's no point in getting into the specifics right now. The audience doesn't even have the big picture yet. Even I'm... ahem, struggling to remember some details of that case.
Navia: Exactly correct, Your Honor. I must refresh everyone's memory about that case before I can explain my charge and reasoning.
Neuvillette: I see. In which case, I will recount the findings about that case as originally recorded by Maison Gardiennage.
Navia: (The one with the motive to kill was Jacques, not my father, and even so, Jacques still had no reason to pull the trigger.)
Navia: (In truth, the third person shot Jacques first, and was shot in turn by my father when my father seized the gun from him.)
Navia: (After that, the true culprit turned the third person into water, erasing all traces of him from the scene.)
Navia: Thank you for the summary, Your Honor. Of course, the Gardes' conclusion appeared quite sensible to us at the time.
Navia: However, we should revisit the case now that we've gained new information about the abilities of Water from the Primordial Sea.

## Talk 17

Navia: This is where my father's grave is... To be perfectly honest, even I haven't been back here for a long time.
Paimon: Huh, there's someone there already... Wait, that figure, it can't be...?
Navia: ...
Paimon: Isn't that Neuvillette? Why would the Chief Justice be here... Eh, Navia?
Neuvillette: ...Mm?
Navia: ...
Neuvillette: ...My apologies. I should have asked before coming to pay my respects.
Navia: Don't say that.
Neuvillette: Sorry about that.
Navia: Oh, I was trying to say there's no need for you to apologize.
Navia: I wanted to show my father how much I've grown, but still, I doubt I've grown to the point that even the Chief Justice would feel compelled to apologize to me over and over.
Neuvillette: In that case... I will stop apologizing for now.
Navia: You really could use some pointers on understanding human emotions, Monsieur Neuvillette...
Navia: In any case... why did you come to Poisson?
Neuvillette: Hmm... Well, ever since that day, I've been turning a question over and over in my head... Just what is justice, anyway?
Neuvillette: There was once a time when I didn't want to believe that there could be anything more important to humans than life itself.
Neuvillette: No, rather than that, it's probably more truthful to say I didn't believe humans were capable of resisting the most basic instinct of living things. That they could rebel against their own nature, or consider certain things to be more important than their own lives.
Neuvillette: Which is also why I didn't stop your father from beginning that fateful duel...
Neuvillette: I believed that a truly innocent man would never throw away his life like that. That there was nothing... should have been nothing more important than one's own continued survival.
Neuvillette: But Mr. Callas proved me utterly and decisively wrong.
Neuvillette: If not for his sacrifice, the serial disappearances case would have remained unsolved to this day.
Neuvillette: Mr. Callas made the choice he did for his daughter, for his associates, and for many people completely unrelated to him...
Neuvillette: And in the end, from a certain perspective, one could say that he did it all for the sake of justice.
Neuvillette: A justice that is higher than... life itself.
Neuvillette: So, you asked me why I came here.
Neuvillette: I just wanted to say my apologies to Mr. Callas in person... I should have noticed all of this much sooner.
Neuvillette: This regret has filled me with a sadness that has haunted me for days.
Neuvillette: That high and mighty chair in the Opera Epiclese indeed insulates one from many important things. Spina di Rosula, thank you so much for your hard work and perseverance.
Navia: I... I'm sorry for being mad at you before.
Navia: So you're actually... One of those types that's cold on the outside but pretty thoughtful on the inside, huh? That reminds me of Silver, one of my guys...
Neuvillette: Sorry about that. Self-expression is not one of my strong suits.
Navia: Didn't I just say you don't need to apologize...
Paimon: Huh, so Navia and Neuvillette seem to have made their peace as well...
Paimon: Let's not disturb them for now... We can wait until after they're done.
Black Screen Text: Following Navia and Neuvillette, you also pay your respects to Callas...
Paimon: Whew... Paimon's never paid respects at someone's grave before, did Paimon do anything rude there?
Traveler: Well, you're not usually supposed to fly around someone's grave.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon didn't know that was a thing... But... But Paimon doesn't know what she should do if she can't fly...
Paimon: Nooo... Paimon hopes Miss Navia won't be too mad...
Traveler: (Wow, she took it seriously...)
Paimon: Anyway, Neuvillette is still standing around there... It's not often that we can catch him alone like this, so why don't we go talk to him for a bit? If we can't talk to Lady Furina, we can at least talk to him, right?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Oh look! There's an important-looking basin over here... and it's full of water!
Traveler: That must be the Water from the Primordial Sea.
Paimon: That means this is where they make all the Sinthe! And that special water is the main ingredient.
Paimon: If you dilute it with normal water, you'll get Sinthe, but the pure stuff can dissolve a human...
Paimon: Paimon will take notes on this incriminating evidence!

## Talk 19

Paimon: What's all this... Ah, it's a bunch of really cute things!
Paimon: Pink accessories, a hair tie, a necklace, even a makeup box...
Traveler: There's a name, too.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees it too. But... why are all these cute things labeled with different girls' names?
Traveler: They probably belonged to the victims.
Paimon: Huh!? You mean, the girls from the serial disappearances... they were brought here!?
Paimon: And then, they were turned into water...
Paimon: And all these boxes of things... these names... that means... This is terrible...

## Talk 20

Paimon: What's this over here? Looks like some kind of place for research.
Paimon: "Experiment number sixteen aims to verify Jakob Ingold's research conclusions on the Primordial Sea, and use his theory as a foundation to achieve a breakthrough."
Paimon: "The experiment was a failure. No individual managed to resurface from the Water from the Primordial Sea. Female specimens twenty-two, twenty-three, and twenty-four were dissolved..."
Paimon: Waaaaaah!!!
Traveler: Calm down, Paimon.
Paimon: #Sorry, {NICKNAME}, Paimon will try her best! It's just that P—Paimon's never read something so scary before...
Paimon: How can someone write something that terrible in such a matter-of-fact tone!?
Paimon: You read the rest... Paimon's too scared to keep going...
Traveler: The goal of the researcher...
Paimon: So that's why he did all of these experiments...
Paimon: But did he really think he'd be able to find a way just by dissolving people over and over? That's just insane!
Traveler: There's another name here...
Paimon: Huh? Isn't that the name you heard by the fountain? Paimon thought... he was an eyewitness in the serial disappearances case?
Traveler: No.
Paimon: Ah... You mean, Vacher is the one who did all of these... ugh, experiments?
Traveler: Yes. He signed off on a bunch of the experiment reports.
Paimon: So that's it... Vacher was no victim, but personally took his lover and...
Paimon: No, that's not it either... If that's the case, why would he want people to resurface from the water?
Traveler: There must be more to this than meets the eye.
Paimon: In any case, Paimon will write it all down...
Traveler: The voice I heard from the fountain was probably Vigneire.
Traveler: He is the researcher.
Traveler: "Vacher."
Traveler: Is to save his lover, a woman called Vigneire, who was dissolved.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: So it is Xinyan! Ha! Paimon's intuition prevails again.
Traveler: You couldn't even remember her name just now...
Xinyan: Huh? Well, I'll be! Paimon, Traveler, what are you two doing here!?
Xinyan: Never thought I'd run into familiar faces so far from home! If you're here for a performance, I'm afraid I gotta disappoint you.
Traveler: Performance?
Xinyan: *sigh* It's a long story.
Xinyan: Have you heard of the Iridescence Tour? It's okay if you haven't... I didn't hear about it until just recently.
Xinyan: The more I think about it, this whole thing was weird from the get-go!
Xinyan: The organizers told me it was a music festival from Fontaine that was famous throughout Teyvat, but it seemed like nobody in Liyue had ever heard of it before.
Xinyan: There was a guy standing on the side of the road calling out, like he was selling Sunsettias or somethin'... I only inquired because I felt bad for him.
Paimon: Aww, that was nice of you...
Xinyan: Well anyway, he showed me a ton of material — the Iridescence Tour is a big deal over in Fontaine.
Xinyan: I heard that gettin' stage time means your music might start to be heard far and wide.
Paimon: Wow, you'd be famous overnight if you were up there!
Xinyan: You think so? Me too! I want as many folks as possible to hear my music — that's why I'm so set on attendin' the festival.
Xinyan: This year's Iridescence Tour is bein' held here in Inazuma. I've been honin' a bunch of new songs since I signed up — I even asked Beidou to ferry me out here ahead of time to scout the place out and make sure everythin' goes perfect.
Xinyan: Xiangling made me up a special packed lunch to wish me well! But... the organizers...
Xinyan: They ran into trouble out on the ocean — they can't make it. They even got fishing boats to send a message to Inazuma so the authorities could start spreadin' the word — the Iridescence Tour is canceled!
Xinyan: How can they just cancel it like that? I come here to perform, and they tell me this after I arrive? Now there's no way of getting the travel permit that the organizers arranged for me, and my temporary travel permit here is about to expire. Things couldn't have gone much worse...
Paimon: Seems like no one was more excited than you about performing at the festival, why should you get the short end of the stick...
Paimon: It's not fair...
Traveler: Yeah...
Xinyan: *sigh* It ain't always easy being a musician...
Xinyan: Well shucks, enough complainin'. This ain't the first time I wasn't able to perform. Time to move on!
Paimon: Wow, you sure cheered up quick!
Xinyan: If you wanna play rock 'n' roll for a livin', you gotta be tenacious! That's why I sprang into action. I submitted a request at the Adventurers' Guild and headed straight to the Tenryou Commission to see what else I could find out.
Xinyan: However... I've been standing here for ages already. I'm not sure what's keepin' those Tenryou Commission samurai so busy that they don't even have time to say hi.
Paimon: How dare they! Paimon bets they're just goofing off!
Xinyan: It's fine, stuff like this is bound to happen when you step onto unfamiliar shores. Hey Traveler, Beidou told me you've been in Inazuma for a while now. You must know how to get things done 'round here, right? Think you can help me out?
Traveler: Don't sweat it, I'm on the case.
Xinyan: Now we're talkin'! If you can get my permit straightened out, I'll write you a killer tune as a token of my heartfelt gratitude.
Traveler: Disappoint us?
