Traveler: Tell me about the city...
Farbod: I've been living in the wilderness all my life, so I rarely get the chance to enter the city. Even my mushrooms are sent into the city via convoy.
Farbod: You seem like you've been to places. Can you tell me what city life is like?
Farbod: I heard city folk merely have to sing songs or dance to get some shiny Mora. Is that true?
Farbod: But isn't every Mora a piece of the Geo Archon's flesh? Why would they trade using an Archon's flesh?
Farbod: And what would they do without Mora?
Farbod: *sigh* It eludes me. Cities truly are mysterious.
