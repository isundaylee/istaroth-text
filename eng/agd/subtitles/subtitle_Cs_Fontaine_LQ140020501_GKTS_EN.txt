Magic should be mysterious, surprising...
And defy logic
Magic is hard work
Every single movement has to be practiced thousands of times
It's alright. We're used to that
We're sorry. You've taught us so much
But we can't tell you the whole truth
It's okay. Do you still remember what I told you?
This world is full of lies and falsehoods
I only hope that one day, you can find your own truth...
What about you?
Have you found your truth?
Magic is my truth
I want to perform a magic trick so great
That people will always think of me
When they talk about it
For a magician
What greater honor could there be?
Look!

Lyney!
Watch out!
Mysterious
Surprising
And logic-defying...
Isn't that right?
This honor belongs to you
Cesar
I'm just sorry it's a little late
