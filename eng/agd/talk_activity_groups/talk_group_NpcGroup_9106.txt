Mavuika: #This place is great — so quiet and serene, like nothing could ever threaten the peace. I admire what you've accomplished here, Traveler.
Mavuika: I hope Natlan enjoys a similar tranquility one day.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Mavuika: It's great! It feels like a vacation spot, almost like the People of the Springs.
Mavuika: Before I became Pyro Archon, I went to the hot springs all the time. It's the perfect place to unwind and meet people from all walks of life, outlanders included.
Mavuika: But, that kind of free time is few and far between these days.
Traveler: You could always try to find that old feeling again.
Mavuika: Hahaha, I actually prefer to keep busy. Let me put it this way...
Mavuika: I'm sure you've invited many friends here in the past. And like me, they probably walked away with a very positive impression of this place.
Mavuika: From the environment to the decorations, you planned out everything down to the smallest detail.
Mavuika: Behind everything we see here lies a tremendous amount of work. And, you do that work, because this is your home, right?
Mavuika: Collecting ingredients, crafting furnishings, planning the layout and design... I'm sure all of that kept you very busy.
Traveler: Yeah, but it was very fulfilling.
Mavuika: Exactly. That's how I feel about Natlan.
Mavuika: Some bear their responsibilities like a burden, out of a sense of identity or obligation. But, I have a vision, and that is what drives me forward.
Mavuika: The role of "Pyro Archon" simply makes it easier for me to fulfill that vision.
Traveler: I know what you mean.
Mavuika: Hehe, that comes as no surprise to me. You're someone with a clear set of morals — through all the trials and tribulations, your resolve never wavered.
Mavuika: That conviction is one of the key qualities of a leader.
Traveler: Hmm, can't say I really get it...
Mavuika: It's alright, that's just my own take on things.
Mavuika: Based on what I've seen, you have your own understanding of the world, and your place in it, so just believe in yourself — you're on the right path.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mavuika: Oh, sure. I took some time to walk around this place and came up with a few suggestions. Maybe you'll get some inspiration...
Mavuika: Ah, from the look on your face, you were hoping for a more... casual conversation. Haha, that's very valid. My apologies — I can never seem to stop working.
Traveler: You remind me of some of my other friends...
Mavuika: Let me guess — they also have high standards for themselves and their surroundings.
Mavuika: Of course, not everyone's like that, and I respect other people's choices. So, I try to operate without imposing my habits on anyone else.
Mavuika: We're all human, which means we're often at the mercy of our emotions. When we get tired or annoyed, we lose focus, and it's hard to be efficient.
Mavuika: No matter how urgent or important, in that situation, it's better to put the work aside and get some rest.
Traveler: True... But there are also times when you just want to power through.
Mavuika: You're not wrong. I used to think some people were just built that way — so conscientious by nature that they just can't tear themselves away from their work.
Mavuika: But eventually, I realized it's not a character trait at all, but a reaction that stems from prolonged periods of anxiety and stress.
Mavuika: There are many possible factors — lack of recognition, family issues, disrupted sleep, lack of exercise...
Mavuika: I try to ensure that we have enough manpower at our disposal so everyone can afford to take breaks. The shamans from the Masters of the Night-Wind can also help relieve stress.
Mavuika: Thankfully, I'm quite the workaholic, so even if a lot of people go on break at once, it's all the same to me, haha.
Traveler: What if people would take advantage of that to be lazy?
Mavuika: Well, that depends on the context. I don't view it as some kind of inherent evil. It's a choice.
Mavuika: All I need to know is whether someone is driven by the same vision... Of course, actions speak louder than words in that regard.
Mavuika: I can talk with them, offer suggestions, and guide their next steps. There will always be things I don't understand, but as the Pyro Archon, I can still help people find the right path forward.
Mavuika: But, first and foremost, they have to be willing. And, that is not a decision I can make for them.
Traveler: It seems like you really respect everyone.
Mavuika: Hehe, I wouldn't go that far. I just don't want everyone to turn into a workaholic like me. After all, that lifestyle's not for everyone.
Mavuika: Plus, it leads to a more relaxed atmosphere, which is better for everyone, don't you think?
Traveler: That feels a bit... over-idealized to me?
Mavuika: Well, we're talking about principles. In a vacuum, I'm sure it sounds vague and impractical. But in practice, there are a variety of factors I consider.
Mavuika: Still, I won't refute your assessment. I consider myself an idealist, after all.
Mavuika: In my experience, surrounding yourself with people who share a common ideal... can be a very powerful thing.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Mavuika: Well, since you asked, I have an idea for a flamestrider Grand Prix!
Traveler: Wh—What was that?
Mavuika: Hahaha, I've been thinking about it ever since I arrived! It would be a shame not to take advantage of all this space and the amazing scenery.
Mavuika: So, this is what I was thinking... We create a race track that combines speed and technique and invite challengers to compete. The winner can be crowned the "Master of the Striding Flame."
Mavuika: If the tournament is a success, it would bring in a significant profit, in which case, you wouldn't need to worry about future prizes, and you could even expand the scale.
Traveler: I see where you're coming from, but...
Mavuika: Oh, don't worry. I already asked Xilonen about that. Although, she categorically refused...
Mavuika: I understand her reasoning, of course. I would need at least eight flamestriders, which would cost a small fortune, and I have no idea where we would find enough Secret Source components.
Mavuika: Still, having a vision is better than nothing. Besides, I have a back-up plan that only involves one rider.
Mavuika: Instead of having everyone ride a flamestrider at once, everyone will take turns with mine, and the person with the fastest time wins.
Mavuika: Of course, Xilonen rejected this proposal as well. The reason being, the flamestrider was originally designed for battle and travel, rather than speed.
Mavuika: Several modifications would need to be made to operate at high speeds, which means faster wear and tear, and more maintenance.
Mavuika: In short, we cannot sacrifice the core function of the flamestrider for our own entertainment.
Traveler: Xilonen makes a convincing argument...
Mavuika: Hm... True.
Mavuika: But, that also means... We could just design a new flamestrider built entirely for speed!
Mavuika: I'll make a quick sketch and show it to Xilonen right away!
Traveler: Do you have enough flamestriders for that?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Mavuika.
Mavuika: Morning! Another busy day lies ahead, and I'm ready to tackle it head-on.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Mavuika.
Mavuika: Ah, good night. I was just doing some puzzles — it's a collection from the Akademiya in Sumeru. I'll call it a night after these last two problems.

## Talk

Mavuika: Did you set up this office just for me? Aw. That's so nice of you.
Mavuika: Whenever I need space to think, I pace around in the Speaker's Chamber and before I realize it, I find myself tinkering with the furnishings. Or doing even weirder things.
Mavuika: For example, I might wipe down the lampshade of the phlogiston lamp several times over, or start cantering around on the wooden alpaca carving... It actually works, okay? Don't knock it till you've tried it.

## Talk

Mavuika: This makes me imagine a huge feast... Everyone raising their glasses, enjoying some good food, and letting their hair down.
Mavuika: We've got the venue, we've got the feast... All that's missing is a bit of healthy competition.
Mavuika: To have a proper feast, you need a reason to celebrate — just like you can't have drinks without some snacks. That's what sets the mood, and allows everyone to fully enjoy themselves.
