Traveler: The stars determine your destiny...
Ashk: Ah, are you talking about the research on constellations?
Ashk: Unfortunately, I don't have a Vision, so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
Ashk: But I feel the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
Ashk: Because if it was decided, then it could be changed, right?
Ashk: If destiny could be changed, maybe Greater Lord Rukkhadevata wouldn't have met her end.
