Traveler: A suspicious person from Sumeru, you say?
Martha: Ah yes, that guy over there. The name's... Chan... something? Ugh. I don't remember exactly, but it was hard to pronounce.
Martha: He came into town some time back, claiming to be a researcher from Sumeru. Well, I've never seen him do any research. He just plays cards all day with the Doge's granddaughter...
Martha: Can't figure out half the things he talks about normally either. "Moving statues" this, "voices in the walls" that... *sigh* Maybe we should get Ms. Contarini to investigate him...
