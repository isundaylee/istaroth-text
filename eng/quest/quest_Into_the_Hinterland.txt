# Into the Hinterland


## Talk 1

Paimon: The mechanical crab went that way. Let's keep up!

## Talk 2

Tighnari: Hey! Over here!
Tighnari: Come on you big lummox, raise your head and look up!

## Talk 3

Tighnari: As I thought. The closer we get to the contamination's source, the more mechanical monsters that appear...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Whew... That's all of them.
Karkata: Kolu!
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: Hey, where are you— Wait for us!
Paimon: #Let's hurry and keep up, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 5

Jasar: Aaah... Spare me, please spare me!
Paimon: Hey, are you okay?
Tighnari: These injuries are superficial. Don't move. I'll patch you up.
Jasar: Who are you all? What happened to those mechanical monsters?
Paimon: Don't worry, we took care of them!
Jasar: Good. Haha... That's good...
Karkata: Kolu!
Jasar: Aaah, it's a monster! Hurry, attack it!
Karkata: Kulilu?
Paimon: How do we explain this? Crabby here isn't a bad guy.
Paimon: It heard you shouting for help and brought us here to rescue you.
Jasar: It's faking it — it has to be! Maybe it's gonna partner up with the other mechanical monsters and kill me!
Jasar: Do you know what's inside the forest? It's all... It's all crawling with mechanical freaks!
Jasar: I just came here to pick herbs, but I accidentally went into the contaminated region and almost died.
Tighnari: ...
Jasar: I gotta get out of here. Yes... Yes, I have to escape...
Jasar: Be careful. These mechanical life forms are up to no good. It'd be best if you stayed far, far away from them!
Jasar: No wonder the Akademiya wanted to completely ban the existence of mechanical life forms. Those things should be annihilated...
Paimon: Are you okay?
Tighnari: His inarticulate speech and bodily tremors indicate psyche disruption. He's been inside the contaminated region for too long.
Tighnari: We've purified the Ley Line energy over there. Follow this path out and you'll soon see the village.
Tighnari: When he gets to the village, someone will bring him to Collei for help. I already prepared medication that will return him to normal.
Karkata: Kolu!
Traveler: It looks like it's...
Tighnari: Hmm... So you think you did a "good job" and want a part as your reward?
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: It's so hard to understand...
Tighnari: Alright, regardless of what you're thinking, you did some real good this time.
Tighnari: That's why I'll give you another mechanical part. Need any help with it?
Karkata: Kelukulo.
Tighnari: Guess not. Well, make sure to hang on to it. What was going through your owner's mind when he made you, I wonder? You're like a giant mechanical crab on the outside and a fluffy little hamster on the inside.
Tighnari: And also, how do you feel about that person saying that you're as evil as the other mechanical life forms?
Karkata: Kulilu?
Paimon: Okay, it definitely doesn't understand you.
Tighnari: It seems like it possesses limited understanding only towards matters related to mechanical components.
Tighnari: "Help others to get parts." That's probably its thought process. As for why it — rather, its owner — is collecting so many components, I'm not sure.
Tighnari: It's getting late. Let's set up camp for the night. We'll explore further tomorrow after a night's rest.
Traveler: Expecting something?

## Talk 6

Paimon: So this is the contaminated region that everyone's been talking about... It definitely looks different from normal!
Paimon: It's like... really creepy and suffocating...
Tighnari: Do you feel unwell at all?
Traveler: Doing fine so far.
Tighnari: Good. It's as I predicted: Elemental power confers a degree of resistance against the contaminated region's influence.
Paimon: How do you know that?
Tighnari: I haven't entered the contaminated region for a proper investigation, but I've conducted quite a few controlled experiments.
Tighnari: My observations during our time here have all but confirmed my hypothesis. Look at these flowers. How are they different from normal?
Traveler: They're more colorful?
Tighnari: This flower species is formally known as the "Sumeru Rose," but it is also known as the "Ley Line Lodestar."
Tighnari: They're sensitive to Ley Lines and emit varying amounts of light in response. Excessive brightness indicates a dangerous level of Ley Line activity in the surrounding area.
Tighnari: From the looks of things, the Ley Lines around here are already out of control.
Paimon: You're saying that the contamination here is coming from Ley Lines?
Tighnari: I can't confirm that right now, but I think that is the case.
Tighnari: Let's take another look around and see if we can discover more clues.
Traveler: They're brighter?

## Talk 7

Tighnari: Let's set up camp here.
Paimon: Alright! Paimon also thinks it's a good spot!
Tighnari: Oh? Any particular reason?
Paimon: This place is perfect to put up a big tent!
Paimon: We can also set up a cooking pot and cook tons of delicious food!
Traveler: A very Paimon reason.
Tighnari: You're not wrong, but the primary reason for choosing this place is because its higher elevation keeps us away from the water vapor below.
Tighnari: Rainforests are very wet. You should always be careful when spending the night in damp places.
Tighnari: For the next tasks at hand, let's divide and conquer. I'll set up the tent, you'll be in charge of making the fire, and Paimon will forage for edibles nearby.
Paimon: Leave it to Paimon! Paimon's a pro!
Tighnari: I'm not expecting that much. Just do what you can.
Black Screen Text: Thanks to Tighnari's guidance, you safely start a fire...
Tighnari: That's right. You can use rushes to start a fire in the wilderness.
Tighnari: Their piths are relatively dry and can be readily set aflame. The downside is that they produce a lot of smoke.
Paimon: #*sob* {NICKNAME}, Tighnari... Paimon couldn't find any food.
Paimon: Paimon didn't know that rainforests had so many interesting plants until we came here! There were all sorts of weird-looking mushrooms, but Paimon didn't know which ones were edible.
Paimon: Paimon also saw wild berries on the ground, and Paimon was gonna fly over and pick them up, but the dead leaves on top suddenly started moving! It freaked Paimon out!
Tighnari: Those were probably Deadleaf Butterflies. They camouflage as dead leaves to evade predators.
Tighnari: My guess is that they mistook you for a bird when you flew over, so they fled. Little did they know that you were more scared than they were.
Tighnari: Never mind. The tent's up, so you two go rest. I'll forage for food.
Karkata: Kolu!
Tighnari: Oh? You found some already.
Traveler: You have my gratitude.
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: Paimon understands it this time! It wants mechanical parts again!
Tighnari: Sorry, no part this time.
Karkata: Kulilu?
Tighnari: That task wasn't important enough. If every little thing resulted in a reward, then it might start to take advantage of the system.
Tighnari: I'll note little things like this and give a cumulative reward at a later time.
Traveler: Are you running low on parts...?
Tighnari: Ahem, that is one reason.
Karkata: Kuli...
Paimon: It looks really sad...
Tighnari: ...After some further thought, it might come up with some weird misunderstanding if I don't give it something. Alright, here's another for you.
Karkata: Kolu!
Tighnari: I'm off to prepare dinner. We'll take shifts on lookout duty tonight. You two can sleep first. I'll wake you up later.
Paimon: We need lookouts?
Tighnari: Yes.
Tighnari: Even though most animals fled because of the Ley Lines, we can't completely let down our guard.
Tighnari: It's settled, then. I'll set up some pest-repelling devices so poisonous insects don't come crawling into the tent.
Tighnari: Have a good night. Not too good, though.
Traveler: It's more useful than Paimon.
Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 8

Tighnari: Hm? You're awake earlier than I expected. Did you sleep well?
Traveler: Very well.
Tighnari: That's good. I was worried that you two wouldn't be able to sleep, so I used two of my homemade incenses.
Tighnari: Don't worry, they're made from all-natural ingredients. They have a light fragrance and aren't harmful to the body.
Tighnari: Speaking of which, have you seen the crab?
Tighnari: It was scampering around over there just now, but I don't know where it went.
Traveler: Are you wary of it?
Tighnari: So you can tell. My suspicion is less towards the crab, and more directed to its unrevealed owner.
Tighnari: A Ley Line effluence of this magnitude occurred without any warning. Someone probably disrupted the natural flow of the Ley Lines.
Tighnari: Until we fully understand the situation, take extra caution. The Akademiya has banned mechanical life form research for years, so the origin of these creatures is very suspect.
Traveler: Banned research?
Tighnari: Topics related to mechanical life forms were popular in the Spantamad for a time. Some of my juniors had also thrown themselves into such research.
Tighnari: They proposed an intriguing idea: Use our knowledge to create a "new and practical" life form that could help humanity "conquer nature."
Tighnari: However, no matter which modules or parts are installed, a machine is innately a construct that receives and executes commands. They can never possess self-awareness like us or other living organisms.
Tighnari: In their pursuit to discover the differences between mechanical and biological life forms, zealous researchers performed unregulated vivisections and other absurdly cruel experiments on animals. Research on mechanical life forms was thus banned.
Tighnari: The irony is that the researchers became even more impetuous afterward. Who knows, maybe the subject will be unbanned in a few years.
Traveler: Do you not like this area of research?
Tighnari: Hmm... That's a difficult question to answer.
Tighnari: I'm interested in the topic of mechanical life, but I don't like the researchers' attitudes.
Traveler: Anything in particular, or...?
Tighnari: It's just my personal opinion.
Tighnari: My ancestors and the Valuka Shuna of the desert coexisted together and supported one another. The bloodline of my people was born from this symbiotic relationship.
Tighnari: So to me, all life is important. To understand life, you must first respect it.
Tighnari: Life is not an expendable commodity, and knowledge should not be wielded like a scepter. These are the points of contention I have with some researchers, and why I left the Akademiya.
Tighnari: Once you start placing yourself above other life forms, I mean... What kind of results do you expect to get from researching pure life with impure intentions?
Traveler: I understand what you mean.
Tighnari: Really? Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Karkata: Kuli...
Karkata: Kolu!
Tighnari: Coffee? Did you prepare this for us?
Karkata: Kolu!
Traveler: It looks like it wants a reward again...
Tighnari: Alright, seeing that you're working so hard to help out, I'll give you another part.
Tighnari: You're not planning on using it? Many of your own parts are critically degraded, and you're running low on power.
Karkata: Kelukulo.
Tighnari: #Alright, suit yourself. Oh and thanks for the coffee, but I'm about to go to sleep. Leave it with {NICKNAME}.
Tighnari: The night watch is yours. Stay safe.
Paimon: #S—Sorry, {NICKNAME}, Paimon slept through the entire night...
Traveler: It's okay.
Paimon: Really? You're not mad?
Tighnari: #Good morning, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Quick question, do you feel off at all?
Traveler: I'm a little dizzy.
Tighnari: Me too. The farther in we go, the closer we get to the source of the Ley Line effluence. We'll be heading out earlier today. I'll take down the tent.
Paimon: Is there something we can do?
Tighnari: Extinguish our fire so we don't set the entire forest aflame.
Tighnari: Also, retrieve the pest-repelling devices from last night. We don't want to affect the ecosystem here.
Paimon: Got it! Paimon will take care of the fire!
Traveler: I'll retrieve the pest-repelling devices.
Tighnari: Alright. Let's meet back here later.
Traveler: Your punishment is solo watch duty.
Paimon: Hehe. Don't worry, Paimon will be sure to stay awake next time!
Traveler: Because the "conquest of nature" is bad?
Traveler: The Akademiya previously conducted research on mechanical life forms?
Traveler: I'm still a little sleepy.
Tighnari: You have to maintain constant vigilance in dangerous places like this. Yawning all the time like that is no good.
Tighnari: If you can't stay awake, it's okay. Go sleep some more. I'm not tired yet.
Traveler: I can manage.
Tighnari: Really? You don't need to push yourself. I'm used to staying up all night because many plant and animal species can only be observed during nighttime.

## Talk 9

Tighnari: Hm? You're still awake?

## Talk 10

Black Screen Text: Last night's pest-repelling devices are recovered...
Tighnari: Alright, it's about time to head out. As we go further in, we may encounter more berserk machines.
Tighnari: The effects of the Ley Lines will also increase. If you're struggling, it would be wise to avoid conflict.
Tighnari: Try to conserve as much energy as possible until we reach the source of the contamination.

## Talk 11

Tighnari: Guess it'll have to wait until we return.
Traveler: What's going on?
Tighnari: I also just remembered that I forgot to apply essential oil to my tail. You probably noticed that it isn't as glossy as usual.
Traveler: ...Nope, I don't see it.
Tighnari: Hmm... Perhaps one night doesn't make too much of a difference.
Tighnari: I'll make a new blend when we get back. It should make up for last night. I should have some leftover herbs from last month...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Paimon's getting sleepy... Ah! Is this because of the Ley Lines?
Paimon: It's been a while since we camped outside like this!
Paimon: #Hehe... This feels like when we just started adventuring together! Nighty night! {NICKNAME}!
Black Screen Text: Paimon gradually falls asleep while reminiscing...
