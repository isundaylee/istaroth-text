# The Exile: Sprouting


## Talk 1

Ziyad: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish.
Ziyad: ♪Blooming from a stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.
Ziyad: ♪She sang...
Paimon: That's a local Sumeru folk song called the "Singing Rose," right? It's such a cute song.
Paimon: Too bad the boy ran off halfway through. Paimon would have loved to hear the whole thing and say hi to him.
Sabbah: You must be new here. First time in Aaru Village?
Traveler: Yes.
Sabbah: No wonder you've never heard of that folk song.
Sabbah: Well then, are you scholars looking to study abroad in Sumeru? I know that there are many foreign scholars in the Akademiya.
Paimon: We do know a lot of scholars, but we aren't quite like them ourselves.
Paimon: #Technically, we're adventurers, the glorious world-trotting duo — Paimon and {NICKNAME}!
Sabbah: World-trotting? Hahaha!
Paimon: What's so funny? We're super famous adventurers, believe it or not.
Sabbah: No, I wasn't mocking you, friends from faraway. Just the opposite. It's a delight to hear uplifting stories like people traveling the world.
Sabbah: When you're as detached from the world as I am, such enthusiastic remarks can really catch you off guard.
Sabbah: I'm sorry if I offended you. My name is Sabbah. I offer you my apologies as well as my welcome to the village.
Sabbah: Ah yes. Were you talking about the rose folk song that Ziyad was singing?
Traveler: Correct.
Sabbah: We can talk more about it if you're interested. I hope it will liven up your journey.
Paimon: Are you going to sing for us, Sabbah? Paimon's dying to hear the rest of it!
Sabbah: Sorry, I'm not good at singing... But we can discuss what the song is about.
Paimon: Sure! So, that kid sang about the rose granting wishes...
Sabbah: Yes. In a tiny village like ours, we don't have a big athenaeum like they do at the Akademiya. All our songs are passed down orally.
Sabbah: It's my belief that the wish-granting flower in the song represents the collective imagination of our ancestors.
Sabbah: In a harsh environment like the desert, water is an extremely vital resource, so they prized water-storing plants.
Sabbah: So, the more adverse the terrain, the more stories there are about plants. It's a reflection of our ancestors' yearning for a better life.
Sabbah: At the same time, plants are also a part of the symbiotic relationship between our ancestors and the flora and fauna of the desert.
Sabbah: However... Aaru is built on sand and the soil here is actually not suitable for the cultivation of Sumeru Roses.
Sabbah: The Sumeru Roses I planted could never grow, so if you ask me, the Golden Rose in the song must have been a product of people's imagination...
Paimon: Uh, hold on, Paimon can't keep up anymore...
Paimon: Is this what you usually talk with people about, Miss Sabbah?
Sabbah: Ah! I'm sorry, I thought since you were new here, you'd prefer such topics over farming or the weather.
Paimon: Paimon got lost somewhere between "symbiotic relationship" and "the collective imagination," but don't worry, Paimon understood that last sentence!
Paimon: You said that the land here isn't suitable for Sumeru Roses, right? We've also only seen them in places with moist soil.
Traveler: Well, this place is mostly sand, after all.
Sabbah: Speaking of roses, I was thinking that since you two are adventurers, perhaps I can hire you to...
Paimon: Now we're talking! We're battle-hardened adventurers. We can do any job, no problem!
Traveler: So, what can we help you with?
Sabbah: I know it's ridiculous to want roses that don't belong here to bloom, but regardless, I still really want to see them.
Sabbah: I'm embarrassed to even say it, but that is my wish.
Sabbah: Based on what I know about roses, they will grow if fertilized with highly concentrated Dendro, even if you grow them in sand.
Sabbah: But it's near-impossible to get such fertilizer out here, so I'm wondering if you may be able to get your hands on some...
Traveler: Dendro?
Sabbah: Yes, Dendro promotes plant growth and works especially well on poor crops.
Sabbah: But I'm just a normal person without a Dendro Vision, and I lack the resources to obtain effective fertilizer.
Paimon: Hmm. If it's just <color=#00E1FFFF>Dendro</color> you want, this is pretty easy! We got this!
Traveler: Roses sure are picky customers.
Traveler: Rose folk song?
Traveler: No.
Sabbah: Huh? Did I guess wrong? Let me think again...

## Talk 2

Sabbah: If it weren't for you, I don't think I'd have ever seen these roses sprout.
Sabbah: If only I knew this would happen... instead of seeds, I should have brought a few more books.
Traveler: You're not from here?
Sabbah: Are you surprised? Well, I guess that means that I've adapted pretty well.
Sabbah: When I first got here, I was unable to get used to anything, whether it be the food, the housing, or anything else.
Sabbah: But I got used to everything over time.
Sabbah: That doesn't mean that I've fully accepted my predicament, though.
Sabbah: I suppose it is impossible to make roses from Sumeru City bloom here after all.
Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Sabbah: I could have been called that once, but not anymore.
Sabbah: I said something beyond my station, and learned something I shouldn't have.
Sabbah: I broke the Akademiya's taboos, so I was removed from amongst their ranks.
Traveler: What did you say?
Sabbah: Curiosity is the impetus for seeking wisdom, but it's also the cause of sin.
Sabbah: I only understood that after I was exiled to this place.
Sabbah: For safety reasons, I don't think I should go into details.
Traveler: All right then.
Sabbah: Ahem, but...
Sabbah: I thought adventurers would just come and go, never coming back to chit-chat after finishing their jobs.
Sabbah: I didn't expect to have another long conversation with you.
Sabbah: To be honest, I don't have a lot of friends to talk to here.
Sabbah: Do you think... at some point... you would be able to come by and fertilize my plants again?
Traveler: Sure.
Sabbah: ...Okay then, I'll wait for you.
Traveler: Why grow Sumeru Roses?
Sabbah: You probably don't know much about them... but they are very versatile, and have many uses.
Sabbah: They can be eaten, turned into medicine, given as gifts, or fetch a good price on the market.
Sabbah: And that's just some of the more common applications.
Sabbah: The flower, leaves, and stalk of a Sumeru Rose also did not always look like this. They all had different appearances once upon a time.
Sabbah: I believe geographical changes led to changes in the roses' traits.
Sabbah: A study of its traits could help us derive past geographical and historical information.
Sabbah: I won't be able to explain the mechanism over just a casual conversation, and sharing such information with adventurers is probably against the rules as well.
Sabbah: If you're interested in botanical evolution, you should visit the Akademiya. They'll have more on the subject.
Traveler: So, you're doing this for your research?
Sabbah: I'm not a researcher anymore. I no longer have the right or means to pursue any research.
Sabbah: If you must know why... *sigh*, you are a very curious soul, you know that?
Sabbah: I grew a lot of Sumeru Roses back in my former residence. The flowers were spectacular, and I got to see them every day.
Sabbah: If it was possible, I wish I could see them again, just like before.
Sabbah: ...That's all there is to it.
Traveler: I can understand that.

## Talk 3

Sabbah: Can you wield Dendro? Are you someone with a Vision?
Sabbah: I haven't met anyone like that in a long time. What a nostalgic feeling...
Paimon: It should be fine now, right, Miss Sabbah?
Sabbah: That's right, they should sprout soon if powered by Dendro. Let's just wait for a while...
Black Screen Text: Gradually, sprouts begin peeking out of the soil.
Black Screen Text: They stop growing after sprouting a few leaves.
Paimon: #They're sprouting! Paimon knew you could do just about anything, {NICKNAME}!
Sabbah: The results were immediate, as I thought... Thank you.
Traveler: Too bad there are no flowers yet.
Sabbah: Oh, that's normal. You can't rush such things.
Sabbah: Plants have to go through stages of growth. That you were able to make them sprout is already quite amazing.
Sabbah: Give the roses some more time to take in the nourishment. It will be better for them as well.
Sabbah: I'm very grateful to you as it is. I wouldn't wish to bother you further.
Sabbah: Just drop by and see them in your spare time. That would be enough.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Sabbah: Do you really have a way to grow roses through the power of <color=#00E1FFFF>Dendro</color>?
