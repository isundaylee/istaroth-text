Traveler: About the ceasefire...
Matsudaira: To be honest, I was relieved when I heard about the ceasefire.
Matsudaira: But don't get the wrong idea, though. It's not like I'm afraid of those small fry from Sangonomiya or anything. We're still the stronger party when it comes to military might by a long shot!
Matsudaira: It's just that I'm past the age where you're all hot-blooded and up for a fight, you know? I'm beginning to think that it's not good for people to remain on the battlefield for too long.
Matsudaira: But of course, that doesn't mean that I'll go easy on anyone in a real fight.
Matsudaira: It can still be pretty dangerous around here, ceasefire notwithstanding, so best you be careful.
