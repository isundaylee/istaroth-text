# The Chasm Charters

Xu: Again, I apologize for asking this favor of you, but we really are very busy at the moment. If there's any trouble, just come back later and we'll talk then.
Traveler: Could you tell me more about The Chasm?
Xu: Well, uh... Oh, right! Silly me. I can't believe I'm sending you out without even the briefest of introductions to The Chasm.
Xu: To be honest, though, I'm not sure I'll do a good job relating the matter to you... I think it was several years ago now when the miners unearthed something strange. What that is, I don't know â€” nor have I really had the courage to ask around.
Xu: Either way, this was reported to the Qixing by the Huishan Hall, and one of Ningguang's secretaries sent out an investigation team that returned and reported that there was some huge threat to everyone's safety, and that the mines must be closed...
Xu: As a result, the Chasm was rendered into its current state. The people of Shenglu Hall constantly ask when it will be reopened, but the Qixing will not allow it, leaving them to fret...
Traveler: Tell me about Muning.
Xu: Oh, him? His family is a big name in the porcelain industry. Pretty high up in Shenglu Hall... You know, the works. But he has little interest in the family business, and instead prefers to enjoy a life of leisure, going where the mood strikes him...
Xu: He's also absolutely no good with Mora, and he owes quite a few people as a result... For fear that he might ruin their business' reputation, the family had him sent to the Ministry of Civil Affairs as a representative to shape him up a bit...
Xu: It just so happened that the Ministry needed a professional from Shenglu Hall to oversee The Chasm, so he was picked as this specialist.
Xu: If you ask me, this is a good thing. According to my father, The Chasm is exactly the place to train one's character. Why, he did work there in the mines himself back when he was young...
Traveler: See you around, then.
Xu: Alright. Stay safe, now!
