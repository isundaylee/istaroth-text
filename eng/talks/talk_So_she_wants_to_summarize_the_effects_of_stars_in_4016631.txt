Layla: So, she wants to summarize the effects of stars interacting with each other... That's going to be tricky.
Traveler: Happy Sabzeruz Festival, "other Layla."
Layla: Ah, you noticed... As you can see, daylight Layla is currently too stressed to enjoy the festivities.
Layla: With a deadline coinciding with the festival, and a research topic concerning complex astrology... It's no surprise she's been sleepwalking again.
Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Layla: Sorry. I'm not sure we can trust such complex and precise calculations to someone else. Just visit her more often, if you have the time. I think that would make her very happy.
Traveler: Happy Sabzeruz Festival, "Blessing from the stars."
