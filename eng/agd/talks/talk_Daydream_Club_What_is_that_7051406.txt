Traveler: Daydream Club? What is that?
Félix Yogue: Hmm, let me think, how should I explain this... So generally, a "club" is... a loose assembly of people sharing the same interests.
Félix Yogue: But... the Daydream Club is bound by something more than "interests" — that is to say, "dreams."
Félix Yogue: However, these "dreams" are often criticized as unrealistic. So we said to ourselves, "why not just name the club 'daydream'?" And that's what we did.
Félix Yogue: As for us, the members of the club are naturally "daydreamers" holding to our "daydreams."
