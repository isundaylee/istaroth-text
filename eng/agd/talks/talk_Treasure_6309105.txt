Traveler: Treasure?
Yegor: Huh? You heard that? Oh, that's problematic, um...
Yegor: But judging by your gear, you seem like a seasoned adventurer... Well, then I'll be honest with you.
Yegor: I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like Konda Village or whatever that place is called...
Yegor: Sadly, I can't leave Ritou yet. If you can figure out a way to get into Inazuma, could you help me ask around?
