Traveler: What's the problem with the report?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: In my humble opinion, there is nothing wrong with the report. The Kanjou Commission has been very careful in submitting their report, and I have already reviewed it according to our usual standards.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: But perhaps with the current unrest, Sir Matsukawa is less than optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: I can understand his concern... But as an ordinary civil official, what can I do to help...?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: *sigh* If I had more power, perhaps I could resolve these issues and actually do something for the Takatsukasa and Kujou Clans.
