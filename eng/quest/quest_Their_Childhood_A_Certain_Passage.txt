# Their Childhood: A Certain Passage


## Talk 1

Verut: Lovi, did you find something good?
Lovi: Nope, there's nothing here at all!
Traveler: What are you doing?
Verut: We're looking for treasure! Hehe... Would you like to join us?
Traveler: Treasure?
Lovi: Don't listen to Verut's bragging. We're just looking to fish up some components.
Verut: Well, the components are treasure... Huh? There should be some here...
Lovi: Looks like we're not going to find anything here. Shall we go somewhere else?
Verut: Sure! Let's go a little further up ahead.
Traveler: I'll go with you two.
Verut: Whoa, you're starting to sound like my brother...
Verut: Well, let's just walk a little further. I'm quite sure the waters around here were full of components...
Traveler: You shouldn't go running around everywhere.
Traveler: Where's Aurele?
Verut: He went to look for Mr. Delerue with some questions.
Verut: As for us, we had to be good and stay good... and search for treasure.
Verut: Hehe, so... would you like to join us?
Lovi: Don't listen to Verut's bragging. We're just looking to fish up some components.
Verut: Well, the components are treasure... Huh? There should be some here...

## Talk 2

Lovi: There's just some rotten cardboard here... and no components.
Verut: That's weird. I fished a few gears out of the water here just yesterday.

## Talk 3

Verut: Found one! This gear is quite complete. There's even a whole bearing over here.
Lovi: Nice, we can use these!

## Talk 4

Lovi: These are... tattered clothes? Their colors have run completely...
Verut: Has someone fished around this area already? There are no components here at all...

## Talk 5

Lovi: Let me see... We can use this gear, and if we saw this bearing open...
Traveler: What are you looking for this for?
Lovi: I'm trying to make my own clockwork puppet. Actually, I've been secretly looking into knowledge related to that.
Lovi: Once I figure it all out, I'm going to make a huge Clockwork Meka — now that'll stun Daddy!
Lovi: I've read lots of books in his room, and I've made some basic components according to the instructions therein.
Lovi: I'm pretty sure that mek's within reach so long as I keep working at it!
Lovi: But I can't study these things in the city, or he'll find out — and that would ruin the surprise.
Verut: That's how this place became Lovi's secret clockwork research base. As for me... Well, I'm her assistant.
Lovi: Well, assistant, talk is cheap! Let's start our research. Today, we must make a moving mechanical arm!
Verut: Aye aye, ma'am! Let our research begin!
