# Aesthetic Critique: Self-Critique


## Talk 1

Depierris: No, no... If I remove the lights and shadows here, what will that do to the layering on the painting?
Depierris: The power of expression in those colors is insufficient... and the contrast is not great either...
Depierris: Ugh! Just a few elements removed, and the whole thing's a mess now!
Traveler: What are you up to?
Depierris: Ah, it's you. It's good to see you again...
Depierris: I apologize for the misunderstanding — I was merely thinking about the issues with this picture, and I couldn't help but pace about...
Depierris: You might not be able to understand, but I simply cannot sit still when reflecting on problems.
Depierris: The longer I sit in place considering problems, the more frustrated I get. That's why I'm used to thinking as I pace.
Depierris: I allow my legs to carry me anywhere they will as I think, so long as they don't keep me in place.
Depierris: So... this happens often. Sorry for making you worry.
Traveler: So, did you reach a conclusion, then?
Depierris: No progress, I fear... I just don't know where to begin.
Depierris: If I remove the lighting effects, the image lacks layers, but if I reduce contour and shaping, the objects within the picture cannot sustain its structure.
Depierris: The removal of just any few elements will send the whole edifice crashing down, devolving it into a heap of trash.
Depierris: I'm just talking to myself, by the way, so don't worry too much — I'm just thinking about how to solve this problem.
Depierris: I must go back and look for my easel first...
Traveler: And what of the question you were considering?
Traveler: I almost thought you were in danger or something.

## Talk 2

Depierris: *panting* Thank you... Really, thank you...
Depierris: Seriously, I was just painting over here — but before I knew it, they had me surrounded!
Depierris: They attacked my painting so vigorously, you'd think they wanted to eat it or something!
Depierris: But I couldn't let them have it, of course, so I grabbed it and ran...
Depierris: Didn't get far before they caught up, though — thank the Archons you were there to rescue me.
Traveler: Is there something wrong with this painting?
Depierris: A—Archons if I know! I've always used Whopperflower Nectar to make my paints — you know, the stuff you got for me previously?
Depierris: Wait... What if the paint was attracting them? No, that can't be — that nectar doesn't smell at all after I mix it into the paint!
Depierris: I daren't change the paint formula on the fly, either. Guess we'll have to find some other way...
Depierris: *cough* And here I thought that even the Whopperflowers could sense the beauty in my painting and wanted to come have a look at it.
Traveler: What did you do?
