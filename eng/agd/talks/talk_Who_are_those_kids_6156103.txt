Traveler: Who are those kids?
Mack: That's Will and Jill. Children aren't really supposed to leave the city without an accompanying adult...
Mack: But I thought, they just look so happy playing together. I couldn't bring myself to go and tell them off...
Mack: So I've just stayed here watching them. Otherwise, I'm not sure how I'd be able to face their parents.
