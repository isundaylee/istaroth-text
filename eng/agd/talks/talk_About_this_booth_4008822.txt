# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About this booth...
Georg: Angel's Share participates in Weinlesefest each time, and plenty of folk come all the way here to Mondstadt to sample our limited-edition wines.
Georg: Back when Master Crepus was around, he'd come to us in person every year to drink a glass...
Georg: *sigh* I don't know why, but this festival always makes me nostalgic.
Georg: Diluc... I mean, Master Diluc has had a rough go of it these past few years, but he seems to be in good spirits this year.
Georg: As long as Master Diluc is well, I'm sure Master Crepus' spirit up above will also be pleased.
