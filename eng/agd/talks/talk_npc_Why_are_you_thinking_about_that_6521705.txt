Traveler: Why are you thinking about that?
Vuillermoz: I used to be part of Mr. Edwin Eastinghouse's Arkhium research team...
Vuillermoz: But I only handled really peripheral jobs. I just took notes and wrote up reports... Worked out statistics, monitored the instruments, that kind of thing...
Vuillermoz: Even then, I didn't understand why all those geniuses would want someone like me working with them. I'm not clever or talented. I'm not even a very good learner.
Vuillermoz: I only escaped the explosion because I couldn't face going to work that day. I called in sick and slept in.
Vuillermoz: I never imagined I'd wake up to find out my research group was almost wiped out in a huge explosion...
