Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lynette: As long as you let your consciousness freely drift, it doesn't matter where you are.
Lynette: ...Though, according to normal standards, the environment here is quite pleasant indeed.
Traveler: According to normal standards?
Lynette: Pure, clear air, a soft, warm bed, a lot of open space...
Lynette: Had we grown up in an environment like this, Lyney probably wouldn't have been nearly so anxious.
Lynette: ...I seem to have allowed some subjective thoughts to color my review. Please pay it no heed. Objectively speaking, this is a delightful place.
Traveler: And according to your standards?
Lynette: It is well-suited to spacing out. My charging speed is currently 5% faster than usual.
Traveler: What an... interesting metric...
Lynette: ...By my standards, that is the highest praise that can be given.
