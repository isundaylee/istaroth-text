Black Screen Text: Seeing you approach, the Blubberbeast doesn't flee but instead joyously swims over, leaping into your embrace in a nigh-instant. From it trills soft notes of affection as it rubs itself against your cheek...
This is indeed Berrypuffier, the little Blubberbeast that you and Paimon fed and nursed to maturity...
Berrypuffier: Blub... Blub!!!
Paimon: Hehe, long time no see!
Paimon: Paimon was worried that you couldn't get used to the ocean, but it seems like there was no need at all!
Traveler: (Instruct Berrypuffier to somersault.)
Berrypuffier: Blub!
Berrypuffier: Blub... Blub!
Traveler: Have a wonderful time!
Berrypuffier: Blub blub!
