Traveler: What are you doing?
Viktor: Hmph! I am not idling away my time by napping!
Viktor: I'll have you know I am a Fatui diplomatâ€”
Viktor: Diplomat's assistant, Viktor!
Viktor: I am here on orders from his excellency to assess the situation in Mondstadt!
Traveler: That sounds exciting, tell me more.
Viktor: I'll tell you one thing... Mondstadt is boring! *yawn*
Viktor: Though they call it the City of Freedom...
Viktor: There's just nothing to do here at all. How do Mondstadters put up with this place?
Viktor: Also, what's the big deal with this Barbatos guy? He's never even here!
Viktor: Can't compare with Her Majesty, the Tsaritsa of the Zapolyarny Palace... Ugh, never mind, that sister over there is giving me evil looks again.
