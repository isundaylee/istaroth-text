Pitot: Welcome to The Rusty Rudder. Choose anything you want!

Traveler: This place is...
Pitot: As you can see, this is a bit of a dingy tavern. I'm the helmsman here, but you can call me Boss. Whatever you want.
Pitot: You just tell me what you want to drink. I'll do my best to either make it myself, or find it for you.
Pitot: Of course, if you really want me to help find some new goods which aren't on the shelves, then you'll have to pay a little more.

Traveler: Why are you wearing a divesuit?
Pitot: I've called this here tavern The Rusty Rudder and, as the helmsman, I naturally have to dress accordingly.
Pitot: What's more, it makes it easier for me to dive into the water and fish out any drunk guests who fall in.
Pitot: If they insist on drowning, then let them at least drown in booze. Otherwise, it'd be bad for my tavern's reputation.

## Talk

Traveler: Bye.
Pitot: See you. You want something to drink, just let me know.

## Talk

Traveler: I need to pay extra Mora?
Pitot: Mora? Heh, if you're only paying in Mora, then I can only sell you what's on the shelves. At most you could have some "good wine."
Pitot: For things that aren't on the shelves, you need to trade something that's not in your wallet.

## Talk

Traveler: Whâ€”What do you mean?
Pitot: Heh, don't worry about it. Just choose what you want to drink.

## Talk

Traveler: I want to see what you've got.
Pitot: Please, take your pick. Though you'll have to make an offer if you want to buy the "good wine."
