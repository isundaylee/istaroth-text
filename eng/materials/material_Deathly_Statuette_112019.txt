# Deathly Statuette

A one-eyed carving that emanates an ominous energy, with no indication of what it's made of.
As you gaze upon this idol, you can almost hear a strange, comforting whisper...
"See, my child. All that lies under the throne of heaven shall be destroyed by upheaval. The eternal peace of the pitch-dark void shall embrace us all."
