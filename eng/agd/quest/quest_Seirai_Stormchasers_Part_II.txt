# Seirai Stormchasers: Part II

Etsuko: That's the second Warding Stone sealed. Only two left.
Taisuke: Let's look at remaining two Warding Stones.
Taisuke: As long as we seal all the Warding Stones, that should calm the storm.
Traveler: Then we'd best be off.
Taisuke: I sure hope that what this "Neko" says is true...
Etsuko: Well, it is our only lead concerning the storm...
Etsuko: Whatever the case may be, let's just have a look at those Warding Stones first.
Traveler: Yup, let's go.
Etsuko: The storm and these Warding Stones... We'll have to write a pretty detailed report for the Guild later...
Traveler: Let's get closer to them at least.
