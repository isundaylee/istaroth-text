# Talk Dialog

Fein: Traveler, would you like to try Heart of the Dice?
Traveler: Yep.
Fein: No problem. Um, have you finished reading the rulebook yet?
Fein: Oh, it's fine, you don't have to read it cover to cover to play. You can always learn as you play.
Traveler: I've got something else to do.
Fein: You're busy? Alright then, feel free to come find me anytime. This booth will be here throughout the King of Invokations Grand Prix event period.
