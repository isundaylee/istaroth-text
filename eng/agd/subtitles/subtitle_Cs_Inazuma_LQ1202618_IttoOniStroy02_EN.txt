A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time
There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni
They were the best of friends
The crimson oni wanted to be friends with the humans
So the blue oni played the role of the naughty kid...
And then he left
After a long time, the crimson oni was living happily with the humans
But in his heart, he wanted to bring the blue oni back home
The crimson oni didn't know where to find the blue oni
His search took him up the highest mountains
And across the widest rivers
He found many traces of the blue oni
But the more he found, the clearer it became:
The blue oni was hiding on purpose
So just as the blue oni had once done, the crimson oni left him a letter:
"Dear Ao, I've made lots of human friends now"
"And I wanna have a big party for everyone"
"I want all my friends to be there. That means you too, Ao"
"If you don't wanna meet me, you can just watch from a distance"
The blue oni snuck back to the village, and hid in the shadows
He saw the great feast and roaring fire, and longed to join in
But though his stomach rumbled
The blue oni remembered the oath of old, and kept his distance
Suddenly, he jumped: The crimson oni was right behind him!
"Hey, you're finally back!"
"C'mon, I'll introduce you!"
"It's time everyone met my best friend"
