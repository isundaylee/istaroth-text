# Teucer's Terrific Tour


## Talk 1

Granny Shan: This price is fair. Well then, I'll get that custom order done for you.
Paimon: Hee-hee, thanks, Granny!
Granny Shan: Worry not, just leave it to me.

## Talk 2

Teucer: Eh? What are those super-colorful winged things?
Paimon: They're called kites. The kids in Liyue love them!
Granny Shan: Hello there, dear! You look like you've come a very long way. Let granny guess — from what you're wearing, I would say... Snezhnaya?
Teucer: Hee-hee, that's right. How do you play with these kite things, Granny?
Granny Shan: When the wind picks up, you let out the string, and whoosh! The kite will fly into the air, up, up and away!
Teucer: Wow... That's amazing. Do you have any Mr. Cyclops ones?
Granny Shan: Mr. Cyclops...? I'm sorry, I—
Teucer: I wanna fly Mr. Cyclops high into the sky so all the kids can get to know him!
Granny Shan: Well, I can do custom builds, but I'll need some amount of reference material...
Teucer: Will this picture do? I drew it myself. I bring it with me everywhere!
Granny Shan: Hmm... I'll manage. Still, I must warn you that custom builds can really be quite expensive...
Paimon: Ah, we should be fine, Childe was pretty generous with that entertainment fund...
Paimon: Um... But then again, throwing money around willy-nilly is, y'know, kinda irresponsible...
Traveler: What do you really mean...?
Paimon: Well, um, so... Yes, technically speaking, these funds are earmarked for Teucer's entertainment... But, if there's any left over when we're done...
Paimon: Either way... it's time to talk prices!
Traveler: You think we should pocket the change?
Paimon: Eh-heh, your words not mine! But yes, we're on the same page here.

## Talk 3

Slippery Wu: Huh! I for one would like to see what this dandy boy's made of...

## Talk 4

Chef Mao: *sigh* All this haggling and wrangling... At this rate, everyone's appetites will be ruined.
Chef Mao: I won't argue with you any further. You can take my price, or you can take your order elsewhere.
Paimon: Um, we're sorry, Chef Mao. We didn't mean to make you mad. We'll pay what you asked — all this bargaining's made us hungry too.
Chef Mao: Ha, now that's better! Go find a place to sit. Your food will be with you shortly.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Found him! There's Childe!
Paimon: Wait, he's talking to... the Treasure Hoarders?
Childe: You know what I'm here for, I trust?
Slippery Wu: Oh, you've got lip. Makin' us guess, are you?
Slippery Wu: If you wanna join up, let me just say this first — dandy kid like you? You ain't welcome.
Childe: Oh ho. What a commendable imagination.
Childe: Well, in the Tsaritsa's name, I suppose I should forgive you country bumpkins for your ignorance. For I am—
Teucer: Brother!
Teucer: You're selling them toys, aren't you, brother? That's so cool! I've always wanted to watch you work!
Childe: ...Why, yes, of course! For I am, uh...
Childe: ...The greatest toy salesman in Snezhnaya!
Paimon: Pfft...
Teucer: So cool!
Slippery Wu: ...
Slick Wu: You playin' games, pretty boy?
Childe: ...So, will you buy, or not? The toys that Snezhnaya produced three months ago will run you... yes, 600,000 Mora. To be paid in full.
Sneaky Wu: T—Toys? And h—how much money!?
Slippery Wu: Wow, is that what it's gonna cost to fix that head of yours?
Slippery Wu (Treasure Hoarder Crowd): Hahahaha!
Teucer: Look at that! Spreading joy and laughter to everyone — that's what toy selling's all about!
Childe: I'll say it again. Toys from Snezhnaya, three months prior, 600,000 Mora, paid in full.
Slippery Wu: Yeah... No. Sorry, salesboy — the same joke isn't funny twice.
Slippery Wu: Or were you always cruisin' for a bruisin'?
Childe: *sigh* Alright then, I'll make things a little easier for you. I'll join the Treasure Hoarders. Perhaps you'll be more willing to pay when we're brothers-in-arms?
Slippery Wu: Huh! Would you listen to yourself!? You think we just let any old person into the Treasure Hoarders? I'm not so sure you could hack it...
Childe: *chuckles* Well then, why don't you put me to the test, dear seniors? I like to think of myself as quite talented in the field of treasure hunting.
Slippery Wu: Hmph, looks like you're not gonna pack it up until someone packs you in. Alright then. Show us what you got.
Slippery Wu: Truth be told, we've set up shop here because there's a fine little loot cave nearby. But the treasure hasn't been easy to get at. We've been at it for two days now.
Slippery Wu: If you think you're up to snuff, why don't you have a crack at it on our behalf? 'Course, that means that once you've got it, it's ours. Don't you try to sneak off with the prize, now...
Sneaky Wu: Hahaha... Come on. If we can't do it, do you really think this guy stands a chance?
Childe: An initiation test, eh? Interesting. It's been a while since I've been assessed by someone else.
Slippery Wu: The loot's on the *opposite cliff*. We're gonna hang back here and watch the show...
Childe: No problem. Don't blink, though, or you might miss it.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Teucer. So you did come here!
Traveler: Don't you ever run off like that again, young man!
Teucer: Shh... Quiet, my brother's giving his speech!
Childe: ...From this day forward, you will honor the oaths you have made to Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, and you will stop at nothing to bring Snezhnaya victory.
Childe: You shall sweep through this land like the icy winds of the furthest north, as strong as the hoar frost of Zapolyarny Palace. You will chill the very marrow in our enemies' bones!
Childe: Her Majesty expects of you loyalty, ruthlessness, and meticulousness...
Childe: For the trials that we face are harsh, and our enemies are like...
Childe: ...
Childe: ...Ahem, like kites and rattle drums...
Childe: Who shall become redoubtable foes of Mr. Cyclops in the marketplaces of Liyue...
Teucer: Uh-huh. Kites are really fun, too.
Fatui Recruit: ...
Childe: This is, of course, an analogy. As they say, "the marketplace, too, is a battlefield."
Fatui Recruit (Fatui Recruits): ...
Childe: So as your... sales manager here in Liyue, I demand that you obey my every order.
Childe: A refusal shall be considered a betrayal, and the price for betrayal is to be dishonorably discharged from... Ahem, from the Liyue Institute of Toy Research.
Teucer: Whoa, that's really strict... Won't people be really sad if they get fired from the Institute?
Fatui Recruit (Fatui Recruits): ...
Childe: Eh... uh...
Childe: (Seeking to please everyone pleases no one at all. Time to try something else...)
Childe: Forget it. Perhaps a round of hands-on training will suit us better.
Fatui Recruit: Hands-on... training?
Childe: After all... a strong body is the proof of one's capacity.
Fatui Recruit: Hey. Did... did he just say that we're doing hands-on training?
Fatui Recruit: A Harbinger wants to spar with us personally? Wh—What an honor!
Fatui Recruit: I can't believe it... are recruits like us really worthy?
Childe: Am I hearing a hint of objection to this idea?
Fatui Recruit (Fatui Recruits): Not at all, sir!
Childe: That's the spirit!
Childe: Now, come at me, you lot.
Traveler: Your brother would have been worried sick.

## Talk 7

Granny Shan: Children, children, I do hope you're not trying to make a mockery of me.
Granny Shan: I'll stick to my price, and not a Mora less... If you seriously want this custom build, then I would hope you can be serious about the price.
Paimon: Sorry, Granny! We didn't mean it like that... Alright, Granny, we'll go with your price.
Granny Shan: That's more like it. Not to worry, now. Just leave it to me.

## Talk 8

Chef Mao: *sigh* All this haggling and wrangling... At this rate, everyone's appetites will be ruined.
Chef Mao: I won't argue with you any further. You can take my price, or you can take your order elsewhere.
Paimon: Um, we're sorry, Chef Mao. We didn't mean to make you mad. We'll pay what you asked — all this bargaining's made us hungry too.
Chef Mao: Ha, now that's better! Go find a place to sit. Your food will be with you shortly.

## Talk 9

Teucer: Wow, this place is huge! And there's so many people!
Teucer: Are the waves here always like this? Don't they ever freeze?
Paimon: Uh, given Liyue's climate, the area around the harbor's mouth probably never gets cold enough to freeze.
Paimon: Paimon is kinda the Traveler's exclusive personal tour guide, but... since this is a special occasion, Paimon can make an exception to help Teucer get to know the place.
Paimon: This place is Liyue's commercial hub, and it's been the biggest port in the seven nations ever since it was decided that Liyue would take on the world through trade.
Paimon: Other than merchant vessels, many fishing boats and industrial transports dock here to replenish their, uh, fishery supplies and daily necessie— necessities, which, thanks to the... immense... throughput capacity of the wharf... Um...
Traveler: Paimon, Teucer won't understand a word you're saying...
Paimon: Uh... Yeah, Paimon can't remember how the rest goes anyway...
Paimon: Well, guess Paimon will just have to explain this Paimon-style! So, this harbor is like Teyvat's mouth, and it's the biggest mouth you've ever seen.
Paimon: All the nations float their boats over the sea into the mouth. The harbor goes om-nom-nom-nom-nom and has a taste of each boat and the cargo it has on board...
Paimon: Then, Liyue Harbor rubs its big round belly in satisfaction, because it's all stuffed full of delicious Mora!
Traveler: That's how you explain throughput capacity?
Teucer: Hey, what's that big metal hook over there? I wanna see!
Paimon: Wait, Teucer, don't run off!
Paimon: Ugh, after all that, he wasn't even listening!
Traveler: Yes, this is all very... Paimon-style...
Traveler: How about a topic kids would be interested in...

## Talk 10

Granny Shan: *sigh* Fine, fine. I've neither the time nor energy to bargain with you at my age. I suppose this price will do.
Paimon: Hee-hee, thanks, Granny!
Granny Shan: Worry not, just leave it to me.

## Talk 11

Granny Shan: Children, children, I do hope you're not trying to make a mockery of me.
Granny Shan: I'll stick to my price, and not a Mora less... If you seriously want this custom build, then I would hope you can be serious about the price.
Paimon: Sorry, Granny! We didn't mean it like that... Alright, Granny, we'll go with your price.
Granny Shan: That's more like it. Not to worry, now. Just leave it to me.

## Talk 12

Chef Mao: Done. I'll go prepare the food, then.
Paimon: Great! It's time for a nice meal!
Chef Mao: Please sit wherever you like. Your food will be with you shortly.

## Talk 13

Granny Shan: Hmm, this price is a little too low...

## Talk 14

Granny Shan: No, that won't do... This amount won't even pay for the materials...

## Talk 15

Chef Mao: Hey now, come on. I can barely cover the cost of the ingredients at that price.

## Talk 16

Chef Mao: Hello! Welcome! Table for three?
Teucer: Whew, this restaurant has a really... choking smell...
Chef Mao: A "choking smell"? You must be referring to our signature spicy chili scent.
Teucer: Spicy chili? But I... can't eat spicy food.
Chef Mao: Ah, what a pity. A person who can't eat spicy food misses out on half of life's joys.
Paimon: Is it really that bad?
Teucer: My meals have to have lots and lots of sugar, and the oil has to be extra virgin vegetable oil.
Paimon: Wow, we've got a real rich kid on our hands...
Paimon: Looks like Wanmin Restaurant's dishes aren't to Teucer's tastes... Maybe we should go somewhere else...
Chef Mao: —Will that be all? Any more special requests?
Paimon: Eh? What do you mean, Chef Mao?
Chef Mao: Ha! Giving the people what they want is the very reason Wanmin Restaurant exists.
Chef Mao: If I thought for one second that I couldn't make a dish to satisfy this child's tastes, I would have absolutely no business calling myself a chef ever again.
Paimon: Whoa, there seems to be a lot of professional pride riding on this...
Paimon: Then we'll leave it to you, Chef Mao. We will be eating here after all.
Teucer: Sure!
Chef Mao: But let me say this first: special requests are going to cost you more than normal.
Chef Mao: Of course, we aren't going to demand prices anywhere near as exorbitant as the likes of Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk.
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or are premium custom orders in fashion lately?
Paimon: Still... Hehe... Surely there must be a little room for negotiation, right?

## Talk 17

Paimon: For our next stop... why don't we head to *Wanmin Restaurant*?
Paimon: It would be a mighty crying shame to come all the way to Liyue and never try the food!

## Talk 18

Paimon: Looks like we'll be hanging out with Childe's kid brother for a while...
Teucer: So, so, so where are we going to play first?
Paimon: Um... how about we start with the *toy store*?

## Talk 19

Chef Mao: Ah, you folks... *sigh* Let's go with this, then. Any more haggling, and we'll ruin the other customers' appetites.
Paimon: Hehe. Thanks, Chef Mao!
Chef Mao: Please sit wherever you like. Your food will be here shortly.

## Talk 20

Paimon: Blergh, it was a little... too sweet. Paimon feels a little sick...
Teucer: I thought it was just right! Almost exactly like how sister Tonia makes it!
Paimon: But this doesn't feel right, somehow... Didn't we bring Teucer here to try Liyue's specialties?
Paimon: ...Meh, whatever. So, where do you wanna go next, Teucer?
Teucer: The *wharf*! I was so caught up looking for my brother when I first got here that I didn't get a good look around.
Paimon: Good idea. The hustle and bustle at the wharf is a specialty of Liyue Harbor too.

## Talk 21

Chef Mao: That seems a bit on the low side... You do realize these dishes will be prepared specially to your requirements, don't you?

## Talk 22

Teucer: Is this where they sell fish? Wow, the fish here in Liyue are so... small.
Uncle Gao: Hey! Whose fish are you calling small? Little kids shouldn't go around ruining others' business.
Paimon: He's just a curious kid... No need to get worked up...
Paimon: That said... These fish are actually pretty big by Paimon's standards. Just how big are the ones you're used to, Teucer?
Teucer: Um, maybe two hundred times your size?
Traveler: That's crazy big...
Teucer: There are legends in my hometown about it. It's supposed to be a super delicious fish.
Teucer: I told my brother about it, and he went out to sea to catch one for me.
Teucer: A few days later, he returned with a humongous fish slung over his shoulder. Anthon and I were so happy...
Paimon: Are you sure that was a fish? Paimon thinks it sounds more like some sort of... leviathan...
Traveler: Sounds like a topic that would interest Xiangling...
Teucer: #Hey, Mr. Nice Guy, let's go over there to see the boats!
Traveler: Your brother spoils you too much.
Teucer: Hee-hee...
Traveler: Actually, that's still pretty small...
Paimon: Hey! Two hundred of Paimon would squish you flat, you know!

## Talk 23

Teucer: That metal hook is huge! And it gets bigger the closer we get!
Paimon: This is an anchor. Docked ships use it to hold themselves in position, to stop the wind and waves from blowing them away.
Teucer: Hmm, an anchor... Got it.
Teucer: But I think I might get it mixed up with Commodore Hook...
Paimon: Commodore Hook? Is this another one of your weird toy names...
Teucer: My brother always sends me a really big toy for my birthday.
Teucer: Commodore Hook, Blacksteel Jack, Iron Tony... We keep them all in our backyard.
Traveler: Are they as big as that anchor?
Teucer: Yeah, and that's why I can't bring them with me all the time. It's a shame...
Paimon: Wow, using Fatui funds for personal gain. To think Snezhnaya would let their Harbingers do that, all for some giant toys...
Paimon: But suddenly, it doesn't seem so strange that Teucer would treat a Ruin Guard as a giant toy...
Teucer: But my favorite has to be Mr. Cyclops. Even though I mostly came here to see my brother, the other big thing I wanted to do was play with Mr. Cyclops!
Teucer: Ooh, are they selling fish over there? Let's have a look!
Paimon: Hey! Quit! Running! Off!
Traveler: They're all made of metal?

## Talk 24

Teucer: ...
Paimon: What's wrong, Teucer? Are you tired? You don't seem so happy.
Teucer: I miss my brother...
Paimon: What? But we were just with him!
Teucer: Yeah, but for such a short time that it doesn't count!
Teucer: Take me to see my brother! I don't want to play anymore!
Traveler: That's children for you...
Paimon: Yep, you can have all the patience in the world, but it won't help you at a time like this...
Paimon: Well, we've played with Teucer long enough, haven't we? Paimon thinks we've tried our best here...
Paimon: Childe said that he'd be by *the river near Qingxu Pool*. Why don't we look for him there?
Teucer: Yay! Let's go, let's go!
Traveler: Guess we've got no choice...
