Traveler: How have you been doing lately?
Joserf: I've been fine, thanks for your concern. That said, my memory is still somewhat foggy. I wonder when it'll all come back to me...
Joserf: Joel's been trying very hard to help me recover those memories. When I look at him, I just think that there's more I could be doing as well.
