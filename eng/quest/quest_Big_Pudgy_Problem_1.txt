# Big Pudgy Problem!

Tunner: #Thank you, Traveler...
Tunner: I just wanted to tend to the grape vines, and then... this happened.
Tunner: *sigh* Please don't say a word about this to my son. He's one of the Knights of Favonius, so I'm sure he has enough to worry about as it is.
Tunner: There's no need to bother him over a silly old man getting himself into a bit of a pickle.
Tunner: Recently, though, we do seem to be having a bit of a slime problem around the winery area. I worry constantly that they'll demolish my grape vines. It's keeping me up at night.
Tunner: I don't know if you have the time to spare for an old man like me... but if so, could you chase off the slimes in the area for me, to stop them from getting at my grapes?
Traveler: Sure thing, old man.
Tunner: Bless you, child! I will rest better for it.
Traveler: No way, old man.
Tunner: *sigh* I would happily do it myself, but at my age my strength is not what it used to be... For a youngster like you, this should be no problem. Come on, make an old man's day.
