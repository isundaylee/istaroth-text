Leni: Do you need me to do anything for you? O hero who fought Stormterror in the skies, the ever-dutiful commission shredder, the finder of hidden chests, the breacher of the unknown mists...
Traveler: You don't have to use so many titles every single time...
Leni: Oh no, that won't do. As an adventurer who has accomplished far less than you, I must always show you the highest respect.
Leni: I'm sure I'm not the only one in the guild who thinks this way. Please accept our show of respect!
Traveler: You seem really enthusiastic.
Leni: Hahaha! Of course! I really love my job, after all!
Leni: I think that adventurers should keep attempting more difficult challenges so they can keep moving towards greater heights.
Leni: Whether it's bettering myself or helping others to get stronger, all these things make me happy!
Traveler: Aren't you going to participate in the challenge yourself?
Leni: Aha! To tell you the truth, I've already had my fill defeating monsters when I went scouting!
Leni: It's a pity that the creatures nearby are not in endless supply. As the one organizing the event, I can't just focus on making myself happy.
Leni: You should also go easy and leave some targets for the newbies so they can practice.
