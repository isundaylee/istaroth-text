There was a transparent bird made of crystal
It was beautiful and fragile, and could sing the most beautiful songs
But since mortals couldn't see it, they believed it to be a trick
How could a transparent bird possibly exist, let alone sing?
When the bird heard that, it flapped its wings
And flew across mountains and seas
All the way to the night sky, where it turned into a star
Its brilliance was so dazzling that it illuminated everyone
It allowed all those that could see it to follow its light through the dark night
To sail through the seas under the guidance of the stars
It was born in wisdom, but trapped in ignorance
It has never voiced a complaint, for this is its destiny
Guiding people to see their destinies is the very meaning of its existence
