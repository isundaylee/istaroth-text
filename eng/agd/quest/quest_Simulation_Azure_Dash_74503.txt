# Simulation: Azure Dash

Arbon: Welcome, dear guests, we meet again. It has not been long, and yet I miss you a little already.
Paimon: Hmph, you sweet talker.
Arbon: Ah, woe is me, loathed am I! How the pain stings. Perhaps I'd best get back to work.
Arbon: Let me state first that the planned data collection project will be divided into two parts. One will be run by Alberre, and the other by me.
Arbon: On my side, we wish to model the agility of a Champion Duelist, and so we'll need you to complete a few underwater speed challenges.
Paimon: Huh, do Champion Duelists have to train underwater?
Arbon: Who knows? I do not know one personally, and I don't think the boss knows any either. He probably just thinks that it's cooler this way.
Arbon: He originally wanted to install 10 different water-drawing mechanisms that can spray jets of water, but eventually gave up on this idea due to the high cost.
Traveler: That does sound pretty cool.
Arbon: Well, Fontaine is the realm of water, after all, and if this is to be sold in other nations, a little Fontainian flair is needed.
Arbon: Anyway, we've prepared a handbook with relevant details. Please peruse it at your disposal.
Arbon: Well, are you two raring to go already?
Traveler: Let me make some preparations.
Arbon: No problem. The data collection devices have already been placed over there, so you need not worry about them. You just need to focus on completing the challenge.
Traveler: Only kids would find that cool.
