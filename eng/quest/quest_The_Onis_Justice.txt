# The Oni's Justice


## Talk 1

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.

## Talk 2

Paimon: According to Detective Sango, Itto should be somewhere around here.
Paimon: Katheryne mentioned that he has a Vision. Why not see if you can track him down using Elemental Sight?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Look! Footprints! Let's see where they lead.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hmm, there's a camp here, but nothing stands out as particularly noteworthy...
Paimon: ...Let's keep moving forward.

## Talk 5

Paimon: There are more footprints here. He should be just up ahead!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Uh oh, lightning storm!
Arataki Itto: Ugh, for crying out loud, this'd better not scare off all the beetles...

## Talk 7

Arataki Itto: Darn it! They've all gone...
Arataki Itto: Let's hop down from here and take a look. My gut's tellin' me that there's a king-size beetle just below. Beefy beetle king, here we come!

## Talk 8

Arataki Itto: Look, you see all those purple things? It's a whole pile of Onikabuto! Now that's what I'm talking about!

## Talk 9

Arataki Itto: Beans? No! Aghhh!

## Talk 10

Daisuke: Did you catch a beetle yet?
Daisuke: If you didn't catch one, then get back out there and keep looking. I've been waiting for ages!

## Talk 11

Arataki Itto: And by the way, that kid has one tough beetle, we can't underestimate it. We have to find a real lean mean beetle warrior.
Paimon: Okay, he's not the sharpest horn on the oni...
Arataki Itto: Okay, lemme see...
Arataki Itto: There. Let's head to that hill. I'll bet my bottom Mora we're gonna find some major-league Onikabuto hiding out there.
