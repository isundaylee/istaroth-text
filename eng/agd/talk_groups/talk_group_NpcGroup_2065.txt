## Talk

Kun: Hello there, Traveler. I guess you're here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
Kun: Well, what do you think? Quite the lively festival, wasn't it? I mean, especially the fireworks show that Lady Keqing organized. Ah, that was one for the history books for sure.
Kun: I hope you can enjoy yourself to the fullest. If you need anything, just come to me!

## Talk

Kun: These items are really hard to find...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Kun: Oh, it's you. Do you still remember the affair with the Jade Chamber? Baiwen came over some days ago, saying that a schedule's already been drawn up for its reconstruction.
Kun: While it's impossible to finish building it so quickly, there are some small matters that can be prepared beforehand.
Kun: She gave me a checklist and told me to look through the items and see what I can easily get hold of, but also that I needn't go out of my way to get them all.
Kun: To be honest, though, I couldn't leave my post even if I wanted to. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is getting busier by the day, so I really don't know...
Kun: It would be great if you had the time to help me make the trip. Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Kun: Thanks for the help.
Kun: Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
Kun: You can ask Jifang about the book. As for the bamboo ornaments, I believe that Master Lu of Fanmu Carpenter's makes them.
Kun: I'm sorry, but I'll have to leave this matter in your hands. Hmm, but it would indeed be good if the Jade Chamber could be rebuilt...
Traveler: You're really rebuilding the Jade Chamber?
Kun: I've heard Baiwen say that the schedule's already been sent out. But given how large that building is, I think that it will take some time to rebuild it...
Kun: They're just preparing some small items at the moment. Things will really get busy once they officially start the rebuilding process.

## Talk

Kun: These items are really hard to find...
Traveler: Something the matter over there?
Kun: Oh, it's you. Well, you must know that the Jade Chamber has finally been rebuilt, right?
Kun: I never thought that such a huge place could be rebuilt just like that...
Kun: Baiwen came looking for me several days ago, asking me to prepare a few items to help redecorate the Jade Chamber's interior.
Kun: Look, she even passed me a checklist and all, telling me to keep the various items recorded there in mind.
Kun: I'll be honest with you, though. My work at the Ministry of Civil Affairs has been getting more hectic by the day. There's just no time to help her...
Kun: Could you help me make the trip to find these items, Traveler? Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done.
Traveler: Consider it done.
Kun: Thank you!
Kun: Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
Kun: You can ask Jifang about the book. As for the bamboo ornaments, I believe that Master Lu of Fanmu Carpenter's makes them.
Kun: I'll leave it in your hands, then. Ah, the rebuilt Jade Chamber truly is a magnificent sight...

## Talk

Kun: A perfectly good Jade Chamber... Gone, just like that...
Traveler: What are you doing over here?
Kun: Ah, it's you. I... Well, I'm currently thinking about how to clear up the fragments of the Jade Chamber currently floating on the ocean surface...
Kun: You recall that it was completely destroyed when it crashed, right?
Kun: Those fragments ended up floating on the ocean, with some larger pieces even blocking the path of passing ships...
Kun: The Ministry of Civil Affairs organized a cleanup, which got rid of all the larger pieces.
Kun: But as for those smaller bits of flotsam... Clear them out one day, and more come floating in the next...
Kun: While they're not that much of a problem, the Ministry's stance is that we should clean them up all the same. I'm currently thinking about how this can be done.
Kun: Our sergeant said that I could look for some people to help out, but who would want to do this job anyway?
Kun: I mean, um, unless you... Well, are you willing to help me with the cleanup? You might even be able to keep some of the useful items you pick up.
Traveler: You can count on me.
Kun: Thanks, you're a big help. I'm afraid that I'm not a particularly good swimmer...
Traveler: Useful items? Such as...?
Kun: Honestly, I don't know myself. But given that this is the Jade Chamber, I'm sure that something eye-catching will turn up.

## Talk

Kun: Ah, the Jade Chamber... To think that it could truly be rebuilt...
Traveler: What are you doing over here?
Kun: Ah, it's you. I... Well, I'm currently thinking about how to clear up the flotsam out there in the ocean...
Kun: You remember how the Jade Chamber crashed and was completely destroyed, right? It left a ton of floating wreckage in its wake...
Kun: The Ministry of Civil Affairs organized several rounds of cleanup, but those tiny pieces have proved all but impossible to clear away...
Kun: Now, the Jade Chamber has been rebuilt, and yet you can still find flotsam coming in on the tides now and then. That's really turning into a problem for us.
Kun: Our superiors have been chasing us to finish the cleanup faster.
Kun: Our sergeant said that I could look for some people to help out, but seriously, who would want to do this job anyway?
Kun: But well, you know, if you've got the time... Could you give us a hand with the cleanup efforts?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Kun: Thanks, you're a big help. I'm afraid that I'm not particularly adept in the water...

## Talk

Kun: Greetings. Can I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Kun: Don't recognize me? I just transferred here from the south wharf.
Kun: I'm going to miss my time there. I always found watching the boats going in and out the harbor quite awe-inspiring somehow.
Kun: Not so much the cargo ships and fishing boats. I mean more the ones that belong to The Crux. I know they are involved in some shady stuff, but...
Kun: ...None of that's any of my business really. If everyone above me's happy enough to let it slide, it's hardly my place to be critical.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Kun: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail! The Millelith is proud to be at your service.

## Talk

Traveler: So, any sights worth seeing in Liyue Harbor?
Kun: Oh, are you a traveler from another nation? Then I suggest that you must go and see one of Xinyan's performances.
Kun: Every time she performs, the ad-hoc stage she uses will burst into flames when the atmosphere reaches its peak!
Kun: Well, this did attract the attention of the higher-ups, and they put a stop to her performances in order to avoid any harm coming to members of the public.
Kun: But as much as I'm a Millelith, I'm also a loyal fan of hers. So I always try to sneak her some intel, so she can stage performances in the blind spots of our patrols.
Kun: Ahem. Don't tell on me to the sergeant! Her music is a great source of joy in my life. To let it be snuffed out would be such a shame!
