# Talk Dialog

Babel: Apologies, our business has me distracted... Was there something you needed?
Traveler: About the traitors...
Babel: You speak of Aderfi and Azariq, yes? Their actions have shamed the Tanit, and before a guest no less...
Babel: They spent too long in contact with those northerners, and forgot that they were children of the Tanit, bound to the rules of the tribe.
Babel: Thankfully, I still have Jeht... She has lived up to my expectations and more.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: Jeht? She is a good child. She learns our ways quickly and greets trouble with neither grimace nor complaints.
Babel: Heh. Speaking of her, it's a shame that there was an... incident between us and her father in years prior...
Babel: But I'm just glad that Jeht has returned to us. Though her father... *sigh* I suppose we can consider this a delayed resolution.
Babel: She likes you, you know. I can tell.
Babel: So... Please don't disappoint her and ruin the friendship you have.
Traveler: About Liloupar...
Babel: Naturally, she has her own perspective. That which provoked her rancor was a misunderstanding regarding our actions...
Babel: But if we wish to rejuvenate the desert, the lands need to be fertile, that they may offer an easier life for our people. Hence, we must rely on Liloupar's favor.
Babel: We hope to come to a mutual understanding on this point at least...
Traveler: See you.
Babel: Farewell. I bid you safe travels for your coming adventures.
