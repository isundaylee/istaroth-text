Traveler: About the Akasha Terminals...
Panah: The Akasha is a treasure trove of wisdom left to us by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Panah: Using the power of the Akasha, the sages developed the Akasha Terminal. By wearing it, you'll be aided by the wisdom of the Dendro Archon in obtaining the knowledge you need.
Panah: In the past, the Akademiya only issued Akasha Terminals to people of Sumeru or outlanders who were in a long-term residence in Sumeru.
Panah: The Akademiya decided of late to distribute the Akasha Terminals to all tourists in Sumeru, hoping to help all feel the universal compassion from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
