# Valor's Afterglow: Return by Sundown


## Talk 1

Jinwu: Ugh, it's Zhiqiong again... She went to retrieve those beacons, and hasn't been back since.
Jinwu: I gave her three extra hours, knowing that dumb habit she has of running around everywhere... But it's been at least five or six hours since.
Jinwu: Could you help me look for her? That kid really respects you, so you should have an easier time... and I don't want to have anyone get in trouble on my watch again.
Paimon: Gah, what's with her, running off again like that?
Traveler: Alright, I'll go.
Jinwu: Ah, yes! Silly me, I almost forgot to tell you the most important thing!
Jinwu: She probably didn't go too far, but at the same time, where would she go...?
Paimon: Alright, don't worry about it, Jinwu! We'll head over to the places where we placed the beacons yesterday first!
Traveler: That's a pretty good call, Paimon.
Jinwu: Alright... alright then. If you find her, please inform me as soon as possible.
Traveler: Where might she be?

## Talk 2

Jinwu: ...
Jinwu: Eh? Oh, my bad. There were some things on my mind. Sorry...
Jinwu: I have to give Zhiqiong a good talking-to...
Jinwu: It's not like I haven't seen kids like her while working in the mines all these years...
Jinwu: There are too many who, like her, see adventure as some kind of noble pursuit, only to see their hopes shattered... and find that it is too late to regret their choices.
Jinwu: And yet, who am I to judge? *sigh* How could a Violetgrass lodged in a cliff's cleft criticize a bird for its way of life?
Jinwu: And yet, how can I just let it go like... *cough* You know what? Maybe stopping her is the wrong thing to do. I mean, she's an adult who can take care of herself already, isn't she?
Traveler: She'll be fine.
Jinwu: I suppose... I hope you're right.
Traveler: She won't regret her decisions.

## Talk 3

Jinwu: How's Zhiqiong? Have you found her?
Traveler: I'm still looking.
Jinwu: Alright, but please, find her soon. If something happens...
Traveler: We haven't found her yet.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Uh oh! She's not looking so good! C'mon, we've got to get her out of here, quick!
Traveler: Can you still walk?
Traveler: Don't worry, I'll take you back.
Zhiqiong: Sorry... I'm sorry, Jinwu... and... *cough*
Zhiqiong: Don't look at me... *cough* Don't look at me like that. Please, don't be disappointed in us... *cough*
Zhiqiong: The golden city... The black watchtower...! *cough* The heavenly envoys have left...!
Paimon: Cut it with the nonsense, you!

## Talk 5

Jinwu: Khedive's given her some medicine... and she's regained consciousness, but she won't tell me anything.
Jinwu: Do you know what happened? How did she end up like... that?
Traveler: She was trapped in the black mud when we found her.
Paimon: That's right, and we got her out just in time!
Jinwu: ...
Jinwu: Never mind that for now. What Zhiqiong needs now is rest. Could you help me deliver this bowl of soup to her while it's still hot?
Jinwu: I'm not a very good cook, but I've had to take care of my fair share of miners, and no one's ever said my fare was bad.
Jinwu: Alright, go then. See if she's any better.
Jinwu: I have to tell Muning that Zhiqiong can't stay underground anymore.

## Talk 6

Zhiqiong: *cough* *cough* I'm sorry...
Paimon: Oh, so you're sorry now, and not when you were running around all over the place, huh!?
Traveler: Alright, give it a rest, Paimon...
Zhiqiong: *cough* Hah... I lost my footing... by mistake... funny, huh? *cough*
Paimon: Nope, it's not funny at all! Is your life really worth so little to you!?
Traveler: You need rest. Jinwu made you some soup.

## Talk 7

Zhiqiong: Jinwu made this...? Thank you... and please help me thank Jinwu and the others, too.
Zhiqiong: I'll be fine, I just need to get some sleep and I'll be good as new...
Zhiqiong: I'm really very sorry... *cough* Could you please come back again in a bit?

## Talk 8

Khedive: How's Zhiqiong...
Khedive: Zhiqiong's condition has worsened. What on earth is she being so stubborn about, honestly...
Khedive: I gave her some medicine. It should be able to at least slow some of the more serious symptoms, so her situation is stabilizing...
Khedive: I'm no adventurer, and I can't claim to understand their desires, but I have no wish to watch someone else suffer before my eyes like this...
Khedive: *sigh* Forget it. I hope she's more amenable to your logic.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Zhiqiong: Hello there! Have a seat.
Traveler: So, about our previous adventure...
Zhiqiong: Ah, are you trying to ask why I was so stubborn or why I gave everyone so much trouble? Haha, come on, I know I was wrong... you don't have to keep harping on it...
Zhiqiong: But to be honest, I suspect that it's in our nature as adventurers to be fascinated with danger.
Zhiqiong: I mean, we were born with strong backs and agile limbs. It just feels... wrong, you know? To have these tools but be content with a placid existence.
Zhiqiong: As for mortal peril, it's not that I haven't given it any consideration, but... Hmm, could I ask you a question?
Traveler: Ask away.
Zhiqiong: The famous adventurer Stanley of Mondstadt is so famed because he passed through the Mare Jivari, but he lost a dear friend during that adventure.
Zhiqiong: Even though few people know what the name of that friend was, the memory of him stays with us adventurers because he went on that adventure.
Zhiqiong: I was thinking... and please, don't laugh if you find me immature. Do you think that this friend of Stanley's, who did not return, has not in fact passed on, but instead can be said to be truly "alive"?
Traveler: The only thing that matters is life itself.
Zhiqiong: But to be remembered... Even if you were to pass on early, would that not be considered an extension of your life?
Zhiqiong: You would live on in a different fashion, in the admiration, memories... in the eyes of others.
Traveler: Don't be so concerned about what other people think.
Zhiqiong: That's what a lot of people have told me. "Be yourself," "just do your job"... These things sound like guidance, but really, they're asking me to give up.
Zhiqiong: I've said before, I think, but I don't go on adventures for anyone else... or for myself, even.
Zhiqiong: Hmm, have you thought about this before?
Zhiqiong: This world has been ordered by the gods, and though we ordinary mortals have not been given "eyes" by them, we nonetheless do not wish to go quietly and be forgotten just like that.
Zhiqiong: I believe that this discontent is not meaningless, and that's why I go around exploring dangerous areas. I mean...
Zhiqiong: I mean, to wrestle with things that even the gods would fear with our frail forms... isn't that what makes us "human"? That's what I believe.
Traveler: Still, you're not the only person who has the right to bestow meaning upon an adventure.
Zhiqiong: I know... I won't forget the help everyone gave me... and I won't forget the trouble I caused you, either. This adventure, after all, wasn't undertaken by me alone.
Zhiqiong: Isn't that what adventurers are?
Traveler: Back to playing the hero now, are we?
Zhiqiong: Heh, I'm still a long way off from where you are... Rather than a "hero," I'd call myself someone who "isn't afraid of dying so that they might truly live."
Zhiqiong: This was something that a senior from Sumeru told me, and she herself heard it from the Eremites.
Zhiqiong: That makes sense...
Paimon: Well, Paimon thinks you're more like "someone who keeps chasing after misfortune"!
Traveler: I suppose being remembered is also a form of success.
Zhiqiong: Well... I've never thought of living a "successful" life. Rather, even if I "fail," I would like to leave an impression on others.
Zhiqiong: At least they would say, "Zhiqiong also did once face the challenges of The Chasm!"
Zhiqiong: At least then, I wouldn't be forgotten like those who sacrificed themselves in deserted places, or... you know, like me now.
Traveler: I've never thought about this issue.
Zhiqiong: Is that so...? I guess that might be because an outsider like you naturally becomes the topic of conversation no matter where you go.
Zhiqiong: I suppose it's like how children born with golden spoons in their mouths might find the idea of poverty to be an exciting, but ultimately unnecessary, avenue for adventure.
Zhiqiong: Ah, uh, sorry... I didn't mean it like that. I was just saying... Never mind. Just forget I said anything.
