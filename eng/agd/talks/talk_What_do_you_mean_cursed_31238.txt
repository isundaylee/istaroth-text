Traveler: What do you mean "cursed..."?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: I'm not sure how it came to be, but the whole place is shrouded in a cursed fog. Even those with a Vision are only able to stay a short while before being forced out.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: With that said, *the chests here* are said to contain items that will help you to resist the fog's curse and *increase your time in the maze*! Some of the chests being guarded by monsters can only be opened *after the monster is defeated*. If you're going to give it a go, make sure to *pay attention to the time*!
