# The Four at Loggerheads


## Talk 1

Paimon: Alhaitham went that way â€” let's hurry up and follow him. Wonder what he's up to...

## Talk 2

Eremite Mercenary: #What the? Where did {M#he}{F#she} go!?
Eremite Mercenary: Ugh, how did we lose 'em? They were just here a second ago...
Paimon: More Eremite mercenaries? Who're they working for this time... Anyway, Traveler, it seems like we were being followed again!
Alhaitham: You were too careless. You should have noticed those hopeless amateurs trailing you a long time ago.
Traveler: Thanks, Alhaitham.
Alhaitham: There's no need to thank me. I've never cared to keep track of personal favors.
Alhaitham: All I did was correct a mistake I happened to come across. It's a habit I developed at the Akademiya.
Paimon: You really gave Paimon a scare, Alhaitham! We never thought we'd run into you here.
Paimon: Last time we met at Port Ormos, didn't you say you were going back to the Akademiya? Wait... don't tell Paimon that you're here to take us back on their orders!
Alhaitham: Oh, so you've already landed yourselves on the Akademiya's hit list? Haha, I can't say that I didn't expect it.
Alhaitham: However, had I wished to turn you over to the Akademiya, don't you think you'd already be the Eremites' honored guests by now?
Paimon: Oh, right... You do have a point.
Traveler: Did you participate in the sages' big project?
Alhaitham: I have no interest in running errands for that project. As a scholar, I've always belonged to the camp that promotes researcher autonomy.
Alhaitham: And these days, you are more fascinating than anything the sages can offer.
Traveler: So, you were actually looking for me?
Alhaitham: Hmm, not quite. To tell you the truth... I'm still investigating the Divine Knowledge Capsule. Unfortunately, I've run into some difficulties.
Alhaitham: Everyone says the capsule originated in the desert and was eventually moved to Port Ormos. If I am to get to the bottom of this, I must understand how the capsule first came to be.
Alhaitham: Which brings me back to you, and why you're so interesting.
Alhaitham: The leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar used the Divine Knowledge Capsule right in front of you, and upon seeing him, your expression became perplexed, and you were lost in thought for quite some time.
Alhaitham: To have that kind of reaction, I think you must have realized something. Are you interested at all in sharing what you've been hiding from me?
Traveler: (It must be because I was so shocked to hear those words again... "world... forget me...")
Paimon: Alhaitham, you really have a ridiculous eye for detail! What kind of person even notices and remembers stuff like that...
Traveler: The situation is a little complicated.
Alhaitham: So that's your answer... Well, I do work for the Akademiya after all. So considering that, it is indeed wise to keep your cards close to your chest.
Alhaitham: But that does prove you do have some undisclosed information about the Divine Knowledge Capsule. Am I right?
Traveler: ...
Alhaitham: No matter. Rather than simply learning the answers from you, I'd still prefer to investigate on my own. Speaking of, you two are also headed to the desert?
Paimon: That's right, we have the same plan as you. But we don't really have any concrete goals at the moment...
Alhaitham: Then I'd suggest starting with Aaru Village. It's the largest settlement in the desert, so it'll probably have more resources and intel than anywhere else. Well? Would you like to head there together?
Traveler: Sounds good.
Paimon: It's always better to travel with someone you know. Let's go!
Traveler: Let's head there together then.
Traveler: I can't share what I know just yet.
Traveler: We couldn't have shaken them without you.

## Talk 3

Cyno: ...
Alhaitham: ...
Dehya: ...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Well, this is pretty awkward...
Paimon: "Hey, wanna play sardines with three people who wanna tear each other limb from limb?" "Sure, why not, sounds fun!"...
Paimon: Ah... The air's so thick and heavy, Paimon can hardly keep floating anymore...
Candace: My sincere apologies, everyone. This is the home of our village chief. I will have to ask you to make do with this small room until the sandstorm dies down.
Candace: Please let me introduce myself. I am Candace, protector of Aaru Village.
Paimon: Ah, our savior has come at last!
Paimon: Nice to meet you, Candace! The name's Paimon! Thank you so much for helping us!
Traveler: You have my gratitude.
Candace: Hehe, there's no need to thank me. It's only right to help each other when the weather gets rough.
Paimon: Wow... She's so gentle and caring, like a nice older sister! ...Unlike those guys over there.
Candace: Alright, now that we're all better acquainted, we should return to the topic at hand.
Candace: As a guardian charged with the responsibility to protect my fellow villagers from harm, I was observing your conflict from afar, even before the sandstorm started.
Candace: And now that you have set foot within Aaru Village itself, it is all the more my responsibility to make absolutely sure that you pose no threat whatsoever to us.
Candace: So please, have an honest and sincere conversation with one another, and put your hostile feelings to rest.
Candace: If anyone dares to start anything again while they are under this roof... I will not hesitate to send them out for some quality time with the creatures of the sandstorm.
Paimon: Oh, uh... On second thought, Paimon may have misjudged Candace's character.
Dehya: Hmph...
Candace: And that goes for you too, Miss Dehya.
Candace: Do I make myself clear?
Dehya: *sigh*... Alright, we got it, Candace.
Candace: Hehe, that's what I like to hear. So, which of you will begin?
Dehya: I was supposed to be a mediator, but uh... I might've gotten a little too involved just now. Anyway, one of those two should probably start talking.
Paimon: Wait, that was you trying to be a mediator?
Cyno: ...
Cyno: I have nothing to hide, so there is no shame in explaining myself.
Cyno: While Alhaitham wasn't wrong about the other matra not knowing my whereabouts, it's not because I've been assigned a morally dubious mission.
Cyno: Rather... I've chosen to exile myself.
Paimon: Huh? Exile yourself?
Cyno: A little while ago, I discovered that there was data missing in the Akademiya's project planning and development files. What little they did report clearly did not match the project's actual progress.
Cyno: As General Mahamatra, I had the responsibility and authority to request an audit. However, to my surprise, the person responsible for the erroneous data was none other than Grand Sage Azar himself.
Cyno: I tried to investigate the issue myself before submitting a formal audit request, but I soon found that all leads and potential pieces of incriminating evidence were carefully concealed from me.
Cyno: I began to realize that... they were cautious of me from the very beginning.
Cyno: Unsurprisingly, the Grand Sage rejected my audit request as soon as the submission reached his desk. He even said to me:
Cyno: "The power of the General Mahamatra is granted by the sages. You have no right to judge us."
Alhaitham: So they really are up to no good.
Cyno: I realized then that to the Grand Sage, the matra are nothing more than tools for the sages to assert and maintain their control over knowledge.
Cyno: The vows that we took, the principles that we strive to uphold... They are meaningless to the Akademiya of today.
Traveler: So you then decided to exile yourself?
Cyno: I believed it would be wise to flee the Akademiya before the sages had a chance to take action against me. This way, they can no longer see nor predict my actions.
Cyno: I will never give up on this investigation... There's no need for someone else to give me power or authority. Once I find the truth, I will administer judgment by my own name.
Paimon: Cyno seems to have the same goal as us... We're all investigating the sages!
Paimon: Plus, now that he's no longer the General Mahamatra, he somehow feels a lot less scary!
Traveler: (It's still too early to trust him completely...)
Paimon: Well, Cyno, if that's your story, then why did you see Alhaitham as a target?
Cyno: When I was investigating the matter in the Akademiya, I overheard a conversation between Alhaitham and a sage.
Cyno: #The sages asked you to investigate a {M#blond}{F#blonde}-haired Traveler. Do you dispute this, Alhaitham?
Paimon: What!?
Cyno: Like many parts of the project, this assignment was undocumented. Now, throw in your suspicious behavior with the Divine Knowledge Capsule, and I think we deserve an explanation.
Traveler: From the very beginning, Alhaitham was...
Alhaitham: Yes, I was indeed tasked with investigating the Traveler.
Paimon: Alhaitham!
Alhaitham: After all, the promised reward was so great that hardly any scholar could have refused. The sage told me, "Once you've completed this assignment, I can give you a glimpse of divine knowledge."
Cyno: A most enticing offer.
Alhaitham: Unfortunately, those academics don't know me at all.
Alhaitham: Their words contained one key piece of information, namely that "Divine Knowledge" indeed exists. That gave me all I needed to know.
Alhaitham: From my perspective, the sages are far from trustworthy. Think about it: Isn't it a little strange that they're so willing to share Divine Knowledge with anyone, even as a reward?
Alhaitham: So, I began my own investigation following the lead of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. In the end, I realized my wisdom in committing to this rather than collaborating with the sages.
Alhaitham: Had I been less guarded, I probably would have ended up like that Ayn Al-Ahmar mercenary, incapable of remaining sane for long enough to hold a conversation.
Cyno: You mean that the sages originally planned to dispose of you using one of those capsules that drive people insane?
Traveler: What about your encounter with me?
Alhaitham: I'd already given up on the assignment by then. I only told the Akademiya I was waiting in Port Ormos for you to appear so that they wouldn't suspect anything.
Alhaitham: So it came as quite a surprise when I encountered my erstwhile target while investigating the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Cyno: Criminals do love to talk about "coincidences."
Alhaitham: #Even though I ran into {NICKNAME} by chance, I had no intention of providing assistance to the Akademiya. Also, you should remember...
Alhaitham: You were the ones who decided to follow me and strike up a conversation after I left that tavern.
Traveler: Now that you mention it, things did go like that...
Paimon: That's true... Alhaitham helped us out at Caravan Ribat as well. Maybe he's telling the truth?
Alhaitham: I'm willing to apologize, if that's worth anything to you.
Alhaitham: I took the Divine Knowledge Capsule behind your back because I judged its existence to be a significant risk. I felt that it would be best for no one to interact with it before it had been properly studied.
Alhaitham: After all, curiosity often proves to be the most dangerous thing in this land.
Cyno: You should be well aware, Scribe Alhaitham, that curiosity can also lead you to danger and suspicion.
Cyno: Answer me this: Did the sages share any information about their project with you?
Alhaitham: Have I not made myself clear? You and I are both distrusted by the Akademiya. Do you really think they would tell me anything?
Cyno: ...Fine. Although you haven't completely proven your innocence, I won't regard you as an enemy for now.
Alhaitham: As you wish.
Candace: Mmâ€”hmm, good. I'm glad to see you two clearing up your misunderstandings.
Candace: And now you, Dehya. I believe it's your turn.
Dehya: ...Oh, sorry. Whatever the boys were talking about must have been so boring that I spaced out.
Dehya: Ahem... My situation is pretty straightforward. My employer, Dunyarzad of the Homayani family, is friends with the Traveler and is currently recovering from her illness at home.
Dehya: I had nothing going on, so I decided to return to Aaru Village for a visit. I was actually looking forward to a pretty exciting time getting back together with everyone here...
Dehya: But then I saw these two random guys in the middle of a pointless argument. It ticked me off, and things went downhill from there...
Candace: Is that all? Well, I will admit that definitely sounds like your style. In that case, welcome back, Dehya!
Dehya: That's more like it! I missed you all so much, Candace...
Rifthound: *growl*
Paimon: Whoa! What was that sound?
Candace: No need to worry. Now that you're no longer at each other's throats, please make yourselves at home. I'll take a quick trip outside to clear out some of those creatures in the sandstorm.
Paimon: Câ€”Creatures in the sandstorm...? Uh, are you sure you don't want some backup?
Candace: Fighting in a sandstorm is not for the fainthearted. Anyone without extensive training in these conditions is at a disadvantage. You needn't worry.
Dehya: Yeah, just leave them to Candace. Don't worry, she's as tough as they come.
Black Screen Text: After a while, the winds outside begin to calm.
Paimon: The winds died down... That means the sandstorm's over, right?
Paimon: Candace still isn't back yet, though. Is she alright? Maybe we should go out and check on her.
Dehya: When you put it that way, even I'm starting to feel a little worried... Alright, let's go. We've been here long enough, and the boys are as chatty as the floor.
Traveler: Is that enough to prove his innocence...?
Traveler: Did you join forces with me just so you could investigate me?
Traveler: The sages were watching me from the very beginning...
Traveler: (What if that whole story was just made up?)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Whoa... Candace, you're still fighting? You've been out here dealing with these creatures the entire time?
Candace: Yes, they just keep coming in waves... I've lost count of how many I've defeated. Before I realized it, even the sandstorm had stopped...
Traveler: Not only is she really strong...
Paimon: Eek, here comes another wave!
Dehya: Leave this round to us! I got interrupted earlier, but now I have something to take my anger out on!
Candace: Hehe, it's been quite a while since I've seen the Flame-Mane in action. I'll leave these to you then.
Dehya: #I'll be sure to put on a good show! {NICKNAME}, let's go!
Traveler: Her stamina is also something else...

## Talk 5

Paimon: The creatures stopped appearing. Was that the last of them?
Candace: What we fought just now was probably the aftermath of the sandstorm, so we should be safe for the time being.
Uncle Anpu: Well fought, everyone. No injuries, I hope?
Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Uncle Anpu: Ah, my apologies, I haven't had a chance to greet you yet. I had my hands full taking care of the village's elderly and children.
Uncle Anpu: I am the chief of Aaru Village. Everyone usually calls me Uncle Anpu.
Traveler: It's a pleasure to meet you.
Cyno: Sir, I am also originally from the desert, but I have not been back for some time now. May I ask if such sandstorms are common?
Uncle Anpu: I can't say they've always been common, but recently, the storms have become increasingly severe and frequent.
Uncle Anpu: Besides sandstorms, we also occasionally get earthquakes... According to an investigator who stayed in the village a while ago, these unusual natural phenomena are related to the withering of Irminsul.
Paimon: Hmm, another effect of Irminsul's withering...
Paimon: So... Irminsul's withering causes Withering Zones in the forest, and sandstorms and earthquakes here in the desert?
Alhaitham: Everything in the natural world is inextricably connected to Irminsul. These "regional symptoms" can indeed be a reflection of Irminsul's present state.
Dehya: *sigh* Everyone in Aaru Village needs to take good care of themselves.
Dehya: Uh, speaking of which, why haven't I seen a single Village Keeper since I got here?
Paimon: Village Keeper? Who are they? Village guards like Candace?
Cyno: Does your curiosity know no bounds... "Village Keeper" is how Aaru Village refers to mad scholars exiled here by the Akademiya.
Cyno: Most of them are scholars who lost their sanity after a period of training in the Avidya Forest.
Cyno: The Akademiya believes that their crazed mutterings may have a negative effect on the psyches of other scholars, so they're forcibly exiled to the desert... Though if you ask me, it's all a boatload of nonsense.
Traveler: Tighnari also brought this up before...
Uncle Anpu: Alas, that's exactly what we've been trying to investigate. One by one, the Village Keepers have been mysteriously disappearing without a trace...
Uncle Anpu: But no one in the village has ever seen them leave... If you're planning to stay around the village for the next few days, I'd appreciate it if you could keep an eye out for them.
Cyno: ...I've had encounters with those people in the past. I'll see what I can do to help.
Alhaitham: The matra are the ones responsible for their exile. Now that you're no longer with them, are you trying to alleviate your guilt and atone for your past sins? I'm fascinated by how you think.
Cyno: Mock me if you will. But if you are guilty, I will eliminate you, regardless of my position or identity.
Uncle Anpu: Oh, you're the former General Mahamatra? You must be an expert in these kinds of investigations. Thank you for your help.
Traveler: I'll help, too.
Paimon: #Is it because you're reminded of Haypasia, {NICKNAME}? These poor scholars, first they lose their sanity, now this... We need to help get them back home, safe and sound.
Paimon: But, uh... Is it really a good idea to tag along with Cyno? You seem like you really don't trust him.
Traveler: That's why this is a great opportunity to watch him.
Cyno: I'll be grateful for the assistance. No doubt you will do a better job than some of my former subordinates.
Cyno: Let's start by finding a spot to share what we know so far.
Traveler: It'll be fine. Dehya and the others are here, too.
Traveler: Haypasia was also nearly exiled to the desert.
Traveler: Sorry for all the trouble.

## Talk 6

Cyno: Although I've sent myself into exile, I'm still doing essentially the same things as before...
Cyno: Do you still have any questions for me before we start our investigation?
Traveler: Why do they refer to the mad scholars as Village Keepers?
Cyno: One of my former subordinates told me that this title has its origins in a strange incident.
Cyno: The Akademiya has long exiled mad scholars to Aaru Village. A mysterious phenomenon exists here...
Cyno: When mad scholars first arrive, they are as incoherent and deranged as before. But after spending some time here, they invariably begin to calm down.
Cyno: Initially, the people of Aaru Village greatly resented having to take in the mad scholars. But a strange incident one night changed that...
Cyno: Aaru Village was struck by the strongest earthquake in living memory. Seeing buildings on the verge of collapse all around him, the then chief of the village was preparing to take everyone to safety...
Cyno: Suddenly, he noticed a mad scholar crouching in a corner, caressing the ground with his hands. A soft, green light radiated from him, like a divine glow against the backdrop of night.
Cyno: Despite the powerful tremors that ripped through the ground that night, all the houses remained upright, almost as if they had grown roots reaching deep into the ground. In the end, not a single building collapsed, and no one was hurt.
Cyno: After that, the people of Aaru Village treated the mad scholars with greater kindness, and began to refer to them as the Village Keepers.
Paimon: #A soft, green light... A mad scholar protecting Aaru Village... Hmm, what do you make of it, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: It must have been Nahida's power.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so, too! Actually, Cyno, do you know if any of the mad scholars continued to wear their Akasha Terminals at Aaru Village?
Cyno: In theory, they would continue wearing them so the Akademiya could still monitor their activities. With that said, the main Akasha system would no longer have any interaction with them.
Paimon: Oh, no wonder! Everything makes sense, then! Add in the fact that they calmed down... It was probably Nahida who calmed them...
Cyno: ...If you are able to draw a conclusion from this one story alone, then it appears you possess much more information than I do.
Cyno: So, what do you make of the story?
Traveler: That mad scholar's power likely came from Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Cyno: Really? Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Cyno: Hmm...
Paimon: What, you don't believe us? Lesser Lord Kusanali was definitely using the Akasha to give her power to the mad scholars...
Cyno: No, it's not so much that I don't believe you, I'm just struck by your reasoning...
Cyno: Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon... Is she really active in Sumeru?
Cyno: The Akademiya has always placed far greater importance on the late Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. They've more or less ignored Lesser Lord Kusanali, and I've never had any reason to doubt their views.
Cyno: In addition, I've never heard any stories about Lesser Lord Kusanali and her deeds... To me, she might as well have been a god that never existed.
Paimon: No way, Nahida definitely exists! She's a... How should Paimon put it... She's a good archon who's kind and wise! ...Even if she says weird stuff sometimes!
Traveler: She also saved me once not long ago.
Cyno: I've spent many years interrogating criminals, so I can easily tell when someone is lying.
Paimon: Good! Then you should know that we're telling the truth!
Cyno: That look in your eyes... I've never seen that from a liar. You two really must have met Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Cyno: ...How can this be...
Cyno: To think, our archon has been among us this entire time...
Paimon: Alright, now it's our turn to put our skills to good use for this investigation!
Traveler: You betcha!
Paimon: But easier said than done, especially since we don't have any leads... Hmm... Maybe we can start by knocking on some doors?
Isak: Excuse me, are you here to help me find my grandpa?
Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Cyno: By the sounds of it... a resident of this village.
Isak: Mâ€”My name is Isak... You'll help me find my grandpa, right?
Cyno: Is your grandpa a mad scholar?
Isak: Hey, don't say that! Grandpa is just Grandpa. Why do you have to call him that... It's not like he's a bad person or anything.
Cyno: ...
Cyno: The person you're referring to is not a local, yet you are. Why do you call him "Grandpa"?
Isak: Grandpa is just Grandpa! He's my family.
Isak: I heard everything you said to the village chief. Please, you gotta take me with you! I wanna find my grandpa, I swear I'll help... I won't be a nuisance!
Cyno: Ah, so you're the one who was eavesdropping on us around the village chief's house.
Cyno: I was planning to go out and take care of whoever it was, but I had a vague feeling that they didn't harbor any ill intent...
Paimon: Whoa, Alhaitham wasn't kidding about matra having sharp senses... Cyno, he's just a kid! All he wants is to find his grandpa. Let's find a way to help him!
Isak: Sorry... I was only listening in because I wanted to know where Grandpa went, honest! If you don't believe me, you can ask Miss Candace.
Traveler: Please help him, Cyno.
Cyno: ...Alright. But first, let's confirm the facts with Candace.
Traveler: We saved Sumeru City together in the not-so distant past.
Traveler: Lesser Lord Kusanali was actually the one who protected the village.
Traveler: Only she could be capable of that...

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: As you approach the village chief's house, Cyno asks Isak to wait nearby.
Paimon: Cyno is super vigilant... Is this what all the matra are like?
Candace: Ah, you're back already.
Cyno: We just wanted to confirm something with you. Do you know a boy by the name of Isak?
Candace: Hehe, I had a feeling he'd go looking for you.
Paimon: Huh? You knew this would happen?
Candace: Yes. Although he tried his best to stay hidden, I still noticed him eavesdropping outside the window. He really wants to get his grandfather back.
Candace: Isak's parents were both Eremite mercenaries who rarely returned to the village after finding employment in the city. He was raised by his grandfather.
Candace: Unfortunately, it was only a few years before his grandpa passed away. Isak was still very young at the time, so various families in the village took turns caring for him so he could survive.
Candace: Later, an elderly mad scholar arrived at the village. Isak thought the scholar bore a striking resemblance to his grandfather, and thus often spied on the man.
Candace: However, the scholar was unkempt in appearance and incoherent in speech. Although Isak referred to the man as his "grandpa," he was afraid and didn't dare to approach him.
Candace: One summer night, the oft-mumbling and bumbling "grandpa" suddenly calmed down and seemed to become more lucid. He even noticed Isak hiding in the distance.
Candace: So "Grandpa" walked up to Isak and patted him on the head. He even took Isak to the entrance of the village, where he patiently taught the boy the names of the stars, and accompanied Isak until he fell asleep.
Candace: The next morning, Isak woke up and wanted to go find his "grandpa" again, only to realize his grandpa no longer recognized him. However, even so, Grandpa retained his calm expression.
Candace: It's said that those who saw the scholar claimed he no longer appeared to be crazy, but appeared to be living in his own world, almost as if he were sleepwalking.
Candace: Isak was thrilled that his "grandpa" was able to find peace, and would follow him all the time asking him things like, "Grandpa, want me to take you somewhere fun?" or "Grandpa, could you tell me stories about the stars again?"
Paimon: All this somehow just makes Paimon feel really sad... It seems like they both deserve so much better...
Candace: Perhaps. Nearly everyone who lives in the desert has some form of hardship or regret. But even so, we must still continue on with our lives.
Candace: It's also my reason for fighting. I must continue to protect this land.
Traveler: ("Lucid grandpa" was probably Nahida... She must have soothed the other mad scholars as well.)
Cyno: ...
Traveler: (From the look on Cyno's face, he's probably connected the dots as well.)
Cyno: Maybe the people have always had a considerate god watching over them.
Paimon: Huh? What did you say, Cyno?
Cyno: No, nothing. As long as Isak keeps his word and doesn't get in our way, we can take him along.
Candace: Perhaps you are more compassionate than I gave you credit for. Please accept my thanks on Isak's behalf, Cyno.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey, Isak!
Isak: Ah, it's you guys!
Paimon: We've cleared everything up! Let's go find your grandpa!
Isak: Really!? Wow, thank you so much!
Traveler: Your grandpa will be found safe and sound.
Isak: Yeah!
Cyno: Alright, let's ask the local residents some questions first.
