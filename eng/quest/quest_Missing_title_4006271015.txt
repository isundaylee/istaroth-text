# Missing title (4006271015)


## Talk 1

Aranaga: Hello, Nara friend! Um... I was supposed to tell you something, but I don't remember...
Paimon: It's okay. We are just happy to see you again!
Aranaga: Well, thank you.
Traveler: About "Mawtiyima"...
Aranaga: She's not talking anymore, but she's doing well. Recovering too, the forest is... Thank you.
Traveler: About forgetting...
Aranaga: Forgetting...? Oh, because the power has been depleted, the Kusava. That's why it will flow away too, memory. Drop by drop, like dewdrops...

## Talk 2

Aranakin: Hello, hello!
Paimon: Hello, little one! Still remember us?
Aranakin: Darn White Floaty! I'm not a little one! Do you still remember the song I taught you?
Traveler: Of course.
Aranakin: Yes!
Aranakin: Then promise me that even if I forget my song... you'll remember it!

## Talk 3

Aragaru: Hello, and thank you! Golden Nara and White Floaty!
Aragaru: What are you guys doing here?
Paimon: You said to remember to come back and play together!
Aragaru: Oh, did I say that...?
Traveler: You did say that.
Aragaru: I see...
Aragaru: Anyway, thank you!
Traveler: What, are you upset?
Aragaru: Mm... No.

## Talk 4

Aranaga: Hello, Golden Nara and White Floaty!
Paimon: Hi! How've you been?
Aranaga: Good! But why did you come here?
Paimon: Huh...?
Aranaga: Well... It's troubling us. There must be a reason, but why you came here, I don't know...
Paimon: We're familiar with this place after all the adventures we had with you guys!
Aranaga: Oh... Really?
Paimon: He doesn't remember our past experiences...

## Talk 5

Aranakin: Hello, Golden Nara! And you, Little White Floaty!
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon is not little! Take a look in the mirror!
Aranakin: Hey, I'm not little either! Oh, right, what are you doing here?
Traveler: We just came back to see you guys.
Paimon: Yeah, we defeated a lot of bad guys in the past after all, and we sang together, and saved "M—Mootaya" together...
Aranakin: Mawtiyima!
Paimon: Yeah!
Aranakin: Oh... Sorry... What you guys are saying must be true, but I don't remember...
Paimon: Um...! I—It's okay! Don't be sad!
Paimon: (He really doesn't remember...)

### Additional Talk 1

Aragaru: Golden Nara, White Floaty! You're here!
Paimon: Yeah! We're here!
Aragaru: Hehehe... I probably forgot many things, so I need you to remind me...
Traveler: Is it because of the Kusava?
Aragaru: Yes... Aranaga should have mentioned it to you. Power is in memory, and no memory means no power...
Aragaru: So... We must have experienced something in the past, but we don't remember anymore...
Aragaru: Haha, but it's nothing to me! We can still start making new memories again, right?
Paimon: Yes! That's the spirit!
