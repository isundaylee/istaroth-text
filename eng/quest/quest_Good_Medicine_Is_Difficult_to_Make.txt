# Good Medicine Is Difficult to Make


## Talk 1

Zakariya: Oh! Traveler! Come over here, I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Traveler: What happened?
Zakariya: Do you remember Maruf, the doctor from Aaru Village? He sent you to get a prescription from me last time.
Zakariya: The poor guy brewed a medicine, tasted it, and ended up retching and vomiting for days.
Zakariya: He said that the original prescription didn't work, so he sought to improve it.
Zakariya: What in Teyvat did he do to find himself in this miserable state?
Zakariya: *sigh* He must've done more than just adjusting the brewing method and modifying the amount of ingredients used.
Zakariya: This is not the first time it's happened. Maruf just can't learn his lesson, can he?
Zakariya: Forget it. Perhaps he ran into some difficulties.
Zakariya: Traveler, could you get some raw ingredients for me? I'll brew a soup myself. Please bring it to Maruf.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Zakariya: Maruf adjusted the prescription that I gave him for treating headaches.
Zakariya: I still need three Henna Berries. Could you get them for me?
Traveler: You mean he's done something like this before?
Zakariya: Yeah, I can't remember how many times. Luckily, he seldom handles poisonous ingredients. Otherwise...

Traveler: Are you sure we're using Scarabs to make the medicine?
Zakariya: Relax, I won't throw an entire bug into the soup, but some parts are useful.
Zakariya: I'm counting on you, Traveler. Do bring me the ingredients.
Traveler: You mean he's done something like this before?
Zakariya: Yeah, I can't remember how many times. Luckily, he seldom handles poisonous ingredients. Otherwise...

Maruf: T—Traveler, what brings you here?
Traveler: Zakariya sent me here.
Maruf: So you must've heard about the mess I've made. This is embarrassing...

Maruf: Phew... I feel much better. Zakariya's indeed a great doctor.
Traveler: Why did you modify the prescription?
Maruf: Do you remember the medicine we brewed together last time? It didn't work very well.
Maruf: I thought I might've boiled it the wrong way or missed a few ingredients.
Maruf: So I... Um... made another bowl based on my experience.
Maruf: I tried it first as a reasonable precaution, and I believe you know the rest.
Maruf: I just sent someone to get some medicine for me from Dr. Zakariya, but you beat him to the punch.
Maruf: Thank you, Traveler. I'm going to get some rest now. After that I'll have to start receiving patients again.
Maruf: I've been absent for so long... Many villagers must be waiting.
Maruf: *sigh* But I'm running out of herbs again...
