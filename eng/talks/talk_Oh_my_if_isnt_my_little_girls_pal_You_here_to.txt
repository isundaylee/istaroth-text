Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh my, if isn't my little girl's pal? You here to hang out with her again?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I've heard that the two of you brought a new friend along. Heard that it's some cute little red kid, too. Make sure you two give her the tour, eh?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: And once the festival ban on pyrotechnics comes down, get Yoimiya to make her a special custom firework, haha!
