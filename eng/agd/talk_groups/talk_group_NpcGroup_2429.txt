Qiaoxi: I can't cope...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Qiaoxi: Hmm? Who goes there? All who wish to cross this bridge are subject to interrogation, those are the rules.
Qiaoxi: That said... Just look at what you're wearing! You're definitely not someone I need to worry about...
Qiaoxi: Why? Think about it — criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no? You, on the other hand, are dressed most ostentatiously indeed.
Qiaoxi: What are you doing here?
Qiaoxi: I am the Millelith responsible for this zone. This is a major thoroughfare to Dihua Marsh. Merchants and tourists all pass this way, so I'm stationed here to stand guard.
Qiaoxi: But this zone is much too big for one person. Just the other day, I discovered a group of monsters nearby...
Qiaoxi: It appears they've set up a camp, and although they haven't made a move yet it's definitely a safety risk. I need to keep an eye on them.
Qiaoxi: I'd happily go and clear them out — except, I worry that if I left my post here, some other monsters would seize the chance to ambush passers-by. I feel so helpless, stuck here all day...
Qiaoxi: Can you go and sort out the monsters over there for me? It would free me up to concentrate on other matters...

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy.
Qiaoxi: Oh? No big deal, I'll work something out. With any luck, the higher-ups will send me some backup within the next few days...

## Talk 3

Qiaoxi: Normally, everyone who wishes to cross this bridge is subject to interrogation.
Qiaoxi: But given your exotic attire, you don't strike me as a suspicious character. I'll let you off.

Traveler: Exotic attire?
Qiaoxi: Yes. You're dressed very ostentatiously indeed... So you're definitely not someone to worry about.
Qiaoxi: Think about it. Criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no?
Qiaoxi: That's based on my experience guarding this bridge, in any case.
Traveler: Tell me about your work.
Qiaoxi: As long as this bridge is here, someone needs to guard it! We can't afford to let our guard down, not for one second.
Qiaoxi: The bridge is a major thoroughfare. So to be handed the job of guarding it is the highest recognition I could ask for.
Qiaoxi: I will never let our enemies have their way, even if it costs me my life!

### Talk 3 related talk 1

Traveler: Have you seen someone who looks a lot like me?
Qiaoxi: Does the person you want to find dress as... uniquely as you?
Qiaoxi: In that case, I've never seen anyone like that. But if they do, that should definitely leave an impression.
Qiaoxi: I remember everyone who crosses this bridge, never mind someone with such an unusual appearance.
Qiaoxi: I'll keep a look out on your behalf. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
