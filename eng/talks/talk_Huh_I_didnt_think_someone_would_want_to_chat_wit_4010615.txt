Hunayn: Huh? I didn't think someone would want to chat with me even now. Aren't you joining in on the Akademiya Extravaganza?
Hunayn: Hmm... What fun events are there... Truth be told, I'm not one for such occasions, so I can't say.
Hunayn: However, I don't dislike these celebratory events. The more students join in such galas, the quieter things are over here.
