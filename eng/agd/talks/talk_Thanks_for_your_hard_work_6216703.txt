Traveler: Thanks for your hard work.
Jiaming: Well, it's not like it can be helped. Better safe than sorry, as they say. In any case, we can't have another disaster here at The Chasm. We owe you a ton of thanks as well for solving the problem this time. Though I stand guard here, I do so with a hopeful heart for our future.
