Jonvelle: Hmm, if we go with this angle, the Flowcurrent Birds... Ah, hello there. Is something the matter?
Traveler: Still taking pictures?
Jonvelle: Why, yes indeed! I've gotten the pictures I wanted, but since the costs of traveling from Fontaine to Natlan aren't cheap...
Jonvelle: I might as well take a few extra shots, right?
Traveler: What do you like about Flowcurrent Birds, exactly?
Jonvelle: Ah, many things! Some love their feet, some their feathers...
Jonvelle: But if you ask me, their most attractive trait is the way their feathers glisten under the sunlight when they emerge from the water.
Jonvelle: In that moment, their feathers look so eminently... fluffable!
Traveler: Nothing in particular. See you around.
Jonvelle: See you!
