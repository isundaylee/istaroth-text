## Talk 1

Nightsoul Spirit: What, ho... To think you could find this entrance. Long has it been since any have come hither...
Nightsoul Spirit: This... Mm, yes, this is where the Nightsouls roam, though afeared am I that none now live on the sun-kissed earth who recall their names or deeds.
Nightsoul Spirit: Ah, Nightsouls... While our mistress slumbers, we are her dreams. When our goddess awakens ever and anon, we are but single strains of her mind.
Nightsoul Spirit: That a living person should set foot here... Haha, those overcome by their battle-craving can hold back no longer... Outlander warrior, you who are much beloved...
Nightsoul Spirit: Still these unquiet souls to slumber soundly with the blaze of battle and triumph, and be rewarded... What say you?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Give me some time to prepare...
Nightsoul Spirit: That so? 'Tis a shame... But speak unto me should you change your mind...
