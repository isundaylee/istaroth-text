## Talk

Tejima: *sigh* I've circled the village over and over again... I still can't remember anything...
Tejima: Though the people and everything else here feel familiar... something seems to have gone missing ever since I've lost my Vision...

## Talk

Traveler: What happened to your Vision?
Tejima: I turned it in a long time ago... The people from the Tenryou Commission marched up to the village to inspect and confiscate when the Vision Hunt Decree was first announced. I heard that the people who refused to cooperate had a really bad time.
Tejima: *sigh* I thought that I should just stay out of trouble. It wouldn't have been good to trouble the villagers...
Tejima: It's just that... though I only turned the Vision in, I feel like something has gone missing from inside me, too...

## Talk

Traveler: Something from inside you?
Tejima: Like... a kind of enthusiasm or obsession that I had. Maybe that was what has kept me in the village this entire time. But I can't remember any of it anymore...
Tejima: Why did I come here? Why did I stay? What should I be doing right now? What should I do next?
Tejima: Amnesia? No, I couldn't call it that. I know who I am and who everyone is here. I remember every road and everything I've done in the village. I haven't forgotten anything.
Tejima: *sigh* It's just that... All of this feels like they've lost their meaning after I lost the Vision.
Tejima: Never mind, go tend to your own business. I'm just rambling. I'll look around some more and give this some more thought...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Tejima: Do you mean... before? Or now?
Tejima: I helped out the villagers here and drove away Treasure Hoarders who were causing disturbances. Just little things that were within my power — nothing worth mentioning.
Tejima: But I can still vaguely remember that I was waiting here in this village for something important...
Tejima: It's just that I've almost completely forgotten what that was, so I have no idea why I stayed here...
Tejima: *sigh* Oh well... There's no reason to stay if I can't remember the reason for it. I might as well leave and go look around.
Tejima: How about you? You look to be an outlander. What brings you to Inazuma with the Sakoku Decree still in effect?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm here to look for someone.
Tejima: Inazuma has become quite a dangerous place. The person that you're searching for must be very important to you for you to be here right now...
Tejima: You want to speak with the Almighty Shogun? Uh... that really isn't something ordinary villagers like us can help you with. I suggest you ask around in the city.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Tejima: Yea, I should be leaving as well... Goodbye.

## Talk

Tejima: Oh, it's you. How have your travels been?
Tejima: Same old, same old. Though I've been waiting for her for most of my life, I still can't remember her voice or her looks. Something's awfully wrong with my head...

## Talk

Traveler: Don't beat yourself up over this...
Tejima: You know, that's the funny part. I can't even remember how she looks even though I loved her so much. And you'd think I would be sad.
Tejima: But for me, forgetting someone is the same as having all thoughts of them severed. I can't feel anything for them I can't even think of them.
Tejima: She's probably the one that's really sad, seeing as how I've completely forgotten about her...
Tejima: Still, thanks for retrieving those journals. Even though I still have no recollection of her, it's good to know that I was once so determined.
Tejima: I will continue to wait here for her. The me from before wouldn't have wanted to let her down...

## Talk

Traveler: So, any more thoughts about the Vision Hunt Decree?
Tejima: When Lord Kujou came to collect our Visions, he said that this was a necessary step to achieve Eternity.
Tejima: I don't really understand these grand ideals... I'm just an ordinary person. But I guess Eternity is something that never changes?
Tejima: Something that never changes... I feel like I'm very close to becoming something like that...
Tejima: My heart is like stagnant water due to the lack of drive and ambition. I can't feel sadness or happiness. It's like I'm dead inside...
Tejima: I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. All I can do now is to accept it as my way of life.
Tejima: Maybe something will change again if more extraordinary events occur... You know, such as your appearing in our village.

## Talk

Traveler: I wish you good luck. See you again.
Tejima: And good luck to you as well. We'll meet again!

## Talk

Tejima: I remember now. Now that I have my Vision back, I remember everything.
Tejima: I agreed to meet her in Konda Village, and we gave each other an omamori as a sign of that agreement. That's why I've been here all this time.
Tejima: I still remember that when we parted, I promised that I would wait for her forever, and that's how I came to be here. She must have done the same...

## Talk

Traveler: Have you received any news of her?
Tejima: Uh, not yet...
Tejima: But I also wrote my experiences during the time when I had lost my Vision into my diary, just as I had before. When I meet her again, I'll share all of it with her.
Tejima: I'll tell her about you too — about how you managed to reclaim my Vision... or should I say, reclaim "myself."
Tejima: Haha... To be honest, I've only just begun to realize as well that the important thing is not the "wish" itself, but the "right to wish."
Tejima: I thought that all I lost was everything concerning her, but in truth, I had also lost myself — the Tejima who waited, the Tejima who pursued.
Tejima: If not for your help, I might well have spent the rest of my life wandering aimlessly about...

## Talk

Traveler: What do you plan to do from here on out?
Tejima: That's a good question, and it's time I made some detailed plans. If I cannot keep waiting for her, then perhaps I shall leave the village in search of her after all.
Tejima: Before, I wanted to leave because I felt lost. But this time, I'm making a move because I'm sure of what my goals must be.
Tejima: Well, I've spent most of my life waiting to no avail, so I might as well be pro-active from here on out! It's not too late for an old man like me to learn from the determination of the young, is it?
Tejima: As long as I hold my wish dearly in my heart, I will not lose my way. That's what you've taught me, you know?

## Talk

Traveler: All the best to you. See you.
Tejima: See you, youngster. I hope that we will both find the person we are seeking.

## Talk

Traveler: I hope all goes well with you.
Tejima: I hope so too.
Tejima: As for you? Are you going to continue traveling?
Tejima: If so, please take these. These are some experiences from when I was younger that I've written down. Nothing would make me happier than if they could be of use to you.
