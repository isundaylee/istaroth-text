Traveler: Tell me about the sea.
Everallin: Observing the sea is my job, and I love it. While I'm around, you've nothing to fear from storms or showers — I'll warn everyone ahead of time.
Everallin: Oh, right, I didn't say so earlier, but I'm a Melusine — according to Monsieur Neuvillette, we have a deep connection to the ocean.
Everallin: And even amongst us, I'm one of the best at sensing the ocean's movements. That's why I've been assigned to work here.
Everallin: I just need to report on said movements and I don't have to wander out into deep seas, so it's a pretty comfy job.
