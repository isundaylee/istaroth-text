Kuki Shinobu: Don't be too weirded out if you see me with my mask off while we rest. I'm just getting some fresh air.
Kuki Shinobu: This place is way too idle, it gets to you after a while... Got to take some deep breaths.
Kuki Shinobu: Not that I'm rushing you, of course. I'll wait until you've made your preparations in full.

Kuki Shinobu: You can leave the trickier opponents to me.
Kuki Shinobu: You did invite me here, after all, so I'll do my part for the cause, no problem.
Kuki Shinobu: As for what part that'll be exactly, arrange that however you wish. I can handle it.

Kuki Shinobu: I do hope I'll get to read a story about a rebellious princess. You know, the type who sheds her long, cumbersome skirts, and learns equestrianism, swordplay... perhaps even medicine.
Kuki Shinobu: She'll live freely, take to the field to defeat evil personally, and defend the people and nation by her own hand...
Kuki Shinobu: ...Hmm. You know what? I might just write that story myself.
