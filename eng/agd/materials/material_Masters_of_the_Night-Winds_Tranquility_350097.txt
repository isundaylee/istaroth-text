# Masters of the Night-Wind's Tranquility

A small settlement that strives to recreate the scenery of the Masters of the Night-Wind, with buildings laid out to resemble the crest of an Iktomisaurus.
To the eyes of outsiders, the Masters of the Night-Wind are a mysterious and inscrutable tribe, and most assume their shamans to be eccentric and hard to approach — not without good reason, for the environs which the Masters of the Night-Wind inhabit are not somewhere that those of a more conventional disposition would thrive.
Eccentricity aside, these shamans excel at tending to themselves — in addition to their festivals. How else would they be able to meditate in comfort all day long?
This Furnishing Set is favored by the following companions: Ororon, Citlali
