We've arrived at the final phase
The winner of this match
Will take the final spot among the victors!
Give it up for a long-time contender
And first-time finalist from the Children of Echoes
Kachina!
You've got this, Kachina!
And her opponent
From the People of the Springs
A young prodigy and Night Warden Wars veteran
Mualani!
This face-off between old friends
Promises to be an explosive showdown!
May the best warrior win!
You've come so far!
Still nervous?
*sigh*
Why does it have to be you...
Still, I'm glad, in a way
Even if I lose
I won't have any regrets
Come on
Kachina
This is no time to be modest!
I know you want this more than me
And it's about time you start sounding like it, okay?
Mm
I want to win!
Mualani
This one is mine!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Mualani
I'm so sorry!
I went
I went too hard!
Look
The winner is
From the Children of Echoes
Kachina!
