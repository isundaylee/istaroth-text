## Talk

Jinwu: Haha, you're back. Well then, sit down and rest for a bit. Make yourself at home!

## Talk

Traveler: Uh, it's going to be a bit hard to treat this as my home...
Jinwu: Oh come on, you've been here a long time. This place is probably even more familiar than home!
Jinwu: Anyway, this place isn't that bad. There's no sunlight in here, but you don't have to worry about the wind, the frost, or the snow.
Jinwu: In any case, I've been down here in the mines for so long that the surface is really what's unfamiliar to me.

## Talk

Traveler: So, how's the current situation?
Jinwu: Thanks to your help, the atmosphere at the camp has become way more relaxed. If I gave you the impression that I was the overly-serious sort before, I'm very sorry about that.
Jinwu: The important business has already been settled. Now, the long-term work that remains is... setting up a permanent watch underground to check for anymore odd changes.

## Talk

Traveler: As for the future...
Jinwu: During this period, many mines can now be partially opened, but going this far underground is still forbidden.
Jinwu: We need to seal up this area and prevent any miners... No, prevent anyone from coming down here.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Jinwu: Alright then. Stay safe as you adventure out there.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you seen Zhiqiong?
Jinwu: ...I'm afraid not.
Jinwu: Muning's brought some people to help search for her, and they found some secret passages that lead into unknown terrain...
Jinwu: But it's too dangerous to keep on searching. I've no clue where that kid's gone, really.
Jinwu: To be honest, I don't know if I should give her a good hiding or make her soup when she returns...

## Talk

Jinwu: Ah, you're here. What is it? Would you like me to refine your Lumenstone Adjuvant?
Traveler: Refine the Adjuvant
Traveler: See you.

## Talk

Jinwu: Ah, you're here. What is it? Would you like me to refine your Lumenstone Adjuvant?
Traveler: Refine the Adjuvant
Traveler: See you.

## Talk

Jinwu: Ah, you're back.
Jinwu: Hmm, Clitopho? What are you doing here?
Clitopho: Hehe... Well...
Zhiqiong: You know this guy, Jinwu?
Jinwu: Yes. He used to sell fake medicines above ground. He'd go around advertising this "Real Man's Meds" nonsense, only for the workers to buy it and find that it was just Valberry Jam.
Jinwu: Well, not that it was harmful, and it was cheap and pretty tasty. It was chilled in ice, too, so it was, all things considered, a way better deal than drinks purchased from a long way off in the city.
Jinwu: So, you've fallen in with the Treasure Hoarders in the meantime, have you?
Clitopho: Um, you could say that... Kind of. Hehe.
Zhiqiong: How did you know that he...
Jinwu: Haha! You've got a lot to learn, kiddo. I didn't spend 20-odd years of my life down in these mines for nothing, you know?
Jinwu: You can wash the soot off your face, but you can't change the color your hands are dyed.
Jinwu: Alright then. Tell me, what can you do? We don't feed idlers around here.
Traveler: He claims that he can make explosives.
Jinwu: Well now, guess that alchemy you learned has finally been put to some use, huh? Well, we do need a demolitions team at the moment.
Zhiqiong: Wait. Didn't we get in touch with a demolitions expert from Mondstadt? Why do we need to count on him?
Jinwu: Oh, you mean her? So, Muning received an apology letter just this morning, saying that the kid had blown the stove right off this restaurant called "Good Hunter" and got grounded as a result...
Jinwu: Even her... guardian, I guess? This guy called the Cavalry Captain, I think. Either way, he got grounded too, and he was supposed to come with her.
Jinwu: I'm not sure what this is. Maybe it's some kind of code for people in Mondstadt? Either way, she's not coming.
Paimon: Um, who might that be...?
Traveler: Should we call this fortune... Or misfortune?
Jinwu: #Hmph, so even you think so huh, Traveler? Well, I guess it's your lucky day, Clitopho.
Jinwu: Come on, Zhiqiong. Clitopho here's from Mondstadt, so he's not too far off the mark from what we were looking for. He'll serve.
Clitopho: Thank you, Jinwu! Thanks so much! So... I guess I count as a member of the team now?
Jinwu: Once you've proved your worth.
Zhiqiong: Well, I've got no faith in this fellow. The demolitions team is a key appointment. Lives will be at stake! And we're giving this to a Treasure Hoarder...
Jinwu: Oh, quit your yammering, you.
Jinwu: I've known this kid way longer than you have. He's not a bad person. Never had the courage to, anyway. Just give him some time.
Jinwu: So, other than meeting some new friends, were you here for anything else?
Zhiqiong: Well, the path to the lower levels has been sealed off by stone, so we're going to use the "Mountainator" to clear that path.
Jinwu: Pfft. The Mountainator, eh? Hahaha!
Paimon: Eh? What are you laughing about?
Traveler: Haha, very funny.
Jinwu: Pfft, sorry. Heh. I mean, call me old fashioned, but in the Engineering Department, we all called this the Safe Blasting Mechanism 2156.
Jinwu: But I suppose Mountainator works too. It's a cute nickname, no doubt.
Jinwu: If you want to use that cannon... Eh, it's a shame I wasn't part of the demolition crew, and I need to take care of the camp over here. Still, I think that you should be able to find a manual nearby.
Jinwu: Ah, right. I also believe that the keys to the facility should also have been hidden separately in two different water filtration devices. Let me mark them out on the map for you...
Paimon: Wait, what? Isn't that the same as hiding your house keys under the doormat? What kind of security measure is that?
Jinwu: Well, you say that, but The Chasm was never a place that ordinary people could access. Even if people with other intentions entered...
Jinwu: It's not entirely likely that they would immediately think to find the two keys in such obvious places. Am I right, my Treasure Hoarder friend?
Clitopho: Ugh... Well, Erge wasn't able to find the storehouse keys, that's for sure.
Zhiqiong: What? That idiot doesn't count. But anyway, I need to continue working on these maps... So I leave Clitopho to you guys.
Traveler: You're not worried about him?
Zhiqiong: Hmph, I'll keep a close watch on him. Who knows if he's got some poisonous plan against us. Even if Jinwu trusts him, I won't let my guard down...
Zhiqiong: I can't be at ease until he's in the hands of the Millelith... Keep an eye on this guy. Don't even give him a chance to try anything.
Jinwu: Alright, now that you know where the storehouse keys are, don't disturb me any further, alright?
Jinwu: #By the way, Traveler. You must have seen some raw Lumenstone ore on the way here, right?
Jinwu: If you need to, come look for me and I'll help you polish 'em up. They're actually pretty good as adjuvants down in this place.
Jinwu: They seem to have the power to restrain the encroachment of that black mud-like substance, almost as if they were born to be enemies. The principle of how that works escapes me, though.
Jinwu: Haha, what can I say? I'm just not all that learned outside my profession. But once you see "that thing," I think you'll understand.
Traveler: The Mountainator, they called it!
Jinwu: Hahahahaha! Stop kidding! Hahahaha!
Zhiqiong: Hey, come on!
Traveler: Clitopho here might actually be the safer choice...
Traveler: He mucked up every job the Hoarders gave him.
Paimon: Hahahaha! Really! In what world does that count?
Jinwu: Of course it doesn't.
Clitopho: Uh, does making explosives count?
Jinwu: ...
