Traveler: So, you do legal consultancy?
Vitruvia: To be precise, I do consultancy on how to "escape the law."
Vitruvia: My goal is to let my clients avoid run-ins with Champion Duelists and avoid entering the theater — except to enjoy performances, that is.
Vitruvia: This is not hard to do. All legal systems have their flaws — and I know them as well as I do the holes in my socks.
Vitruvia: Hmm... Speaking of that, I should probably spend some Mora to get a pair of new ones.
