Diona: Hey Dad, want to play a game of Genius Invokation?
Diona: But before we play, I got one thing to say to you! If you're already tipsy from drinking today, then the game will be over in three rounds.
Draff: In three rounds? Sounds like you're underestimating your dear father.
Draff: I'm pretty sure I could drag the game out to at least five rounds.
Diona: Hmph! And you'd still lose! You think that's something to be proud of?
Diona: Last time we played, you mistook the Hydro Elemental Dice you rolled for Cryo! Ugh, so annoying!
Draff: Haha, you know I have a problem with my eyesight...
Diona: No, you have a problem with drinking! Don't try to cover it up!
Draff: Alright, alright, I know, drinking is bad. I won't drink today, not even a single drop. There, happy?
Diona: I guess so.
Draff: Now, if I DO win, what's the prize?
Diona: What? You're trying to get me to mix you a drink? Don't you even think about it!
Draff: What if I win in under five rounds?
Diona: In your dreams, I won't lose! Let's start!
