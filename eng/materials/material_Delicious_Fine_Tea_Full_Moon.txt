# Delicious Fine Tea, Full Moon

A tea pastry containing egg yolk. The loose and delicate texture of the grainy egg yolk mingles with a faint fragrance of tea. One small mouthful brings earthy happiness enough to make you swoon. You could pop several in your mouth at once, and woe betide any who should seek to steal a single crumb from the corner of your lips.
