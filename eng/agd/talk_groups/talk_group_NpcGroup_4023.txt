Traveler: Are you on vacation?
Shams: Bingo — warm sunlight, tasty food, and an endless supply of time!
Shams: Haha, don't misunderstand me, I'm no hedonist. It's just that I finished up a big job, and now I happen to be enjoying my holiday.
Shams: It wasn't easy going to Inazuma to do business during the Sakoku Decree... *sigh* But that's all in the past now. No point in dwelling on it.
Shams: Anyway, after wrapping up that big one, I can finally take it easy for a while.

Traveler: It was pretty tough.
Shams: Yeah, if you've tried to get through the thunderstorm around Inazuma, you must know what I mean.
Shams: In the end, I had to ask for help from the Crux Fleet to take the herbs and stuff to Watatsumi Island.
Shams: I learned quite a lot from them on that trip... But, uh, I'm gonna save it for the next time we work together.

Traveler: Who's Kamal...?
Shams: Kamal is my old pal!
Shams: But Kamal's already packed it in and doesn't do this business with me anymore... *burp* He insisted on joining some doggone Adventurers' Guild.
Shams: The way I see it, those small-fry jobs the Adventurers' Guild is slinging aren't nearly as — *burp* Aren't nearly as exciting as my work...
Shams: Maybe he just got tired of it. If you have the spare time — *burp* — don't forget to bring my old pal Kamal some good food and drinks.

Traveler: "An even bigger job"...?
Shams: What's hottest in Sumeru right now is definitely... uh, that canned stuff, pretty rare... Right?
Shams: *burp* ...Someone like me doesn't have the cushy reserves of the Homayanis. If I want to make money, I have to take risks and do high-end business.
Shams: People of superior learning may not give a hoot about anything else, but that's not the case when it comes to knowledge.
Shams: Let me tell ya, I got them all figured out... *burp*
