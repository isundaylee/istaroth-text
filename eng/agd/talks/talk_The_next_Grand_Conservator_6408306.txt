Traveler: The next Grand Conservator?
Ziryab: Yes, the current Grand Conservator announced a few days ago that he was going to retire, and the next Grand Conservator needs to be voted in by the sages.
Ziryab: Practically everyone is talking about this. Didn't you hear them chattering about it?
Ziryab: Something about Vikram of the Vahumana being good with people, and Rifaet of the Haravatat being incredibly intellectual. Stuff like that...
Ziryab: I think there're even fan clubs of some sorts that've been set up by some students. From what I see, there's too little schoolwork.
Ziryab: Hana's better. She doesn't care about these mundane things.
