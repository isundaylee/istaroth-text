Manly Jack: What are you doing?
Manly Jack: Aha, well! Ever heard of a little something called "manliness"?
Manly Jack: That fellow Jack from the Adventurers' Guild, he knows all about it. Says that if you defeat ten thousand hilichurls, then everyone suddenly sees you as Mr. Manly, and so on.
Manly Jack: Sooooo... I am currently getting ready to prove, once and for all, that I am the manliest man of the lot!
Manly Jack: Go on then. I'm watching.
Manly Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm taking my time over this. Don't want to rush into it and make a fool of myself now, do I?
Manly Jack: Hilichurls are the most terrifying of creatures. You don't go up against a hilichurl without doing some serious preparation in advance!
Manly Jack: You know, filing your nails, styling your bangs...
