# Custom Gift Envelope No. 4


## Talk 1

Candace: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. I heard about how you helped Dehya with the gift envelope. It was beautiful, thank you.
Traveler: Everything is settled back at the village, I'm guessing?
Candace: Yes, it's all thanks to Dehya and the others. I can rest a little easier knowing the village is still protected while I'm gone.
Traveler: Take this time to get some good rest.
Candace: I will. Dehya wants to visit Qiaoying Village in a few days.
Candace: She said the scenery is beautiful, and the village is known for their tea. It's a perfect gift for the people back home.
Candace: I was planning to follow the tradition here and make a few gift envelopes for them.
Candace: But, Dehya packed our schedule to the brim, and with all the running around, I'm not sure I'll have the time...
Candace: Dehya told me you're good at making gift envelopes. Could you show me how to make one?
Traveler: Of course, just leave it to me.

## Talk 3

Candace: #So, that's how it's done... This gift envelope is wonderful, Traveler, thank you.
Candace: Now, I just need to make a few more to give alongside the souvenirs I bought. I'm sure the people back home will love them.
Candace: But, this one... I'm keeping just for me.
