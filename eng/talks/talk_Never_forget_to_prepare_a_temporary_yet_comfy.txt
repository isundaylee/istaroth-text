Travel Guide: "...Never forget to prepare a temporary yet comfy bed for your Saurian companion before camping or resting!"
Travel Guide: "First, find some dry branches and stones to build the foundation. Make sure it isn't too moist, otherwise the Saurian's sleep will be adversely affected."
Travel Guide: "Next, spread out some soft fabric and cloth on top of the foundation to form a comfortable bed."
Travel Guide: "Finally, stuff the bedding with fur or other items that can help retain heat as a filling, and cover the Saurian with a soft woven blanket, and you're done!"
Travel Guide: "For detailed setup instructions, please consult with our staff. We have extensive experience in caring for Saurian companions..."
