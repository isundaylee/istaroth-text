Traveler: Yes please.
Genta: I wanna see your performance again, too, but the Tenryou Commission has ordered us to put everything on hold. You're putting me in a difficult position here...
Genta: Ooh, I know! Since it's you, we can say we're friends hanging out and having fun.
Genta: The Tenryou Commission won't be able to say anything against that, hahahaha!
Genta: This is a pretty genius idea, isn't it? I mean, at least half as genius as Boss's ideas?
Genta: Bring it on, Traveler! Begin your performance.
