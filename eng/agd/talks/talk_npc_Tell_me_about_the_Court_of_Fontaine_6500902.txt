# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine.
Sylvie: Is this your first time here? If it is, let me recommend some hot spots to you.
Sylvie: If you're interested in the news and want to know more about Fontaine, I recommend you head in the direction of The Steambird.
Sylvie: If you wish, you can purchase a copy of The Steambird along the way, and if you're lucky, you might even stumble upon the scene of a journalist conducting an interview.
Sylvie: If you're interested in the latest fashion, you can check out Damoville Purveyor in Quartier Narbonnais.
Sylvie: Perfume and clothing stores that push the times and tides here in Fontaine can be found there, too. Many tourists fresh off the boat make Narbonnais their first stop, in fact.
