Traveler: Why are you wearing a divesuit?
Pitot: I've called this here tavern The Rusty Rudder and, as the helmsman, I naturally have to dress accordingly.
Pitot: What's more, it makes it easier for me to dive into the water and fish out any drunk guests who fall in.
Pitot: If they insist on drowning, then let them at least drown in booze. Otherwise, it'd be bad for my tavern's reputation.
