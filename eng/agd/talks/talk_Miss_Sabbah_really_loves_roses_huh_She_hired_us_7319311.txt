Paimon: Miss Sabbah really loves roses, huh? She hired us even though she knew that roses aren't suited to this place at all.
Paimon: Paimon understands that feeling. It's like when you're already full but still feel the urge to eat when you see street food.
Paimon: Y'know what? They're actually the same obsession, just for different things! That's why we've gotta help her!
