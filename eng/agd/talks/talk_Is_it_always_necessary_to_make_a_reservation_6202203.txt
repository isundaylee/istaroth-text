Traveler: Is it always necessary to make a reservation?
Licai: Yes, I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. If you wish to eat inside the restaurant, we ask that you make a reservation three months in advance. I will be sure to make a record of it.
Licai: Oh? You think it's a long time to wait? At the Liuli Pavilion, we can only seat a few guests at certain times each day, hence the three month wait.
Licai: Besides, for a chance to eat in Li cuisine paradise, surely three months is not too long...?
Licai: People that come to Liuli Pavilion do so because they love eating the treasures of the mountains cooked in classic Li style. Everyone has to wait their turn, even the rich and famous.
Licai: You can get food to go if you want, but you'll be missing out on the atmosphere.
