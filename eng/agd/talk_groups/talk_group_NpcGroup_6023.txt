Traveler: What's the stuff you sell here?
Echuah: They are the fruits of adventure, trophies of the pioneering spirit.
Echuah: Some are trinkets I picked up myself, while others were given to me. As for what you buy — well, that's up to you!
Echuah: Of course, if you've got your eye on anything in particular, you can pay a deposit first, then take it over to the Saurian Relics Association for appraisal before you decide whether or not you want to buy it.
Echuah: But as for how professional their opinion would be... Haha, well, that's hard to say. If you ask me, you'd be better off listening to a few more of my stories.

Traveler: Is it really alright if I don't buy anything?
Echuah: Of course, no problem at all. After all, what better advertisement could I ask for than having people being willing to hang around in front of my stall?
Echuah: Thanks to this, I've also met quite a few colorful characters.
Echuah: I remember one cool customer from Fontaine who wore sunglasses and a little anchor on his hat. He left quite the impression.
Echuah: He didn't say much, but he was very curious about Natlan's Ancient Names. He listened to me rabbit on about them for quite some time.
Echuah: I'm sorry to say that I've completely forgotten everything I said then... Perhaps some of it wasn't particularly accurate either, haha.
