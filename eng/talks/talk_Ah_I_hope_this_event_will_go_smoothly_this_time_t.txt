# Talk Dialog

Lizzie: Ah, I hope this event will go smoothly this time too...
Traveler: What are you working on?
Lizzie: I'm preparing to welcome guests here. We've got all sorts of fun activities lined up for the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: But some of the events are being held outside the city due to the large areas needed, so without a guide to tell people where things are happening, some of them are going to miss out!
Lizzie: That's why I've been stationed here and put in charge of introducing the festival's activities to everyone.
Traveler: Well, tell me all about it.
Lizzie: There are three events taking place during the festival: "Ballads of Breeze," "Floral Pursuit," and "Breezy Snapshots."
Lizzie: The activity I'm in charge of, specifically, is "Ballads of Breeze." The other two representatives should also be at their stations and making some final preparations.
Lizzie: Everyone's pretty excited, so here's to the smooth running of this year's Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: May you have a happy time as well!
Traveler: What activities have we got lined up?
