Aah! So... so lifelike...
...
Why is nothing working!?
This foe is not invincible
You hold the treasure
The power to defeat it
In your own two hands
The treasure? You mean...!
The names!
It's the Marechaussee Hunters' names!
How are we supposed to...?
You forget, Paimon?
There's still one skill
We saved until the very end!
Hunters fight not for fame
But to aid the people whenever they are summoned
Walter the Marechaussee Hunter
Master of a thousand tricks
Executioner of the Phantom Hunters
I call for aid!
Este the Marechaussee Hunter
Inheritor of Cassiodor's will
Judge of the Shadow Hunters
Answer my call!
Petronilla
Protector of Justice and Order...
The Hunter I respect the most...
Thank you for saving my friend
The best one I'll ever know
Please
Lend us your strength
We have come
To answer your summons
