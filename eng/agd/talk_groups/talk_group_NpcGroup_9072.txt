Traveler: Do you like it here?
Candace: It's quite different from Aaru Village, but I feel at ease here nonetheless.
Candace: I was so surprised the first time I came in. Such a small teapot, and yet so vast on the inside...
Candace: If I could store Aaru Village in a teapot...
Traveler: Wanna give it a shot?
Candace: I was simply musing. Even if that were possible, what I seek to protect is not an object named Aaru Village...
Candace: ...It is my homeland and the lives of everyone in it.
Candace: I apologize for making you listen to all this...
Candace: And, thank you for having me.
Traveler: That would definitely make things more convenient...
Candace: Hmm... If I could easily take everyone someplace else...
Candace: No, I suppose they wouldn't agree to leaving the desert in the first place.

Traveler: Up for a chat, by any chance?
Candace: Sure, but what should we talk about...?
Candace: If you don't mind, could you tell me about the places you've been to? Any of them will do.
Traveler: About the scenery and culture of Mondstadt...
Candace: Verdant grass, a city of song and freedom...
Candace: I'd love to see it for myself.
Candace: The desert has been my home my entire life. I hardly even journey to the other side of the Wall of Samiel.
Candace: But after hearing you speak of all these faraway lands, I can't help but find the thought of traveling quite... enchanting.
Traveler: You should come with us!
Candace: Ah, it truly is a tempting offer... But I cannot forsake my duty to protect Aaru Village...
Candace: Perhaps your words will take root within my heart, and one day, my desire to see the world beyond will sprout and grow.
Candace: When that day comes, I shall follow your footsteps.
Traveler: About the scenery and culture of Liyue...
Candace: A nation of trade and contracts... I've heard about it before, but your description paints a whole new picture.
Traveler: About the scenery and culture of Inazuma...
Candace: A land surrounded by the ocean, a castle built atop an island...

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Candace: If you have time, would you like to hear me tell a story?
Candace: You can sit by my side, or... something more casual, whatever makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.
Candace: Although I may be a village guardian with her spear and shield ever at the ready... Deep down in my heart, I've always loved cozy and calm atmospheres like this.
Traveler: Got it.
Candace: Great. So, just be yourself when you're around me.
Candace: Well then... weary wanderer of lands beyond, do you wish to hear about the ancient legend of King Deshret, or the history of Aaru Village?
Traveler: About the legend of King Deshret...
Candace: King Deshret was an ancient god of the desert, known as "Ahmar" to the desert folk.
Candace: He was the king of warriors, gardeners, and intellectuals alike. He controlled the howling winds in the desert, the sand dunes silvered by moonlight...
Candace: And the thousand-and-one fairy folk who hide within the dreams of the night and the cries of the owl...
Candace: His arrogant acts of folly led to his ruinous fate. The sands entombed his city, leaving only the sorrowful elegies of the Eremite songsters...
Candace: Even now, most desert folk remain devout believers in King Deshret. The rumor that he will one day be resurrected has become their only hope for the future.
Candace: People may find it hard to admit, but lies often soothe the heart more than the truth ever could.
Candace: My apologies... Things got dark pretty quickly.
Traveler: You might feel better if you let everything out.
Candace: Heh, you're right.
Candace: We had a difficult past, and our lives at the moment aren't exactly easy, but it's our peaceful lifestyles that I wish to defend.
Candace: Thank you for patiently listening to all that I had to say. It feels like a burden has been lifted from my heart.
Candace: #Thank you, Traveler.
Candace: When you have time, I'll tell you more stories of the interesting things that happen in our village.
Traveler: About the history of Aaru Village...
Candace: In the past, the mountain and lake where Aaru Village is situated was a part of King Deshret's territory.
Candace: As the god of the desert, King Deshret built a city from the golden sand and crimson rock, and called it "Akhtamun."
Candace: After King Deshret passed, the surviving residents of the city became the earliest inhabitants of Aaru Village, bringing their traditions and faith with them.
Candace: Some time later, Aaru Village became a place of exile for scholars...
Candace: We are all born free, yet we are also inevitably bound by shackles.

## Talk 10

Candace: I love Aaru Village's architectural style. Heh, I know I'm biased, but that's not the reason why.
Candace: Just look at these intricate patterns and beautiful facades. The ancient style really adds a lot of character, and it's all the more majestic in such a tranquil environment.
Candace: ...Can I stay here and admire it for a little longer?
