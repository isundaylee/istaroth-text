Traveler: What sort of crowd?
Rhemia: The sort that wear hats.
Rhemia: Different humans exhibit different behaviors. Some wear hats, and others don't. Same for drinking coffee, or being in a hurry...
Rhemia: I love categorizing them and summarizing the various patterns they follow.
Rhemia: For example, more people wear hats in the morning than in the afternoon. Do you know why that is?
Rhemia: From my observations, it seems that people are properly dressed when they head out in the morning.
Rhemia: But in the afternoon, after a day at work, they stop sweating the small details. They loosen their ties, take off their hats, and run out to the platforms happily.
