# Subtitle: OpeningSequence_Girl_EN

You opened your eyes in the bitter cold with the hope for a better world
Only to be greeted by the sight of your brother being impaled by chains
A foreign goddess descends from the skies and takes away your only kin
Yet failing to avenge your twin, you succumbed to a dark slumber...
When you come to, the world around you is not as you remember
Time that remained stagnant for an eternity began flowing anew
You embarked on a perilous journey alone
In search of the goddess who took everything from you...
