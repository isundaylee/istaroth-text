# The Black Serpent Knights' Glory


## Talk 1

Dainsleif: I thought he would've been turned to ashes in an instant... Halfdan's soul is extraordinarily resilient.
Abyss Lector: Meddling fool! Encumber us no more...
Dainsleif: Don't you have a greater encumbrance to worry about? Come on, this is your grand opportunity to get rid of me.
Abyss Lector: ...Dainsleif!!!
Dainsleif: Take him out, and deactivate the device!

## Talk 2

Paimon: What do we do now? The Abyss Lector's gone, but the device won't stop...
Paimon: And Halfdan...
Traveler: Let me take his place.
Dainsleif: No! As long as the device is active, the cursed are rendered powerless. Only you can take on the Abyss.
Dainsleif: If you value his sacrifice, then do not waste any more time here.
Dainsleif: See all these rays of light and portals? They must have installed several of these energy devices in various locations. Find them! Quickly!
Paimon: So we have to... go through these Abyss portals? ...Hey, wait for Paimon!
Traveler: The cleansing won't have any effect on me.

## Talk 3

Paimon: So that's it, right? The device is fully shut down now?
Dainsleif: The burning sensation has indeed stopped...
Paimon: So we managed to stop the Abyss Order's plan?
Traveler: But... Halfdan...
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: Let me check.
Paimon: Dain must be really upset...
Paimon: Of all the ways to be reunited with one of his former comrades after so long... This is rough...
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: ...Let's go.
Traveler: He seems to have breathed his last.

## Talk 4

Paimon: That was Halfdan's soul...
Dainsleif: More than one kind of strange power exists here. Souls are no strange sight under the circumstances.
Dainsleif: Still, if you intend to venture deeper in and continue your investigation, you ought to be careful.
Dainsleif: *cough*...
Paimon: You bet, we'll be super careful. Oh, but... Dain, does this mean you're not coming with us?
Dainsleif: That device took a severe toll on me. It will take me some time to recover.
Paimon: Oh, right... Well, actually, Paimon already knew that. You've clearly been pushing through the pain this whole time!
Paimon: You've earned a good rest, Dain... Ooh, you should take a vacation!
Dainsleif: "Vacation"? Huh, the very notion. This word has no business being in my vocabulary.
Dainsleif: There are more important things that demand my attention. The "Loom of Fate" operation is still underway.
Dainsleif: And I suspect that these amplification devices are connected to that plan.
Traveler: I will be on the lookout.
Dainsleif: Thank you for understanding.
Dainsleif: I only hope that next time we meet, you know whose side you're on.
Paimon: Sheesh! He sure knows how to hold a grudge, saving that snide remark right till the end...
Paimon: #Well, shame that we didn't get to see your {F#brother}{M#sister} again, but at least we learned some useful info, huh?
Paimon: As long as you keep pressing on with your journey, you guys will definitely meet again, and everything will be back to normal, right?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon almost forgot — the real reason we came here was to investigate what was going on with the hilichurls, wasn't it?
Paimon: We've probably seen enough to report back to the miner now. But, uh... how are we going to explain it to him? This is all way too complicated for regular people to understand!
Paimon: Meh, we'll figure it out — just don't forget about the commission when we're done here.
Traveler: We will talk more next time. After you've recovered.
