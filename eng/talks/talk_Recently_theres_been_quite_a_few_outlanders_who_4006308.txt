Kurisu: Recently, there's been quite a few outlanders who have come to Ritou specifically to take part in the Irodori Festival. As such, it's up to us here in the International Trade Association to welcome them warmly.
Kurisu: From the moment we were notified that Ritou would be the festival site, which would be excellent for business, everyone's spirits really picked up.
Kurisu: Whether you may have goods to sell or if you'd just like to know more about the festival events, feel free to ask me.
Kurisu: So, is there anything I can help with? Do tell.
