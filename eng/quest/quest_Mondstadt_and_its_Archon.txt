# Mondstadt and its Archon


## Talk 1

Grace: Thanks be to the Anemo Archon...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Grace: I'm praying to Lord Barbatos. It was by his protection that Mondstadt was able to weather this storm.
Grace: We also have him to thank for the safety of the Knights of Favonius and the adventurers of the Guild.
Grace: Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
Traveler: Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
Grace: I dare not fathom the things Lord Barbatos has done for us.
Grace: But just knowing that such a diligent deity watches over Mondstadt sets my heart at ease.
Grace: Ah, yes. If you have some time, could you do me a favor?
Grace: I'd like you to help me collect one batch of Dandelion Seeds, and scatter them to the winds at the top of the Anemo Archon Statue...
Traveler: ...How hardworking of him.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I think I've heard of this one...
Grace: Oh, but didn't you help Glory scatter Dandelion Seeds in the same manner before? Did you forget?

## Talk 3

Traveler: Why is this done?

## Talk 4

Grace: Dandelion Seeds that go with the wind carry the feelings in our hearts with them, whether that feeling is remembrance, or thanksgiving.
Grace: Lord Barbatos is the Anemo Archon, so it is most fitting to use these Dandelion Seeds to express our thanks to him.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Allow me, then.
Grace: Thank you.

### Additional Talk 1

Grace: Have you gathered the Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: Have them right here.
Grace: These should be enough. Please wait here for a moment...
Grace: ...Lord Barbatos, please hear me...
Paimon: Wow, she's so... devout. So... many words...
Paimon: Who knows if that Tone-Deaf Bard is listening...
Grace: Alright. Please take these dandelions seeds. Help me go up and scatter them.
Grace: I should really do this myself, but with my physical abilities... I would probably have a hard time getting back down, even if I could climb up there.
Grace: So I'm counting on you.

### Additional Talk 2

Grace: Have you scattered the Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: I've done just that.
Grace: Regardless, I do hope that Lord Barbatos will be able to hear my voice.
Grace: Thank you for your willingness to help. Please take this for your troubles â€” and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
Traveler: The wind will carry them far abroad.
Grace: That's wonderful. It should be easy for Lord Barbatos to notice.

### Additional Talk 3

Grace: Lord Barbatos, I hope that you can hear me...
