Traveler: I thought it went pretty well.
Langqing: I have to agree! I didn't think that rock 'n' roll of this kind existed, it's even different from the sort Fangfang and I heard in Fontaine. I'd love to collect some literature adjacent to the matter.
Langqing: Don't forget to drop by Wanwen Bookhouse more often if you've got the time.
