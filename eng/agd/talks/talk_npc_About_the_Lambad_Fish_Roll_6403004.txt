Traveler: About the Lambad Fish Roll...
Lambad: It's a recipe I came up with on an adventure in my youth. The flavor of the finished product far exceeded my expectations, so I bestowed it with the great name of "Lambad"!
Lambad: When I was traveling around then, I had delicious grilled fish in Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma. So, it got me thinking that the aroma of grilled fish in the air was just what Sumeru needed, too!
Lambad: And that's how my famous Lambad Fish Roll was born. And it's not just grilled fish â€” I combined it with Sumeru's specialty pitas to create a fish roll that can be eaten with ease, even on the choppiest of seas.
Lambad: Such a genius invention is naturally worthy of the resounding name of "Lambad."
