# Hey, Your Letter!


## Talk 1

Michica: Those bumbling fools... How've they lost another load of packages? I told them not to mess about when they're out delivering things...
Traveler: What happened?
Michica: A few of our Couriers ignored instructions yet again, and guess what? They've gone and lost a bunch of packages.
Michica: *sigh* Don't they realize that such carelessness damages the reputation of the Scions of the Canopy?
Michica: When you're out on the job, focus on delivering things! If you're going down a slope, just keep going as you normally would. Why would you suddenly drop into a slide like you're on vacation!?
Michica: I've told them so many times, but those youngsters just won't listen. All they care about is chasing cheap thrills...
Michica: *sigh* Now I'll have to get someone to retrieve those packages. Let me think, who's free right now...
Traveler: I'll lend a hand.
Michica: Yâ€”You'd really help me out? That's great!
Michica: It would take me quite a while to find someone who could help, and if I went looking myself, there'd be no one here to watch over the Courier's Longhouse.
Michica: And don't worry, I wouldn't just leave you to find a needle in a haystack. I know the routes those kids usually take, so I can probably guess where those packages went missing.
Michica: I'll mark out those probable locations. Thanks in advance. I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Are those packages big?
Michica: No, they're not. But that's what makes them a real hassle to find. *sigh* Those careless little...
Michica: ...So, if you have the time, would you be willing to help me track them down?
Michica: The Courier's Longhouse is a bit short on manpower right now, so if I went to find them myself, there'd be no one here to man the store.
Traveler: No problem, leave it to me.
Michica: That's amazing! Thank you so much!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Based on the marks Michica made for us, those packages should be somewhere nearby.
Paimon: Let's have a closer look around. Hmm, where could they be...

## Talk 3

Michica: One... Two... Should be a few more...

## Talk 4

Michica: One... Two... Should be a few more...

## Talk 5

Michica: So, how did it go? Did you manage to find the packages?

## Talk 6

Michica: Two... Three... That's all of them! Excellent job, you retrieved them all.
Michica: ...Wait a sec, wasn't this one meant to be delivered by Tundama?
Michica: Here's your payment. Thanks for the help!
Michica: Agh, I'm gonna have to have a serious one-to-one with Tundama about this...

Traveler: See you.
Michica: I'm counting on you to find the packages. I still have to sort through all the ones in the shop. *sigh* When will those kids start behaving like professionals...
