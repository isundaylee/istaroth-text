## Talk

Kouichi: Midori, Midori. Let's talk about the Outside World again!
Midori: Hehe, again? Really now...
Midori: Since you're so eager to hear about it, Let me tell you something new then! So, what do you want to know?
Kouichi: What is that place called Liyue on the other side of the ocean like?
Midori: Liyue is super famous for its rocks. You know that too, right?
Midori: But you definitely don't know that those rocks from Liyue are actually little animals. They can run, yell, and jump!
Kouichi: Wow! That's so cool... What about Fontaine?
Midori: The roads of Fontaine are all built in mid-air. The wagons that people ride fly like egrets. It only takes a short while to get from one side of the village to another!
Kouichi: Awesome! What... what about Sumeru?
Midori: The Sumeru locals have it more difficult. There are grass all over the ground after all.
Midori: They eat and drink grass. There are no Egg Rolls, no Dango.
Kouichi: Poor Sumeru...
Kouichi: If only I could get out of here. I would probably be on the other side of the sea already...
Kouichi: Ugh, rocky animals, flying wagons, please wait for me...

Midori: Well, I'm running out of new stories to tell Kouichi...
Traveler: What kind of new story?
Midori: It's a new story told by Uncle Ramsay.
Midori: He said he's been to many countries and seen many interesting things. In order to record these things, he wrote something called the travelogue.
Midori: He showed me a lot of his travelogues!
Midori: For example, there's a kind of iron carriage that flies in the sky in Fontaine. It runs along an invisible road. It takes no time to travel from one end of the village to the other.
Midori: There's a special kind of grass in Sumeru, which can be planted anywhere. It can be planted in soil, water, or sand. Once it's planted, it will sprout and grow.
Midori: And... And... There's a kind of... hmmm... boat that can stay at the bottom of the sea for a long time!
Midori: By riding in that boat, people can go to the deep sea to do all kinds of things and see all kinds of fish!
Traveler: Really...
Midori: Anyway, that's what Uncle Ramsay told me...
Midori: Well, that's not the point!
Midori: Recently, Uncle Ramsay stopped sending me his travelogue for some reason. So I'm running out of stories to tell Kouichi.
Midori: I know that Uncle Ramsay has been staying at the Komore Teahouse. I wanted to go find him. But the gatekeeper, Sister Kozue, wouldn't let me in because I'm a kid...
Midori: You look old enough. Can you help me ask Uncle Ramsay, what happened to those travelogues?
Traveler: Ehm, I am not that old...
Midori: Anyway! You look like a reliable person. Please help me!
Traveler: I'll see.
Midori: Oh? Are you also interested in reading those travelogues? No problem. Just give them to me when you're finished.
Midori: I... I'll go with you. Although I can't get in, I can wait for you near the teahouse...
Midori: Ah, I'm so looking forward to reading Uncle Ramsay's new travelogue.
Traveler: Did he tell you about Snezhnaya?
Midori: Snezhnaya? Well, I don't think so.
