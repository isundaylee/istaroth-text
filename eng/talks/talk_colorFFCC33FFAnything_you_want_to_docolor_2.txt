Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Anything you want to do?</color>
Sayu: If you have the time...
Sayu: Would you like to plant a tree with me?
Traveler: Plant a tree?
Sayu: Yeah, let's plant a big one!
Sayu: Bigger than all those trees outside.
Sayu: I can teach you some ninjutsu using leaves.
Sayu: Oh, and they are all escape techniques...
Sayu: Um, because escaping is very important! Especially when going up against really strong enemies!
Sayu: I don't want to see you get hurt...
Traveler: Then I'll be counting on you to teach me.
Sayu: No problem.
Sayu: After that, we can climb up the tree for a rest.
Sayu: Sitting on the trunk, enjoying the wind...
Sayu: *yawn*... Just thinking about it... makes me a little sleepy.
Traveler: Good night, Sayu.
Sayu: #Likewise, {NICKNAME}.
Sayu: *yawn*...I hope I dream of you every time I fall asleep...
Traveler: Sweet dreams, Sayu.
