# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You really aren't bad at all...
Paimon: Hmm... Looks like Miss Jala really was discovered by the Knights of Favonius.
Jala: Oh, it's you two! We meet again!
Jala: I... I told you about releasing animals before, right? ...Don't ever do it!
Jala: When I returned to Mondstadt to ask about the local specialties, two knights immediately arrested me at the gates!
Jala: I left the Knights of Favonius headquarters not long ago... I was given a huge fine and a lecture...
Jala: I had no idea the Anglers I released had no natural enemies in Cider Lake and were multiplying so quickly, almost to the point of destroying the lake's ecosystem!
Jala: Fortunately, the Knights of Mondstadt are capable and reliable. They handled it before it got out of control. Otherwise... Otherwise, I'd have become a villain, condemned by history for all time to come!
Jala: Though the Knights were all polite and nice, and they just patiently explained everything to me...
Jala: Mondstadters really are incredibly friendly. They didn't resent or shun me, even though I made such a big mess...
Jala: There was a little girl in red who saw me crying by the road, and she even comforted me with lots of snacks...
Jala: Though the fine itself was huge to me, it merely covered the losses incurred and the salaries of the knights sent to do damage control...
Jala: I just feel so bad about what I did! I really regret it!
Paimon: Well, as long as you can learn from your mistakes. The issue has been resolved, so you don't have to be so hard on yourself now!
Traveler: Just don't go randomly releasing creatures again!
Jala: Of course! I will remember this lesson! Always!
Jala: Perhaps... I should donate another shipment to Mondstadt... and then go apologize in person to those Mondstadters who were affected by my actions...
Traveler: And remember to tell your friends that.
