Xamaran: How curious! This two-legged hatchling makes no use of her feet.
Paimon: "Two-legged hatchling"? Hmph, Paimon's got a name! And looks like someone's gonna get themselves the silliest nickname in the world ever!
Paimon: Let Paimon think... You know what, we're gonna call you "Sheeshroom"!
Paimon: Also, look at this glowing powder in the air. Are they mushroom spores? Paimon wonders if they're the reason why we could hear this mushroom talking.
Xamaran: Xamaran knows many legged ones who make no use of their feet. Yet Xamaran knows not any Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, that's natural, because Paimon is one of a kind.
Xamaran: Xamaran knows the two-legged one over there. How strangely familiar.
Paimon: #Traveler, do you know Sheeshroom?
Traveler: No, I don't.
Xamaran: Xamaran smells the heat of golden sand and the dampness from deep within the rainforest. That's the smell of Xamaran's hometown.
Paimon: Hot sand and the rainforest? Do you mean Sumeru? We did just talk to a Sumeru scholar at the camp...
Xamaran: Although Xamaran has been away from its hometown for long, Xamaran makes no mistakes.
Xamaran: #Traveler the Two-Legged, fate has brought you here. Xamaran has a favor to ask.
Xamaran: Xamaran has dwelled here for many a year and found it a cozy and comfy home...
Xamaran: Yet foul energy is growing lately. Xamaran has been drained of strength fending off the evil and has ended up in this state. Xamaran must seek help from the two-legged.
Paimon: Sheeshroom does look a little under the weather...
Paimon: #Hm... Oh right, Traveler, we can lend the energy of the Adjuvant to Sheeshroom, perhaps? Maybe that'll make it feel better.
Traveler: Maybe I do, but I don't remember.

Xamaran: ...Ignorance might be a blessing, and knowledge might bring forth calamity...
Xamaran: ...Only that which graced with the ambrosia of knowledge can flourish into the strong...
Xamaran: ...Only that which has been tested with the desolation of wandering can brave the wilderness...
