# The Third Experiment: Life


## Talk 1

Paimon: You... You want us to jump!? From up here!?
Albedo: Not necessarily — not if you know of a better method, that is.
Traveler: We'd better have a better method.
Albedo: Whichever method you choose, the experiment will end when you reach the opposite shore of the lake.
Albedo: I will factor the time expended and your top speed into my comparative analysis.
Paimon: The opposite side of the lake... So... We're gonna be swimming?
Albedo: Without limitations, we complete tasks intuitively using the method that seems most rational to us.
Albedo: Some of us would be unable to stand the icy waters... Others might find the whole thing rather refreshing.
Albedo: No matter what choice you make, it's all a part of the experiment. For me, every detail is invaluable to the research.
Traveler: My kind of experiment.
Albedo: Then if you would, please. I eagerly await the results.
Traveler: This is actually less stressful than the superpower part.
Traveler: That's not very reassuring.

## Talk 3

Albedo: Great work, I've never seen a performance quite like it.
Albedo: Your reputation precedes you, Traveler. The data shows that you're easily outperforming the average citizen in Mondstadt.
Paimon: But you followed us the whole way without breaking a sweat!
Albedo: Me? Actually, I used alchemy to cheat a little, but anyway.
Albedo: If it turns out that the natural laws of Teyvat do not affect you, I should be able to make various inferences about the otherworldly civilization you belong to.
Albedo: If the natural laws of Teyvat do affect you, then I shall be able to make inferences into the kind of evolution that would occur under the absence of such effects.
Albedo: The innumerable possibilities that this could present, the captivating insights... It will be something to savor again and agai—
Paimon: Buuuut how does this help your RESEARCH?
Albedo: You've helped me to unravel many of the problems that were holding it back. When we return to the campsite, I should be able to show you something interesting.
Traveler: What else have you researched this thoroughly?
Albedo: I may be about to make some analogies between you and a few... unusual specimens. I hope you won't be offended.
Albedo: Gold, Petrified Trees, a sun eight times the size of our own...
Albedo: The essence of the investigative process is enthralling, but such feelings are inevitably fleeting in nature.
Albedo: I'm willing to pour all my energy into research, and yet specimens are finite. As the unknown transitions into the realm of scientific understanding, the feeling of enlightenment is lost.
Albedo: All these things that start out as objects of fascination end up possessing the prosaic mundanity of a Sunsettia or a Sweet Flower. They cease to be noteworthy.
Paimon: Oh... So that's why you wanted to paint those hilichurls? Because you got to see something new and interesting in the differences between them?
Albedo: Precisely. To quote my exact words from earlier, these creatures are, for the most part, "quite boring... not worth closer inspection." There is precious little about them that serves to pique my curiosity now.
Paimon: So after all these experiments, are we gonna be, like, boring to you? Like some basic draft of a sketch?
Albedo: Of course not. You have been of great assistance to me, and I will remember this friendship for a lifetime.
Albedo: Now, before we head back to the campsite, there's one more experiment: intelligence.
Albedo: Follow me, there are some other ruins nearby.
