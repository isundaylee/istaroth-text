Traveler: Is Petrichor that boring?
Moce: Exactly! Nothing ever changes around here, and everyone's okay with that... If it wasn't like this, Uncle would never have left!
Moce: I wanted to go see the outside world... I heard people in town say that Sumeru's an interesting place, with its rainforests and deserts... and ancient fortresses and temples!
Moce: Here, it's all water everywhere you look... Ah, how I wish I could go on an adventure!
