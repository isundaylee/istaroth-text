Traveler: About the Yashiro Commission...
Madarame Hyakubei: The Yashiro Commission, the Kanjou Commission, and the Tenryou Commission are known as the "Tri-Commission."
Madarame Hyakubei: The Yashiro Commission is different from the other two commissions. It's responsible for cultural affairs in Inazuma, like offerings to shrines, ceremonial affairs, publishing books, and so on.
Madarame Hyakubei: Because of that, we often hear the various wishes of the people of Inazuma...
Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato is a very kind lady. She has persuaded the Commissioner to allocate funds and resources to help grant the peoples' wishes.
Madarame Hyakubei: But since the requests concern many different aspects of life here, we usually have a shortage of manpower when things get busy...
Madarame Hyakubei: Now that I mention it, would you be interested in helping us out? You will be paid fairly, of course. Once you have more experience and a better reputation, you will receive more important and better-paying commissions.

## Talk 9

Madarame Hyakubei: Honored guest, a moment, if you please. I trust you are the Traveler of whom Miss Kamisato has previously spoken?
Traveler: Indeed I am.
Madarame Hyakubei: Then please forgive my intrusion. I am Madarame Hyakubei, a retainer of the Kamisato Clan.
Madarame Hyakubei: I have heard tell of your great deeds, and Miss Kamisato thinks extremely highly of you. No doubt you are one of great honor, and worthy of our trust.
Madarame Hyakubei: I have long since wished for the pleasure of making your acquaintance. Unfortunately, I have been unable to extricate myself from my duties recently.
Traveler: Too kind, too kind.
Madarame Hyakubei: On the contrary, it is you who are too modest. Even the Yashiro Commissioner Kamisato Ayato himself has mentioned you before. He, too, believes that you are worthy of our trust.
Madarame Hyakubei: I'll get to the point. Since the Yashiro Commission oversees worship at the shrine, we often have the occasion to hear about people's earnest ambitions.
Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato, being as kind and thoughtful as she is, convinced the Yashiro Commissioner to allocate resources to help people realize their ambitions.
Madarame Hyakubei: After some deliberation, he decided to establish a public commission system as the means of achieving this. I am the one he assigned to organize it.
Madarame Hyakubei: The remuneration is more than ample, but the problem is that there are too many commissions and not enough people to handle them... If you were willing to lend your assistance, that would be wonderful.
Madarame Hyakubei: If you are unable to start right away, that's no problem. You can simply find me in a few days' time when your schedule is freer.
Madarame Hyakubei: I have compiled the details of the commissions that we've received so far, if you wish to take a closer look.
Traveler: What do you want?
Madarame Hyakubei: Haha, you are every bit as forthright as the stories claim. Please excuse my habitual meandering.

## Talk 10

Madarame Hyakubei: If you should ever have the time and the desire, we would be most grateful indeed for your help.
Madarame Hyakubei: If all goes well, you will not only be well compensated but your reputation in Inazuma will be enhanced.
Madarame Hyakubei: Of course, even one such as yourself cannot become a local legend overnight. As with many things in life, you will need to start from something small and work your way up.
Madarame Hyakubei: Specifically, this means that as your reputation builds up, the commissions you have access to will grow in complexity. Consider it a gauge of the level of trust that people here place in you.
Madarame Hyakubei: Please give it some thought. It goes without saying that I'd be thrilled if you were willing to help out.
Madarame Hyakubei: I will leave you to think it over.
