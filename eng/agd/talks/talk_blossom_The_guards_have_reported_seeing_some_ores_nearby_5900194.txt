Ahoeitu: The guards have reported seeing some ores nearby, and it sounds like it's more of those Condessence Crystals that contain phlogiston... Not exactly headline news though.
Ahoeitu: If only we had someone from the Children of Echoes here, we could have consulted them about the quality... Though as I see it, they're all pretty much the same anyway. Every kind of material has its use, after all.
Ahoeitu: Anyway, if you're in need of ore, you can go mine some here.
