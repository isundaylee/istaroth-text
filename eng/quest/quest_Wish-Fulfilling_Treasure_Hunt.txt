# Wish-Fulfilling Treasure Hunt


## Talk 1

Urville: ...What are you looking at? Never seen an adventurer before?
Paimon: Well, what a coincidence. We're adventurers ourselves. What are you doing here?
Nadia: We're looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum. It's gonna make us rich, Urville said so.
Urville: #Hey! Why are you telling {M#them}{F#them} about it?
Nadia: Oh... In that case, no, we are definitely not looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum!
Traveler: You haven't been scammed, too, have you?
Paimon: If you heard it from someone called Virgil, then, you've been lied to. There's no treasure. It's just a scam.
Urville: Ha! Like I'm gonna believe you! You just want to get us out of here so you can keep the treasure for yourself...
Urville: Do I look like a fool who just believes whatever someone says? I know what you're trying to do!
Traveler: Alrighty then. Good luck to you.
Paimon: It seems that some lessons must be experienced to be learned...

## Talk 2

Urville: Treasure... where could it be? In a chest? In a cabinet? Or tucked away in some hidden compartment?

## Talk 3

Nadia: I'm sorry, I can't remember what the treasure is. If only I could remember... then I'd be able to help out more.

## Talk 4

Precious Chest: (It's a chest that looks like private property. Best not to touch it...)

## Talk 5

Nadia: I see! Ball Octopuses' eyes brighten up when they see your physique. But why, then, would you join the Fleet?
Urville: Because rumor has it that sailors make big bucks. It'll bring a much more stable income than what we're doing, trying to find some secret treasure...
Paimon: Hey there. What are you two doing here?
Nadia: Urville's doing physical training to join the Fleet... Joining the Fleet earns big bucks...
Urville: Nadia, I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut...
Nadia: I'm sorry. I forgot again.
Nadia: Hello, strangers. Urville is preoccupied with very important work, which is confidential, by the way. So, please leave us alone and keep your questions to yourselves.
Traveler: We've met before, haven't we?
Nadia: Is that so? I'm sorry, I don't remember.
Urville: She suffered cranial damage previously, and she's kept on forgetting things since.
Urville: #Nadia, head back to shore with {M#them}{F#them} and rest a bit at The Rusty Rudder.
Paimon: What about you? You don't look so good... Have you been...
Nadia: That's not the case. Training is tough. Urville has to complete all the training courses in order to join the Fontaine Fleet.
Urville: Ah, you know me so well, Nadia. Now, hurry up and go.
Traveler: Good luck with your training, then. We're off.
Paimon: Hey, let's not leave him here like that! Paimon feels he's just too embarrassed to ask for our help... You see, asking someone for help when you're in trouble isn't something to be ashamed of at all.
Urville: I—I told you I'm fine. Don't believe me? How about I do some push-ups right now?!
Paimon: Wait, stop moving, you'll flip the wooden planks!
Traveler: Stop trying to act tough when you don't even have an oar left.
Paimon: That's right. Asking help from passing adventurers when you're in trouble is not something to be ashamed of.

## Talk 6

Urville: I didn't ask you to save me... How nosy. I'll just tell you upfront now — I have no Mora for you.
Traveler: Why are you scolding me after I helped you?
Paimon: We can't just ignore a person in danger... That's not called being nosy.
Urville: That's too good to be true. I don't believe in kindness without agendas. I would've believed you more if I was some lovely damsel you'd come to save...
Urville: But the fact is, I look like an odd-flavored candy without any wrapping from the city's candy store. No one would take a second look, let alone pick me up.
Urville: If you didn't save me for Mora, then you must be up to something more sinister...
Paimon: Whoa! This guy's head is so twisted... Paimon doesn't care if you believe us or not — we've always been bleeding hearts anyway. We didn't do it for Mora, but you at least owe us a "thank you"!
Nadia: Thank you, strangers, for helping Urville. I wanted to help, but I never could be of any help... I'm just useless like that.
Urville: Don't say that about yourself, Nadia...
Paimon: #Oh, we forgot to introduce ourselves. Paimon's name is Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}.
Urville: D—Darn it, you want me to remember who I owe my life to, don't you?
Nadia: #Thank you, {NICKNAME}, but even if you tell me your names, I'd forget them soon enough...
Paimon: ...Huh?
Urville: ...I told you. She's suffered cranial damage, so she often forgets things. Don't judge her by how she is now. She used to be an elite at the Marechaussee Phantom, you know?
Urville: But if it weren't for how she is now... She wouldn't have gotten mixed up with someone like me...
Nadia: Yes. Urville saved me when I was severely wounded, but I didn't have any Mora to give him, so I want to repay him by helping him... But I often forget things, and I can't remember if I've ever been of help...
Urville: Don't worry, you've helped me out lots. There are many things I would never have achieved otherwise alone by myself.
Nadia: Is that so? I must've forgotten it. But, I'm happy to hear that I'm not so useless after all.
Nadia: If you want to collect your debt from us, can you wait until Urville is wealthy? Once we find the treasure, we'll be able to pay you back.
Paimon: We're not collecting any debts! By the way, are you so fixated on finding the treasure and getting rich because you owe a lot of debts...?
Urville: To be honest with you... it's for her treatment. You've seen it yourselves how serious her forgetfulness is...
Urville: Just so you know, she used to be called Knowledgeable Nadia, and she could remember everything.
Urville: A full recovery is nearly impossible, but I want her to be able to return to a normal life at the very least... Even so, the medical expenses are going to be huge.
Urville: I am neither knowledgeable nor masterful, so all I can do is bet on luck. But I must say, my luck on bets has been very consistent. I have never won a gamble.
Urville: I thought I'd be able to find something of value inside or near that tower, but as it turned out, all I could find were shells and octopuses... and those octopuses even stole some things off us...
Urville: Not only did I lose my coin pouch and adventurer's gear... Even the diving set I rented from Pitot has sunk into the water... Haha... I'm really out of options.
Traveler: You're suddenly quite the talker...
Urville: That's because I'm despicable. I figure that if I say all these things, kind people like you wouldn't have the heart to ask me for things in return, right?
Traveler: You wish! I'm putting it on your tab.
Nadia: Not a problem. I can dive. I can retrieve Urville's coin pouch and diving set, so we can repay our debts and start over.
Nadia: Besides that, my token is missing as well. It probably also fell into the water, and I need to go search for it.
Urville: What!? You should've said that from the beginning! A Melusine's token is really important! Much more so than the coin pouch or diving set...
Nadia: Is that so? I still don't fully understand, but I get it. I was afraid to delay your training. If you can't finish your training, you can't join the Fontaine Fleet.
Urville: L—Let's not talk about joining the Fleet. Are you okay diving by yourself? What if you run into those octopus robbers...?
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, why don't we go with Nadia? It doesn't feel right to leave her to dive into the water to retrieve all those things by herself.
Traveler: Your coin pouch is fine. And it will be mine.
Urville: I knew it... Never mind, as long as you can protect Nadia and retrieve her token... The coin pouch is nothing...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME} was just messing with you!
Urville: Now that you're helping with retrieving our missing items, can you also try to find my <color=#00E1FFFF>other things, like my tripod</color>... They should be <color=#00E1FFFF>in the water near where we originally set up camp</color>...
Paimon: Sure thing... No point in doing only half a favor.
Nadia: Well, thank you... Thank you?
Paimon: Did you forget Paimon already, Nadia? That was quick! Anyway, Paimon's name's Paimon!
Nadia: I got it now. You are Paimon. Thank you, Paimon.
Urville: Be safe! I'm counting on you then.
Traveler: After all, the motto is "we can't sit idly by."
Traveler: That's still not gonna change your current predicament.
Traveler: I don't expect anything in return for helping someone out.
Paimon: After all, our motto is "we can't sit idly by."

## Talk 7

Precious Chest: (Looks no different from any other treasure chest.)
Urville: Hey! What're you doing!? That's private property!
Urville: ...What are you looking at? Never seen an adventurer before?
Paimon: Well, what a coincidence. We're adventurers ourselves. What are you doing here?
Nadia: We're looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum. It's gonna make us rich, Urville said so.
Urville: #Hey! Why are you telling {M#them}{F#them} about it?
Nadia: Oh... In that case, no, we are definitely not looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum!
Traveler: Thank you for informing us of the situation.
Urville: Darn... Well, even if you know, we were still here first. We'll definitely take the lead...

Paimon: Uhh... But we...
Urville: Sorry, she suffered cranial damage previously, and she's kept on forgetting things since. What she says is not very coherent...
Urville: #Right. Nadia, head back to shore with {M#them}{F#them} and rest a bit at The Rusty Rudder.
Paimon: What about you? You don't look so good... Have you been...
Nadia: That's not the case. Training is tough. Urville has to complete all the training courses in order to join the Fontaine Fleet.

## Talk 11

Urville: You want to check on how we're progressing? I'm not telling you a word.

## Talk 12

Nadia: Sorry... but we are not looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum.

## Talk 13

Urville: Nadia's token is the most important thing, followed by my diving set... As long as I have it, I can dive. It's not to say that everything else is not important, it's just that...
Urville: The coin pouch... I—I do want to repay you for your troubles... But it's so little that I don't think you'd care for it...

## Talk 14

Urville: Nervous? I'm hardly nervous at all!
Urville: ...
Urville: How's my hair? How do I look? I'm not gonna embarrass myself by leaving something humiliating behind again, am I?

## Talk 15

Paimon: We're back! Let's count... We found Nadia's token, the tripod, and the diving set, which is sadly a bit damaged... Oh, and we found your coin pouch, too!
Traveler: Which did you lose? A coin pouch that's full of Mora or one without any?
Paimon: C'mon, stop messing around. We only found one, so let's just return it to him. The Mora's for Nadia's treatment, after all.
Urville: Yes. It's not much, but thank... thank you for retrieving it for me.
Urville: It feels... heavier than before...
Paimon: Huh? Is it because... we robbed those Ball Octopuses in return?
Urville: Ugh... my arch-nemesis was so easily defeated by you two? You're no ordinary people for sure...
Paimon: Arch-nemesis? You mean the Ball Octopuses?
Urville: Yeah, during the time that Nadia and I set up camp here, we had clashes with them every time we went diving... There was no winning side. We were evenly matched, you could say.
Urville: I made it my goal to defeat those worthy and admirable opponents myself... But I didn't expect you to take them down like that...
Traveler: Sorry. Looks like I've interrupted your goal.
Paimon: ?
Urville: By the way, I found a piece of paper from my earlier ventures while you were down there. It's been on my person, so it didn't get wet.
Urville: But I can't understand a word of what's written on it. Maybe an adventurer with vast knowledge like you could decipher it.
Urville: I bet this thing is highly valuable. Consider it a token of my gratitude.
Paimon: We'll gladly accept it.
Nadia: We also found this beautiful conch in the sea. Urville, please accept it.
Urville: Oh, thanks.
Black Screen Text: Urville takes the tiny conch and examines it...
Urville: Strange. This conch resembles the one from your hometown, isn't it? No wonder you find it pretty. What's the word? Nostalgia? Does it remind you of home?
Nadia: Well, not exactly. I had forgotten about it before, just like everything else, but when I saw it, I remembered. I saw it somewhere else, too. It's smaller than the one at Merusea Village, but bigger than this one.
Nadia: It's a collector's item from a researcher who studied many things. Unlike Urville, he has vast knowledge and a lot of Mora.
Nadia: But that was from a long time ago. He left many legacies, like the underwater shelter. I remember someone saying that there was treasure hidden there.
Nadia: But who said it...? I'm sorry. I can't remember.
Paimon: You're always apologizing, but it's not your fault. You don't have to apologize.
Urville: That's right! You're truly incredible, Nadia! Of course, it'd be even more incredible if you could remember where this treasure-filled underwater shelter is...
Paimon: In the end... all you care about is still treasure!
Traveler: Do you even have a heart!?
Urville: That's right. I am despicable. Caring about treasure is how I really am! At least I'm honest! I want all the treasures, whether it's the legendary treasure or the legacy of that researcher! I want them all! I want to get rich!
Urville: If I was rich, I would be able to find the best doctors for Nadia... Then, she wouldn't have to live with a homeless person like me...
Nadia: You'll get rich, Urville, and we won't have to live like this anymore. I can't remember the precise location, but I think I do have an idea of where this underwater shelter is.
Urville: Then what are we waiting for? Despite the damage, the diving set still has one functioning oxygen tank, which should be enough for a dive.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, should we go, too? Paimon's so curious about the treasure...
Urville: Both of you should come! You've helped us out a lot, so when we find the treasure, I'll definitely give you a share... no, two shares!
Traveler: I was also about to ask if she knows the location...
Paimon: #Oh, no... When did you become a heartless adventurer, too, {NICKNAME}...?
Traveler: It's okay. You can exact vengeance on me instead.
Paimon: Whether Urville can defeat you is one matter, but you can't really accept substitutes when exacting vengeance...

## Talk 16

Nadia: This is the place. I remember being here before.
Paimon: Is there really treasure here? This place doesn't feel special at all...
Urville: Impressive. Deeming this kind of place not worth your attention based on experience and knowledge. Just like how easily you defeated my arch-nemesis... Now that I've seen how you work first-hand... I'm impressed.
Urville: One is quite all right, but I don't have confidence that I'll escape from a whole group of Fontemer Aberrants. Thinking back, I did get surrounded by a group of Ball Octopuses when I was small, and I nearly drowned.
Urville: It was fortunate that a kind-hearted Melusine saved me and took me to a luxurious room... much like the one we're standing in.
Traveler: You really do have quite a connection with the Melusines.
Urville: True. The Melusines are nice to me. But I don't have much of a connection with humans... Guess that evens things out.
Urville: Never mind all that. Let's focus on getting rich!
Urville: Let's split up and see if we can find the legendary treasure.

## Talk 17

Investigate: (It takes you some effort to open the chest, but inside, there is only dust and powdery remains of... whatever the chest used to hold. Better not think about it.)

## Talk 18

Investigate: (By looking upwards to the point where your neck cannot bend back any further, you finally manage to make out some books that look interesting, but they have nothing to do with research whatsoever.)
Investigate: (There are some yellowed blank sheets of paper and numerous empty ink bottles in the drawer.)

## Talk 19

Investigate: (There seems to be something beneath the laid out sheet music...)
Paimon: What is this? The handwriting is barely legible... almost like a child wrote it... How strange, what it says seems oddly familiar... Could this be a coincidence?

## Talk 20

Nadia: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, you're so kind... just like Urville.

## Talk 21

Paimon: Will we really find treasure here? We haven't found anything... besides a strange message that looks like it was written by a child...
Urville: We didn't find anything either. That strange message... may be a clue left behind by the researcher! You know how rich people like to do these fancy things...
Black Screen Text: You give the message to Urville...
Urville: Huh, you're right. It can't even be called writing. It's more like a child's scribblings...
Urville: ...
Urville: ...Eh?
Paimon: What, did you find anything?
Urville: I found the treasure.
Paimon: Huh!? So this thing really did hold clues to the treasure? Paimon couldn't tell at all...
Urville: How should I put it... but the last line of the ugly handwriting says...
Urville: "Today's experience is a treasure to me. The Melusine is so nice to me. When I grow up, I want to be someone who helps others, too."
Traveler: So this message was your...
Urville: Enough... You must be laughing hard inside... Haha... I can't believe something so embarrassing came from me.
Traveler: The handwriting is ugly, true. But what you said was right.
Paimon: Now that you put it this way, it really is something only a sincere and kind child would say! But what happened in the following years that turned Urville into such an awkward grown-up...?
Paimon: By the way, Paimon just remembered, didn't Nadia say that she "heard" someone say that there's treasure here?
Paimon: And there's only one Melusine in this story, the one that saved Urville! Urville, do you still remember the Melusine who saved you all those years ago?
Urville: All Melusines look kinda the same... How could I tell? Besides, I even forgot that I've left something so embarrassing here...
Paimon: Then... How about you, Nadia? Did anything here remind you of your past?
Nadia: I...
Nadia: I'm sorry. I can't remember.
Paimon: You still can't remember? Oh, and Paimon thought there'd be a super happy ending to this story...
Urville: I don't know what kind of story you're expecting, but I'm definitely not some sort of protagonist. So, please, stop forcing Nadia to remember things.
Urville: I can't live up to your expectations, or the expectations of my younger self, for that matter... I've grown up, but not for the better. I still can't help anyone.
Urville: To think that I even promised to split the treasure with the both of you... Hahaha... Should I rip this piece of garbage up for you, then?
Nadia: Urville, you've already saved me from certain death, and you're still trying to help me. It's just a temporary run of bad luck that you're having, and that I'm also forgetful...
Traveler: Even if you didn't get rich today, you've still gained something.
Nadia: Yeah. We helped you retrieve your precious memory, Urville, and that is the most valuable treasure. You should know that.
Urville: But it's not worth anything... I can't pay for your treatment...
Nadia: It's okay. It's just a temporary run of bad luck. Just get a grip on yourself, Urville. Keep a long face like that and even good luck will be driven away.
Nadia: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, sorry for making you come all this way for nothing. But, can I ask you for one more favor?
Traveler: Let's hear it.
Nadia: Can I please ask you to take a photo for me and Urville? If I have a photo, I'll be sure to remember what happened today whenever I see the picture.
Nadia: I want to remember how the two of you helped us out, and that Urville needs to pay you back when he gets rich.
Paimon: No need to remember that! But, if a picture is all you want, that's a piece of cake!
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Nadia: I haven't even said it...
Paimon: Those words rolled off the tongue, just like that... Scary!
Traveler: No worries. We've all gone through our own awkward years.
Urville: Why are you saying that like you're old when you seem so young yourself? You're embarrassing me even more!
Traveler: So there is no valuable treasure here.
Paimon: Y—You can't really say that! Well, Those words are priceless to him, aren't they?

## Talk 22

Paimon: Ready? Do you want to pose or something?
Paimon: Hmm... Urville might look better sitting down. What should the background be?
Traveler: Sit in the middle of the long chair.
Urville: Alright... And Nadia will stand beside me. Is this alright?
Paimon: Well, except for your rigid expression, everything else looks fine!
Paimon: Well, anyway! That'll be it, then. Say cheese!
Traveler: Sit on the single chair.
Urville: I doubt I'd fit with my divesuit on...
Paimon: It feels cramped... You might as well just stand.
Traveler: Sit on the round chair.
Urville: You serious? Why not ask Nadia to sit? Go on, Nadia.
Nadia: No. Urville, you sit.
Paimon: Uh...

## Talk 24

Nadia: #Thank you, {NICKNAME}, Paimon. I'll treasure this photo... and remember how much you've helped us.
Paimon: Hehe, by the way, you've remembered Paimon's name for a while now!
Nadia: #Yes. Now, I know. Paimon must be as important to {NICKNAME} as Urville is to me.
Urville: Come on... You're embarrassing me.
Urville: But... I have to thank you for retrieving the tools for my trade. And now that I can dive again...
Traveler: You gonna keep looking for treasure?
Urville: Of course! Why would I stop?
Urville: Being able to find treasure or not aside, if I gave it up, I would be giving up the possibility of ever getting rich.
Urville: That said, I could probably go find a stable job at Lumidouce Harbor... or perhaps be a maid in The Rusty Rudder?
Traveler: That's a bit of a stretch.
Paimon: That's hard to imagine...
Nadia: If that's the case, why don't you go work at Lumidouce Harbor, and I can go be a maid at The Rusty Rudder? Two salaries will hasten our road to great wealth!
Paimon: That seems even more wrong!
Urville: #Haha! Anyway, thank you, {NICKNAME}, Paimon. You're good people, just like the Melusines.
Urville: I hope that the next time we meet, I'll already have become wealthy, and Nadia will have fully recovered from her injuries. I hope you will have also found whatever it is that you're looking for, too!
Traveler: You've certainly considered many different career paths.
Paimon: Paimon would say too many!
Traveler: Better just forget about treasure...
Urville: That's asking me to give up on getting rich. No way.
