Kaede: I never thought that Ritou would play host to a festival by the Yae Publishing House, nor that this many people would show up.
Kaede: Thanks to the Irodori Festival, our Inazuman products and toys have been very popular indeed, even those that aren't necessarily part of our event-specific promotions.

## Talk

Kaede: Wow. The Irodori Festival hasn't started yet, and there are already so many people on Ritou...
Kaede: Well, dear customer, you'll have to wait till the festival starts to get one of our Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!
Kaede: ...Ah, you're not here about the Shogun Statues? Sorry, we've just gotten so many queries concerning those recently.

## Talk

Kaede: Hmm? You're talking to me... Are you a customer?

## Talk

Traveler: So, what's this shop all about?
Kaede: We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
Kaede: Back then... we might have also sold statues of the Almighty Shogun and other related goods as well.
Kaede: Sadly, we haven't really seen that many customers since the lockdown came into effect except for those Snezhnayan merchants who want to entertain their families.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kaede: *sigh* So you're not here to buy anything after all, are you...

## Talk

Traveler: What kinds of dolls?
Kaede: Our featured products are statues of fox spirits and porcelain tanuki dolls. Uh... tanuki dolls sell a bit better.
Kaede: They represent good fortune in Inazuma. Many business owners buy one to place in their stores, hoping for financial success.
Kaede: They look really cute as well! It's not a bad idea to gift them to your favorite girl or the children in your family.

## Talk

Traveler: Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: *sigh* It used to be our best-selling product...
Kaede: Sadly, we've lost our customer base ever since the lockdown happened. And such a delicate item is not cheap to craft, so we've had no choice but to take them off the shelves.

## Talk

Kaede: Again, seriouslyâ€” uh, I mean, hello, how may I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: So, what do you sell here?
Kaede: We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
Kaede: During special periods like holidays or festivals, we would also sell statues of the Almighty Shogun and other related goods.

## Talk

Traveler: Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: Before the Sakoku Decree was instated, it was our best-selling product... But the old edition has long ceased production, and we've switched to a new one since.

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Kaede: Ack... How? I can't believe I lost because of this...

## Talk

Kaede: Ah, why don't you buy a doll? Maybe it'll give you better luck...
