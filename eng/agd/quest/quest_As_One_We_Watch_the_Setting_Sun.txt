(Quest is part of chapter: Chapter V: Act IV The Rainbow Destined to Burn)

# As One We Watch the Setting Sun


## Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon can't sleep with all the noise outside... Forget it. Let's go check it out.

## Talk 2

Dedougou: Ouch... That hurts...
Kachina: Stay still. Your wound needs time to heal. You need to rest for a few more days.
Boulsa: The monsters keep increasing in number. It's like something changed...
Mualani: It's definitely unusual, and we all should be careful. But, don't worry too much. You have us by your side!
Mualani: If there's one thing the Abyss fears, it's strength. If they think we're easy prey, they've got another thing comin'!
Mualani: Oh, someone's calling us!
Kachina: Coming! Coming!
Paimon: #Something wrong, Traveler?
Traveler: (The feeling of dread is getting stronger...)
Traveler: (Do we really have time to wait for the final hero to appear?)

## Talk 3

Paimon: Kinich! You made it back in one piece!
Sibu: Oh, these must be friends of yours. Well, I'll head out, then. See you later.
Ajaw: Hahaha, it was a piece of cake. Those invasive pests are lucky someone called a truce, or we would have burned them all to ashes!
Kinich: I appreciate the concern, Paimon.
Kinich: Despite Ajaw's description, the situation wasn't quite so smooth. The Captain's forces are all elite warriors. It was a tough fight.
Kinich: We were prepared to retreat at any moment, and now the Pyro Archon and The Captain are working together... Not the outcome I was expecting, that's for sure.
Paimon: Yeah, a lot happened while we were in the ruin. We'll tell you about it some other time...
Kinich: Well, at least the Pyro Archon's plan advanced a step further. This is the best outcome we could have hoped for — we really appreciate all your help.
Kinich: But, we have to keep pushing forward. Sibu and I were just about to head out, actually. My tribe is calling for messengers.
Paimon: We won't keep you, then. Let's talk later!
Ajaw: Hah, little Kinich thinks he can just leave without consulting the Almighty Dragonlord K'uhul Ajaw... Hey, wait up!

## Talk 4

Xilonen: Nope, we can't give any of these to our soldiers. They were not tempered correctly at the forge.
Xilonen: Well-made weapons and shields are vital for the survival of our people. I know we're under a lot of pressure, but we can't compromise on quality.
Xilonen: Listen, I'm not blaming you. I know this isn't your usual standard of work. Why don't you all take a break, and I'll take care of the pieces.
Paimon: Hey, Xilonen. Is something wrong?
Xilonen: Nothing I can't handle. Just some rushed, defective goods, that's all.
Xilonen: Even the most skilled craftsmen make mistakes under pressure. If you two want to avoid the same fate, you should really get some rest.
Paimon: You must be exhausted, too...
Xilonen: Hahaha, don't worry. I like it that way.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I have something else to do.
Paimon: Alright, let's take care of that first, then.

## Talk 6

Paimon: If you're done for the day, we should get some rest. Paimon has a feeling we'll need it for tomorrow!

## Talk 7

Traveler: Yep, let's rest.
Black Screen Text: That night...
Citlali: You ready?
Xilonen: Yep... Let's go meet the Lord of the Night.

## Talk 8

Citlali: So, this is where you heard the Lord of the Night? Guess that means she really has awakened...
Citlali: Hopefully we made it before she falls asleep again.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Fret not, I'm still here. For a weak lifeform, falling asleep is no less taxing an exercise than staying awake.
Xilonen: I'm sorry for disturbing your rest, but there's something we didn't have the chance to ask you earlier. We need to forge a new Ancient name for the Traveler.
Xilonen: #But, we ran into a problem. He's not from Natlan, so there are no records of him in the Night Kingdom.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: #I see. Mavuika must hold him in high regard.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: It would seem the two of you are not simply here on her orders. So, what say you? Do you believe this traveler to be deserving?
Xilonen: ...
Citlali: ...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Speak your mind — there are no others here. You are both my children, both children of Natlan. I would hear your opinions on the matter.
Xilonen: #He is special. He saved Kachina and devoted himself to helping us avert this disaster. Natlan owes him a debt.
Xilonen: #But, that debt has not been repaid. With an Ancient Name, we can at least guarantee his safety.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Even though that guarantee will come at the cost of your own life?
Xilonen: Yes.
Citlali: So, it's true. Forging an Ancient Name consumes the life of the craftsman...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Forging an Ancient Name is an act of creation. It involves taking disparate concepts throughout the Night Kingdom and condensing them into a heroic epic.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: But, it takes time for the new concept to be integrated into that realm. If the Ancient Name is like a seed, then the life of the craftsman is the outer shell, serving as its protection.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Once that process is complete, the seed will sprout, and having served its purpose, the outer shell will gradually disappear.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Forging an Ancient Name is no easy task, and creating one for an outlander makes it even more challenging. Still, if you're here, that means your mind is set.
Xilonen: Yes. Because I believe forging this Name will be well worth it.
Xilonen: We don't know how long we'll be able to hold back the Abyss, or what the final price of averting this disaster will be...
Xilonen: If giving up my life means that all the people of Natlan can have a future, then the sacrifice is practically negligible.
Xilonen: Even when I'm staring death in the face, I don't think I'll regret this decision. I bear the name "Bar{RUBY#[D]Blessing}aka." This is a part of my duty.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: I understand. The chance may be exceedingly slim, but you still want to seize it, because this could be the final step to victory.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: And you, Citlali? The anxiety you feel... It's because you saw something, yes? Something you were not meant to see...
Citlali: So, you know about that, too...
Xilonen: What is she talking about?
Citlali: ...I've had concerns for a long time. Mavuika's plan needs too much time, and too many things can go wrong.
Citlali: The Masters of the Night-Wind have a ceremony that can be used to glimpse the future. It's just... using this power on the Pyro Archon has always been seen as a taboo.
Xilonen: And you did it anyway? Wh—What did you see?
Citlali: Death.
Xilonen: ...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: A key part of Mavuika's plan is using the six heroes to release the power Xbalanque obtained from the Ruler o{RUBY#[D]Ronova}f Death.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Considering its origins, the price of using that power... is death.
Xilonen: You're saying... Mavuika is going to die in this war against the Abyss?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Yes.
Citlali: I can't just ignore what I saw. That's why I need the Traveler's power. I need the power of a Descender.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Don't forget, Citlali... Even if it may seem like someone is fated to die, the nature of death and fate are different.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Fate indicates what will happen in the future — the time, manner, and place are all predetermined. But, death is different. Death is a rule.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The Ruler of Death's power will allow Mavuika to triumph over the Abyss. But, she must offer her own life in the process.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The Ruler of Death cares little for the time and manner of a death. She simply guarantees that it will occur.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Fate may be able to influence the timing, but that is all the Traveler can change.
Xilonen: You're saying... We might be able to change when she dies, but not the outcome?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: I cannot help you with this, I'm afraid. It's beyond my capabilities.
Citlali: Mavuika knows about all this, doesn't she?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Yes. I imagine she has long accepted this eventuality.
Citlali: Well, I can't! She's so strong! She never gives up, never rests until a problem is solved...
Citlali: She's not the type of person to just quietly accept her death!
Citlali: The Traveler shares that quality. That's why I think this gamble is worth it. Together, I know they can overcome the impossible, be it fate... or death.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: We shall have to wait and see, but I will curb my expectations.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: My time is running out. It is my honor to witness humanity in this moment of absolute determination.
Citlali: We won't forget your contributions. Once we deal with the Abyss, we'll find a way to keep you alive.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Thank you for saying that, but there is nothing you can do.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: How many years of life are enough? Ten? One hundred? One thousand? Ten thousand?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The Night Kingdom will disappear, the humans will continue to fight against the Abyss, and in the end, all will cease to exist... When you consider all of that, extending my life is meaningless.
Xilonen: That's what makes us different. Even if our end comes tomorrow, humanity will still do whatever it takes to survive today.
Citlali: Exactly.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Times like these always fill me with admiration, and reinforce my commitment to the mandate I shoulder.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: My creator was right in esteeming you as special above others.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Here, this is my gift to you and an extension of my will. It can record the Traveler's experiences in this land, whether from the past or the future.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: With it, you can forge the Ancient Name you desire, and the Traveler will also become a hero forever recorded in the memory of Natlan.
Xilonen: Thank you. We're sorry to ask this of you when your strength is already all but spent.
Citlali: Really, thank you so much.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Your thanks are unnecessary. This is the least that an Angel can do.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Time for you to leave. It's... getting dark.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Xilonen! Citlali! Is there a reason you're up so early?
Xilonen: We went to see the Lord of the Night, and she gave us this.
Xilonen: Like I said before... I couldn't forge your Ancient Name because there was no record of you in the Night Kingdom. But, with this, we can finally record your deeds.
Citlali: Just keep it with you during your time in Natlan, and eventually, it'll be full of your adventures.
Paimon: Really? Let Paimon see!
Paimon: Whoa, it's the two of us! And a sun in the middle...
Paimon: Oh, and that must be... Kachina?
Citlali: It's not a concrete medium. It reflects the Lord of the Night's will, and shows what she wants you to see.
Xilonen: In other words, don't worry about its form. When you want to check the contents, just take it out and have a look.
Paimon: Sounds convenient! It's also super light, and doesn't take up too much space...
Paimon: This is a really awesome gift!
Traveler: It didn't come at a price, right?
Paimon: Oh, yeah... We'd feel bad accepting something like that.
Xilonen: Don't worry, you two. Like you saw yesterday, aiding humanity is the Lord of the Night's mandate.
Xilonen: She would have willingly reconstructed Natlan's Ley Lines at the cost of her own existence. She wouldn't ask anything in return for this.
Citlali: Exactly... Just take it.
Paimon: Well, if you say so, hehe...
Kachina: Oh! Thank goodness you're here! The Abyss attacked again, and it's really bad!
Kachina: The monsters are everywhere! We need help!
Xilonen: So soon? We just fought them off!
Paimon: We can figure that out later! Let's go!
Traveler: It didn't cost a ton of Mora, right?
Paimon: You think the Lord of the Night wants Mora?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Citlali: Ororon.
Ororon: Granny.
Citlali: ...
Ororon: What's wrong, Granny? It looks like you have something to say.
Citlali: *scoff* You know exactly what you did! You need some sense knocked into you, that's what I think! Now, where do I even begin...
Ororon: I'm sorry.
Citlali: Hah, now that you have nowhere to run, THAT'S when you apologize!? You couldn't wait to run off last time, and the time before that...
Ororon: Pretty sure I apologized those times, too...
Citlali: What exactly were you thinking? Being a wanted criminal is one thing, but then you also tried to pull off that whole thing in the ancient ruin...
Citlali: I'm not the one who needs an apology... Apologize to yourself for risking your life.
Ororon: Okay, I'm sorry.
Citlali: ...
Ororon: I don't have anything to say for myself, Granny. Yell at me all you want. I know I messed up.
Citlali: You better be sincere. This is an incredibly serious matter.
Ororon: I'm being sincere, I promise. I've seriously reflected on my actions...
Ororon: I know what I did was risky, and I know I made some bad choices, but I don't regret it. I just had to do something...
Ororon: Not because I thought I was special, but because I wanted to help Natlan as much as I can.
Ororon: Of course, in the end, I just ended up causing more trouble, so... you're right. My apology doesn't mean much, but I don't know what else I can say.
Ororon: You even had Ifa bring me that gem... A simple thank you isn't enough, but still... Thank you, Granny.
Citlali: You're welcome. Just make sure to thank Ifa sometime.
Ororon: I will.
Citlali: Anyway, don't feel too grateful. I tampered with the bag to copy a portion of your memories.
Ororon: ...Oh, I didn't notice.
Citlali: Of course you didn't. You forget how many years I have on you? Like you could uncover one of my tricks...
Citlali: Anyway, I have something else to tell you.
Citlali: The Pyro Archon has discussed your case with the others. Many of your actions violated the rules of Natlan, and you should understand you'll have to take responsibility for that.
Ororon: I understand.
Citlali: But... your efforts weren't entirely meaningless in the end. In addition to giving us another failsafe, you saved yourself with sheer force of will, and managed to become a hero.
Citlali: Hmph, not too shabby, grandson.
Ororon: #Did Traveler and Paimon tell you to say that?
Citlali: What? No! I said that because I mean it!
Ororon: I can't believe you're complimenting me at a time like this... You normally let your fists do the talking.
Citlali: #You're not off the hook just yet. I told Traveler I was going to break your legs, and I meant every part of it!
Ororon: Could you... not? I still need them to walk...
Citlali: Trying to negotiate, are you? Alright... Make me an offer.
Ororon: Given all the good things that I managed to accomplish... can you let me off the hook this one time? I promise to do better in the future.
Citlali: Fine. I can let this slide for now, but I'll be watching. We'll see if I change my mind.
Citlali: #Oh? Traveler, Paimon... Didn't expect to see you here.
Paimon: Hello!
Traveler: Talking things out with your grandson?
Citlali: Yes... Looking after these little rascals is rather exhausting.
Paimon: #Taking care of Traveler isn't easy either... Paimon's life is an uphill battle.
Traveler: ?
Ororon: #Traveler, Paimon... I want to thank you for your help back at the ruin.
Traveler: It was nothing.
Ororon: I won't.
Citlali: Let's get together sometime. If Ororon really wants to thank you, he can treat us all to a tasty meal.
Paimon: Sounds great! We'll be there!
Traveler: Just don't do anything like that ever again!

### Additional Talk 2

"The Captain": Now that we're working together, we'll need to coordinate our efforts. I'll leave a portion of my forces for you to command.
Mavuika: That will definitely help relieve some pressure. You're sure they won't object?
"The Captain": It's an order — I will make that clear.
Mavuika: Excellent. I appreciate your trust.

### Additional Talk 3

Solnev: The Captain says a group of us need to stay behind to guard the Source Mechanism. It's extremely important. We'll stay here.
Solnev: Of course, you're free to come and go as you please.

### Additional Talk 4

Xilonen: You should head back and get some rest. I need to fix some things here first...

### Additional Talk 5

Dedougou: Ah, finally some relief...

### Additional Talk 6

Boulsa: What rotten luck, to be injured at a time like this...
