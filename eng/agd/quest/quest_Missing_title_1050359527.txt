Traveler: About Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals...
Pitot: Oh, you can't just find this just anywhere. I'm pretty interested in collecting strange and interesting things, so if you're willing to hand it over to me, I'll make sure to compensate you.
Pitot: Sure looks like a good specimen. If you manage to come across any of these things again in the future, do me a favor and bring them to me. I'll compensate you like I did just now.
