Amina: Atea... is an elder I deeply respect.
Amina: After my grandfather died, the elders voted for me to become the chief of our tribe.
Amina: I always have a lot of new and crazy ideas, so everyone believed I could lead our tribe towards a different kind of future.
Amina: For a long time, though, I had no idea what to do.
Amina: But, Atea was always there to encourage me. Even when I made mistakes, she never made me feel bad for messing up. She'd help me analyze what went wrong and help me do better next time.
Amina: She's someone I really respect, so... I'll remember what she taught me, and work hard to become the chief our tribe deserves.
