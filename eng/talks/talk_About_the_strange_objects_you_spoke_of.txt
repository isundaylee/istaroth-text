# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About the strange objects you spoke of...
Daniaud: Fishermen often say that "fishermen can catch anything — just not fish."
Daniaud: I thought that was just a joke, to be honest, but as it turns out, there really is such a person in Sumeru — no matter what water body he goes to, what bait or equipment he uses, he always catches... Well, not fish!
Daniaud: What an enviable ability! I thought that simply being able to catch clockwork fish here in Fontaine was already quite amazing!
Daniaud: If the things we catch define a fisherman's world, then his world truly is vibrant and full of life.
Daniaud: *sigh* Enough talk. I should do my best as well!
