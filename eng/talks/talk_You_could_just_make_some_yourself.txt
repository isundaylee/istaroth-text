Traveler: You could just make some yourself.
Taisuke: Exactly! That's exactly what I was thinking too! Seirai Island is dotted by a great number of shallows, so I decided to make some tools and go over there later to catch a few fish!
Taisuke: Once that's done, we can make some grilled fish, some smoked fish, some dried fish, some fish soup...
Taisuke: Oh, I do hope Lady Neko will like them!
