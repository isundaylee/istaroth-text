Traveler: What's the deal with "Before Sun and Moon"?
Ema: That book is quite special, insofar that it wasn't borrowed and not returned, but was instead stolen.
Ema: It is a chronicle of fables, and is a restricted text. In fact, I believe that Watatsumi Omikami himself ordered that it be banned.
Ema: Those three have close links with Khaenri'ah, and have as such been deemed suspects. They have been locked in the hanging prison beneath Dainichi Mikoshi.
Ema: You can start your investigation from them.
