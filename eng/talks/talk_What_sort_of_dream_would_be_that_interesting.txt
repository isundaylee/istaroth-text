Traveler: What sort of dream would be that interesting?
Moce: A very, very long one! Uh, I don't really remember much of it anymore, though. Did I have it yesterday? Or have I had it before...
Moce: I dreamed that the town was invaded, and I joined up with the Gardes, becoming an awesome officer â€” even my dad had to listen to me!
Moce: I would say, "Giovanni, bring me my gun," and he could only say, "Sir, yes, sir!"
Moce: In the past, when I would dream, I would wake up once I realized that something didn't add up. But that dream was perfect. I was so happy, I could've played in there forever.
Moce: I guess it's because of my recent desire to go on an adventure.
