# Talk Dialog

Xiao: #Traveler.
Traveler: It's just as I thought... You stopped short of stepping into the city again.
Xiao: Being in the city isn't the only way for me to appreciate the lights and beauty of Lantern Rite. Look... Liyue Harbor lies just beyond this mountain.
Xiao: As long as I stand at this vantage point, I may freely behold the sight of all the kites slowly ascending into the sky.
Xiao: ...For me, that is enough.
Traveler: Alright.
Xiao: I invited you here because there is something I would like to do.
Xiao: ...I want to release a Xiao Lantern, and... I'd like you to be there for it.
Traveler: Did you make it yourself?
Xiao: Yes.
Xiao: I apologize for its crude appearance... I have little skill in that regard.
Traveler: No, no! It's amazing.
Xiao: ...You are very kind, as usual.
Xiao: Alright. It's time.
