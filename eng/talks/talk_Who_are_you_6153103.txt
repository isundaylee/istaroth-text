Traveler: Who are you?
Adelinde: I am the head housemaid. Please come to me if you ever need help with anything at the winery.
Adelinde: My work? Just housekeeping. Most of the time it's just cleaning the rooms and taking out the trash, nothing strenuous.
Traveler: What can you tell me about the rumors?

Adelinde: Don't take them too seriously. Nothing they tell you is worth paying too much attention to.
Adelinde: Did you really think there could be quite so much drama... Heh...
