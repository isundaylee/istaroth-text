## Talk 1

Bricole: Huh. Was the time limit too short? It seems even you found that rather tricky...
Bricole: Would you like to try again? You just need to <color=#00E1FFFF>retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit</color>, and then come find me.

## Talk 2

Bricole: Oh, you're back. Well, and so am I...
Bricole: After the Institute heard my brief report, I was asked to assess the area for suitability as a quality development training ground alongside conducting my retrieval work.
Bricole: *sigh* This all feels very familiar, somehow. I remember that there was a period of time when our Administrative Officer was very big on getting everyone to do diving training as well.
Bricole: I personally think that it's all rather pointless, but work is work, I suppose, and a mission is a mission... Not to mention how this place is rather strange... I mean, unique.
Bricole: As such, I've placed a few replica anchors in the area. Don't worry, they're just dummies. They're one-hundred-percent safe.
Bricole: The content of the current training is to <color=#00E1FFFF>retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit</color>.
Bricole: Would you like to give it a go? I can give you some compensation for taking part â€” you'll be assisting in research, after all.

## Talk 3

Bricole: Alright, I'm timing you. You need to <color=#00E1FFFF>retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit</color>, and then come find me.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let me give it a try.
Bricole: Alright. I'll time you. Don't forget, you need to <color=#00E1FFFF>retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit</color>, and then come find me.

## Talk 5

Bricole: You got it! Looks like this challenge isn't impossible, after all! Guess I can submit this proposal to the Institute!
Bricole: Shame that I haven't finished checking all the assets yet, so I'll have to come back here later.
Bricole: But regardless, thanks for your help! Ah yes, and here's your reward. Safe travels, now!
