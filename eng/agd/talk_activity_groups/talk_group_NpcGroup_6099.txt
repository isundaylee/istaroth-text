Tundama: Want a letter mailed? It's good to keep in touch with your family and friends, you know!

## Talk

Traveler: Do you do overseas delivery?
Tundama: Theoretically speaking, it shouldn't be a problem.
Tundama: It'll be a bit difficult for me to leave Natlan personally, though. I'll have to submit multiple rounds of applications to the Wayob, and even then, it's anyone's guess whether or not my leave permit will be granted...
Tundama: Haha, jokes aside.
Tundama: If letters need to be sent abroad, we'll usually take them to the border, before handing them over to our colleagues from the other nations.
Tundama: Anyway, just leave it to me! I promise you that I'll get it delivered!

## Talk

Traveler: I wonder how you'd send a letter to someone without an address.
Tundama: Haha, so it's not so much a letter as a missing person poster, eh?
Tundama: If you're looking for someone, you might want to try your luck with the People of the Springs.
Tundama: Their folks and Saurians are all super knowledgeable. They are adept at both pathfinding and navigation.
Tundama: Some people have said that Koholasaurs are like dogs that live in water, and I think they're on to something.
Tundama: Their only flaw is that they tend to work rather... slowly. You might have to wait a while before you can be reunited again.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm fine for now.
Tundama: No worries! Just come find me if you need a letter delivered.

## Talk

Traveler: You seem to love your job.
Tundama: Of course!
Tundama: You can stay in shape, enjoy the scenery, and even enjoy the happy smiles on the recipients' faces when they get the letter at long last. There's no other job that'll let you have all that!
Tundama: It's true that I'll have to be the harbinger of bad news every once in a while, but the longer you work this job, the more you learn that good things still outweigh bad things in this world!

## Talk

Traveler: Do you do overseas delivery?
Tundama: Of course! If I ever want to leave Natlan, I just need to submit a request to the chief. I never have to wait long for approval.
Tundama: That said, I do most of my deliveries within our borders.
Tundama: If letters need to be sent abroad, we'll usually take them to the border, before handing them over to our colleagues from the other nations.
Tundama: Anyway, just leave it to me! I'll get it delivered â€” that's a promise!
