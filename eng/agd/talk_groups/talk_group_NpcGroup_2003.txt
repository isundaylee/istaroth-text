Uncle Tian: Oh, hey kiddo!
Uncle Tian: Now here I was thinking that the Lantern Rite would go by without incident this year. But my, did I not expect to see the Jade Chamber to rise again in my time.
Uncle Tian: It's a good way to start the year, I say!

Traveler: How have things been going lately?
Uncle Tian: Well, after handing my work off to others, I must say that I've certainly freed up a lot of time.
Uncle Tian: And now that I've had time to handle more mundane matters, I've realized that many of my old fishing buddies have either passed, or that we've drifted apart in the intervening years.
Uncle Tian: ...Seems like you've got a lot on your mind, too. So how about it, wanna reel a few fish in together?
Uncle Tian: You've got to get away from the clutter if you want to keep your mind clear. In many things, you just have to go with the flow. As long as your conscience is clear, things will be fine.

## Talk

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Wow. I didn't think you'd be able to break the game this way.

## Talk

Uncle Tian: This is a game I've been thinking about for a long time. It's not easy to break, haha.

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Well, if I were younger, I might have figured out a way to break it...

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Don't underestimate an old veteran's card skills...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Uncle Tian: Just a spot of fishing. I don't make my living off of it anymore, though, so when I catch something, I throw it right back in again.
Uncle Tian: It's been a long time since I chatted with someone your age. Good to meet you. Here, have a fish.

## Talk

Traveler: About fishing...
Uncle Tian: Fishing, you say... Well, it's certainly not a tool to hide my identity. I really do enjoy fishing.
Uncle Tian: After a life of struggle and strife, fishing is how I quiet down and clear my thoughts.
Uncle Tian: To be honest, I'm not even all that concerned about the value of my catches anymore... On the other hand, you seem quite concerned about that, don't you?
Uncle Tian: Haha, come now, of course I can see it. Here, you can take today's catch.

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Darn. Seems I forgot my bait.
Uncle Tian: Oh, hey kiddo!

## Talk

Traveler: Hello.
Uncle Tian: Hey there! Never expected any young 'uns would come talking to me at my age.
Uncle Tian: Find yourself a spot to sit. You can call me Uncle Tian. Makes this old codger feel like a young man again.
Uncle Tian: Huh? You think I still look young?
Uncle Tian: Well, youth isn't really a matter of age... it's more to do with how much pain and suffering you've experienced in your life.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your boat.
Uncle Tian: This boat? You like her huh? Been with me all my life...
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler, but at least I had it in me to haul in whatever snagged my line!
Uncle Tian: Things you do for yourself, you yourself get to reap the rewards for. How much you sweat determines how much you get... Those were the good ole days, could just keep goin' an' never get tired.
Uncle Tian: ...
Uncle Tian: ...
Traveler: ...?
Uncle Tian: Ahhh, what was I saying... Lost my train of thought...
Uncle Tian: Oh, right. Anyway, I struggled for the first... I dunno how long, but with perseverance and bit of luck, I got my own business started up and didn't have to do all the fishin' myself anymore.
Uncle Tian: But, everyone's out tryna swindle each other, an' before I knew it, I'd lost sight of myself.
Uncle Tian: So to bring myself back to my roots, I bring my tired old self here to fish and talk about the good ole days.
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler...
Traveler: You ahh... said that part already...
Uncle Tian: ...Whaddya mean I said that already? Don't butt in when the old fella's talkin'. Now back then I was poorer than a panhandler...
Uncle Tian: but at least I had it in me to haul 'em in...
Uncle Tian: ...

## Talk

Traveler: Okay, great. Ahh... Bye.
Uncle Tian: Oh, alright then. Be careful out there young 'un.
Uncle Tian: If you happen to pass by Qingce Village and see my dear Yundan, be sure to speak with her, let her know I'm alive, yeah?

## Talk

Uncle Tian: Ho there, youngster.
Uncle Tian: Oh? So it's you. Haha, I suppose there's no point keeping up the act, then.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about your real identity...
Uncle Tian: Shh... Don't shout it for the whole world to hear. Other than a few people in key posts, the number of people who know my identity can be counted on one hand.
Uncle Tian: People have ever been made to choose between status and freedom.
Uncle Tian: It has taken a lot of effort for me to preserve both, haha.
Uncle Tian: But I, too, shall give up my seat as one of the Qixing someday. The more freedom I experience, the more status feels unwieldy and clumsy.
Uncle Tian: ...I hope that "he" too can enjoy his freedom, now that he has thrown off his yoke.

## Talk

Traveler: About Huixin...
Uncle Tian: Haha, thanks for looking out for my daughter.
Uncle Tian: She can be quite headstrong. Only good old Ganyu... I mean, Ms. Ganyu, can get through to her.
Uncle Tian: But ever since that previous incident, she seems to have become more receptive to my advice...
Uncle Tian: ...Speaking of which, you're quite the cunning player yourself, hmm?

## Talk

Traveler: Till next time.
Uncle Tian: Go well, youngster.
Uncle Tian: If you happen to pass by Qingce Village and see my dear Yundan, be sure to speak with her, let her know I'm alive, yeah?

## Talk

Uncle Tian: What's all this commotion... Has something happened?

## Talk

Traveler: It's the Lantern Rite festival.
Uncle Tian: ...Oh yes, Lantern Rite! One of the biggest days of the year.
Uncle Tian: Young people these days... I do wonder whether they will be able to cope...

## Talk

Traveler: A dragon, Stoneterror, is attacking the city!
Uncle Tian: ...A dragon, you say?
Uncle Tian: Well don't just stand there, call the Milibands! ...The Band of Mili-Men, you know? Or was it the Mili-Band of Brothers? The Knights that Mill Around, maybe?
Uncle Tian: *sigh* I can't remember what they're called. I'll probably just fish here a while longer then go back home...
