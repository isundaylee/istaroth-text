Moco: D'you know what?
Hillie: No, what?
Moco: We have one less key than Adelinde... uh-huh...
Hillie: *gasp* Does that mean... There's a secret room!?
Moco: Right! You got it!
Moco: And so this one time, when I was waxing the floors, I noticed that right down the far end of the corridor on the second floor... there's a hidden room!
Hillie: Really!? So that's really the room that...?
Moco: Well. I crept up to the door and as I got close, I heard this "thud... thud... thud" sound getting closer and closer!
Moco: I was like, sooo scared... and then just as I was about to run away... Adelinde was behind me!
Hillie: Yikes!
Moco: The weirdest thing is that she didn't even tell me off. Instead, she was all polite and asked me nicely to go back to my room...
Moco: But when I got back to my room, that's when I realizedâ€”
Moco: That thudding sound... it was exactly like how Adelinde's shoes sound when she walks!
