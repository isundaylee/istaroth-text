Charles: Any recommendations?
Charles: The apple cider from the Dawn Winery is a special at Angel's Share.
Charles: You can try my special cocktail if you want. It's on the house if it's your first time here.
Traveler: What sort of liquor is the best?
Charles: If you like strong wine, then I'd recommend that you try Death After Noon. It's Captain Kaeya's favorite.
Charles: But the strongest wine I know has to be the one called Fire-Water.
Charles: It hails from Snezhnaya, and was brought into Mondstadt by Snezhnayan merchants, but Master Diluc stopped importing it, saying that it didn't fit the tastes of the people here.
Charles: The only remaining bottle is from the original batch. It's for display purposes only, though, so you'll have to go to Snezhnaya if you want to try some.
