Traveler: Sounds complicated...
Jin: It's not that bad, but there's simply too much tea in the warehouse, and they all require different preservation methods. Some can't be exposed to humidity, some must be kept away from bugs, some can't be placed under the light, and some can't come into contact with other tea leaves to prevent their flavors from mingling with others.
Jin: To guarantee that every type is preserved in the appropriate environment, the warehouse is divided into many areas, and some even overlap one another...
Jin: Even if I know where to look for something, it takes a lot of effort to retrieve said item.
