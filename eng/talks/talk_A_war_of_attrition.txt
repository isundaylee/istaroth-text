Traveler: A war of attrition?
Hiroyuki: Yes. I'm currently considering conflict scenarios versus the Shogun's Army.
Hiroyuki: I've fought against the enforcers of the Vision Hunt Decree before. I know how strong they are.
Hiroyuki: By contrast, we Sangonomiya troops suffer from a severe material shortage. Watatsumi Island's production capacities just can't keep up. A war of attrition is therefore strictly disadvantageous to us.
Hiroyuki: Not to mention how Vision wielders are in the vast minority. How long can us ordinary people stand against the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hiroyuki: *sigh* This path of resistance is an arduous one indeed...
