# The Toy War: An Armistice


## Talk 1

Caron: Haven't gone back, have you? Well, I must thank you — I'm sure father would be pleased that my brother and I finally spoke.

## Talk 2

Livre: I see you're doing well, Caron.
Caron: B—Brother? What are you doing here?
Livre: We haven't seen each other in so long, and THAT'S what you chose to say?
Caron: I—I just didn't expect you to come over to see me. I mean, our shops are quite close together, but you never came over. I thought you were still angry with me...
Livre: I'm not here to talk to you about what happened before. I'm just going to ask you this: that adventurer toy was made because of me, right?
Caron: Ah? Uh... *sigh*
Caron: I knew I wouldn't be able to hide anything from you.
Paimon: W—Wait, now Paimon's confused. Wasn't that toy inspired by Bennett?
Caron: Ah, I see you two have arrived as well... I'm sorry for not explaining previously, but I didn't know where to begin...
Caron: Although that adventurer did give me critical inspiration, my brother was the real reason I insisted on having the toy made.
Traveler: I can see why it might be complicated for you.
Livre: Caron, your mawkishness hasn't changed one bit.
Caron: You haven't changed either, brother. I'm more and more convinced that you and that adventurer are the same type of person.
Livre: I don't have a Vision, nor am I an adventurer.
Caron: But you have that same adventurous spirit. Bennett lives in an adventure, while you live for adventure.
Livre: Did you pick that flattery up from me too?
Caron: How can that be? You've never been a flatterer — you've never hesitated to tell me that I haven't any fighting spirit. And while the truth is frustrating, it is the truth nonetheless.
Caron: You've always been trying to be the best toy merchant ever, but I acceded to the family's arrangements, continuing the cycle of clockmaking.
Caron: Only people like you and Bennett could turn their passions into their profession. I cannot — it would take a hundred of me to match your courage.
Paimon: C'mon, don't say that about yourself!
Caron: There's no point in hiding this... When my brother first stated his intentions to move his shop next to mine, my first reaction was to consider moving the shop. Father would be ashamed, and rightly so.
Caron: But in the end, the Northland Bank took that spot and separated us. A happy coincidence again, you could say.
Paimon: Yeah, Arbon told us about it.
Livre: Hmph. Do you really think the world is so full of happy coincidences? That the Northland Bank just so happened to come between us at that time?
Traveler: What do you mean, Livre?
Livre: I had reserved that spot long ago, but a new idea struck me, and so I transferred it to them for a low price. This didn't just come out of nowhere, you know.
Paimon: So you were the one who got them involved! Huh. Did you think that your previous decision was too impulsive or something?
Livre: Ever since I left, my goal has always been to be the greatest toy merchant. But what sort of greatness would that be if the family feud made my brother move away in the process, huh?
Paimon: Hehehe, that smells like concern to Paimon! You were just making excuses when you said you wanted Caron to apologize, weren't you?
Caron: A—Apologize?
Livre: What "apologize"? Did I ever say that?
Paimon: Wow, that's a really earnest denial, considering that you actually did say it!
Livre: Hmph. I'm here to congratulate you, Caron. That toy... is quite well-made.
Caron: Heh. It's been such a long time since I last heard a word of praise from you, brother. I didn't think that...
Livre: I've also brought you a gift: here's the data I had these two adventurers gather over the last few days. This should help you create something even more interesting.
Caron: Huh? But weren't you going to make toy Champion Duelists? That data's important to you, isn't it?
Livre: That plan's suspended. The market shifted faster than I thought, so some ad-hoc adjustments will be necessary.
Caron: But... This data... How could I just take it?
Livre: You take it when I give it to you, obviously!
Caron: *sigh* In that case, I'll take it... for safe-keeping. Feel free to reclaim it, should you ever need it again.
Paimon: Huh, so Livre's "other plan" was to give the data to his brother.
Livre: I apologize, dear customers, that I did not ask for your suggestions first before doing this.
Paimon: #Oh, it's fine. You paid us, didn't you? And this is your personal matter. This was totally worth it if your relationship with your brother can be improved, right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Our thoughts are aligned in this, indeed.
Paimon: Hehe. Guess this was a successful third party intervention!
Paimon: Oh, right. Livre, Caron, since we're all here...
Paimon: Why don't you strike while the iron's hot and work together on something? You're good at making stuff, Caron, and we can have Livre do the advertising! If you do it as a team, it's sure to work out!
Livre: I appreciate your good intentions, but there's no need.
Caron: Hmm... I feel the same way.
Paimon: Wait, so this is what you two are gonna agree on!?
Livre: That Bennett fellow said this too, didn't he? "The world is full of all sorts of people."
Caron: So you did remember that part.
Livre: "The world is full of all sorts of people, and they all have sights that only they can see." If I learned anything from him at all, this would be it.
Livre: Caron and I are just different people, which is why we've set out on different paths. Perhaps he thinks that my path is too adventurous, and I for my part can't stand the kind of placid existence he leads.
Caron: That's right. If the hour hand does the minute hand's work, it will get fired without compensation the next day.
Livre: And while intense challenges are an adventure, is a simple life not one as well? Everyone's on their own journey of adventure.
Livre: So, since we've each chosen our direction, let's walk down that path and seek our own unique sights.
Caron: And I'll occasionally go meet with you. After all, your road will be quite difficult.
Livre: Pfft, don't you worry about me. At least I know how to enlist third parties to help me out of jams. I didn't sit around waiting for these adventurers or the Northland Bank, let me tell you that.
Caron: And what will you do when there's a problem that even a third-party can't solve? I'm sure you know how the stiffer a gear is, the less durable it will be. I worry that...
Livre: And if we meet, we'll meet! What else can we do, huh? That's just life.
Caron: No. You won't be defeated by life, just like Bennett. And if things prove otherwise...
Livre: Yeah?
Caron: I'll send you flying with a knuckle sandwich.
Livre: Hah, brat, listen to yourself, talking to your big brother like that. Don't get too cocky!
Paimon: Well, if Lady Furina can sit at the judges' desk for a while, then a little brother can borrow his big brother's lines, right?
Livre: Haha, I see you're figuring us Fontainians out. I'd like to ask you something, so if you're free, let's meet outside my shop later.
Livre: That's all I have to say today, Caron. I'll be heading back now.
Traveler: We're honest businessmen, too.
Traveler: I don't really get what was so difficult about all this.
Livre: That's on my brother for twisting himself about into loops over everything.

## Talk 3

Livre: You're here.
Paimon: Well, you seem to be in a good mood.
Livre: Thanks to your help. Speaking of which, Caron's trip to Mondstadt gave me an idea.
Livre: Perhaps I should go travel around for a bit and find some inspiration for toys myself.
Livre: You've traveled the world. You probably know some friends like that Bennett. Do you have any suggestions for me?
Paimon: Well, we do have a lot of friends, but when it comes to toy inspiration, that might be a bit tough...
Traveler: Why not look for a third party?
Paimon: Eh? We're a valid third party, aren't we?
Livre: Are you referring to... the Northland Bank?
Paimon: Oh, you meant the previous third party! Oh, let Paimon think... The Northland Bank's under the Fatui, and the Fatui are under...
Livre: Are you referring to a Harbinger? Do you mean that we can make a toy themed after a Harbinger?
Paimon: #...Huh! {NICKNAME}, do you mean... Oh, Paimon gets it.
Paimon: Hehe, Livre, did you know that there's a very special Harbinger, whom they call the—
Paimon: "The greatest toy salesman in Snezhnaya"!
Livre: What? Is there such a person?
Paimon: Of course, and he's a real expert, too! Maybe he'll inspire you... and y'know, a toy merchant and a seller would make a pretty awesome combo, don't you think?
Livre: Thanks for your suggestions — they've been very helpful.
Livre: I don't think it would be easy to get in contact with a Harbinger, but I do have some connections at the Northland Bank. I'll see what I can do.
Paimon: Hehe. Don't forget to invite us to try whatever new toy you come up with!
Livre: I will. Keep an ear out for news from me!
