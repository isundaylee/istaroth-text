# Familiar-Looking Candy Box

A candy box that is often used in various celebrations in Sumeru. When the girl who would become a researcher was still young, she used to take one candy a day from the box. Back in those days, her biggest worry was that the candy would run out. After becoming a researcher, this empty candy box has become a nostalgic reminder of other possibilities in life. This candy box was left here as a gift. To the researcher, this is also a symbol of freedom from misery.
