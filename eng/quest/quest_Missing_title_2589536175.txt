# Missing title (2589536175)

Traveler: How are your adventures going?
Ylgr: Quite smoothly. I've finished annotating the maps of Drunkard Gorge, Springvale and the surrounding areas...
Ylgr: Annotation is actually quite tiring, but it's also very satisfying... Are you interested in my work, by any chance?
Ylgr: If you are, please take these â€” it's some of the knowledge I've gained on my adventures. Someday, everyone in Mondstadt will use the maps I've made!
