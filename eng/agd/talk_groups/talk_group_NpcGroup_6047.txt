## Talk

Sibu: Hello, need a letter sent? I hope the destination is somewhere I've never been before.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you that well-traveled?
Sibu: Well, that's all relative.
Sibu: Naturally, someone like me who delivers letters all the time has seen a lot more of the world than someone who never gets out.
Sibu: But I mainly carry messages from tribe to tribe, so I'm a lot less well-traveled if you compare me to those of my colleagues who've been much further afield.
Sibu: I even have a friend who once delivered something near Ochkanatlan!
Sibu: It's an ancient city, built by the followers of the first Pyro Archon. The whole area's very dangerous, but we'll deliver there all the same!
Sibu: I just hope I'll be lucky enough to pick up a cool commission like that too sometime soon...

Traveler: Don't worry, I shan't bother you.
Sibu: I see, looks like your friends are all still around then.
