# Root Cycle

One of the keys designed by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo for the tower. When combined, the keys form a peculiar shape of three and a half circles, for which there is a special explanation.
The third circle and outermost half circle are the Cycles of Remuria and Khraun-Arya, symbolizing the relationship between humans and gods.
