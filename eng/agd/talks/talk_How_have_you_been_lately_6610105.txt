Traveler: How have you been lately?
Michica: Okay... ish... Mostly because we've been short-staffed.
Michica: The area affected by the war was so vast that many of our couriers, who were tasked with carrying battle reports, ended up collapsing from exhaustion. Many others are still busy running to and fro between the various camps.
Michica: We are now prioritizing the delivery of intel related to the Abyss and reconstruction efforts. The efficiency of other package deliveries may be affected as a result â€” we apologize in advance.
