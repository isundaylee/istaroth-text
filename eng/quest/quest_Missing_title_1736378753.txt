## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Ritou Harbor bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices regarding all kinds of matters will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: Former Kanjou Commissioner Hiiragi Shinsuke now awaits the Almighty Shogun's judgment regarding his crimes of high treason. Owing to his age and in acknowledgment of his past contributions, he is presently indefinitely detained without bail.
Bulletin Board: However, should he commit any more acts of treason during this detention, he will be branded a public enemy of the Inazuman state and his judgment shall be enacted with extreme prejudice and without any mercy.
Bulletin Board: While the Kanjou Commission debates the matter of his successor, the Commission's duties shall be performed by a personal deputy of Her Excellency.
Bulletin Board: The duties of Kanjou Commission staff will not be adjusted. We urge all staff to remain calm and follow any arrangements sent from your superiors.

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: As we are presently in a state of ceasefire and peace, imports to Watatsumi Island will resume.
Bulletin Board: Once the matter of trade route security is agreed upon by both the Shogunate and Sangonomiya, the commercial port to Watatsumi Island will be opened shortly.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: "Thanks to the efforts of various big shots, we can finally do business freely once again."
Bulletin Board: "Many of our friends who'd lost confidence have gained it again, and those who went bankrupt have hope of regaining their liquidity."
Bulletin Board: "I'd love to say more, but things are so busy..."
Bulletin Board: "Whatever the case may be, to anyone who reads this message, I wish you luck in the coming days!"

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: Yashiori Island's Jakotsu Mine has been closed temporarily, with representatives from the Shogunate and Sangonomiya discussing future development. It will be reopened soon after an agreement has been reached.
Bulletin Board: Former miners from Jakotsu may claim job loss compensation from the Yashiro Commission estates and may also take the occasion to indicate preferred avenues of future employment.

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: The special privileges granted to Snezhnayan merchants in trade and in port affairs have been revoked. Any accumulated arrears must be paid within 2 weeks, or Ritou will not extend further protection to your goods and cargo.
Bulletin Board: We ask all shipments of military equipment and material to leave the borders of Inazuma and Sangonomiya immediately. The Fatui and all related personnel are included in this order.
Bulletin Board: "I am but a humble leather goods contractor for the Shogun's Army and have nothing to do with the Fatui. I only knew of the war through the financial statements I went through..."
Bulletin Board: "I have also only just gotten my permanent business permit from the Kanjou Commission. Am I still to be chased out nonetheless...?"
Bulletin Board: We apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you, but please do leave within the allotted time.

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: I'm searching for my husband, Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou. He is a tall man without any facial hair and has a scar on the side of his forehead. He has yet to return home despite the ceasefire.
Bulletin Board: If any returning samurai or old friends and acquaintances know of his whereabouts, please inform me. You will be duly thanked for your help!
Bulletin Board: Yours Respectfully, Inaba Shizuko.

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "I was often stuck doing lots of rear echelon work, so I never got to see the grand sights of Inazuma City. But today, I finally got my wish."
Bulletin Board: "The locals here in Ritou were pretty restrained. I guess it's because not too long ago, we were still at each others' throats..."
Bulletin Board: "But we were welcomed very warmly by the outlanders. Couldn't find one of their stores without discounts for us Watatsumi folk anywhere you looked."
Bulletin Board: "Looks like our actions did have a positive impact on their lives after all... I'm glad that all the unfortunate things that happened so far were not meaningless after all."

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: "Ahahaha! Ever since I got my Vision back, I've been super motivated! Guess who's back? That's right! I'm back!"
Bulletin Board: "C'mon, Kujou Tengu! So I heard that you got a hiding and had to flee all the way back here. I'm practically laughing myself silly over here, you know? Ahahaha!"
Bulletin Board: "I'll be waiting for you at the port just for an extra laugh! And don't forget about our duel!"
Bulletin Board: Would you shut up already? I heard you the first time!
Bulletin Board: This message has been left specifically by Madam Sara and may not be removed.
Bulletin Board: I did not leave that there! Have it removed at once! Do your jobs, you people of the Outlander Affairs Agency, will you!?

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: "Watching these 'traitors' who so often had to give back before us saunter and shop their way through Ritou..."
Bulletin Board: "And thinking back on all the losses and pain that we suffered during this war... bitterness wells up within me unbidden."
Bulletin Board: "Still, I suppose that surviving and being able to reunite with my family was a good thing in the end... This war has just taken so much out of us all."
Bulletin Board: "I'm not sure if I get to say this, considering that we were enemies..."
Bulletin Board: "But we've been given a new opportunity by this peace, haven't we? I hear that Uyuu Restaurant is pretty famous around these parts. Let's go get a drink there some time."
Bulletin Board: "...Don't you act so familiar with me."

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "I came here to Ritou specifically to look for a Tenryou samurai who once gave me a sword wound on the battlefield."
Bulletin Board: "I was going to thank him for not striking a fatal blow then and ask him for another duel."
Bulletin Board: "I hate to break it to you, but now that we are at peace, Her Excellency the Shogun has banned all duels with real swords save for duels before the throne."
Bulletin Board: "Agh, come on! That's so boring! ... Ah, whatever. Let's just go get a drink or something, eh?"
Bulletin Board: "Speaking of drinking, I do know a good spot. Meet me at the docks later?"
Bulletin Board: "Alright, that'd be great!"

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: With Lady Miko's permission, the Grand Shrine will soon host a large-scale event.
Bulletin Board: This is a rare opportunity, so we encourage all shrine maidens, clergy, and commission staff to make preparations soon!

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: "After the Sakoku Decree was abolished, trade activities have come to life â€” as has pirate activity."
Bulletin Board: "Please remember to keep safe as you sail, and if you are attacked by pirates, please report it to the Tenryou Commission as soon as possible."

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: Their Excellencies, the Almighty Ogosho and Watatsumi's Divine Priestess, both express their deep grief at the many tragedies that occurred at Tatarasuna and on Yashiori Island.
Bulletin Board: From this day forth, the Shogunate and Sangonomiya will begin reconstruction and redevelopment work in these lands in partnership with one another.
Bulletin Board: Together, we will pacify this war-torn land, bring the guilty to justice, and restore Inazuma's prosperity.
Bulletin Board: All the more must we follow the divine wisdom of Her Excellency the Shogun, acting as one to accomplish the great cause of Eternity.

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: "To help deal with increased trade needs, I suggest that everyone arrange to meet at the International Trade Association to exchange information and ascertain the situation."
Bulletin Board: "Let's avoid any unnecessary competition and convert our business opportunities into the greatest profits possible."
Bulletin Board: "I'm all for it! Mora, here I come!"

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: "A friend who used to go out fishing together with me has returned. His time in the war seems to have left him very melancholy indeed."
Bulletin Board: "Our neighbors have some reservations about him due to his having joined the resistance army, and have kept their distance for the most part..."
Bulletin Board: "But it doesn't matter much to me. He's my friend and that's what counts!"

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: "The very next day after the ceasefire came into effect, a ship from Sangonomiya arrived, claiming to want to purchase some lifestyle goods from Yae Publishing House."
Bulletin Board: "I mean, that's what I heard, at least."
Bulletin Board: "That said, I've got no clue what lifestyle goods they thought they'd get at a bookstore..."
