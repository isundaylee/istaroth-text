## Talk

Kurai: I am the Jibashiri Kurai. Are you here to help solve the problem of these small orbs of thunder?
Traveler: What problem is that?
Kurai: Ah, yes, when I went to Narukami Island to conduct an exchange previously, I used a secret technique to capture some strange objects.
Kurai: I think the academic name for it is an Electro Seele. Or something.
Kurai: They fly all over the place, and numb all the people living here. It's quite vexing...
Traveler: What do you need solved?
Kurai: Well, the issue of those Electro Cells, of course.
Kurai: Between you and me, I have no idea what to do with them.
Kurai: Vishaps and villains, I can master, but these little gadgets are way beyond me.
Kurai: How am I supposed to stop them from moving?
Traveler: See you.
Kurai: See you. If you know how, please help me solve this electric ball problem.
