Traveler: You need to fish for a Paimon.
Yuzu: Eh? What's a Paimon?
Yuzu: Oh, you mean a guide... Hmm, that might be tough. Inazuma's been closed for so long, I haven't had the opportunity to make any friends from other lands...
Yuzu: I doubt the people at the Adventurers' Guild will be much help there either. Why, I was just spinning my wheels here this entire time, and if it were up to them, I would keep doing that!
Yuzu: But now that I'm free, I'm going to get prepped, and then I'll take my first step toward being a great adventurer!
