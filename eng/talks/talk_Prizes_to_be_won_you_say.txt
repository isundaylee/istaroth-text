Traveler: Prizes to be won, you say?
Yamashiro Kenta: That's right, we're giving out prizes for store names!
Yamashiro Kenta: I wanted to come up with a catchy name and also get some publicity at the same time, so this is my two-in-one solution.
Yamashiro Kenta: The clients here were very enthusiastic, and they gave me a lot of suggestions.
Yamashiro Kenta: It's just that, well... Most of the names have been something too, uh, special. Like "The Watatsumi Pearl," the "Nagi-Nagi," "Tumbly-Round-Super-Shiny," and so on.
Yamashiro Kenta: Standing out from the crowd is good, of course, but I reckon that it would be better if we went with something that has broad appeal, so I've yet to decide on a final name.
Yamashiro Kenta: If you have any good ideas, please take part in the event as well!
