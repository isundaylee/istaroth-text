Traveler: Is Lily your daughter?
Jilliana: Oops, did I say my prayers out loud by mistake?
Jilliana: ...I should concentrate more when I pray.
Jilliana: Lily is my daughter. She is a gift from Barbatos; the gift of hope.
Jilliana: ...All it was, was, Lily was pestering me this morning to get her a present.
Traveler: You really love your daughter.
Jilliana: It's true, I do.
Jilliana: ...I have been through many... bad things in my life.
Jilliana: Luckily, I have moved past all that now. I have a family, and most importantly of all... I have Lily.
Jilliana: As long as you keep going, keep trying, eventually the day will come when the archon hears you and rewards you for your willing heart.
Jilliana: At this point, some people reveal their heart's desire and get what they have always dreamed of having — a Vision.
Jilliana: ...But to me, my Lily is as precious of a gem as any Vision you could offer me; probably even more precious.
