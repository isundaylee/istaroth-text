Traveler: Hi there! You don't seem to be from around here either.
Atsuko: That's right, I'm from Inazuma. It's been a long road getting here.
Atsuko: Facing the crashing waves before me, whilst trying to escape the forces behind me... My raft sank, my money got swept away by the sea...
Atsuko: Was a good thing the locals helped me, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here today. I've decided I want to get a job on a boat and travel all around the world.
