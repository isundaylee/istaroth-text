Traveler: About Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Gulabgir: Isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best proof of hope?
Gulabgir: She sacrificed herself to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
Gulabgir: She may have passed away, but other lives continue to thrive on the land and in the sea.
Gulabgir: Ah... The songs that had been sung among Vanara are popping into my mind again.
Gulabgir: I should replay them next time. I'm sure to make more money with that. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Greater Lord?
