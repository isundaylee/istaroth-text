# Aragaru's Drawing


## Talk 1

Aragaru: Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here again!
Paimon: Whoa! Say hello before jumping out next time! You scared Paimon again!
Traveler: We're not bad guys.
Aragaru: Hmph... You're right... So, Golden Nara and White Floaty who don't look like bad guys, could you do me a favor?
Traveler: #Sure thing. I'm Traveler.
Paimon: And Paimon is Paimon, don't forget that again!
Aragaru: Again...? Uh... Ahem, I'm Aragaru!
Paimon: #We have been here with you, but you forgot it all... Ugh, too much explanation! Traveler, why don't we do that together?
Black Screen Text: You describe your adventure with Aragaru in detail.
Aragaru: Is that so...? I can't remember, but I somehow want to believe you... And you have the flower I gave, I can feel her.
Aragaru: Ah, right! The bad Nara set up a campsite. Let's see what they left there. Maybe we could know their plans!
Traveler: We chased the bad guys away for you.

## Talk 2

Aragaru: How is it? Did you find anything?
Paimon: Hmm... Nothing but vague orders, and this! A dried flower!
Aragaru: Eh...! This flower, can I have it?
Paimon: That's from the bad guys, aren't you afraid of getting poisoned... or something like that?
Aragaru: No need to worry, I have seen the flower before... The person, I should know... Please give it to me, okay?
Traveler: Of course, here.
Aragaru: #Thank you! Nara Traveler and White Floaty!
Black Screen Text: Aragaru brought the little dried flower to Mawtiyima Forest...

## Talk 3

Aragaru: Let's go to the bad Nara's campsite and find out what they're up to!
Traveler: How can you tell if someone's bad?
Aragaru: #Well, I can't really explain it, but Nara Traveler and White Floaty are not baddies for sure! I believe that!
