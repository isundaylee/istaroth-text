## Talk

Iron Shoulder: Well, you look free. Done for the day?

## Talk

Traveler: Done with work?
Iron Shoulder: Oh? You don't have a job? That won't do...
Iron Shoulder: You should find a job soon, or you might get too used to idling about.
Iron Shoulder: Once you've done work for over a decade like me, you'll slowly begin to understand your place in this world.
Iron Shoulder: You'll understand that you're just a normal person, but a single screw in Rex Lapis' great work. Then you can be considered to have matured.
Iron Shoulder: If not, you'll become like those who roam the streets every day, never having grown out of being children despite their white hair.

## Talk

Traveler: Well, you look quite idle yourself.
Iron Shoulder: It's called "catching your breath."
Iron Shoulder: I can do the work of three people in a single day. That's why everyone calls me "Iron Shoulder."
Iron Shoulder: I ply my trade faithfully at the Blackcliff Forge, and though we always hear some weird rumors drifting over from Liyue Harbor...
Iron Shoulder: Well, I don't pay them any mind. Liyue has prospered for a thousand years, and even if the sky were to fall, Rex Lapis would hold it up. What's the worst that could happen?

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Iron Shoulder: Rex Lapis, dead?
Iron Shoulder: Our Lord Rex Lapis?
Iron Shoulder: ...
Iron Shoulder: You may as well say that Blackcliff Forge has gone under. I'd even be inclined to believe you!
Iron Shoulder: Rex Lapis, dead... Impossible...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Iron Shoulder: Indeed, let's cut the idle talk and get back to work.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Iron Shoulder: If we hadn't gone through with the Rite of Parting, I would have found it hard to believe that Rex Lapis is gone.
Iron Shoulder: I used to think that he alone would remain, even long after Liyue Harbor or any of the seven nations had passed away.
Iron Shoulder: *sigh* I have no idea what his passing means for Liyue, or for the Blackcliff Forge... I just hope I won't lose my job!

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Iron Shoulder: Nothing I've noticed. Not in the last couple of days, anyway...
Iron Shoulder: But surely you must have more important things to do than sightseeing?
