Kaeya: You're already here by my side, what more could I ask for?
Kaeya: #Though, I would like to know one thing. Is there any way in which I can be of assistance to you, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: You really have a way with words, Kaeya...
Kaeya: Haha, how flattering!
Kaeya: As always, I speak only from the heart.
Kaeya: Nothing would make me feel prouder than knowing that my words of advice are of some help to you.
Kaeya: That would imply that you trust me and proves that I am capable of helping you solve your problems.
Kaeya: In fact... would you like me to compile a guide for you...?
Kaeya: It would contain all kinds of practical knowledge for at home and on the road, including the techniques I have developed for communicating with people from all walks of life. I'd like to share it all with you.

Kaeya: Hahaha... My pleasure!
Kaeya: I'd better get to work then...
Traveler: You never fail to impress me, Kaeya.
Traveler: Can I rely on your words of wisdom in the future?
