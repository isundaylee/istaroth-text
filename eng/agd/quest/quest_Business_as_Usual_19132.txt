## Talk 2

Lanyang: Hello, how may I help?
Traveler: I'm here to fetch a change of clothes for Ningguang.
Lanyang: Ah yes, of course. Please wait a moment, I'll go and get them.
Black Screen Text: After a long wait, Lanyang finally returns.
Lanyang: Here you are. Please give this to Lady Ningguang.
Traveler: That seemed to take you a while.
Lanyang: Yes, this whole room is full of Lady Ningguang's personal items. Not just clothes, either â€” there are all kinds of jewelry and ornaments...
Lanyang: Lady Ningguang asked us to rearrange this room recently. We're currently right in the middle of that, so everything's in a bit of a mess. That's why it took me a little time to find this for you.
Traveler: (Sounds like Ningguang has a huge personal collection...)
Lanyang: Anyway, you can take it now. Thanks for coming to pick it up.
Traveler: (I suppose this is a problem unique to rich people.)

## Talk 3
