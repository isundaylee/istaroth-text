# The Floral Courtyard: Part I


## Talk 1

Fushizome: Good day, you two.
Fushizome: Ah, a fragrance wafts from the two of you. You must both be connoisseurs of the finer things in life...
Paimon: #Huh. Do we smell that nice, {NICKNAME}? Let Paimon try...
Paimon: Oooh, you do smell of Matsutake Meat Rolls! Guess this lady's right on the Mora, huh?
Traveler: I don't think she's talking about that kind of fragrance, Paimon...
Paimon: That's true. And with this familiar opening... Ooh, Paimon gets it! Is this lady gonna need our help as well?
Fushizome: Indeed, I believe that you will serve as dutiful guides and bring more customers in, but I'd prefer that you be able to enjoy this festival as a customer.
Fushizome: Would you two like to give it a try if you have time? Creating a "floral courtyard" of your very own, that is.
Paimon: What's a "floral courtyard"?
Traveler: Sure, I'd like to find out.
Fushizome: As you can see, I am a florist. The arrangement of these flower stands behind me is the "floral courtyard" — arranged according to the principles of "ikebana."
Fushizome: To place carefully trimmed flowers into their respective vessels and add on various accessories to create a courtyard-like scene on the table. This is the "floral courtyard" — the crystallization of the floral arts.
Fushizome: With the aid of the Yashiro Commission, I am taking part in the Irodori Festival with a variety of "floral courtyards," in the hopes that we might introduce the beauty of the floral arts to our guests.
Fushizome: If you're interested, please feel free to give it a go.
Paimon: Huh... These floral artworks really are super pretty, and they look really elegant too. But it looks tough. Can we really do it?
Traveler: Worried about your handicraft skills, Paimon?
Fushizome: Please do not worry.
Fushizome: To help our guests truly appreciate the charm of this art, I have prepared a great number of items that can simplify the construction process.
Fushizome: You just need to select the main flower, the floral scene, and the base, before combining these elements to create your very own "floral courtyard."
Fushizome: Of course, the important thing is to experience "expressing yourself through the floral arts." As such, I will give you four "floral themes" to test your thinking a little.
Fushizome: If you complete the theme on each day, you will be able to take the corresponding "floral courtyards" and flowers back with you as mementos, along with some extra prizes.
Paimon: Really? That's awesome!
Paimon: #Hehe, come on, {NICKNAME}, since this lady's put in so much effort, let's lend her a hand, shall we?
Traveler: We'll do it for the beauty of the floral arts...
Paimon: Alright then, let's start now! Let's make our own... Uh, what was it again? Right! Our very own "floral courtyards"!
Fushizome: Hahaha. You have my thanks for your enthusiasm...
Fushizome: Well, then let's begin, shall we? The theme for today is "The purple sakura lies sparse, the clear sand is fragrant."
Fushizome: Ponder the meaning of this theme, and focus on the flowers and the various other utensils to create your very own "floral courtyard."
Traveler: We'll do it for the extra prizes...
Traveler: Too used to doing things in large strides, Paimon?
Traveler: Paimon, I think you're missing the point...

## Talk 2

Fushizome: In the following days, I will continue to stay here and guide those who come for the Irodori Festival, and help them to enjoy the beauty of the "floral courtyards."
Fushizome: Don't forget to drop by every day to get another "theme." There will be a total of four such themes for you to figure out.
Fushizome: Of course, if you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer them for you.
Traveler: About the flowers here...
Fushizome: The flowers I use are all provided by Sakuya's Flowers. The flowers they grow are of impeccable quality and affordable prices.
Fushizome: Perhaps you've met Sakuya as well. We once studied ikebana under the same master.
Fushizome: Sakuya is also very well-studied in the floral arts, but when she heard that there would be tons of people at the Irodori Festival, she seemed to have gotten a bit of stage fright. She said that it would be difficult to quiet down and focus on her work in such an environment.
Fushizome: In any case, I will advertise Sakuya's Flowers on her behalf.
Paimon: We can help too if you need us!
Fushizome: Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
Traveler: Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
Fushizome: Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
Traveler: About the Yashiro Commission's involvement...
Fushizome: The Yashiro Commission has always been very supportive of Inazuma's floral arts. Indeed, the person who sponsored this event is the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Fushizome: She has always been incredibly talented in these arts, even from a young age. I saw her perform ikebana once, and even had the honor of exchanging pointers with her.
Fushizome: Although I'm older than her, I'm nowhere near her ability in terms of skill in ikebana or understanding of the floral arts.
Fushizome: Where circumstances have permitted, she has provided funding to help publicize ikebana every year. I've even heard that she has used her own savings to do so...
Fushizome: She once expressed her frank desire for more people to understand ikebana and to drum up more interest in it such that more might want to practice this art.
Paimon: Huh. So Ayaka did so much for Inazuma's floral arts...
Traveler: I hope her wish comes true.
Fushizome: Thank you both. You are indeed good-hearted people.
Traveler: I have no further questions at the moment.
Fushizome: Alright, then. You can come and look for me any time.
