Mikhail: Did you hear what happened with The Captain?
Lyudmila: Ah... I heard a few whispers. Apparently, the Tsaritsa has decided to keep his position as-is...
Mikhail: The Captain must have had his reasons for doing what he did, and the Abyss is not a foe to be taken lightly...
Lyudmila: What's this? A rare lapse in your bullish optimism?
Mikhail: ...Well, he did manage to earn everyone a valuable reprieve, including us, wouldn't you say?
Mikhail: And I've heard tell from our returning comrades that there's something wrong with the sky above Natlan.
Lyudmila: Ah! Has an even greater calamity befallen us?
Mikhail: Perhaps a calamity, or perhaps an opportunity... Why else would the powers that be suddenly dispatch more hands to a place like Nod-Krai?
