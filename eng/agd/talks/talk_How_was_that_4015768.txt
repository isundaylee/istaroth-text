# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How was that?
Jifang: What a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. I was immediately reminded of my studies in Fontaine.
Jifang: I would often go to cafes in Vasari Passage to read, and when I heard this song one day, I asked the barista what it was called.
Jifang: They didn't know, but a large fellow having some cake nearby told me that it was named "Le Souvenir avec le crepuscule." And yeah, later on, he became my husband.
Jifang: He was at the cafe meeting with his friends from a literary club back then. Ah, how nostalgic. We were all so young!
Jifang: Oh, right! Your music festival... I fear I shan't be able to attend, but if needed, I can get my husband to go.
Jifang: He's been fiddling with some old books that haven't been selling well all day, and I haven't been able to dissuade him from doing so.
Jifang: But I'm sure such cultural exchanges would interest him. I'll ask him to bring some souvenirs along that he can give out to boot.
