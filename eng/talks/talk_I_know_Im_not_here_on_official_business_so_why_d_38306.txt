# Talk Dialog

Jean: I know I'm not here on official business, so why did I sound so stern just now? It seems I struggle to break out of work mode.
Traveler: Tell me about the Knights.
Jean: The Knights of Favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. I'm a bit ashamed of myself for it...
Jean: If only I was a stronger leader...
Jean: Or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our Grand Master does...
Jean: No, I cannot feel sorry for myself. We need to solve our problems first. Right?
Traveler: Tell me about the Holy Lyre.
Jean: Barbatos' sacred relic, Mondstadt's treasure... The Holy Lyre.
Jean: No wonder it has the power to purify evil...
Jean: I hope it will help us save Dvalin, like Venti says.
Jean: If it can, then it truly is a blessing bestowed upon us by Lord Barbatos.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: May the wind guide us in saving Dvalin.
