Fedhri: Human? It's been a long time since there has been a human here.
Fedhri: But it appears as if you are not someone bound to the Pari. I cannot rely on you.

## Talk

Fedhri: Outlander offerer, have you come bearing Plumes of Purifying Light for the Amrita Pool?

## Talk

Traveler: About the Plume of Purifying Light...
Fedhri: Plumes of Purifying Light are fragments of memory. Memories belonging to the divine bird, Pari, and humans. All those memories unable to return to the tree and the land will eventually become Plumes of Purifying Light.
Fedhri: Although, should you offer them to the Amrita Pool, all memories will be accepted.
Fedhri: You'll have to find those memories scattered across the land that have yet to become Plumes of Purifying Light.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Amrita Pool...
Fedhri: The primordial waters of the Amrita are also what imbued us Pari with life.
Fedhri: Regardless of regret or woe, the Amrita can wash it away.

## Talk

Traveler: About the offering...
Fedhri: As long as you have an offering for the Amrita Pool, the waters and the tree will bestow upon you blessings.
Fedhri: This is also the mercy of the divine.
