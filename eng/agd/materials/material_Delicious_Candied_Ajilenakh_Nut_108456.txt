# Delicious Candied Ajilenakh Nut

A rich dessert. The syrup itself melts upon contact with your mouth, revealing the nut like a gem swathed in velvet, layer leading on to layer of joy. One small bite, and it is as if you are soaked in a tub of silken sweetness. Why, you really, really must make a few pieces more next time!
