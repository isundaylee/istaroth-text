# Present From the Past

Xiangling: ♪ Got myself a Cryo Regisvine, cook it up for dinner time... ♪
Paimon: ♪ Even better if it's paired with a bit of swine... ♪
Traveler: Stop encouraging her!
Xiangling: Lighten up a little! What in the world could bring more joy than finding rare ingredients?
Xiangling: Wait, there's something else here too!
Paimon: This must be the boar that hunter was chasing.
Paimon: But Paimon's never seen one with this pattern before.
Xiangling: Where have I seen this before? Hmm... Aha! It was in the "Historia Naturalis Liyue"!
Xiangling: This pattern is unmistakable. It belongs to a breed of boar that went extinct 300 years ago!
Paimon: Wow! How is this one still alive after so long!?
Traveler: Accidental cryopreservation?
Paimon: Could be...
Xiangling: I read that this boar was hunted to extinction because its meat was so highly prized.
Xiangling: Cryo Regisvine and extinct boar. Not one, but two priceless treasures!
Traveler: This'll be our winning ticket.
Xiangling: Right. Now let's get back to Springvale!
Traveler: Won the genetic lottery?
Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure that's not really possible...
Traveler: ♪ Wash 'em down with a glass of wine... ♪
Xiangling: Hee-hee... Your version just ruins it.
