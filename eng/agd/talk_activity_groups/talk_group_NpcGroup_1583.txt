Harry: Hello there!
Harry: I'm Harry of the Knights of Favonius. This area has been deemed highly dangerous, and I have been ordered to keep the public away.
Harry: Vicious monsters have been reported around the Stormbearer Mountains.
Harry: We have yet to ascertain their precise location, but the Knights of Favonius are on their trail.
Traveler: I don't see any other knights here except you...
Harry: We need to confirm the monsters' positions before taking large-scale action. Otherwise, they'll see us coming and run off.
Harry: Hence, the search team is operating in smaller units. They are operating very discreetly and staying away from the public eye.
Harry: Please, for your safety, stay away from the Stormbearer Mountains.

Traveler: What kind of help do you provide?
Harry: For regular citizens, I help escort them safely to the city, to Springvale, or wherever.
Harry: For people who know how to look after themselves, adventurers and the like, I offer training in self-defense.
Harry: Seem like you fall into the latter category. So please take this sword, and take care of yourself.

Traveler: What are you doing?
Harry: I am gathering information on where monsters are stationed along this road. It'll help me better protect the merchants' route.
Harry: If the situation gets worse, intel like this will help me convince the Acting Grand Master that the Stormbearer Mountains area is in dire need of a cleanup operation!
Harry: Just like the Grand Master's one, back in the day!
