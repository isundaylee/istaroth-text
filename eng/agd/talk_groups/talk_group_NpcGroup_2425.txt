Traveler: I am searching for someone...
Miss Bu: Then it is as I thought! Though for Miss Bu the Fortune Teller, this was easy to discern.

Miss Bu: For example... I know that you hold many secrets in your mind... that you sometimes feel lonely... and that there is someone who holds a very special place in your heart...
Traveler: You could say that about anybody!

Traveler: What legend?
Miss Bu: Why, the legend of the conch lodge. It's very popular among the young people of Liyue.
Miss Bu: ...You can hear the sound of the sea in a conch shell. The same is true of the conch lodge...
Miss Bu: Only, the sounds heard here come not from the ocean blue... but from the Sea of Souls.
