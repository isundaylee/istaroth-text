Traveler: You are...
Bhabha: I'm just an old-timer with too much free time on his hands nowadays.
Bhabha: I once crossed the rainforest and the desert when I was young. I adventured all over Teyvat, saw plenty of things, and made many friends...
Bhabha: I didn't have much Mora then, but what I did have were vigor and courage.
Bhabha: Then... Then I happened to dig up something precious on one of my adventures. Some people said it was one of the treasures of the spirits, and some said that it must be a relic of the Dendro Archon...
Bhabha: I was just a kid then who didn't know any better, so I sold it to the highest bidder.
Bhabha: Thanks to that income, I'm able to clothe and feed myself even in my old age, hehe.
