# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything interesting happening around here?
Hongyu: No, I wouldn't say that anything interesting has happened. But I did encounter something weird recently...
Hongyu: There was something not quite right about my house. If it wasn't a bowl or chopsticks moving all of a sudden, then it was a chair suddenly falling over.
Hongyu: After talking things through with a friend, he introduced me to an exorcist named Chongyun. They say that he's a specialist in these bump-in-the-night matters.
Hongyu: But the instant that exorcist walked into the room, all the strange happenings stopped right away! He didn't even have to work any thaumaturgy!
Hongyu: It truly is weird. I still have no idea how that might have happened...
