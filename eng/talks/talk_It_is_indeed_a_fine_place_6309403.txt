Traveler: It is indeed a fine place.
Imatani Saburou: Indeed. When she and I traveled here for the first time, we knew that we would settle down here.
Imatani Saburou: We plant fruits, grow flowers, and weave. It's a peaceful life, yet it is not boring at all. Once we had some children, it got even more bustling.
Imatani Saburou: It sounds a bit too carefree, right? But it's not a bad thing to be carefree. You don't have to live a busy life traveling around to have a fulfilling life.
