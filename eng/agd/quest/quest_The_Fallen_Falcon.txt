# The Fallen Falcon


## Talk 1

Paimon: Tadhla? Tadhla! Uh, sheâ€”
Liloupar: This is the choice of her own will: To no longer live as a Falcon, but as a friend.

## Talk 2

Masseira: The ruins in the north, around where you first met each other.
Masseira: This is her choice. I hope you will respect that.

## Talk 3

Tadhla: Here you are. I am happy that you came.
Traveler: I heard you wanted to talk to me.
Tadhla: I've always liked the desert at this time of the day. It's beautiful. It's my favorite sight.
Tadhla: Only it is a shame that I never had the chance to watch the sunset with my friends.
Paimon: Yeah... The desert is all dyed with the color of the sunset. So peaceful and quiet...
Paimon: But, Tadhla, did you ask us to come here just for that?
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: To the Tanit, you are guests. To Falcons, you are potential prey. But I hope you are the ones who will survive.
Traveler: ...
Tadhla: So, I am sorry.
Traveler: How's it going?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Darn it, Masseira is gone!
Liloupar: He left a note. Hmph, that sly old fox.
Investigate (Neat Note): By the time you see this note, I should already have ensconced myself in a safehouse within the valley.
If your head is still on your shoulders, do not weep for Tadhla's choice.

This hunt is not yet over. This is just the beginning of the storm.
Thus does Masseira the Hunter, elder of Tanit, warn you.
Paimon: Huh? What does he mean by all this? Paimon doesn't get it.
Liloupar: Seems like he fled the tribe under certain pressure and left this note for you. Hmph, the Tanit sure are not as peaceful as they seem.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Tadhla: (Tadhla avoids eye contact and lowers her head nervously.)
Traveler: Are you alright?
Tadhla: Sorry, the hunt is over. I am Father's "Falcon."
Tadhla: But I'm feeling great. Don't worry about me.
Traveler: That's pretty extreme...
Tadhla: Extreme, huh? I'm not sure about that. I've always lived like this ever since I was a child.
Tadhla: Well... But, the stories of you and Paimon, and the adventures that you two experienced...
Tadhla: Should there be a chance, I would really want to hear more of them.
Paimon: No problem! We have tons of stories to tell!
Traveler: Yes, I'll tell you all of them.
Tadhla: Pfft...
Tadhla: #Ahem, sorry. I'm just very happy. Thank you, the Master of the Jinni. Um, I mean, thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: We can talk about them any time you want.
Traveler: Haven't you ever thought about living for yourself?
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: No. Never. I never had such thoughts, or expectations.
Tadhla: The desert is a place of indifference and brutality, where I have no time to think for my own good. Without me, my tribe lives on just the same. However, without my tribe, there is no way I will survive.
Traveler: About your relationship with Masseira...
Tadhla: As I said, he is my father, and I am his Falcon. I follow his orders. I hunt for him, risk my life for him, as he is the will of the Tanit.
Tadhla: When the day comes that I cannot fully execute Father's orders, then my life as a Falcon will end.

### Additional Talk 2

Masseira: Ah, if it isn't the esteemed Master of the Jinni. What can I do for you?
Traveler: About Tadhla...
Masseira: She likes you, I can see that.
Masseira: Don't worry, I'll leave her be. To be young... Right?
Masseira: I'll encourage her to express her feelings. As her elder and father, this is a duty to which I am bound. There's no need for you to worry about her. Truly.
Traveler: About the "coming-of-age ceremony"...
Masseira: Thank you for helping her complete her coming-of-age ceremony. I was right to trust you.
Masseira: Next, she will accept her first hunting mission as a qualified Falcon.
Masseira: By then, hehe, please witness her growth in person.
