Master Zhang: Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: Recently, they've come across a lot of Crystal Ore. It's just a shame that I've been busy. If you've got the time, go mine some, come back here and have them refined.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
