Traveler: What's the story of the Icewind Suite?
Maillardet: A fine question!
Maillardet: Like how Coppelius was defeated in a war against temptation, and was thus punished. Or how Coppelia so loved him that she nearly died from grief as a result.
Maillardet: Or how, to save the imprisoned Coppelius, Coppelia would set out on a journey.
Maillardet: Or how, no matter how things go, the drama shall end in a lovers' dance.
Maillardet: Haha! Well, actually, that was just me making some story bits up. I mean, I'm no literary scholar, just a researcher who works with clockwork meka.
Maillardet: As far as I'm concerned, their function is more important than their story.
Maillardet: However, if you're that interested in the story... Well, I'll consider.

Traveler: Why do they need combat skills?
Maillardet: Um... Well, actually, Mr. Bossuet was against that at first, too.
Maillardet: I guess you could consider this... my personal interest?
Maillardet: See? Now that Coppelius and Coppelia have combat abilities, their dance now exudes elegance as well as power!
Maillardet: Regardless of what anyone else thinks, I believe that this was a successful attempt.
Maillardet: Of course, there was a happy accident involved... With Mr. Bossuet's departure from the Institute, there's no one left to reject my research plans!
