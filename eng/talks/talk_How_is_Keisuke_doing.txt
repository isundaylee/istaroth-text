Traveler: How is Keisuke doing?
Imatani Saburou: He came home once. He told us that he had finally resolved his differences with Sakujirou. As for how it got resolved and where Sakujirou went, he didn't tell me.
Imatani Saburou: But as long as the matter is settled, I'm fine with it. My wife and I are happy for him.
Imatani Saburou: Many lost things can be retrieved, but you can only have so many childhood friends. There's no getting them back once you've lost them.
