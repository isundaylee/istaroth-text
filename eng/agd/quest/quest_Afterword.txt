# Afterword


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's been a while since our last adventure! Paimon wonders how Mini Durin is getting along in Simulanka.
Paimon: Let's go to the Forest of Blessings and take a look!

## Talk 2

Kaeya: So the "Magic Tonic" here is just writing ink... What a weird and wonderful world.
Kaeya: Ah, Miss Citrus — do you happen to serve any beverages here that don't contain Magic Tonic?
Citrus: Of course we do. What flavor would you like?
Kaeya: Hmm, Sunsettia? Jean, you want in?
Jean: ...Sure, I'll have the same please.
Citrus: Sounds good! Two sunsettia drinks, coming right up!

## Talk 3

Collei: The structure of the tree houses here is nothing short of amazing! I have to write it down, so I can tell Master Tighnari all about it later...
Paimon: Hey, Collei!
Collei: #Agh!! You scared me... Traveler and Paimon? You got invited here, too?
Paimon: Yep! ...Well, they sorta skipped the invitation part, but... Anyway, whatcha doing out here? Something caught your eye?
Collei: Oh, yeah, I'm trying to observe and summarize the structures of the trees here, and also the animals that live here — well, the residents, I guess? I still can't get over the fact that they're all someone's origami handiwork!
Paimon: Once a forest ranger, always a forest ranger, huh? Not sure you'll be able to apply much of what you learn here back home, though, with this being a magical world and everything...
Paimon: ...Huh? Over there, by the giant footprint, have those houses always been there?
Collei: Oh, those? The local flying squirrels told me that they were built by a small dragon and some guy wearing a hat.
Paimon: Oh! That must have been Mini Durin and Hat Guy! Any idea where they went?
Collei: Supposedly, after building the houses, they went to somewhere called, uh... Constellation Metropole? Did I say that right?
Paimon: Yep, you got it! Oh, also... When the locals mentioned the dragon, did they seem at all, uh... Did they say how they felt about him at all?
Collei: Hmm... Now that you mention it, the atmosphere changed a little when they talked about him...
Paimon: Oh no...
Collei: They mentioned some stuff along the lines of "past misunderstandings" and "welcoming new members"...
Collei: I only just got here, so I know very little about what has happened in the past. They seemed genuinely grateful for the houses, though, and said they were going to plan a welcome party.
Paimon: Oh, thank goodness, phew... Sounds like the Forest has begun to accept him. It's a step in the right direction!
Collei: Are you looking for that small dragon?
Paimon: Yeah, he's a new friend we made after we arrived here.
Collei: No way! Really? I'm getting more and more interested in your story!
Collei: Ugh... No, no, no, I've got to save it for next time. For now, I've got to make the most out of my time in this wonderful world!
Paimon: Hehe, there's no rush! Just take it slow and enjoy yourself — like Kaeya. Oh, he sends his regards by the way.
Collei: Oh, Mr. Kaeya is here too? Then... I've got to go say hi to him!
Paimon: Well, right now he's at the tavern, and he probably won't be leaving until he's drunk... Hmm, not that he'll ever reach that point since his alcohol tolerance is so high... Basically, it's Kaeya — you know where to find him!
Collei: Haha, you make a good point, Paimon. Then I'll focus on exploring for now, and go catch up with him later!
Paimon: #Shall we go pay a visit to the Metropole, Traveler? Maybe Mini Durin and Hat Guy are still there.
Collei: Oh right, by the way, something pretty interesting has been happening in Sumeru recently. Master Tighnari has been working really hard on it, so if you have time, definitely go check it out!
Paimon: Sounds good! We'll find some time in our schedule.
Traveler: Take it easy, Collei!
Collei: Of course! See you later!
Traveler: Enjoy your... field trip!

## Talk 4

Collei: The origami squirrels rely on wind currents to lift their agile bodies and easily move between the trees... This has created a truly unique ecosystem.
Collei: Oh no... I'm running out of pages on my notebook...

## Talk 5

Mona: What!? Are my eyes deceiving me?
Mona: There is no way... I can't believe it...
Paimon: Hey, Mona! We heard you muttering from a long way away! What's up?
Paimon: Is your scryglass acting up again?
Mona: Oh, it's you, the saviors of this world. My scryglass is fine. But I'm not sure I can say the same about my eyes...
Mona: Look. Look at this statue.
Paimon: ...What, is it broken or something? Looks fine to Paimon... That's your master, right? AKA, the "Goddess of Prophecy"?
Mona: I refuse to believe it! There's no way that old hag looks like anything like this.
Traveler: Maybe she did when she was younger.
Mona: When she was younger? Oh, actually... Now that you mention it, this does remind me of the fashionista phase she wrote about in her diary...
Mona: ...She can't hear me, can she? I swear, I just got chills down my spine...
Paimon: Either way, it's probably a little rude to talk about her right under her statue.
Paimon: But how did you know it's a statue of her if you never saw her as a young woman?
Mona: I did a quick scry when I came into this world, and when I saw the stars' reflections, I was at a loss for words... It looks like fate in Simulanka is directly based on Teyvat.
Mona: A projection of real-world fate, to form an image of reality...
Mona: Or in layman's terms... basically, the creator made this world inside a mirror, or a lake, and this world is the reflection.
Paimon: Still sounds pretty impressive.
Mona: The more I scried, the more familiar everything looked... It's her work, there's no doubt about it. Even so, everything's far more complex than I'd imagined. Trying to decipher it all is giving me quite a headache.
Mona: I also asked the locals about her. They call her: "She who has dominion over the stars and the course of fate itself"... Not even a pretense of humility. Clearly, she let the role of creator-goddess get to her head...
Mona: Not that I'm surprised in the least, of course. It certainly matches the tone of her diary... Ahem, anyway! We should change the topic.
Paimon: Oh! So Mona, have you seen a small dragon around by any chance? He's about the same size as Paimon, but with tiny little wings.
Mona: Ah, you mean the one that caused all that trouble? I haven't seen him for myself, but I heard that he came to the Metropole not long ago to formally apologize for his actions. Apparently, he brought a huge stash of toytanium and plant oil to make amends.
Mona: Most people accepted his apology, although there are some who said that they'll reserve judgment until they've seen how he acts in the future.
Paimon: Ooh, okay... Do you know where we can find him?
Mona: One moment...
Mona: Ah, it looks like he's at the Broken Sea. There's a big group of people with him, too.
Paimon: Cool! Wanna come with us? We can introduce you.
Mona: Hmm, I think I'll sit this one out. This might be the closest I ever get to meeting the Old Hag in her youth, so I think I'll spend some time seeing what else I can glean from her grand design. You guys have fun.
Traveler: ...Be careful, Mona.
Mona: What do you mean, "be careful"? Now you're making me nervous!
Paimon: We'll be off now. See you later, Mona!
Traveler: Thanks for your astrological assistance.
Mona: Anytime.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Mona: (Creating a whole world's starscape is no easy task...)
Mona: (Old Hag... I guess you do deserve the title of Trismegistus after all.)

### Additional Talk 2

Fischl: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins... Dost thou see what I am seeing? Tell me that my all-perceiving Auge der Verurteilung deceiveth me not!
Oz: Your eyes see true, Mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Very well. Then, as sovereign ruler of the Immernachtreich, I extend to you both my greetings, O Night Dragon from the Land of the Thousand Stars, and his hat-wearing servant.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Who did you just call a servant?
Oz: What Mein Fräulein means to say is, "Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you."
Mini Durin: Pleasure to meet you too! But Hat Guy's not my servant, he's my friend.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Now you're over-explaining.
Paimon: Hat Guy, Mini Durin! Found you at last! Whoa, and Fischl's with you, too?
Fischl: Ohoho! Greetings, Outlander blessed by the Immernachtreich! How honored you are to meet your Prinzessin beneath the stars of another sky... Clearly, a decision made by fate itself!
Traveler: I echo your sentiments, Your Highness.
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight! Paimon!
Albedo: Greetings. You both look well.
Paimon: Hey there Klee! Have you been having fun here?
Klee: Yep, loads and loads of fun! There are soooo many cute animals! And a magic train that was reeeeally long! And a huge, huge castle, and a king lives there and everything!
Albedo: I've been taking Klee to see all the sights. It's been a very enriching experience. Alice's magic is truly outstanding.
Klee: Yeah, Mom's amazing! Klee wants to build a great big house now, too!
Mini Durin: So... Your mom and my mom... were friends?
Klee: Mhm! Our moms were friends, which makes you my big brother! My mom used to read your mom's stories to me all the time, they were great!
Mini Durin: ...Big brother?
Traveler: You're part of the family now!
Mini Durin: Wow... Thank you, Klee! Can I go play with Klee, Hat Guy?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Suit yourself.
Klee: Albedo, Albedo, can I—
Albedo: Go on — just don't go too far away. I'll come pick you up later.
Klee: Yey! C'mon Mini Durin! Do you wanna come play with us too, Fischl?
Fischl: Hehehe! Your Prinzessin accepts your invitation. Rejoice! Though you may be concealed by fog, still you shall have the good fortune to witness the true might of the Auge der Verurteilung!
Oz: What Mein Fräulein means to say is, perhaps we can all play hide-and-seek together. Mein Fräulein is "it."
Klee: Hooray! I love hide-and-seek!
Mini Durin: Me too!
Albedo: To return to our previous discussion, Mr. Hat Guy, you were telling me about a prophecy?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I heard B talking to M. What she said was...
"B": Since you're so persistent, let me tell you a secret...
"B": R's child... will one day rise from the dead.
Paimon: Huh? Is she saying that... Dragonspine-Durin will come back to life!?
Traveler: I'm shocked...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I only heard it in a memory. So don't hold me to it.
Albedo: Understood. My recent observations at Dragonspine lend credence to this prophecy as well.
Albedo: Durin's heart has slowly but surely been growing in vitality. The process is extremely slow, but the trend is clear...
Paimon: Aah... What should we do?
Albedo: To start with, plan for every potential scenario. Including, of course, the worst-case scenario...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Albedo: I am well aware of Durin's past, and I sincerely hope that things never escalate to that point. Still, we need to be prepared for every possibility.
Albedo: If the prophecy is true, and Durin's heart will one day beat again... I'd like to hope that whatever rises from the dead is no "evil dragon."
Albedo: If you understand what I mean.
Paimon: Kind of...? But not really.
Albedo: And so... When the time comes, Mr. Hat Guy, will you and Simulanka's Durin be willing to lend us a hand in our hour of need?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Huh? What's this got to do with me?
Albedo: You saved the Durin of this world. I don't see that as a mere coincidence.
Albedo: If there is any meaning to be read into the actions of the three Goddesses beyond fairytale whimsy alone, I can only boldly speculate that...
Albedo: ...The fate of this reflected world may have a reciprocal effect upon our own world.
Albedo: If Durin of Dragonspine will soon come back to life, we will need Mini Durin's help... as well as yours, given that your fates are now intertwined.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Well, that's a nuisance.
Albedo: To be sure. It certainly won't be easy.
Klee: Albedo, Albedo! There's a flying paper ship over there! Can we go see it together, pleeease?
Albedo: Sure. Two seconds, I'll be right with you.
Albedo: Please give my suggestion some thought, Mr. Hat Guy.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Mini Durin: Hat Guy, I'm back! ...Hmm? What were you guys talking about?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Nothing.
Paimon: ...
Mini Durin: Huh? Okay then. Let's go join the others. Everyone's going to check out the new origami ship!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Alright. I'll be right there.
Traveler: #{REALNAME[ID(1)]}...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Why would I be? Do I strike you as someone who cares about other people's issues?
Traveler: (Now that he's saved Simulanka's Durin, maybe he'll be sympathetic to the Durin of our world...?)
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Quit trying to guess what I'm thinking. I'm leaving.
Traveler: (Hmm, Albedo was right. He needs time to think about it for himself.)
Klee: Aww! What a lovely little boat!
Mini Durin: The Forest Fairy helped us make it!
Paimon: Paimon just realized, there's a lot fewer people around the Broken Sea now. Guess most of them have made their way back to the Metropole.
Klee: Does this boat have a name? I can't see one anywhere!
Mini Durin: Huh...? A name?
Klee: Mhm! Every boat has a name! At least, all the ones I've seen before.
Albedo: They're usually symbolic names that represent something aspirational.
Mini Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Let's go with "The Durin."
Mini Durin: Huh? You want to name it after me?
Paimon: Oh! You mean, to wish Mini Durin a safe voyage as he sails into a new chapter of his life beyond this world?
Fischl: Your Prinzessin approves. Let this vessel bear the name of the most esteemed dragon of the night.
Mini Durin: "The Durin"... Hehe, let's call it that, then! Thank you, Hat Guy!
Mini Durin: Also... Can I ask you a favor?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Go on.
Mini Durin: Remember how Mom's friend said I should be able to leave this world? Well... I want to pay a visit to your world. Just a quick trip! Can we?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Huh?
Mini Durin: ...I—Is that a no?
Paimon: Paimon thinks that's a great idea. If the people of Simulanka are allowed to go to Teyvat, then what's the problem with taking Mini Durin there for a visit?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...I'm assuming I'll have to be your bodyguard while we're there?
Mini Durin: I... I can protect myself! And I'll do what you say, I won't fly off on my own, I promise! Please, can I go?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...It'll be up to you to stick close. If you disappear on me, don't expect me to come looking.
Mini Durin: Got it! I'll stick close!
Albedo: Why don't you take The Durin? Now you've given it a name, it'll be a maiden voyage for the boat and a brand-new journey for you.
Klee: Are you leaving, Mini Durin? Okay... Well, make sure you come visit me in Mondstadt so we can play together again! Klee will draw you a map to show you the way.
Fischl: Though our time together has been as fleeting as a ray of light in the depths of the long night, the Immernachtreich will welcome you with the grandest of music ceremonies on the occasion of our next reunion. As surely as the stars in the sky watch over us, we shall meet again.
Oz: What Mein Fräulein means is that you're always welcome to visit her at home as well.
Mini Durin: Cool! Ah, I have so many new friends now... I'm so happy!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Are you done yet? If you want to leave, then get over here.
Traveler: Take care.
Mini Durin: Thank you, everyone! Thank you so much! The blessings you gave me are more precious than any treasure, and more beautiful than any fairytale!
Mini Durin: Next time, it will be my turn to make your wishes come true!
Traveler: Are you worried about Durin?
Traveler: It's great to see you too.
