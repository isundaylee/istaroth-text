Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Izad: If you like flora and fauna, there are plenty of things to see.
Izad: But it's impossible for me to name every one of them... Hehe, best to ask a Forest Watcher for that.

## Talk

Izad: An unusual floral fragrance permeates the air... I really would love to stay a little longer.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Izad: I'm a Forest Ranger of Avidya Forest. I'm in charge of liaison between the Forest Rangers and Pardis Dhyai.
Izad: We send regular reports on the ecological situation in Avidya Forest to Pardis Dhyai, and Pardis Dhyai provides us with all kinds of assistance.
Izad: For example, we recently received quite a bit of seeds and nutrients that Pardis Dhyai supplied for free.
Izad: The Forest Rangers are in charge of selecting suitable planting areas or distributing the seeds to the nearby villagers, so that we can all add a little more green to the rainforest.

Traveler: See you.
Izad: Slow down and appreciate the flowers and plants here.
