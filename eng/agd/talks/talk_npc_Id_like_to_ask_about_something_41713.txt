# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I'd like to ask about something.
Wagner: Well, spit it out already.
Traveler: How good is this smithy?
Wagner: Stupid question. If you really want to know, buy something.
Wagner: Talk is cheap. Pick up a blade and you'll soon know.
Wagner: If even this much eludes you, then you've got a long road ahead of you, runt.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself.
Wagner: There are no other qualified blacksmiths here, except for me and my apprentice, Schulz.
Wagner: I can tell you from experience that hard work is all there is to the craft! Many other "blacksmiths" out there are just out to make a quick mora!
Wagner: Family? Inheritance? Meaningless! I only need an apprentice to pass on my skills.
