## Talk

Traveler: Tell me, are there any events happening as of late?
Margaret: There have. Recently, the Angel's Share has been giving out complimentary Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, and we've been running a promotion in response.
Margaret: Since we're the Cat's Tail, our main appetizer has to be Mondstadt Grilled Fish!
Margaret: Anyway, take these, and remember to swing by some time if you're free!

Margaret: Finally, I have the chance to stop you. I've had my eye on you for a while now â€” an outlander wandering the plaza is quite easy to spot.

## Talk

Traveler: Well... ahh... Tell me about yourself.
Margaret: Me? I'm just a simple tavern owner.
Margaret: I'm sure you'd noticed my tavern, Cat's Tail, on your way here.

## Talk

Traveler: Just how are the taverns around here?
Margaret: I don't like to admit it but the best tavern in the city is Angel's Share.
Margaret: However, ever since I hired Diona as my bartender, business has been looking up.
Margaret: Doesn't matter whether they came for the wine or for her... Money is flooding in now.

## Talk

Margaret: So, you couldn't resist stopping by again, huh?
Margaret: Hehe, that's alright. Thanks again for your help with my little Princey.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Margaret: I'm waiting for someone to invite me for a drink at the tavern. Would that be you?
Margaret: Just kidding! Loosen up a little! Mondstadt is a city of romance~!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Margaret: Leaving already? Don't forget to come see me when you come to Cat's Tail for a night out.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Margaret: I must admit that though I'm glad we're all finally safe, I do feel just a bit unsatisfied.
Margaret: The Angel's Share was seriously affected by the dragon attacks as many of its popular drinks had their supplies cut.
Margaret: Here at the Cat's Tail, we even had an ongoing discount to take further advantage...
Margaret: ...But in the end, our sales were still a little less than theirs.
Margaret: Still, there's not much I can do about that. It is supplied directly by the Dawn Winery, after all, which gives it an overwhelming advantage in terms of where they get their wine...
