Traveler: About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: She lay down the roots and fertilized the land â€” all our harvests, whether in the fields or in life, stem from her.
Durgar: And since carpentry's how I make my living, a trade that's plenty close to the trees, I'm all the more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
