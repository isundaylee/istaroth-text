Fujiwara Toshiko: Hello, adventurer from afar. What business do you have with me?

## Talk

Traveler: You could tell that I'm an adventurer?
Fujiwara Toshiko: Don't get me wrong, I don't really know who you are. But I can tell from your gear. You look like someone who often goes out on adventures.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Although I am not in the same line of work as you, I am still a descendant of pirates after all. I have pretty keen eyes.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you looking for treasure?
Fujiwara Toshiko: Oh, so you heard about that? I do have a treasure map from my ancestors. The treasure it leads to will belong to me and no one else.
Fujiwara Toshiko: However, my ancestors were the pirates who once occupied Seirai Island. The clues on the treasure map... are probably still on that island.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Hmph, it's all the Kanjou Commission's fault. They came up with some stupid reasons to force the island's residents out. Now I have no use for this treasure map.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Come to think of it, there's been a legend of a pirate treasure circulating for generations on Seirai Island... After my ancestors left, could the Kanjou Commission have already taken the treasure for themselves?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Okay, goodbye.

## Talk

Fujiwara Toshiko: Hello there. Can I help you with something?

## Talk

Traveler: When did you get back?
Fujiwara Toshiko: I came straight back once the previous incident concluded.
Fujiwara Toshiko: We didn't find anything valuable, no... But I couldn't have stayed on that island a second longer.

## Talk

Traveler: Regarding the treasure...
Fujiwara Toshiko: Ugh, let's not even go there. I took that picture and asked around a bit, but there's nothing special about it. It's really just an ordinary picture.
Fujiwara Toshiko: But that's what I don't get. Why would people go to such lengths to conceal a simple picture?
Fujiwara Toshiko: After unlocking all those mechanisms, that was all we found. In fact, I doubt that this was the treasure I was looking for at all!
Fujiwara Toshiko: Did I read the treasure map wrong or something? Or is something wrong with the treasure map? Where is the real treasure located?
Fujiwara Toshiko: ...Did the Kanjou Commission take it for themselves, by any chance?
