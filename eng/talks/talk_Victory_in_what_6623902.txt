Traveler: Victory in what?
Utsil: In a duel, of course!
Utsil: I've got all the Saurian blessing cards — I mean, all the Saurian cards — plus a deck with Saurian feathers... *ahem* I mean, the latest custom cards...
Utsil: So I'll be invincible come the next match! Victory is 100% guaranteed to the proudest of players — and that's me, bay-bee!
Utsil: Of course, I still have to thank my teacher, Acat, for carefully drawing up a deck of Qucusaurus cards for me. I wish her business at Chuwen Fair all the prosperity it deserves.
