Takatsukasa Tomohide: Uh... Hello?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: If you don't have anything urgent, I must really continue deliberating this matter with Sir Matsukawa...

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: I am of the Takatsukasa family of the Kujou Clan. I work for the Shogunate.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: The Kanjou Commission has recently submitted some new financial reports. I'm currently reviewing and organizing them to report to my superior.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: But my superior seems to be a bit worried about this report.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Sir Matsukawa has been in office for many years, earning him immense prestige and respect. If he is worried about this report, then I must be more prudent in my review...

## Talk

Traveler: What's the problem with the report?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: In my humble opinion, there is nothing wrong with the report. The Kanjou Commission has been very careful in submitting their report, and I have already reviewed it according to our usual standards.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: But perhaps with the current unrest, Sir Matsukawa is less than optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: I can understand his concern... But as an ordinary civil official, what can I do to help...?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: *sigh* If I had more power, perhaps I could resolve these issues and actually do something for the Takatsukasa and Kujou Clans.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Alright. Then I will get back to work...

## Talk

Traveler: So, you are...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: I am of the Takatsukasa family of the Kujou Clan. I work for the Shogunate.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: The Kanjou Commission has recently submitted some new financial reports. I'm currently reviewing and organizing them to report to my superior.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Ever since the abolishing of the Vision Hunt Decree, Sir Matsukawa has been even more cautious about the materials he sends to the Kanjou Commission. I must be vigilant, too.

## Talk

Traveler: What's the problem with the reports?
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Well, you see, the abolishing of the Decree caused a huge stir. This also exposed many instances of nepotism and fraud within the Kanjou Commission.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: We've currently got our hands full clearing the old accounts.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: And with the war ending with the Shogunate being unable to decisively defeat the rebels, Sir Matsukawa is even less optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma than usual.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: The work on my hands has grown significantly, and the paper pushers below me have not been all that useful in this matter, so I have had no choice but to follow Sir Matsukawa through this work every step of the way.

## Talk

Traveler: How's the situation in the Kujou Clan...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Being as busy as we are, I have not paid the clan's internal affairs much mind... So the news that some in our family tried to stab the main Kujou Clan in the back, I was very shocked...
Takatsukasa Tomohide: It is fortunate that Lord Kujou Kamaji was able to gain the Almighty Shogun's trust. If not... *sigh* I dare not even think about the consequences.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Still, this series of events has me thinking that I should pay our internal affairs more mind... Once I have finished my work here, I will pay the main clan a visit...

## Talk

Traveler: Don't let me bother you, then.
Takatsukasa Tomohide: Alright. Then I shall return to my work...
