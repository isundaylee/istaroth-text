Traveler: Anyway, who is Kuisel?
Bricole: I don't know either. I don't recall anyone by that name at the Fontaine Research Institute... Perhaps, as far as he's concerned, it's better that nobody by that name exists?
Bricole: Just like he said himself, Kuisel was just a convenient character. The more different that character was from himself, the better, as it made it less likely anyone would recognize him... Although that's just a guess of mine.
Bricole: *sigh* If you ask me, though, I think he changed enough over the years as it is. I didn't recognize him at first.
