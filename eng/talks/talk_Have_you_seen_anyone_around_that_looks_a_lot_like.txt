Traveler: Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Six-Fingered José: Someone that looks a lot like you? Is it a relative of yours?
Six-Fingered José: Oh, then may I ask if that person is fond of wine?
Six-Fingered José: If they're out for a drink, then Mondstadt would be the place. And if it's the Mondstadt I know, they'd surely stop by the Angel's Share.
Six-Fingered José: I keep tabs on everyone I see in the Angel's Share. I'm always keeping an eye out for a potential audience, you know.
Six-Fingered José: But if the fellow you're looking for doesn't like to drink, then I'm afraid I don't have any clues for you. Lo siento.
