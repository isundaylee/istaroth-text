Fariha: Hello. I'm Mr. Nizam's secretary. I'm responsible for taking minutes for him.
Fariha: If you see Mr. Nizam sighing slightly more than usual, it's a normal occurrence.
Fariha: There's always more to do whenever there's an event being held in the city.
Fariha: We'll talk later. I still need to sort out which supplies need restocking.
