Traveler: About fun activities...
Estienne: Since the result is all the same, choosing one or more people from a group, then isn't it more fun to make a game out of it?
Estienne: Some people think games are childish and I respect their opinion. After all, everyone playing games should participate voluntarily!
Estienne: Unwilling participants will end up spoiling the game and ruining everything. That would leave everyone disappointed, and that's the opposite of why we have the games in the first place...
