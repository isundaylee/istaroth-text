# Wild Escape


## Talk 1

Charles: Master Diluc, this is this week's accounts.
Diluc: Hmm... The disaster has greatly affected business.
Charles: Well, let's hope it all ends soon.
Venti: Hi, we'd like a seat at your, uhh... least conspicuous table.
Diluc: Umm... The second floor has fewer customers. You'd be less conspicuous up there...
Diluc: But aren't you a bard? Why not sit front and center?
Venti: Hahaha, let's save the paid performance for next time. We'll be heading up now, see you in a bit!
Diluc: Hey, keep an eye on them. There's something strange about that bard. I'll go ask around.
Charles: Ask who exactly?
Diluc: The "protectors" of Mondstadt...

## Talk 2

Diluc: Not going upstairs yet? You both seemed to be in a hurry.

## Talk 3

Otto: Ah, Master Diluc. Have you seen two thieves around?
Diluc: What happened? Why have you mobilized so many guards?
Miles: Haven't you heard, Master Diluc? Two thieves were trying to steal the Holy Lyre!
Diluc: Oh? How odd.
Miles: Isn't it? The Holy Lyre is a treasure that was played by the God of Anemo themselves. Such a precious piece of cultural heritage—
Diluc: Why would one want to steal something they can't sell off? Would pay better to steal from my cellars...
Otto: Huh?
Diluc: Sorry, off topic. Believe they headed that way.
Miles: Understood. Thank you, Master Diluc!

## Talk 4

Venti: Today I think I'll have a glass of...
Diluc: You can put down that bottle you stole from behind the counter.
Venti: ...something cold.
Diluc: Right. I want answers.
Venti: Lemme finish my drink first? I'll pay you — well, with a performance.
Diluc: It's not about money. You seem too young to be drinking.
Traveler: How about answering my question first?
Traveler: Actually... yeah.
Venti: No need to worry. When I started drinking, you were still—
Venti: Oh, you wanna ask "Who's this?" Am I right?
Venti: He is Master *Diluc*, the boss of... ah, the owner of this tavern.
Venti: He's very famous. By the way, his dandelion wine is one of my favorites.
Venti: Though most of the time I can only afford a bottle or two...
Diluc: I just heard about some thieves from the guards.
Diluc: For the record, I like your guts for trying to steal the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Diluc: Even if you are fools... but we don't often get to see people like you.
Paimon: It wasn't us that stole it! The real thief is still out there!
Venti: This is the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius. Why would someone so aspiring steal Mondstadt's sacred treasure?
Diluc: Hotshot...? Oh, so it's you.
Traveler: We're not close, actually.
Traveler: I've only heard him play once.
Diluc: So, you and the bard are close friends?
Diluc: Well... Despite only being a passing traveler, you still offered your help to Mondstadt in its time of need.
Diluc: A shame you joined the Knights.
Diluc: The Knights of Favonius... Inefficient right from beginning to end.
Diluc: And towards the *Fatui*? Weak and conservative.
Diluc: Forget it. I don't feel like talking about it.
Venti: Seems you don't really like the Knights of Favonius.
Diluc: Just differences in approach is all.
Diluc: I have my own hopes for this city.
Diluc: Now, answers. Why did you steal the Holy Lyre?
Venti: You sure you want to know? It could implicate you in the affairs of the Knights of Favonius.
Diluc: That's fine. I somehow always end up implicated in their affairs.
Venti: If I tell you the story with a performance, will you believe me?
Diluc: It depends. I'll make my own judgment.
Venti: Then will I get paid?
Diluc: Your reward will range from anywhere between five Mora and the Holy Lyre. It all depends on your story.
Venti: Very well. Let me put on a show...
Diluc: What did I just witness...
Diluc: This is confidential information. Why did you let me know?
Venti: Why? Hmm... Perhaps the winds are changing.
Venti: What say you, Master Diluc?
Diluc: Interesting.
Diluc: Give me some time. I'll organize some contacts.
Diluc: Outlander, as one of the Knights, it seems you're not a suspect.
Diluc: Blonde is the only description on the wanted poster. You should be safe.
Diluc: As for the bard however, it'd be better if you stayed in the tavern.
Venti: Haha. No problem! I like taverns.
Diluc: ...
Diluc: Okay. Let's meet here tonight after the tavern closes.
Amber: Okay then. You just need to follow the *marked route* to the finish.
