Traveler: Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, the fewer people who want my help the better, for it means that we have a good academic atmosphere here.
Shohre: To be surrounded by books... That sounds rather nice to me. I'd say there's no simpler life than one whereby your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two while looking at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I'm too impatient to read. I can apply for access to the general summary in the Akasha if I really want to know about something.

Shohre: But that's just a thought. I know myself — I'm far too impatient to read.
