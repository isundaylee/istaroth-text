# Low-Temperature Warning


## Talk 1

Iris: Excuse me? Did you want something?
Iris: It's so cold here...
Iris: Cold is the norm when you're up a mountain like this one.
Iris: You look like a Traveler. So, are you planning on scaling the mountain?
Traveler: Just to have a look.
Iris: Fair enough. I'm not going to try and stop you... I've met my fair share of travelers and whatever you say, there's no dissuading them.
Iris: All I will say, if you're serious about this, is to keep an eye on your *body temperature* at all times.
Iris: If your temperature drops too low, not only will it slow you down, but you can also injure yourself. And if you're unlucky enough to get attacked by a monster in that state... Well, that's the last situation you'd want to find yourself in.
Iris: So, if your temperature drops dangerously low, get yourself to a *source of heat* and warm back up while you plan your next move.
Iris: In short, and I know you've probably heard this plenty of times, but it's true: This is, by far, the most dangerous place in all of Mondstadt. When you're climbing a mountain, you must always plan your movements carefully.
Iris: I've seen more than a few adventurers lose their lives because they didn't think before they acted...
Iris: Alright, I won't lecture you any longer. Just be sure to prepare before you set out.
