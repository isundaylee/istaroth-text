Ramiz: Grandma, may I ask you a question? Nawaz and I have been thinking about this one, but we still don't get it.
Kulsoom: Oh, of course you can, dear.
Ramiz: So, uh... Grandma, is King Deshret really gonna come back from the dead...?
Kulsoom: ...!
Ramiz: Grandma?
Kulsoom: Those fanatic believers! Can't they spare the children!?
Kulsoom: Child, please, listen well. Though gods are indeed very powerful, even they can disappear.
Kulsoom: Being obsessed with things that have disappeared is madness. It is no way to live.
Kulsoom: *sigh* If only the desert children had the chance to learn a little more. Then they wouldn't easily fall for such lies...
Kulsoom: Child, I... I know this is a lot to ask, but please, study hard — you should learn a thing or two from Setaria.
Ramiz: I... I understand.

Kulsoom: Do you now understand where you went wrong?
Kagemni: Yes... I know...
Kulsoom: And where was that exactly?
Kagemni: I... I shouldn't have trusted in rumors...
Kulsoom: And?
Kagemni: And, uh... I... I shouldn't have gone babbling to your grandson about that hearsay?
Kulsoom: Well, that was wrong of you, yes, but is that really the most important thing?
Kulsoom: What's the point of just "knowing" things? Do them! That's the important part!
Kulsoom: It's because you're always lounging around at home that you wound up believing those baseless rumors!
Kulsoom: You're still young — you've still got all the time in the world to learn new things. Why don't you follow Setaria's example and go study?
Kagemni: Y—Yes, you're right...
