# The Genius Researcher and the Seed of Another World


## Talk 1

Paimon: Is that Albedo? Why would he hang around a place like this?
Rosaria: The word on the street is he loves painting. He'll hang around anywhere for a good landscape.
Rosaria: The views and scenery here are pretty good, potential paintings everywhere you look.
Paimon: But... can't he see those hilichurls? Isn't he in danger?
Paimon: Eek!

## Talk 2

Albedo: Who are you? Why did you alarm them?
Albedo: Thank the gods I'd already completed my painting. Would've been a shame to leave these particular hilichurls unfinished.
Traveler: You were painting hilichurls?
Paimon: What's up with painting hilichurls? What makes them so interesting?
Albedo: Hmm, I'm afraid the answer isn't easy to explain. If you'd like to have a look at my painting, it may give you a clue.
Traveler: Uh...
Paimon: Wow, look at the detail! But some of it seems to have been done in a hurry.
Albedo: You can find these hilichurls anywhere, quite boring in fact, not worth closer inspection.
Albedo: But take a look at this specimen. The build, the coat... And there's a distinct force at work here.
Albedo: In the cyclical lives of such primitive communities, such unique attributes are an indication of evolution at work. Evolution, the transition from nothing into existence, from the known to the un—
Rosaria: Hold your horses. Ugh, something tells me we're in for a thesis, and I haven't got the stamina.
Rosaria: We've found your man, I'm headed back.
Paimon: What!? Don't you have any questions for him? Hey!
Paimon: Ugh, what a weirdo.
Albedo: So Sister Rosaria brought you? Surprising. And I didn't have time to thank her.
Albedo: But back to the point. From her words, it seems that you were looking for me?
Paimon: Mm-hmm, we met a girl in Mondstadt, Sucrose! She said you were stuck with your research.
Albedo: I see, so Sucrose sent you here.
Albedo: Then, if I'm not mistaken, you must be the Honorary Knight. You've got the whole of Mondstadt talking.
Albedo: I've heard a bit of everything: your actions during Stormterror's attack, your elemental control, and quite a few other mysterious things...
Albedo: I'll skip to the conclusion, there's only one possibility after all. You came from afar — from another world. Correct?
Traveler: Correct.
Albedo: Excellent. If I could procure your assistance, I think my research would benefit enormously.
Traveler: Your research?
Albedo: Ah — forgive me, this must be confusing. Where should I begin? Hmm... The essence of life?
Paimon: Whoa whoa, you want to start with that!?
Albedo: Hmm... You're right. Giving a demonstration would be better than trying to explain.
Albedo: For example, awakening life. Breathing new life into fallen leaves.
Paimon: You can do that!?
Traveler: Alchemy really is miraculous.
Albedo: However, I have a particular seed in my possession. The method I'm talking about has produced no results.
Albedo: It's like you, in that it hails from another world. Helping it to grow — to bloom... That's the problem my research is up against. That's where I'd need your assistance.
Paimon: Well, if you're struggling to figure it out, Paimon's not sure we're gonna be much assistance.
Albedo: I beg to differ. I'm unable to comprehend the intricacies of life outside of the known world.
Albedo: But you're not from the known world. By observing and researching you, I may just be able to find a way to get the seed to sprout.
Traveler: So I'm an... object of research?
Paimon: #Uh... Shall we just get outta here, {NICKNAME}? This sounds a little freaky.
Traveler: Is there any danger?
Albedo: It's possible. But I will do everything in my control to ensure your safety.
Albedo: Time for a change of surroundings, we should be going. There's research to do!
Rosaria: Missing text (1779528594)
Rosaria: Albedo and that Traveler seem to have hit it off.
Rosaria: Takes a weirdo to know one I guess. I wonder... Does this constitute a risk to Mondstadt?
Traveler: What's in it for me?
Albedo: Mora, knowledge. And the answer to the question you are seeking. It happens to be an answer that I can provide. How does that sound?
Traveler: Alchemy really is useful.
Traveler: I'm not sure I understand.
Traveler: You are worthy of your scholarly reputation.
Traveler: Very... avant-garde.
Traveler: I thought you were painting a landscape.
