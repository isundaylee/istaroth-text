Sanad: All these books... Do I have to read through every page?
Sanad: I thought the entrance exam to the Akademiya was the biggest challenge I could ever face. Turns out I was too optimistic!

Traveler: About the books...
Sanad: My roommate recommended these books to me.
Sanad: I asked for some advice on research, and his answer was that we can't only rely on the Akasha.
Sanad: He said that to carry out in-depth research, it's best to track down the source of knowledge, read carefully, and also think proactively.
Sanad: I said: "Sure! Lemme try your method!" He's the best among us, after all — we've almost given up on trying to catch up with him, you know.
Sanad: But I really didn't expect him to read... so many books every day...

Traveler: About studying...
Sanad: I'm not very talented, and it took me great effort to get into the Akademiya.
Sanad: My sister often encouraged me, saying that things would be much easier once I passed the exam.
Sanad: That's not true at all! My schedule has become ever crazier since I got admitted... I've been experiencing hair loss lately. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety. Can I get my assignments done? Will my thesis proposal get approved?
Sanad: Speaking of which, I wonder if I can borrow my sister's theses from when she was studying here. We're from the same Darshan, you see...

## Talk 4

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? Don't tell me you've got yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya!
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine with school!
Sanad: I just want to borrow your theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need some reference materials! Yeah, that's what they are for, reference only!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: What's more, if it's something of reference value, it's probably already archived in the Akasha. Why don't you apply for access?
Zohreh: Instead of borrowing my out-of-date theses, why don't you discuss your ideas with top students in your school?
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... One could even say he's an overacheiver. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.

## Talk 5

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? You haven't gotten yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya, have you?
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine at school!
Sanad: I.. just want to borrow some of your old theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need them as... reference materials! Yeah, that's right!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: I'd say that you might get more out of discussing your ideas with some better students in your cohort, as opposed to borrowing my theses from way back when.
Zohreh: Perhaps a little discussion might lead to something new altogether. You never know...
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... or perhaps we should say that he achieves too much. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil right now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.
