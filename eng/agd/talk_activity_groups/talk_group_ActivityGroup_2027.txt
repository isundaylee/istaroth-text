# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2027

## Talk

Xavier: Oh, how lucky am I to have so many kind-hearted people assisting me!
Chiori: Yeah, yeah. Just watch your step, now.
Xavier: Everything I've been through is starting to pay off now... There finally is a light at the end of the tunnel!
Xavier: Ah, I see it now! What lies before me... is a whole world of hope!
Chiori: ...No, what lies before you is the fountain. I hope you can start seeing clearly, or you'll end up taking a dip in it!

## Talk

Kamisato Ayato: ...Indeed, Monsieur Neuvillette, I'd very much appreciate hearing your thoughts on everything we just discussed, including my initial proposal, and the general direction of our potential cooperation.
Neuvillette: Your proposals are reasonable, and quite well-thought out. Your sincerity and wish for our mutual success was evident in your words, so there's no need to be so modest.
Kamisato Ayato: Thank you. So, what's your decision?
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: If you're asking for my personal opinion... I'm willing to cooperate in full based on my own opinions and my impression of Inazuma's culture.
Neuvillette: However, Fontaine doesn't run simply based on the feelings of one individual. I'm sure Inazuma must be the same. Everything must be done in accordance with the regulations that are in place.
Kamisato Ayato: Yes, of course.
Kamisato Ayato: I will submit a written proposal outlining the details of our potential cooperation to the Palais Mermonia within a week.
Neuvillette: Then I look forward to hearing from you.

## Talk

Kamisato Ayaka: Here, Yoimiya, try some Conch Madeleine.
Yoimiya: No, you ordered it, Ayaka, so you should be the first to try.
Kamisato Ayaka: To be honest, I ordered it for you. You're fond of desserts, aren't you?
Yoimiya: Hehe... Well, in that case, I guess I shouldn't refuse! Let's try some together!
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, alright.
Yoimiya: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Yoimiya: This is amazing!
Yoimiya: The texture is so soft! You can feel the super rich aroma of butter as soon as you take a bite, and the aftertaste is pure bliss...
Kamisato Ayaka: Great, I'm glad you like it.
Kamisato Ayaka: I enjoyed it too. And I really like the swirly design.
Yoimiya: I've heard that it's supposed to look like a Beryl Conch! I've never actually seen one myself, but now, I'm really curious about what it looks like!
Yoimiya: Hey, Ayaka, when you can find the time, would you like to go search for one underwater with me?
Kamisato Ayaka: Alright, why don't we go right after this?
Yoimiya: Great, then that's a plan! There are so many places I'd like to visit with you!

## Talk

Chevreuse: What? Never thought that the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol could come from the Fleuve Cendre?
Traveler: I have to say, I'm pretty shocked.
Chevreuse: Honestly, I'm pretty shocked, too. There used to be a time when I thought I would never be able to join the Gardes.
Chevreuse: But as long as you can distinguish yourself through your accomplishments and skills, you'll eventually be recognized for your worth.
Chevreuse: If you look at it another way, my life at Fleuve Cendre has actually taught me a lot of valuable skills.
Chevreuse: Skills like... how to barter with criminals, or how to think in their shoes.
Chevreuse: Of course, I'd appreciate it if you could keep this a secret between us.
Traveler: I'm sure that wasn't easy...
Chevreuse: You mean, rising through the ranks? It was a struggle, for sure.

## Talk

Chevreuse: Even though it's a bit late, I must thank you for investigating this case with me.
Chevreuse: Not on behalf of the Special Patrol this time — it's a personal expression of gratitude from yours truly.
Traveler: About your family...
Chevreuse: Ah, you want to hear more about my father?
Chevreuse: To be honest, I didn't spend that much time with him. He was always busy with the Special Patrol, so he would often return home really late at night. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
Chevreuse: Once, he didn't come home for a long time. Maybe a whole week or so.
Chevreuse: When I went out to buy food, I learned that he had become a criminal, and by extension, that made me a criminal's daughter.
Chevreuse: But we can talk about that another day.
Traveler: About the case...
Chevreuse: I actually have a lot of sympathy for Veronique and Baptiste. I can understand the hatred they feel for their father...
Chevreuse: But that doesn't mean I'll allow them to walk the path of evil, even if it might lead to another sense of justice.
Traveler: About the film...
Chevreuse: Films are different from the real world. They are a form of art and represent the wishes in people's hearts.
Chevreuse: I adore "The Two Musketeers," and I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to act the role as one.
Chevreuse: I can't wait to catch the film when it premieres in the opera house. I'm looking forward to seeing the audience's reaction to the climactic ending.
Traveler: Please take care...
Chevreuse: Thank you for looking out for me. I'll see you at the award ceremony — I'd be very surprised if we don't win.

## Talk

Chiori: Ah, it's you. Is there something I can help you with?
Traveler: About Chioriya Boutique...
Chiori: Interested in our couture services? Just give me the word.
Traveler: But we didn't really do anything...
Chiori: There's no need to be humble. You helped Xavier and Chevreuse, and even Kirara's told me many good things about you. They are all my friends.
Chiori: Thanks to you, we were also able to premiere the film in time. Its success has increased the reach of my brand.
Chiori: You've done far more than what you give yourself credit for.
Traveler: About your work...
Chiori: I am merely a fashion designer. I don't have anything else I moonlight as.
Chiori: But when you run a business, it's inevitable that as you make more friends, you'll also encounter all sorts of thorny issues.
Chiori: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. It's just the common sense of business.
Traveler: I don't have any more questions.
Chiori: Okay, see you around.

Chiori: Okay, see you around.
Chiori: Xavier's over the moon now that he's actually won the Furina Award. Maybe I'll actually find him in a fountain the next time I see him.
Chiori: The demand for couture at my Boutique has also increased... so much so that I don't have enough staff to handle it.
Chiori: Looks like I'm one step closer to achieving my dream.
Chiori: Anyway, you will always be welcome at Chioriya Boutique. I would love to see you both again at the upcoming Fontaine Fashion Week as well.

## Talk

Kamisato Ayaka: I'm so glad we were able to complete the film. Thanks for taking care of me while I was here.
Traveler: Your acting was brilliant.
Kamisato Ayaka: Really? Thank you...
Kamisato Ayaka: At first, I simply tried to work hard out of a desire to not become a burden to the crew. It would have been so embarrassing if the filming had to stop to accommodate my lack of skills.
Kamisato Ayaka: But Director Furina was both patient and knowledgeable, and Chevreuse and Elain taught me a lot about the scenes and details. It was all thanks to their help that I was able to grow comfortable with the role.
Kamisato Ayaka: And even with all of that said, I still... got a little flustered with praise, especially since everyone, including you, were complimenting me at the end...
Traveler: Did you have a good time?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I visited many places with Yoimiya in between the filming sessions.
Kamisato Ayaka: The elegant streets, the beautiful flowers and greenery, and the dreamlike underwater world... Everything I saw will shine like stars in my memories.
Kamisato Ayaka: It also brings me joy to think that perhaps you've marveled at those exact wonders as well.
Traveler: Thank you for your hard work, Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, it's nothing at all. I... don't often have the opportunity to wander out into the world like this.
Kamisato Ayaka: Not only did I make many new friends during this trip, I also picked up many new skills from everyone around me. I will cherish this experience greatly.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, and I'm also going to bring some Conch Madeleines back to the Yashiro Commission as a gift.
Kamisato Ayaka: If we could enjoy them with some coffee... Hehe, perhaps it'll feel as if I'd never left Fontaine at all.
Traveler: Have a safe and relaxing trip home.
Kamisato Ayaka: Mhm, thank you for looking out for me. Please do take care of yourself during your adventures as well.
Kamisato Ayaka: If the stars align, we'll see each other in Inazuma again.

## Talk

Xavier: Lady Furina, please allow me to take just one more photo of you! I would also love to get your autograph... just as a memento of our time together on the crew.
Furina: Hey, I've had enough of the Kamera flashes from when we were all up on stage.
Xavier: But... But Lady Furina, you are the best Director I've ever met! The most photogenic maiden in all of Fontaine! This kind of lively and celebratory setting is exactly where you shine. I believe all photographers would agree...
Xavier: Come, the brightest star of our land! Show us your light! The Kamera is waiting to sing praises of your beauty!
Furina: Well I'm flattered, but... but...
Furina: *sigh* Alright, I'll humor you and try a few more different poses.
Furina: But I don't have to hold the trophy, right?
Xavier: Ah... Ah! Of course! You may pose however you like!
Xavier: Thank you so much, thank you so much! By the heavens, my luck has been beyond belief, I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it now...

## Talk

Chevreuse: Miss Yoimiya... We haven't had the chance to talk, but please accept my thanks for everything you've done over the past few days.
Yoimiya: Oh? But I feel like I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
Chevreuse: I'm very grateful for your assistance during that special performance in the warehouse.
Chevreuse: It was always going to be somewhat risky. To engage and draw away Morris all on your own...
Chevreuse: You're only a civilian and have never been trained to act in such a dangerous situation...
Yoimiya: Don't say it like that! As the director's assistant, it was my duty to help out the crew however I could. It was an honor to help you solve the case.
Yoimiya: I have to admit though, my heart was thumping super hard the entire time I was laying on the ground. I was scared that everyone would notice, hehe.
Chevreuse: You did great.
Yoimiya: Oh, and before I forget! If you ever visit Inazuma, please come and pay a visit to Naganohara Fireworks. I'll make some fireworks for you — I even know what shape I'd make!
Chevreuse: I'm guessing... a musket?
Yoimiya: Hehe, telling you now would ruin the surprise! If you really want to see it, just come and visit me!

## Talk

Kamisato Ayato: Oh, I didn't expect to meet you here.
Traveler: About your drink...
Kamisato Ayato: I've been told that this is a beverage called "Fonta." I quite like its unique taste.
Kamisato Ayato: The slogan, "A Font of Refreshment," is rather catchy as well. I'm starting to wonder if I could incorporate it into our cultural exchange initiative.
Kamisato Ayato: What would happen if we were to add some sprigs of mint into Fonta? I believe this is an idea worth testing.
Kamisato Ayato: Or perhaps we could even take it one step further, and mix in an equal amount of Milk Tea Medley...
Kamisato Ayato: Hehe, but for some reason, I suspect that experiment wouldn't turn out well.
Traveler: About the film...
Kamisato Ayato: Thanks to you, the film was successfully completed and the Yashiro Commission secured a collaboration project with the Palais Mermonia.
Kamisato Ayato: If another opportunity was to arise in the future, perhaps I should take on the chance to act as the protagonist.
Kamisato Ayato: Or perhaps... you think the role of villain would fit me better?
Traveler: Have a safe trip home.
Kamisato Ayato: Thank you for the well wishes. I will take good care of Ayaka and Yoimiya.
Kamisato Ayato: I would like to wish you safe travels on your next journey as well.

## Talk

Petit Lumiere: How about it? Ready to try your hand at filming?
Traveler: Yep.
Petit Lumiere: Excellent. I've already set up the scene, the actors are ready, and all is awaiting your arrival.
Traveler: About your older brother...
Petit Lumiere: Lumiere is much older than I, but that poses no obstacle to us brothers working together.
Petit Lumiere: We were not yet famous when we filmed "The Arrival of an Aquabus" and "Employees Leaving the Factory."
Petit Lumiere: We two brothers have done everything together, because no one was willing to assist directors who were not yet famous, haha!
Petit Lumiere: If you are interested, you can go see those two films.
Traveler: I'm not ready yet.
Petit Lumiere: No problem, I understand. A quality product requires time to incubate and nurture.

## Talk

Turenna: Super Zenith Boss-Level Force, do you have any further instructions?
Traveler: Let's play a round of "Thousand-Pace Interdiction Arcminute Sharpshooting Zone"!
Turenna: No problem! This game doesn't use up any real ammunition, and the targets don't require maintenance, so you can play as many rounds as you like!
Traveler: About muskets...
Turenna: Oh, interested in a custom-made musket of your own?
Turenna: Though I couldn't tell you exactly how muskets work myself, I do recall hearing colleagues mention the names of several outstanding gunsmiths.
Turenna: In terms of their lifespan, accuracy, and ballistic stability, there's simply no comparison between a mass-produced musket and one that has been painstakingly crafted by a gunsmith...
Turenna: And if you're using high-quality ammunition, produced to very tight tolerance levels, then get ready for some jaw-dropping results!
Turenna: But I seem to remember that regular citizens aren't allowed to carry muskets, at least not without having first cut through an absolute sea of red tape...
Turenna: Tell you what, when I return to the Special Patrol headquarters, I'll ask around for you!
Traveler: See you around!
Turenna: Nice to meet you again, Super Zenith Boss-Level Force! I'll be here waiting for you, drop by whenever you'd like!

## Talk

Helene: Even though they promised to help with the testing, I still feel a little on edge...
Helene: This restless feeling... Just as I thought, getting over my client-phobia won't be as simple as that!
Traveler: Are you alright?
Helene: Ah! You're back! I—I'm so sorry, I must have zoned out...
Helene: I've been thinking, is there really no way for me to escape the shadow of my clients?
Helene: Could it be that the only solution is, as you implied, to come up with a way of "getting rid" of my boss?
Helene: I—I need to think this over!
Traveler: About the stabilization platforms...
Helene: Huh? You, the miracle worker... You're interested in mechanical principles?
Helene: Actually, there isn't anything novel about the technology itself. I just happened to make some technical breakthroughs based on some previously abandoned research...
Helene: I've heard that there was a bunch of very talented engineers way back when... who wanted to make cannons that could fire stably even amidst towering waves.
Helene: To that end, they worked day and night to invent a device that could stabilize weaponry on a vertical axis.
Helene: Such projects were ultimately abandoned, sure, but I was able to restore the stabilizers based on some fragmentary documents.
Helene: After scaling it down, the end result was the current "Stabilization Mek."
Helene: I wonder whether there's really a market for this type of machine...
Traveler: (Quietly leave...)
Helene: Oh no, what am I going to do...

## Talk

Melies: Well, how was it? My experimental style and "Special Lighting" are quite something, no?
Traveler: I was just getting into it!
Melies: Ha, I knew you were up to the job!
Melies: Filming action scenes clearly suits you like a suit.
Melies: Feel free to drop by the studio anytime during the Film Festival to carry on filming, and immerse yourself in the limelight!
Melies: I literally have an inexhaustible supply of film roll, so no matter how many cuts you want to film, be my guest!
Traveler: When will the film come out?
Melies: Hard to say, to be honest...
Melies: Even after you and your acting double have finished all the filming, I've then got to go through the whole process of editing, color grading, sound design, and more...
Melies: I'm not even sure if it'll all be done in time to start officially promoting it and put out a trailer.
Melies: But none of our work will have been wasted! Even if it all takes a day or two extra, when the film finally comes out, its quality will speak for itself!
Melies: So please, have patience, my good partner.
Traveler: Well, I'm off...
Melies: Goodbye for now. Remember, when you get some time on your hands, please do pop into the studio for a bit of filming!
