# Pirate Invasion, in Liyue Harbor!


## Talk 1

Little Fei: Meng, today I get to be the captain — right?
Little Meng: Lulu, I've been the captain loads of times in a row now, we should let Fei have a turn.
Little Lulu: But Meng, you're the bestest captain ever! I want you to keep being it...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Little Fei: We're trying to play a game. They promised me I could be the captain this time...
Little Fei: But Lulu keeps saying it's way more fun when Meng is the captain.
Little Fei: *sigh* Lulu always does this... But, if it's what she wants... I guess it's fine by me.
Little Fei: Hey, do you have time to join in? You can be the pirate!
Traveler: Okay...
Little Fei: *sigh* Once again, as always, I'm just the first mate...
Little Fei: Just like last time, come and join us when you're ready.
Traveler: But I wanna be one of the good guys.
Little Fei: *sigh* Ah, I really wanna be the captain...

## Talk 2

Little Fei: Ready yet?

## Talk 3

Little Fei: Here we are! Here's the captain!
Little Meng: What are you doing, bringing the pirates here!? You should've led them on a wild goose chase so that me and Lulu would have time to escape!
Little Fei: Why do you and Lulu get to escape while I have to stay here and hold the pirates up!?
Little Fei: I got a better idea: I give you over to the pirates while I escape with Lulu!
Little Meng: But... Beidou says you should never abandon your friends!
Little Fei: Oh? And does Beidou also say that the captain should run away with their favorite person at the first sign of trouble!?
Little Meng: Why you little... I'm never sharing my Lotus Heads with you EVER again!
Little Fei: FINE! It's only you who cares so much about stupid Lotus Heads anyway!
Paimon: They are blowing this way out of proportion...
Little Lulu: Don't worry, I know a way we can sort this out.
Little Lulu: Lotus Heads are their favorite thing in the world... Giving them their favorite treat will definitely calm them down.
Little Lulu: Can you find some Lotus Heads for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Little Lulu: Thank you! You need to be quick though.
Traveler: It's not Lotus Heads they're fighting over...
Little Lulu: Oh... Really? Well what is it?
Little Lulu: ...Anyway, just get some Lotus Heads. We can't have them arguing like this all day.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Ready.
Little Fei: Alright then. I guess we can start.
Little Fei: I hate being the first mate...
Little Fei: Lulu and Meng only care about themselves...
Traveler: Ar! Do I spy me some pieces of eight? Hand 'em over!
Little Fei: Oh, hi pirate. Sorry, I'm just a poor first mate with nothing for you to steal.
Little Fei: If you're here to rob the boat, you need to find someone with enough money... Hmm...
Little Fei: I know! The captain is really rich — you should go and steal from him!
Paimon: Wh—What!? Don't you work on this boat?
Little Fei: Yeah! That means I know how to find the captain.
Little Fei: He's just a captain anyway... What's so special about that...
Little Fei: Come with me! I'll take you to the captain...

## Talk 5

Little Lulu: Did you find some Lotus Heads yet?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_NPC): Yup.
Little Fei: You're the meanie!
Little Meng: No, you're the meanie!
Little Lulu: Stop fighting. You're only going to wear yourselves out.
Little Lulu: It's just a game, there's no need to get so mad. We're all friends, right?
Little Lulu: And look what I've got... Freshly picked Lotus Heads! Go on, help yourselves.
Little Lulu: Once you've eaten, we're gonna straighten all this out.
Little Lulu: We'll decide who gets to be the captain and the first mate, and in what order. Sound good?
Little Meng: Fine...
Little Fei: Okay...
Paimon: Wow, it actually worked! Peace and quiet at last.
Little Lulu: Told you so!
Traveler: How did you know that would work?
Little Lulu: We've been playing together a long time. I know these things.
Traveler: Little Lulu is a miracle worker...
Little Lulu: Heeh-hee, thanks. But Beidou is the real miracle worker.
Little Lulu: I hope I can be like her when I grow up...
