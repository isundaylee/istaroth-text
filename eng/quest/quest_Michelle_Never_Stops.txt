# Michelle Never Stops!


## Talk 1

Michelle: Ow, my back...
Traveler: Are you okay?
Michelle: I was just getting ready for work, but then all of a sudden my back started hurting.
Michelle: I promised Quinn I would go and help out at his fruit stand today, but I think it's best if I rest here for a while first...
Michelle: But I can't just stay here and hold everything up.
Michelle: Could you go and ask Quinn what he needs me to do? That will help me get prepared.
Traveler: Okay.
Michelle: Thank you. I should be fine after a short rest.
Traveler: It's not far, surely you can make it?
Paimon: Come on, is this really so much to ask? Help me out here.

## Talk 2

Michelle: Have you spoken to Quinn?
Traveler: Yes. He says you should get some rest.
Paimon: There's nothing to do at Quinn's today anyway, go home and rest up.
Michelle: Really... *sigh* Looks like I should find something else to do...
Paimon: What? You're not going to take a sick day!? Take the chance while it's there!
Michelle: Stop and feel what is happening all around you. That's Lord Barbatos' winds, still hard at work.
Michelle: We are blessed by Barbatos. It is not a privilege we should take lightly — we all need to do our part.
Michelle: As for your part... What have you been doing? Why are you sweating so much?
Michelle: It seems that you are very busy yourself. But this is not a bad thing, for the more we toil, the more we sweat, and the more keenly we feel the winds of Barbatos.
Michelle: Here, have this bottle of milk. Drink up and get back to it, for there is no shortage of work to be done in this world.

## Talk 3

Quinn: Oh no...

## Talk 4

Michelle: My back hurts so much... I hope I'll recover after a short rest...

## Talk 5

Quinn: Where is my delivery? This is ridiculous...
Traveler: What's happened?
Quinn: *sigh* My fruit stall is all out of sunsettias. I ordered several batches a while ago...
Quinn: But they still haven't arrived. And my customers won't wait forever.
Quinn: Eury alone has come by three times already, and all she wants is *three sunsettias*. She's been a regular customer for a long time, and now I'm afraid I might lose her!
Quinn: I need to stay at the stall... If only someone could go and pick a few wild sunsettias for me.
Traveler: If it's urgent, I can go.
Quinn: Really? That's amazing! Thank you so much.
Traveler: Michelle is on her way...
Paimon: Hang on! What is Michelle doing picking fruit in her condition!?
Paimon: We can help!

## Talk 6

Quinn: Did you find me some *sunsettias*?
Traveler: Not yet.
Quinn: There should be plenty of *sunsettias* just outside the city. Please, I need to stay here — can you run and grab some quickly?

## Talk 7

Quinn: Have you found me some sunsettias yet?
Traveler: Got them right here.
Quinn: Great. That should be enough for Miss Eury.
Quinn: *sigh* But it looks like most of my customers have gone now. This isn't a one-person job, it seems.
Quinn: Oh— I should give you something for your trouble. Hang on...
Paimon: There is no need for gifts. But we do have a request for you.
Traveler: It's about Michelle.
Quinn: Michelle? You've seen her?
Quinn: I should give her a less taxing job?
Quinn: All I ever asked is that she watch the fruit stand for me.
Paimon: Oh. Is that true?
Quinn: But with no more customers, it looks like I won't even need her to do that...
Quinn: Please tell her to go home and rest for me.
Quinn: I'll go and chase up that delivery in a moment.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa... This looks like really tough work.
Paimon: Michelle has enough on her plate already. Let's help Quinn finish the job off ourselves.
Paimon: And then let's beg him to give Michelle something that's a bit more manageable...
Paimon: Hopefully Michelle won't mind us stepping in on her behalf like this.

### Additional Talk 2

Quinn: Thank you for your help. *sigh* Next time I need to get more people on board. Maybe Beatrice? Nah...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Hahaha... Well, on the bright side, at least we got some exercise...
