Traveler: Is something on your mind?
Ogura Yuu: I have a sister who's taking care of our family business, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, in Inazuma.
Ogura Yuu: My sister and I grew up around textiles and have been making clothes since we were little. If my military duties didn't force me to be stationed here at the watch tower, I would be home helping out with the shop.
Ogura Yuu: If the disputes between the Shogunate and the Sangonomiya can someday be resolved, I can go back home to be reunited with my family and help my sister with the shop.
