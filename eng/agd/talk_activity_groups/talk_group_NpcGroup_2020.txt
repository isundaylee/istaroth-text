Xingxi: Mingxing Jewelry is well established within the industry, even if we are only taking advance orders on gems right now. We do have some other items in stock however.

## Talk

Traveler: What do you have on offer?
Xingxi: Other than gems, a few odds and ends. Are you a traveler? Perhaps I have something that could be of use to you.

## Talk

Traveler: You're only taking advance orders on gems?
Xingxi: I do apologize for the inconvenience. We often find ourselves unable to meet the demand for our goods here at Mingxing Jewelry...
Xingxi: As you will already know, Liyue is famed for its ceramics — they can only be fired locally due to the unique properties of the soil here.
Xingxi: Some would go so far as to say that Mingxing Jewelry is in a league of its own in the trade. Wealthy merchants will travel from all corners of Teyvat just to purchase a single Lucent Crescent from us. It is the quintessential Liyue ornament.
Xingxi: We were caught by surprise when the mines at the Chasm were closed. All of a sudden, we had no suppliers.
Xingxi: As you can see, only a few display items remain in stock. Though if you were to insist on buying one, the price would be... Hmm, forget it. Hearing the figure would only upset you.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me more about Mingxing Jewelry.
Xingxi: Mingxing Jewelry is a Liyue trader of precious stones and gems that has been around for hundreds of years.
Xingxi: You could say it is the Rex Lapis of the market for precious stones. It is the only store of its kind, and it has been in business continuously since the day it was founded.
Xingxi: Have you ever heard anyone mention our Lucent Crescent ornaments? They are especially popular with young people.
Xingxi: We produce a very limited quantity of Lucent Crescent — only ten per month. People say that if you manage to purchase one of them, you are sure to win the heart of your beloved...
Xingxi: Interested? Heh... Whether what they say is true or not I don't know, but I do know that I, personally, would be won over if someone was to buy one for me...

Xingxi: Goodbye.
Xingxi: Take care. Once our stocks recover I will be sure to inform our regular customers.
