Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Saimon Eri: I've lived my whole life in Konda Village. There are no legends here that I wouldn't know about.
Saimon Eri: Are you asking if I'm doing alright here by myself? Haha, it's very nice of you to ask, but I'm not alone.
Saimon Eri: We haven't received any letters from our son in a long time after he went off to join the army. So my husband decided to leave the village to ask around concerning his well-being...
Saimon Eri: *sigh* I really don't think there's a need to be so worried. Jirou has always had good luck. The archons will watch over and protect him.
Saimon Eri: Besides, he's a clever boy. He knows a million ways to keep himself alive. Everything will be just fine.
