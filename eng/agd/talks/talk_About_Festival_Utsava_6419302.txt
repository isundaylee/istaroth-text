Traveler: About Festival Utsava...
Arasaka: The more friends to share the "taste of happiness" with, the better it becomes. So when Festival Utsava comes, I will make sure every Aranara gets to have a "taste of happiness."
Arasaka: By then... I think Arapacati will have a good time like everyone else.
