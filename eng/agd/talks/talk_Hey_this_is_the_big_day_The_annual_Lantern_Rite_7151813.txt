Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.

Kun: It's also said to have something to do with Fontaine's renowned Iridescence Tour!
Kun: I heard they haven't done a show in a while, so this one can't be missed!
