Minglan: #Would you like to participate in a martial arts demonstration, Traveler?
Traveler: I'd love to give it a try!
Minglan: Great. In that case, please, follow me.
Traveler: Let me think it over first...
Minglan: That's alright. Just let me know when you want to give it a whirl. I'm sure the Sergeant would be more than happy to have you.
