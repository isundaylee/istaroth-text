Traveler: What is this place?
Hinterman: Welcome to Poisson, a little place for us fishermen.
Hinterman: The sights here aren't as grand as you'll see in the city, but everyone here lives a leisurely life.
Hinterman: Ah, yes. I should probably mention that the terrain here can be quite slippery, so if you're here to travel, do watch your step.
