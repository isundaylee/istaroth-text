# Adventurer Exam: Taking Flight


## Talk 1

Anna: Where did I go wrong...
Traveler: What's up?
Anna: Traveler... I...
Anna: I studied pretty hard after your previous coaching session.
Anna: After that, I asked Jack to help me do a mock test.
Anna: I... I failed that mock exam.
Anna: I'm not sure where things went wrong. Traveler, could you coach me again?
Traveler: No problem.
Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler!
Anna: So... First off, how many people can a single wind glider carry while airborne?
Traveler: (Uh, did I give the wrong answers that last time...?)

## Talk 2

Traveler: One person per glider.
Anna: I see...

## Talk 3

Traveler: That depends on how good the person doing the gliding is.
Anna: Huh...

## Talk 4

Traveler: That depends on the weight of the person gliding.
Anna: Hmm, I see...

## Talk 5

Anna: Second question: what should we take note of when using wind gliders?

## Talk 6

Traveler: To select appropriate take-off points and to assume the correct take-off posture.
Anna: Oh...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Taking off using Anemo Slimes is always an interesting option.
Anna: Is that so...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: You need to make sure that you're below the wind glider.
Anna: Ah, alright, I see...

### Additional Talk 3

Anna: Here's my third question, then: what should we take note of when landing?

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Select an appropriate landing spot, and do not fold your wind glider in abruptly.
Anna: Oh, I see...

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: You have to mind your descent posture most of all.
Anna: Is that how it is...

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: Make sure to find solid ground to land on.
Anna: Hmm, I see...

### Additional Talk 7

Anna: Hmm... I think I've more or less got it all down now! But I won't get anywhere just by listening...
Anna: Traveler, could you give me a demonstration of wind glider usage?
Traveler: Sure.
Anna: I sure will! Let's get going, then!
Traveler: Watch closely now.

### Additional Talk 8

Anna: Wow, you're really good at this! No wonder Amber said that I could learn a thing or two from you.
Anna: Hehe, with you as my coach, this exam will be a cinch!
Anna: Thanks so much! Here, these are for you. I'm off to revise some more!
Anna: I wonder what color my wind glider should be...
Anna: Blue? Green? Maybe a bit of both, perhaps?
