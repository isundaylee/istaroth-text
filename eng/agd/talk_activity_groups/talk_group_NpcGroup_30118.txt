Xinyan: Ahh... Ahh... *cough*! That party was a real blast! You know you had a good time when you ended up singing a little too hard and straining your voice...
Beidou: Seems I've caused you all sorts of trouble. Sorry it's been so tough on you.
Xinyan: Are you kidding me!? I got to go out on the ocean with you and celebrate the festival with y'all. Couldn't have asked for more. Best Lantern Rite ever!
Xinyan: I was gonna ask, though... Now that your crew is all back home with their families, aren't you gonna get bored on your own?
Beidou: Haha, not a chance. Just yesterday I got an invitation to play some chess. Said I could head up for a game whenever I'm down to play.
Xinyan: Head up...? Oh, right! You mean to the Jade Chamber.
Beidou: Uh, moving on â€” when you're feeling better, we should grab some food together.
Beidou: Lantern Rite only comes once a year, and I, for one, intend to make the most of it.
