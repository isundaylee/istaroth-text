# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Ningguang: A chat? Is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
Traveler: Nâ€”No... just a simple chat.
Ningguang: Hmm, interesting... so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
Ningguang: And you wish to have a "simple chat"?
Traveler: I don't think I could afford the dinners they're buying.
Ningguang: Haha... Ahh, you make me laugh.
Ningguang: These people... they send me the most extravagant gifts...
Ningguang: ...But all they're really after are my words... any morsel of information that may hint at Liyue's future commercial trends.
Ningguang: Which makes the prospect of a carefree, honest chat here with you... all the more valuable to me.
Ningguang: For it is something that Mora cannot buy.
Ningguang: So, stay with me a while, and let's chat about the simpler things in life. Anything at all.
Traveler: We can talk about anything you like.
Ningguang: ...You really are quite different from the rest.
