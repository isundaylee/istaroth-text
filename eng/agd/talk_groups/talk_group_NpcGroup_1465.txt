Traveler: About Stormterror...
Charles: Well, what's passed has passed, I say.
Charles: Life isn't all sweet fruit juice. It also needs some bitter alcohol. These incidents will also become part of our experience.
Charles: Rather than ask how this could happen, we should look forward to the future. Accepting the bitter with the sweet is how adults do things.
Charles: Once you're ready for the bitter, I'll pour you a special brew.

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Charles: It's been quite the headache for sure. Stormterror's affected our tavern's supply routes, so the variety of wines here has also dropped...
Charles: As for Stormterror itself, I'm not too worried. I think those people who numb themselves with alcohol are just scared out of their wits.
Charles: But we do reach the point of no return, then we just need to wait for night to fall.
Charles: The "Knight Who Emerges At Night" will not just stand idly by.

Charles: Any recommendations?
Charles: The apple cider from the Dawn Winery is a special at Angel's Share.
Charles: You can try my special cocktail if you want. It's on the house if it's your first time here.
Traveler: What sort of liquor is the best?
Charles: If you like strong wine, then I'd recommend that you try Death After Noon. It's Captain Kaeya's favorite.
Charles: But the strongest wine I know has to be the one called Fire-Water.
Charles: It hails from Snezhnaya, and was brought into Mondstadt by Snezhnayan merchants, but Master Diluc stopped importing it, saying that it didn't fit the tastes of the people here.
Charles: The only remaining bottle is from the original batch. It's for display purposes only, though, so you'll have to go to Snezhnaya if you want to try some.

Charles: Tell me about yourself.
Charles: You want to know about me?
Charles: I've been working as a bartender here for more than a decade. I'm employed by the Dawn Winery, like everyone else.
Charles: I'm not that interested in alcohol, but it's my job so...
Charles: I mean, I'm not like Diona at Cat's Tail. I heard she hates alcohol.
Charles: Occasionally, Master Diluc, the owner of the winery, will cover my shift.
Charles: Days off are precious after all, so I'm very thankful to him for that.

Charles: Oh, not for me. Thanks anyway.
Charles: Really? Shouldn't drink too much anyway, I guess.
