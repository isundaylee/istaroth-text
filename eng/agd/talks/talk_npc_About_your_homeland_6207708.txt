Traveler: About your homeland...
Atsuko: Sometimes I miss the sights that I used to see in my home... The tranquil Chinju Forest, the lovely Sacred Sakura... I grew up with them.
Atsuko: But after the Sakoku Decree was implemented, Inazuma really became such an oppressive place. For someone who loves freedom like me, it was simply unbearable.
Atsuko: If we wanted to leave, we'd have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people would never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: That's why I eventually just grabbed the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: The journey was tough, but thanks to the intervention of some locals from Liyue, I now have my freedom!
