Traveler: Lucelle?
Hugues: *sigh* An old companion of mine. It could have lived free after I modified it, but then they took it away from me.
Hugues: There was no time to take anything back, because they then gave me a new workplace — the Fortress of Meropide.
Hugues: By the way, before Lucelle belonged to me, it was a Gardemek with the Gardes.
Hugues: It didn't resist when I modified it, so I took that as consent.

Traveler: And that's how you landed a new job in jail.
Hugues: ...Yes.
Hugues: Even so, this job has some perks over my previous work at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Hugues: My time in Meropide was more conducive to creativity, to be honest, given the lack of complicated processes and boring summary meetings.
Hugues: Even my daily meals were delivered by clockwork machines. Such an enviable situation! A shame, though, that the canteen manager refused to sell me that machine.
