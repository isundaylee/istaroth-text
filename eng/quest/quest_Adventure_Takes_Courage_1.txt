# Adventure Takes Courage!

Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Hi, Katheryne.
Traveler: Hello, Katheryne...
Katheryne: Greetings. You both look great today. Are you here to take commissions or deal with other affairs?
Katheryne: Why are you both staring at me? Is there something of significance that you would like to inquire about?
Traveler: No!
Katheryne: Understood. You seem like a seasoned adventurer already.
Traveler: You could say that.
Katheryne: Then you must be well acquainted with the Adventurers' Guild's way of operation. Therefore, I won't waste your time going over it.
Katheryne: If you have any questions for the Guild, please feel free to ask me at any time.
Katheryne: Please pitch in with the commissions in Sumeru City. Outstanding adventurers like you will surely be a great help to the people here.
Katheryne: Safe travels, Traveler. Ad astra abyssosque!
Traveler: Wâ€”We just want to take commissions...
