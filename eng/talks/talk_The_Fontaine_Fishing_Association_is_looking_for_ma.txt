Fontaine Fishing Association Management: The Fontaine Fishing Association is looking for master linebreakers to engage in the great business of linebreaking together! Please contact us for details...
Message: "What in the blazes is 'linebreaking'? Why haven't I heard of it?"
Fontaine Fishing Association Management: "The art of 'linebreaking,' as it were, is to put your honor and your life on the line in an epic duel! It requires us to push ourselves to our limits, maximizing our potential as we face the ultimate challenge!"
Fontaine Fishing Association Management: "Only through this art can we claim victory over the craven weakling cowering within ourselves as well as the fish beneath the waves, and place honor, joy, and the fish themselves into our bag."
Message: "Isn't that just fishing!?"
