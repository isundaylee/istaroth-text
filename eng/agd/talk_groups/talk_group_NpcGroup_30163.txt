Traveler: Al... mighty Shogun?
Rika: Ah. Don't worry about it too much. This is just something they say in the novel.
Rika: I mean, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?" is the tale of a loser Shogun and the Kitsune Guuji who can do it all.
Rika: You know, I did ask Lady Yae if publishing such a novel was alright.
Rika: But Lady Yae just said "don't worry about it. As long as it sells, it's all good!"
Rika: And in fact, this book actually sold pretty well.
Rika: But every time I look at this text, I can only think: our Shogun truly is a forgiving soul...

Traveler: What's with those ears...
Rika: Oh, they're just a prop, as is this shrine maiden costume that I'm wearing.
Rika: Actually, I'm just a part-time employee at Yae Publishing House, and my job this time is to act as one of the characters in the light novel to advertise a collaborative drink.

Traveler: About the event-exclusive drink...
Rika: Oh, you mean "Rainbow Aster"?
Rika: In the novel, this is the drink that the Kitsune Guuji made for the main character — the Shogun — when the latter was ill.
Rika: It has a most refreshing taste, owing to the addition of Mint, as well as Calla Lilies from Mondstadt.
Rika: After drinking it, the main character realizes that the Kitsune Guuji was not angry, but was instead being supportive all this time, and so becomes able to overcome a crisis.
Rika: After the novel came out, Yae Publishing House has received a constant stream of letters from readers, expressing interest in having just such a drink.
Rika: As such, we've used the occasion of the Irodori Festival to develop this drink alongside Sailing Breeze.
