Confused Bystander: Ugh... My boyfriend asked me to solve a difficult problem. My head hurts just by thinking about it... Here it is: "*You have 5 wood boards. Use them wisely to cross the river.*"
Confused Bystander: Arranging the 5 wood boards next to each other can only make me go half the distance. If you were to put space between them to reach the other side, the gap would be too big for me to jump across.
Confused Bystander: An *adult man* could jump further... I guess I can't do it after all.
Confused Bystander: What do you think? How should we arrange them?
