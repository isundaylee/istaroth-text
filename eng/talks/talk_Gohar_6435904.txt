Traveler: Gohar?
Safie: Oh, sorry. I forgot outsiders don't know about Gohar.
Safie: She is a beautiful lady that everyone here in Caravan Ribat likes. Whoever meets her can't help but say a few words of praise to her.
Safie: It's a pity you can't get to meet her in person. Some weeks ago, she received a letter from a Dusk Bird, then she asked me to send her to Sumeru City.
Safie: It was so much fun...! Um, I mean, it was an unforgettable work experience!
