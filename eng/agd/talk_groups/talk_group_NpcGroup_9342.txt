Arataki Itto: #Alright, Traveler, who we gonna throw down with next? I'm ready to rumble!
Arataki Itto: What are we waiting for, anyway? C'mon, let's gooo! Or they'll start thinkin' we're scared of 'em!
Arataki Itto: Oh, but I guess you need some time to organize the victory feast, right? Gotta plan ahead for these things! ...Okay yeah, we can hang around here a little longer. Good thing I got this lollipop to tide me over.

Arataki Itto: Look, even if there are a couple o' tough customers lurking around this place, what's there to worry about when you've got Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto on your side, huh? Huh? Haha, there is nothing out there that you need to be afraid of.
Arataki Itto: Let's see who actually has the guts to face me. A couple o' whacks from my club will send 'em all running back whence they came! WAPOW! ...And if not, we'll let Ushi deal with them.
Arataki Itto: Ugh, anyway, no use fighting on an empty stomach. Hey, they do food here, right?

Arataki Itto: Hahaha, these books are actually pretty good. I bet the boys in the gang would enjoy reading 'em, too.
Arataki Itto: Huh? ...Fairytales? You mean... they're meant for kids?
Arataki Itto: Ahem! Uhh, what I meant was, we should totally share these books with the kids in the city! They'd be a smash hit with them!
