Traveler: Since the Akasha is being used...
Lamiya: Oh? You mean, "Why do we still use the Inscribed Mirror since we already are using Akasha technology," right?
Lamiya: Considering the differences between animal and human brains, using the Akasha directly has a relatively high risk at this stage.
Lamiya: Also, as only the sense of vision is connected, though you may see from the animal's perspective, it's still your own body moving...
Lamiya: Consider what would happen if connected to the vision of a bird. Visually, you are flying, and it is hard to control a fear of heights or your instinctual movement. It would definitely cause accidents...
Lamiya: Hehe, so the mirrors are better for the time being.
