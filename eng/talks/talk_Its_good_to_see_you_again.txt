Traveler: It's good to see you again.
Anisa: Same here! It's always good to meet the person who saved my career in oceanography, you know?
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that, I've been studying the various fish species in the waters around Watatsumi Island to try to pin down the areas in which Kuntira's descendants might be living.
Anisa: And in the process, I discovered the great amount of diversity that exists among the oceanic creatures here! An unexpected boon indeed!
Anisa: *cough* Sorry, I got a little carried away. Regardless, thank you so much for your help.
