# Furball Fortress's Frightful Fix!


## Talk 1

Valerina: Honorary Knight, Cat Whisperer Paimon, are you two tired? Would you like something to eat or drink? Or perhaps a massage to relax your muscles?
Traveler: Never mind that for now. Let's talk business...
Paimon: That's right! It can't have been cheap setting up this Furball Fortress. Even Paimon knows that...
Paimon: If there's a problem with the finances, don't hesitate to let us know and we'll figure something out!
Valerina: Ah, so that's what you were concerned about... Well, we've nothing to worry about as far as Mora is concerned.
Valerina: My parents are both merchants. Not super rich, but they do support me with "operational funds" each month, so running the Fortress is no big deal at all.
Valerina: I might look like a stiff breeze could blow me away, but I was the "riddle solver" in my adventuring team back when I was with the Adventurers' Guild.
Valerina: Quite often my entire team relied on my intelligence to overcome the strange mechanisms in the ruins and get us to the treasure.
Valerina: That's to say, I didn't come cheap if anyone wanted to hire me as a freelance adventurer. I used to take on quite a bit of work, too. Sometimes I'd even complete over ten missions in a month.
Valerina: In fact, the Mora I earned on my own has surpassed the "operational funds" my parents provide me with. At this point, I have enough to handle my daily expenses for a lifetime and then some.
Valerina: I don't really have any hobbies, and now the money that was just sitting in my savings is being used to help cats today, and tomorrow, it might help more animals still. That works out just as it should, don't you think?
Paimon: Wow, you're... certainly wealthy beyond Paimon's expectations... Hang on, what do you mean "That works out just as it should"?
Valerina: Hmm. How should I put this... I've been part of many adventuring teams in my time, and I've dealt with all sorts of animal-loving people and pets.
Valerina: I've also met some compassionate souls asking others... and even the Knights of Favonius or the Church to adopt stray animals.
Valerina: This, while they themselves don't have any money beyond that needed to support themselves.
Valerina: Some good souls with the means, on the other hand, donate enough Mora to take care of one or two stray cats. They're good role models.
Valerina: I mean, it's good to have sympathy, but I don't really like asking others to do things that they... well, aren't even responsible for in the first place, you know, just because of your own feelings.
Valerina: That's why solving this problem is a job for someone who's both willing and rich, like me — I'll pay, and I'll do my part!
Valerina: Of course, I'll stop bothering you two and Ms. Rosaria once I've learned how to get along with cats!
Paimon: Huh. Y'know what, Valerina? That's kinda cool! Paimon didn't know that you had this side to you.
Paimon: Those stray cats are real lucky to have met someone like you. Paimon sure hopes that the Furball Fortress will help more cats in the future!
Traveler: Well done indeed!
Valerina: Hahaha, such wonderful praise from the Honorary Knight and Cat Whisperer Paimon...! Ah, now I'm getting really pumped up again!
Valerina: I'll keep working at it. I will learn how to communicate with cats and manage the Fortress as best I can!
Traveler: A commendable spirit!
Traveler: Food and drinks?
Paimon: Huh, did you set up a kitchen in here, Valerina? Paimon hasn't seen one.
Paimon: And what about the chef? Or are you gonna step up to the plate?
Valerina: As you can see, while this place isn't officially open yet, some guests still stay here for long periods of time.
Valerina: And I wouldn't say making them go out and buy food and drinks themselves is an ideal situation.
Valerina: As such, I've set things up with Sara at Good Hunter so that if our guests have requests for takeout, they can leave them with me. Then, Ms. Rosaria or I will put the order in at Good Hunter.
Valerina: I'm not running this place to make a profit, so the prices for ordering takeout will be the same as getting it straight from the restaurant.
Paimon: W—Wait, you're not even charging them for the delivery fee?
Paimon: I'm sure our guests will be thrilled to be able enjoy delicious food at the original price while playing with cats!
Valerina: Right? Even you think it's a great idea, don't ya, Cat Whisperer?
Valerina: Once the Fortress officially opens, this can be one of its selling points!
Valerina: The more people we attract, the more likely the cats are to find a suitable owner. Once the number of visitors and the rate at which I adopt cats reaches a nice balance, I'll consider expanding the scale of our operations.
Valerina: Once that happens, we'll be able to add a management area, and areas in which other stray animals can be adopted...
Valerina: Though that's an issue I'll have to plan out in the future. Just leave the business operations and data gathering to me. Don't sweat that stuff!
Traveler: No worries, we know you're busy!
Valerina: Hah, not as busy as you, I expect! Why, I should watch the two of you work more if anything!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm, you know... We've encountered a lot of interesting animals lately!
Paimon: But they're not exactly the types of animals you can play with. They're either super big or super... wet. Anyway, Paimon wants to play with something small, cute, and cuddly. Ooh, like a cat!
Paimon: #How about we head to The Cat's Tail in Mondstadt and have a look around, Traveler?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Oh, it's just a regular house. Gotta say, Paimon was expecting something a little bigger with "Fortress" in the name and everything.
Valerina: This was the biggest space I could find in the city over the past few weeks. The rent is cheap, so that's a plus. A half a year's worth of rent along with all the Cat's Tail-inspired furnishings only cost me a few million Mora.
Valerina: Of course, not all of the cats will be staying indefinitely. We plan to offer some of the healthy ones up for adoption. As long as the new future owners prove capable and the cat seems like a good fit, they're welcome to take their new pet back to a loving home!
Valerina: This location is definitely good enough. We could even expand the business one day and start sheltering stray dogs, foxes, or even squirrels! When that day comes, though, I'll probably have to think of a different name. Hmm, maybe the "Furball and Friends Fortress" would be a better fit, haha.
Rosaria: I would suggest letting all of this play out first. You still don't know if the customers will even get along with the strays.
Paimon: Huh? Look over there! That cat is staring at us...
Valerina: Oh, it's the little white cat! She's super afraid of people. She ran away when we tried to give her a bath. It took us forever to track her down again.
Paimon: She looks so soft and clean, and her fur is so white and fluffy, just like fresh fallen snow. Wait, that's perfect! We should call her "Snowball"!
Traveler: "Tofu" would also be a good fit!
Snowball: Meow~ meow~!
Paimon: #Those are also some good names, Traveler, but Paimon thinks she likes "Snowball" best!
Paimon: Here, kitty kitty. That's it, Snowball! Good kitty. That's a good kitty...
Valerina: I—It's been, what, a minute? And you already got the cat to listen to you! Did you see that, Miss Rosaria? She's practically a miracle worker! You really are a cat whisperer...
Paimon: That was nothing! They may be strays, but as long as you give them a good name and call on them with love, you're sure to gain their trust eventually!
Paimon: First things first, though, you gotta pay attention to the way you interact with them. Hmm, how should Paimon put it... Basically, it all comes down to your demeanor!
Paimon: For example, you can't just stand there trembling in fear, Valerina. If you're afraid, the cats are sure to become afraid as well! As for you, Rosaria, you might want to keep an eye on your, uh... facial expressions...
Rosaria: These poor creatures, picked up off the streets, given a name... and they now have a loving home. Fate is kind to even the lost souls who have wandered astray...
Rosaria: This city really has brought peace and happiness to us all.
Snowball: Meow!
Valerina: Hey, Snowball is snuggling up to Rosaria! Looks like she's not afraid of her anymore!
Paimon: (Did Rosaria just... smile?)
Traveler: (I saw it too!)
Rosaria: No matter. There are more important things to focus on.
Rosaria: Anyway, it's getting a bit stuffy in here. I'm going to go get some air. Call me if you need me.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon thought Rosaria would be happier about that...
Valerina: Please teach me more of your ways, Honorary Knight! And you too, o great cat whisperer!
Valerina: We're sure to get more and more strays coming to the "Furball Fortress," and I doubt all of them will be as friendly as Snowball. There's still so much I don't know about interacting with them...
Paimon: No problem! Just watch and learn!
Paimon: It's about time we move on to a more advanced lesson — how to get the cats not to just trust you, but to like you!
Paimon: It's all about patience! As long as you put in the effort to get to know them, you'll become best friends in no time!
Valerina: I completely understand! The Furball Fortress is still in its trial phase, so the more I can learn at this stage, the better!
Traveler: (We should pretend like we didn't see anything!)
Traveler: "Pudding" isn't a bad choice either!
