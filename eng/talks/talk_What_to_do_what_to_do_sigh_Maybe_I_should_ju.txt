Ulman: What to do, what to do... *sigh* Maybe I should just go straight back to Mondstadt...
Ulman: It's been so long that I've forgotten even the taste of Dandelion Wine...
Traveler: Show me what you've got.
Ulman: Sure, have a look!
Traveler: See you.
Ulman: See you next time! I've got a feeling we'll be working together again in the future. I'll be counting on you when the time comes!
