# Gilded Tajine

A stewed meat dish. The unique hat-shaped pot cover is capable of reducing the amount of moisture lost during the stewing process â€” a culinary secret known only to the desert folk. This delicious delicacy has followed the gilded Eremites all over Sumeru, and thus did it gain its name and fame.
