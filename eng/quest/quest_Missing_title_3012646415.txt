## Talk 1

Hanayama Kaoru: Oh no...what now...
Traveler: What happened?
Hanayama Kaoru: Hey...I'm so glad you're here... It's like this, after you gave me the flower seeds, I started planting flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: But before I could plant much, a group of monsters suddenly appeared and kept loitering around the place where I was going to plant the flowers. I no longer dare to go over to plant them.
Hanayama Kaoru: If they continue to remain here, they may destroy the place where the flowers were planted...
Hanayama Kaoru: If you don't mind, could you go and get rid of those monsters for me? I... I just want to plant flowers...
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Hanayama Kaoru: You said yes? Thank you so much! I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Why are you so determined on growing flowers?
Hanayama Kaoru: I was thinking, the reason why people don't want to come back to Tatarasuna is because they are worried that this place is no longer suitable for living after the Mikage Furnace incident happened...
Hanayama Kaoru: I can't persuade everyone one by one, but if I can plant a lot of beautiful flowers here again...
Hanayama Kaoru: Maybe it will be enough to convince everyone that Tatarasuna is already safe.
Hanayama Kaoru: And...heh, besides planting flowers, I have no other means to convince people...
Hanayama Kaoru: So please, please help me to chase away those monsters!
