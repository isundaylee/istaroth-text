# The Story of "the Princess" and "the Adventure Team"


## Talk 1

Paimon: Weren't we just flying up into the sky in a bubble?
???: Yes, we were.
Paimon: And we kept going up, and up, and up, until we crashed headfirst into the water, right?
???: Yes. Is there something wrong?
Paimon: Uh, there's so much wrong with this that Paimon doesn't even know where to start...
Traveler: Perhaps this is just one of the kingdom's magical aspects.
Paimon: Ugh. You know what? Paimon's just not gonna ask! The Princess's treasure should be around here somewhere, right?
???: Yes. It is there, protected by a three-layered seal.
Paimon: Where? Oh, you mean that? Hmm, while that outer bubble is pretty big, the treasure seems to be inside a really small chest.
Paimon: And it looks like there are some threads of flowing water connected to the big bubble...
???: It seems as if the Bubble Formation here will not attack us. Hmm, in that case, let's use it to break the seals!
???: We just need to <color=#00E1FFFF>guide its projectiles to the bubble rings connected to the flowing water</color>. That should transfer the force of the projectile through the water and weaken the seals.
Paimon: Yeah, those bubbles are pretty scary...
Paimon: One, two, three... Looks like there are <color=#00E1FFFF>three strands of water</color>. Once we deal with them, the treasure should be ours!
???: #That's right. It's in your hands, Knight {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: No one wishes to have their soul weighed down by gravity.

## Talk 2

???: We've finally found it... The most precious of treasures...
Paimon: It looks like a pocketwatch.
Traveler: Seems like it's not moving anymore...
Paimon: Well, it has been in water all this time, so it should've broken down long ago, right?
???: This is... full of Princess Lyris's precious time.
???: ...
???: Let's go back to the tower and meet up with our friends.

## Talk 3

Petit Chou: You're back!
Al: Colonel Kate and Mori linked up with us while you were out.
Paimon: Hehe. We're back with the Princess's treasure!
Colonel Kate: Well done, soldier! You've made a fine contribution. The Resistance Front is proud of you!
Al: Kate, now isn't the time...
Jak: #Not so fast, "Colonel." {NICKNAME} is a contact of the Orchestre, not cannon-fodder from some no-name army.
Colonel Kate: #Ha! Your orchestra couldn't hold {NICKNAME}. Not unless you wanted to name it after {M#him}{F#her} instead!
Jak: #Hmph! And what of your rank? You may as well give it to {NICKNAME}, no?
Jak: The soldiers bleed while commanders steal the glory. This is quite ordinary. But you, now you're special! A "colonel" who not only does nothing, but even lets his troops take credit for victory!
Colonel Kate: You...! While you were whiling your time away here, I was taking out the Bubble Formations in the waters above. If not for that, they would not have gained the treasure so easily!
Traveler: Stop fighting over me, all of you!
Paimon: Wow, you sound like a female protagonist in a novel! Well, uh, how about this? Let's just call the organizations Colonel Paimon's Resistance Front and the Orchestre Paimon!
Paimon: ?
Ann: Ugh! That's it, I'm done! Mori, get him!
Mori: Woof, woof! Bad person!
Black Screen Text: Mori bowls Jak over.\n\n
Black Screen Text: Mori bowls Jak over.\nKate laughs at him...\nOnly to also be knocked over by Mori.
Black Screen Text: The altercation is eventually calmed by Al and Petit Chou's mediation.
Ann: Honestly...
Paimon: Mori's really reliable at times like this, uh... Y'know, in some ways...
Traveler: Let's get to business, shall we?
Paimon: That's right! We'll get nowhere if we keep arguing, and the more we go nowhere, the more we're gonna argue...
Ann: Yes... You're both right.
Paimon: Let's have a speech then, Ann! Y'know, the rousing kind!
Ann: Eh? But...
Al: I approve of Paimon's suggestion. Is it not at such times that an adventure team's leader should step up to the plate?
Ann: But I'm not good at speeches... and can you really call me the "leader"...?
Colonel Kate: As surely as I am a colonel, I affirm that you would be the best officer for this adventure team.
Jak: My views on the title of "Colonel" aside, we are in accord.
Petit Chou: #I... I don't know much about leaders, or glory, or whatever, but if not for you, and if not for {NICKNAME} and Paimon, whom you brought here, I don't know what would've become of me...
Ann: ...
Ann: #Knight {NICKNAME}, Paimon, what do you say?
Traveler: This is what everyone wants.
Ann: Hmm... Well, in that case, what should a leader say in times like this?
Paimon: Let Paimon think... Since we have Princess Lyris's treasure, next, we just need to enter the tower and rescue her, right?
Paimon: So you just need to encourage everyone to do just that before we start.
Ann: ...
Ann: #Paimon, do you have any interest in being leader? How about you, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Hey, hey, you can't do that!
Ann: Why not? If not for your strength, we wouldn't have made it this far...
Traveler: We're just here to support you.
Paimon: Whatever the case, only you can be the leader of this adventure team. That's what everyone wants, so stop trying to push it off to someone else!
Paimon: We'll support you!
Ann: Ohh, alright, alright! Ugh, this "leader" business used to be so much easier...
Ann: Ahem.
Ann: No matter what the name of our organization is, we're all part of the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team. We have a common goal, to rescue Princess Lyris...
Jak: Ms. Lyris.
Ann: ...Or Ms. Lyris, and we intend to save the Narzissenkreuz Kingdom...
Jak: Republic...
Mori: *growls threateningly*
Jak: *cough* Please continue, Ann.
Ann: And restore the land and waters here to their original gleaming shimmer through the Reconquista, so that the sunflowers may once more flourish. Am I not right about that?
Paimon: That's right!
Ann: We've experienced many battles and partings during the long years of conflict, and many team members we once had are no longer with us.
Ann: But I won't forget the times we spent together. We'll always be friends.
Ann: That's right. Even if I am our leader, I am everyone's friend first and foremost.
Ann: The same goes for you, Colonel Kate, Jak. Don't forget your friendship over differences in ideals and perspectives.
Paimon: (Ann's being super mature right now, huh?)
Traveler: Bravo! *applauds*
Paimon: Bravo!
Ann: Come on, stop teasing me!
Ann: #With Knight {NICKNAME} and Paimon's aid, we were finally able to obtain the Princess's treasure. Time that was once frozen will flow again, and we will rescue her.
Ann: #For that, {NICKNAME} and Paimon, I thank you. You will always be our friends. I believe that our Princess would also be glad to call you such.
Ann: O—Okay, I'm done now...
Paimon: Bravo!
Traveler: Bravo! *applauds*
Paimon: Nice! Alright. What do we do next?
Ann: Well now... I think it's time to unleash the treasure's power on the stagnant tower. This way, its "time" should flow once more.
Traveler: Like this?
Petit Chou: Whoa...
Al: #My thanks, {NICKNAME}. Now...
Al: Unfortunately, I fear that none of us{RUBY#[S]Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team} know what will happen next.
Petit Chou: But since the Princess's tower has been unsealed, we should move as soon as we can, right?
Ann: Right you are, Petit Chou. Let's go!
Traveler: Aye, what next?
Traveler: (That can't have been easy.)
Traveler: I'm not going to overstep on what's been a relaxing time so far.
Traveler: Wouldn't that make me a "Grand Master" of sorts?
Traveler: Eh, that seems tiring. Forget it.
Paimon: If you do become one someday, don't forget to make Paimon an Honorary Knight!
Paimon: Hehe, now that's a title Paimon can get behind!
Traveler: This is between you and them.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME} means that since everyone says so, you should just accept!
Traveler: I've heard enough. See you around.
Traveler: Let's get this straight first. I didn't join any of you...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Why do Narcissus's little minions all need so many titles?
Jak: The more useless the person, the more hats they need.
Al: Actually, they are mighty warriors who have caused us much harm during previous engagements. If the battle seemed easy, it was due to your great might.
Ann: #Sorry, Knight {NICKNAME}, but our attacks can do nothing against these henchmen, so it is all up to you.
Traveler: Easy-peasy.
Paimon: ...Y'know, where is Princess Lyris? Doesn't look like there's any path ahead.
Ann: To be honest, I didn't think this far either...
Ann: Let's... keep going up, shall we?
Paimon: How do we do that?
Traveler: You can fly up there, Paimon.
Paimon: Well, even if Paimon could do that... What would she do if she encountered Narcissus's minions?
Paimon: And even if all the kingdom's treasures were up there... It would only feel like we found them if you were there, too!
Al: Go up, you say... Ah, I understand. We do, one and all, have a certain amount of power. It is all magic given to us by the Princess, yes, but we can do some things with it.
Ann: But if we do...
Jak: We were all born from the same source. I don't see why you would be unable to understand and accept this. Has this not happened before?
Ann: I know, I know all this... in theory. But I just hate these things. I don't know why, but I just do.
Petit Chou: Don't make such a face, Ann. We were born from the same waters, and we are only this way because...
Petit Chou: We bound ourselves into different shapes using thin films to keep the Princess company. Coming together once again for her sake is not strange at all!
Paimon: Wait. What are you all talking about?
Al: As long as we forsake our forms and join together, we can produce greater magic. This way, we can send you to the tower's apex.
Paimon: Wait, but if you do that—
Al: You need not worry, friend. We came from the same body of water, so giving up our forms is not the same as what you would call "death." Pure waters can turn into creatures of all sorts, and such changes do not only go one way.
Petit Chou: Yup! Even if we cannot adventure or fight alongside you, we can still progress together!
Ann: ...
Ann: #Knight {NICKNAME}, Paimon, what do you say?
Traveler: This is not our decision to make.
Traveler: Only you can decide what your adventure team will do.
Paimon: #You're right, {NICKNAME}, but...
Colonel Kate: Give us our orders, ma'am! The tower seals have been broken, which means they can no longer hold Narcissus back. Every moment counts!
Ann: Alright. I'm counting on you all.
Colonel Kate: Orders received!
Petit Chou: #Leave it to us! Go with {NICKNAME} and Paimon, Ann. Make sure you save the Princess!
Jak: Hmph. I leave Ms. Lyris in your hands.
Al: In that case, dear Petit Chou...
Al: Mori, Colonel Kate, and Jak...
Mori: Okay. Bye-bye.
Paimon: Ah, it's just like what happened at Mori's fountain...
Ann: Our power is derived from the Princess. If so resolved, we can manifest it once more...
Ann: #Ugh. Pull yourself together, Ann! Let's go, Knight {NICKNAME}, Paimon!
Traveler: Only you can decide whether we proceed or not.
Traveler: This is your story.
Traveler: Bit of a close shave, I'd say.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hmm? It's just a portal... Where does this one lead, though?
Ann: Hmm... I'm not sure either, to be honest. I have never considered what would happen after we entered the tower.
Paimon: Huh. Oh well. In that case, let's proceed with caution.
Traveler: With more proceeding or more caution?
Paimon: Come on! Both!
Ann: Yes. We should be careful. We're the only ones the Princess can rely on.
Traveler: Let's see what's on the other side.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...
Traveler: Is this a library?
Ann: This place... This library has existed since long, long before we arrived.
Ann: Their contents seem to be ancient dramas. Children love to read books, but there is much they won't understand, so they will often ask adults to read the stories to them.
Ann: In the books, where there is an evil dragon, there must be heroes who hunt the dragon. If there is a mage, there must be a wandering knight. The Reconquista must come to pass, and the princess must be saved.
Ann: And of course, a chime will sound, and the tale of adventure will come to a halt.
Ann: Yet it will not end. There will be another adventure, and another, and another one after that, until the children grow up and leave this place.
Paimon: Ann?
Ann: Huh? I... Sorry, it felt like memories and feelings suddenly... flooded into my mind. How strange.
Paimon: Huh. Well, as long as you're alright... Paimon thought you might have been bewitched by Narcissus's magic or something!
Ann: Urk. That might actually be so!
Paimon: Hmmm... Well, what do we do next?
Ann: I'm not sure either...
Traveler: Whatever the case, let's have a look around.
Paimon: Yup. First off... Huh, there's a door over there, but it looks like there's no way through it.
Traveler: You two should be able to get across.
Paimon: Hey, you're Ann's knight right now, you know. This will all be pointless if you don't come along!
Ann: That's right!
Paimon: This tile sticks out like a sore thumb...
Traveler: This might be some sort of path.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know either... But let's go, all the same!
Traveler: This might be a trap...
Traveler: Is this a bookstore?
Paimon: What makes you think there'd be secret underground bookstore ruins anywhere in Fontaine?
