Traveler: About Swords
Paimon: #Traveler, have you noticed?
Paimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.
Paimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?
Paimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!
Traveler: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.
Paimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?
Traveler: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.
Paimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!
Paimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?
Traveler: Well, at least it's the right size for you...
Traveler: Ahem, "What matters isn't the value of the sword..."
Paimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!
Traveler: "It's the fighting spirit."
