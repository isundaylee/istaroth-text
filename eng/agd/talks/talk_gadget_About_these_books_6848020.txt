Traveler: About these books...
Osse: Fascinating, no? These books have all been infused with the mysterious power of the "symphony." They can be activated using the melodies of the music box.
Osse: Well done. It looks as if you can now skillfully manipulate this musical might. I was right to put my faith in you.
Osse: There are many books like this one in the castle. Back in the day...
Osse: Nay, let us not dwell on the past. I believe you are fully capable of discovering the mysteries within.
