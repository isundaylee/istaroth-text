# Sacred Seal: Ceremony

A stone plate with ancient text on it that seems to have once been part of a certain building. The desert sands play host to many an unknown wish. Who made them, and who carries them now? The original meaning of this symbol was most likely "sacrifice," with an extended meaning of "rites" or "ceremonies" emerging later.
