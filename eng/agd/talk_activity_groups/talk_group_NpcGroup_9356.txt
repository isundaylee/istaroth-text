Nahida: I don't much like spending time in places where there's nothing to do. It's like looking at a blank page in a book.
Nahida: But since you're here, maybe we can liven things up a little to make this time more meaningful.
Nahida: Like... Ooh, we could share some stories with each other before we set off again.

Nahida: I'm really curious to know what's at the end of this maze, too.
Nahida: And yes, I know that as we go further in, we're bound to meet tougher and tougher monsters, and maybe even suffer some setbacks along the way.
Nahida: But after the winds and rain have passed, the saplings in the forest grow a little bigger and a little stronger. We'll only get to see the blue sky above the treetops if we keep pressing on, right?

Nahida: Children have all sorts of wonderful dreams, with more colors than even the feathers of the Dusk Bird.
Nahida: But once they grow up, their once-vibrant dreams slowly begin to fade.
Nahida: Luckily, we can use the written word to make a record of our dreams before they disappear. Maybe, when it comes down to it, that's what fairytales are.
