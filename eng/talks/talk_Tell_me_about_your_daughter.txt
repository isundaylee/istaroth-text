Traveler: Tell me about your daughter.
Jiayi: Her name's Little Liu. My wife sadly passed away in childbirth, so it's the grandparents who look after her now.
Jiayi: She's still very young. I haven't a clue how to explain this to her... So I just lie, and say that her mother has always been working in Liyue Harbor...
Jiayi: *sigh* I haven't seen her in a good long while since coming to Liyue on my own for work. The last time I held her in my arms, she was nowhere close to the weight of this polearm...
Jiayi: Is she eating her dinner?
Jiayi: Is she in good health?
Jiayi: Is she making lots of nice friends?
Jiayi: *sigh* Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...
