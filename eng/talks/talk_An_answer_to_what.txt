Traveler: An answer to what?
Idhari: The biggest problem before me, the answer I seek is... Yes, it is The Withering.
Idhari: The issue of The Withering has been growing in severity lately, and it's spreading even more rapidly and further now.
Idhari: There aren't many who have Visions, so relying on them to resolve it won't really work.
Idhari: So, it's my time to shine. It's my time to eliminate The Withering from its source!
Idhari: Hehe, my reputation in the Akademiya will definitely rise once I've resolved such a major problem, and I may even get to be a sage!
