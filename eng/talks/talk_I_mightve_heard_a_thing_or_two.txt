# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I might've heard a thing or two.
Ramiz: Ooh! That means you must've read the "Aranara" picture book series too, right?
Ramiz: Setaria brought me lots and lots of those books so that I can read them and learn words at the same time.
Ramiz: I thought that I might have trouble understanding them, but turns out that this stuff is super interesting!
Ramiz: I just, uh... Sometimes, I get too excited to see the ending and read too fast, so I end up forgetting to record some words that I don't know yet...
Ramiz: I'll ask Setaria the next time I see her, though!
