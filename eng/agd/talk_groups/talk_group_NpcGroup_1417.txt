## Talk 2

Wagner: Okay, I've got other things to do...

## Talk 3

Wagner: What? You look surprised. Never seen a blacksmith play cards before?

## Talk 4

Wagner: Whoa... for you to be able to catch such a small mistake...

## Talk 5

Wagner: It seems I'm good with cards as well as a hammer and anvil. Hahaha!

## Talk 6

Wagner: Traveler, do you have a moment?
Traveler: What is it?
Wagner: Have you heard of Stormterror's Lair? It's those ruins outside Mondstadt.
Wagner: While Stormterror made the place his home, it was shrouded in a whirling, impassable storm. No one could pass through, so the precious crystal ore in there hasn't been mined.
Wagner: I've heard people say that the storm around the area has disappeared. That should have been a prime moment to go for the ore veins...
Wagner: ...But with so many places in the city needing repairs, our smithy's services are in high demand. Schulz can't hold the fort down alone either, so I can't leave.
Wagner: What say you go have a look, Traveler? If you find any crystal ore, bring some back with you.

Traveler: I'm on the case.
Wagner: My thanks. These crystal ores should help in forging and in restoring the city as well...

### Talk 6 related talk 1

Traveler: I have other things to do...
Wagner: That's no issue. We aren't in a rush. When I have time, I'll check it out myself.

## Talk 9

Wagner: Can I help you?

### Talk 9 related talk 0

Wagner: I'm trying to find out about the "Darknight Hero."
Wagner: I haven't seen any "Darknight Hero" around here.
Wagner: I'll tell you what though, if he's purchasing his weapons from someplace else, he doesn't know what's good for him.

### Talk 9 related talk 1

Traveler: So, about the ores...
Wagner: There's still much work to be done. I need to put my back into it...

### Talk 9 related talk 2

Wagner: What do you have to sell?
Wagner: Take your pick. You'll find no second-rate items at Wagner's.

### Talk 9 related talk 3

Traveler: I'd like something made.
Wagner: Did you bring the materials? Let me have a look.

### Talk 9 related talk 4

Traveler: *I'd like something made.*
Wagner: That reminds me — your order from last time is ready. Is that what you wanted, or is this a new request?

### Talk 9 related talk 5

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

### Talk 9 related talk 6

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Wagner: There's nothing to be said. Dragon or no dragon, I'll be here.
Wagner: As long as there's life in me, the fires of Wagner's smithy will not go out.
Wagner: Smithing is not dependent on brute strength. You need the sweat on your brow from constant hard work, and perseverance stronger than the metals we forge!
Wagner: The tempest is precisely the time to practice perseverance. If one were to be terrified at a little wind, then forging a respectable weapon is simply out of the question!

### Talk 9 related talk 7

Traveler: Any tips on finding ore in Mondstadt?

### Talk 9 related talk 8

Traveler: I'd like to ask about something.
Wagner: Well, spit it out already.
Traveler: How good is this smithy?
Wagner: Stupid question. If you really want to know, buy something.
Wagner: Talk is cheap. Pick up a blade and you'll soon know.
Wagner: If even this much eludes you, then you've got a long road ahead of you, runt.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself.
Wagner: There are no other qualified blacksmiths here, except for me and my apprentice, Schulz.
Wagner: I can tell you from experience that hard work is all there is to the craft! Many other "blacksmiths" out there are just out to make a quick mora!
Wagner: Family? Inheritance? Meaningless! I only need an apprentice to pass on my skills.

### Talk 9 related talk 9

Traveler: Goodbye.
Wagner: If there's nothing else, get going. I'm busy.

### Talk 14 related talk 4

Traveler: Aren't you going to find shelter?
Wagner: Shelter? It'd take a much bigger storm than this to keep me away from my blacksmith's...
Wagner: The wrought iron here spends all day getting hammered into shape.
Wagner: People, on the other hand, don't get that chance as often — so make the most of it.

## Talk 18

Traveler: Any tips on finding ore in Mondstadt?

### Talk 18 related talk 0

Wagner: Nope.
Wagner: Not if you've already exhausted the sources I told you about.
Wagner: If you're that desperate for more, I'm sorry but that's your problem. We can discuss it another time, but I'm busy right now.

### Talk 18 related talk 1

Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I do know a few spots, having been in the trade this long. Never had the time to check them out myself is all.
Wagner: Tell you what, I'll mark out the locations for you — just make sure you come to me when you need any forging done, got it? Give me your map...
Wagner: ...Right, done. Crystal Ore deposits all marked out for you. Don't make me regret telling you.

### Talk 18 related talk 2

Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I did in fact come across some odd-looking Crystal Ore recently. It's called Magical Crystal Ore and it's a lot more powerful than your regular ore.
Wagner: I, for one, don't have the skill to deal with that kind of power. It could be that it takes more than the work of a smith to process that kind of thing.
Wagner: ...I've marked a few locations of Magical Crystal Ore on your map. Go fetch some and see what you make of it.
Wagner: You must let me know if you figure out how to make use of it... I can't stand being shown up as a blacksmith by a bunch of stupid rocks.
