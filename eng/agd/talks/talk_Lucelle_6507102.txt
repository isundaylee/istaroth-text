Traveler: Lucelle?
Hugues: *sigh* An old companion of mine. It could have lived free after I modified it, but then they took it away from me.
Hugues: There was no time to take anything back, because they then gave me a new workplace â€” the Fortress of Meropide.
Hugues: By the way, before Lucelle belonged to me, it was a Gardemek with the Gardes.
Hugues: It didn't resist when I modified it, so I took that as consent.
