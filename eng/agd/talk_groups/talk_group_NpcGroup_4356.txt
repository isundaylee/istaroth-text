Traveler: Are you looking for someone?
Aybak: Yes.
Aybak: ...Ah, please don't get me wrong. Safie isn't my real sister, it's because we're a very close-knit group, so we call each other brother and sister.
Aybak: Our group just received a few new commissions, and one of them really suits her. But she's nowhere to be found... I guess she wandered off somewhere again.

Traveler: Why don't you do it yourself?
Aybak: Haha, that won't be necessary. We're not that shorthanded.
Aybak: I'm the leader of the Eremites in Caravan Ribat. It's best if I stay to supervise public safety here and carry out the maintenance of the Wall of Samiel.
Aybak: Those are basic orders from the Akademiya, and I can deal with them on my own.
Aybak: As for the other commissions, my brothers and sisters can see to them. If all of us can make money, we'll live happily together.

Traveler: Need my help?
Aybak: It's okay. It's not an emergency. No need to bother anyone else.
Aybak: And she should be able to take care of herself on her own.
Aybak: But you, you'd better watch yourself. In this place, quite a lot of people come and go... if you know what I mean.
