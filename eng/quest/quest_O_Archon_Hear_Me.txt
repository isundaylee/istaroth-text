# O Archon, Hear Me!


## Talk 1

Shouta: Lacquerware... how do you make those...
Traveler: Why do you need lacquerware?
Shouta: #Oh, it's you, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. So here's the thing. Have you ever heard of a shrine's divine intervention?
Shouta: From what I've heard, if you give precious offerings to the shrine, maybe your wishes will come true.
Shouta: I think that pretty lacquerware is very valuable. If I used those as offerings to the shrine, then I'd be sure to get a reply.
Shouta: However, I don't have money to buy any lacquerware. That's why I want to make one for myself.
Shouta: I heard that Nanatsuki from Yayoi Lacquerware is very good at making them...
Shouta: #Could you go ask her about the lacquerware, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}?
Traveler: No problem. Let's go.
Shouta: #Thank you, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}!
Traveler: Not going yourself?
Shouta: Nanatsuki is pretty serious most of the time. I don't have the guts to go ask for her help myself...
Shouta: #But if you're with me, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}, things will probably go better...

## Talk 2

Yayoi Nanatsuki: Hello, is there anything I can help you with?
Shouta: Uhh... so...
Traveler: So, he wants to ask about lacquerware...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Ah, so you want to offer lacquerwares to the shrine, and you want to make one yourself?
Shouta: Please, Nanatsuki. I have a wish that I want to have fulfilled! That's why I... Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about your secret formula!
Yayoi Nanatsuki: The issue is not the painting formula. If you want to make beautiful lacquerware, leaving the paint aside, you also need a long period of practice.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: And this isn't just about time, it's more about... the capital. I am the fourth generation successor to a family of lacquerware-makers.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: I even traveled to Sumeru to study lacquerwares. So it's impossible for you to grasp lacquerwares overnight.
Shouta: Is... is that so? But I can't really think of anything else to offer to the shrine...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: In my opinion, it's not about the value of the item being offered to the shrine. This item you offer should represent your feelings.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: As long as you have the right feelings and intentions, and offer your favorite items, you should be able to get a response from the archons.
Shouta: Right feelings and intentions... the things that I like...
Shouta: Hmm, I think I get it... and I also don't. But thank you anyway, Nanatsuki.
Shouta: #Let's go back to the shrine first, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. I still need your help with figuring out the kind of things I want to offer.

## Talk 3

Shouta: I mean, Nanatsuki said that I should, didn't she? But what should I offer, exactly...
Shouta: Speaking of things that I like, it's gotta be Tricolor Dango. I love them so much...
Shouta: But would it be disrespectful to offer Tricolor Dango? I offered Konpeito Candy before as well, but I got no reply.
Shouta: I've also heard that some people will pack fresh petals into sachets and offer those. That sounds more appropriate than Dango...
Shouta: #What should we do? What do you think we should offer, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}?

## Talk 4

Traveler: It's better that we offer one of those sachets.
Shouta: Okay. Let's go with your idea!
Shouta: O Archon, bless me and help my wishes come true...
Shouta: #Thank you for staying with me until now, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. Please have these. They're for you!
Shouta: I'll come back here tomorrow to check again. I hope that I'll receive a reply...

## Talk 5

Traveler: Let's go with Tricolor Dango.
Shouta: Really? Okay! I happened to have brought one with me. My mom made it for me and I haven't even eaten it yet...
Shouta: Let's offer it up, then!
Shouta: O Archon, bless me and help my wishes come true...
Shouta: #Thank you for staying with me until now, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. Please have these. They're for you!
Shouta: I'll come back here tomorrow to check again. I hope that I'll receive a reply...
