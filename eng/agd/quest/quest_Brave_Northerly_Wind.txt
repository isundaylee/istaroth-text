# "Brave Northerly Wind"

Clanche: Ah, two more brave warriors step up to the plate! Are you here to play Boreal Flurry?
Clanche: Come then, right this way! I'm looking forward to witnessing your unmatched powers of flight!
Traveler: Whoa, cool it!
Clanche: One needn't keep cool to fly, dear guest, not at all!
Clanche: A cool head will merely dull your sense of the wind â€” only one who faces the wild wind utterly unprepared may uncover their true potential.
Clanche: Flying squirrels nowadays are far too timid! They've utterly forgotten the lessons taught by the "Brave Northerly Wind"!
Clanche: They stand in safe spots and declaim the courage of leaves that dance in the wind, yet are far too frightened to leap into its embrace themselves.
Clanche: How can we protect the kingdom alongside Her Highness if things keep going this way? Ludicrous! Ludicrous, I say!
Paimon: Man, this flying squirrel sure is the energetic type...
Traveler: Looks like he really loves flying.
Clanche: And that's why I found myself a passage with especially intense wind currents, and set up all sorts of devices inside it.
Clanche: Only the bravest, the boldest, and the most bellicose in flight shall best its course.
Clanche: Do you have the required courage, dear guests?
Traveler: I'll have a right go at it!
Clanche: Excellent! Follow me, then! The passage is not far from here!
Traveler: Well... I've got other things to do...
Clanche: Oh? Still need some time to prepare, then? Fret not, I shall wait here.
Clanche: Come back whenever you'd like to brave this windy passage.
Traveler: I haven't said anything yet!
