Madiha: My most important partners, you're back! How did the Barking Fox's controls feel to you? Was the flight envelope broad enough?
Traveler: Haha, it's pretty impressive!
Paimon: The Barking Fox wasn't difficult to control at all! It was actually pretty fun! But about that technical jargon of yours... Paimon doesn't know how to answer that!
Madiha: Hmm... Your response would be best classified into the "user could not accurately describe their feedback" category — but that's pretty common and not a big deal at all!
Madiha: No matter how many tries it takes, as long as you complete the test challenges without making personal modifications to the Barking Fox, then its flight performance is at the expected level!
Paimon: Personal modifications?
Paimon: #That sounds complicated! Traveler doesn't understand anything like that either!
Traveler: I can learn. For Paimon.
Paimon: Pass! Paimon doesn't fight monsters in the sky, so speed is useless to Paimon!
Paimon: And if Paimon is too fast, you'll never be able to keep up!
Paimon: Even if Paimon races ahead and waits for you, you'll have no one to talk to, eat with, or enjoy the scenery with while catching up... And that sounds really sad!
Paimon: What's the point if we can't travel together!?
Traveler: Exactly!
Madiha: You were presented with the chance to speed through the air, yet you refuse to move forward without your companion... Ohh, I feel deeply moved by your conversation!
Madiha: How about you two invest a bit more in me...? Hmm, yes, I think around 60 million Mora should do it!
Madiha: I can develop... an assistive propulsion jetpack for your wind glider, and create a miniature version for you!
Madiha: It will only take a little over a decade or so! Once it's done, you can zoom through the sky together!
Paimon: Eek! How did this suddenly become about Mora!? And not only are you asking us for so much, you also want us to wait a decade!?
Paimon: You just barely finished a small flying toy, and now you're talking about a huge device to help people fly? Can you really do that?
Madiha: Of course! Just put your trust in me, the Phantom Toy Master!
Traveler: Then we'll use our share of the profits as the deposit!
Paimon: That's a great idea! Madiha said the Barking Fox will sell really well, so earning a mountain of Mora should be a piece of cake!
Paimon: *ahem* Phantom Toy Master, we're your most important partners! You said the Barking Fox will sell really well, and we have such a huge cut...
Paimon: Maybe you'll be the one owing us 60 million Mora next year... maybe even more!
Paimon: #But the proof's in the pudding! Make us prototypes first, and if Paimon and Traveler are satisfied, we'll consider reducing the amount you owe us!
Madiha: Y-You're actually using business lingo to respond in kind! Curses!
Madiha: Th-Then we'll wait until the Barking Fox goes on sale and see how it does! There's no need to worry!
Madiha: Don't worry about what I just said! In fact, if you just forget about it, that's fine by me!
Traveler: Make a prototype first, then we can talk about investing!
Traveler: *sobs* Paimon would never abandon me!
Traveler: I'll make Paimon a jetpack!
Traveler: It wasn't good enough!
Paimon: Huh? Really? Paimon thought it was okay...
Paimon: #Looks like Traveler's become a harsh critic after testing so many people's inventions.
Madiha: Negative feedback!? I can't believe it... Could you please tell me what's wrong?
Traveler: It's too slow...
Madiha: Ugh, I should have expected this. Demanding users who can't even describe their problem... I don't know where to start...
Madiha: I have to make sure our advertisements don't target such customers...
Madiha: Uh... *ahem* That's not what I meant! Anyway, let me have a look myself! And thank you for your feedback!
Traveler: It isn't maneuverable enough...
Traveler: I dunno, but it just isn't good...
Traveler: Maybe we should talk about you instead...
Paimon: Oh, right! If you call yourself the Phantom Toy Master, you must have really amazing... um... design experience? Is that how you say it?
Paimon: And you seem to know all about... investments? You're always talking about huge sums of Mora! You must have made a ton of money before!
Madiha: Uh! Um! Ah!
Madiha: E—Emotional damage!
Paimon: What's wrong!? You look like you're about to die of pain!
Madiha: No! I will never die of anguish! If I am to die... I will die extremely wealthy, due to overindulging in every luxury imaginable!
Madiha: Only the regret of missing out on a business opportunity can harm me! I even survived traveling on foot in the desert... for three whole months!
Madiha: Those awful debt collectors who forced me to flee into the desert will never understand! But mark my words, my innovations will one day be turned into Mora!
Traveler: So you owe a lot of money.
Madiha: No! Don't say such vulgar things! I just... I just had a lot of... unexpected expenses due to trial and error while exploring the boundlessly fantastical secrets of toys!
Paimon: Paimon finally understands Madiha's situation... and what "Phantom Toy Master" actually means...
Madiha: You two have good instincts when it comes to people! You were willing to partner with me and provide a long-term source of capital... You'll definitely get a thousand percent return once I rise to the top!
Madiha: So why don't we take this opportunity to give our future toy empire an additional boost...
Paimon: Stop right there! If you ask us for money, we won't give you any!
Traveler: Not a single Mora!
Paimon: That's right! We're super broke!
Paimon: Okay, we shouldn't say that... it's not that bad! But we have a really long journey ahead of us, and we have no idea how much Mora it'll cost!
Paimon: After all, we worked hard and took a long time to earn our Mora, and we would have been starving on the streets long ago if we gave it away to just anyone...
Madiha: Wow... Such cautious investors! Does this mean funding is drying up again...? But that's fine!
Madiha: Just don't regret it! The earlier you invest, the higher your cut! The minimum investment will be much higher in the future!
Traveler: We're very poor!
Traveler: You're under a mountain of debt.
Traveler: Goodbye for now!
Madiha: Huh!? You still haven't gotten enough? That means flying the Barking Fox is really fun! That's great! It's a design success!

Chatillon: Distinguished guests, would you like to play Spino Blaster now?
Traveler: Let's play Spino Blaster!
Chatillon: No problem! Please, blast away to your heart's content!
Traveler: This game is pretty fun!
Paimon: Yeah! We imagined we were just like... gunners on a huge battleship! We were unleashing salvo after salvo, those targets didn't stand a chance!
Paimon: But now that Paimon thinks about it... do real ship gunners have to aim at so many targets in such a short time, too? That's really tough...
Chatillon: Precisely so! Now you understand the original inspiration behind the game!
Chatillon: Shells don't fly in a straight line but arcs. Gunners must raise the cannon to hit faraway targets...
Chatillon: At the same time, the ship will be rocking on the waves, so the gunner must adjust the cannon vertically to compensate for the pitch and roll.
Chatillon: For all of those reasons, gunners must be extremely proficient in determining the proper elevation of the cannon barrel in order to be able to properly aim in all situations.
Chatillon: Of course, it's also essential to learn how to lead properly in order to hit fast-moving targets. The faster the target and the slower the shell, the more difficult it is to predict how much to lead.
Chatillon: That's why I invented the Crocomorph Vortex-Based Crocodilian-Armored Heavy Naval Battleship-Style Water Blasting Training Cannon! The speed and cost of ammo are both quite low.
Chatillon: By placing the cannon on a rocking, floating platform and using balloon targets, superb gunners can be quickly trained, greatly increasing the battle prowess of the entire fleet!
Traveler: Training?
Paimon: So this game is actually a project to train gunners!? Paimon smells a new scent in the air... and it's gunpowder!
Paimon: If Idyia found out there's such a military project in Veluriyam Mirage... wouldn't she feel unsafe?
Chatillon: Relax! Lady Idyia knows all about this. I don't plan to change Veluriyam Mirage into anything resembling a battlefield.
Chatillon: Pay attention to my words! I said it was my "original" inspiration, and now it's "recreational" and not "training."
Chatillon: Far as I can tell... Fontaine's fleet doesn't need me anymore. Or rather, Fontaine has no intention to ever form another fleet like that.
Chatillon: My invention has no other purpose, so it might as well be used for something fun. At least it will bring people some happiness.
Traveler: I guess that's okay...
Paimon: Why do you sound so dejected? Did talking about Fontaine's fleet remind you of anything unpleasant?
Chatillon: Haha, nothing like that! I don't want to spoil the mood!
Chatillon: Lady Idyia gave me a precious opportunity that allows me to keep doing what I do best. As long as you're happy, I'm happy!
Chatillon: The work I talked about is all in the past! Just forget it, focus on enjoying yourself and the Crococannon!
Traveler: That's reassuring...
Traveler: Battle?
Traveler: I think I can go a few more rounds...
Chatillon: Wonderful, seems like this game has captured your interest!
Chatillon: The basic idea is simply for you to enjoy yourself, so it isn't very difficult yet...
Chatillon: But if you get good at it and feel ready for a challenge, just be patient. I'll add some new wrinkles and twists to it as soon as possible!
Traveler: Why don't we talk about your story?
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon is curious about your past too... Why did you think about making a game out of water cannons?
Chatillon: Oh, that's simple! My old job was related to cannons.
Chatillon: A very long time ago, I was a weapon engineer for Fontaine's fleet. My wife and daughter were both excellent gunners serving on the flagship.
Chatillon: You could say my whole family is quite familiar with cannons!
Chatillon: My wife and daughter often gave me firsthand feedback. Thanks to their expertise, I became an outstanding engineer, and was elevated to work on some impressive projects.
Chatillon: I was often away from home testing weapons. Incidentally, the desert has a lot of empty spaces to test cannons and shells, so I became a frequent visitor.
Chatillon: However, in one field test, we neglected to store the shells and detonators separately, and there was a massive explosion...
Chatillon: The team suffered grievous losses. I was tossed away like a ragdoll, and I count myself lucky to have survived, though I laid in that forsaken desert in a coma for days!
Paimon: Th—That's horrifying!
Traveler: Your tale of tragedy has moved me to tears...
Chatillon: Yeah! So, remember, kids: safety first when handling explosives, always!
Chatillon: After that, I dragged my battered body, tracking down my injured colleagues with great difficulty, but we were lost in the desert and had to stay put for the rescue.
Chatillon: And just like that, we were forced to live in the desert. I don't know how long we survived like that, but rescue never came. After we exhausted our supplies, we thought we were done for...
Chatillon: Luckily, we stumbled across Lady Idyia! She invited us to her new home: the Veluriyam Mirage you're in now. Compared to the desert, it's a much more hospitable environment.
Chatillon: Miss Idyia also informed us about what was happening in Fontaine. Some of us got anxious and returned to Fontaine with her aid, but others felt it was meaningless to go back...
Chatillon: I, too, was depressed for a while... But to repay Miss Idyia for saving my life, I decided to use my strength to help her make the park more fun and entertaining!
Chatillon: After who knows how long, I started to miss my old work, so I decided to build this Crococannon, and a new attraction for the park...
Paimon: So, does that mean you've been in Veluriyam Mirage for a long time now, Mr. Chatillon?
Paimon: Why didn't you go back to your wife and daughter? Just what did Miss Idyia tell you...?
Traveler: My instincts are telling me...
Paimon: Huh? Hey, how come Mr. Chatillon is looking so gloomy all of a sudden?
Paimon: Well, Paimon still doesn't know what exactly happened, but... your Crococannon made us really happy, and will certainly do the same for other visitors too, Mr. Chatillon!
Paimon: So you can be happy, and forget all that stuff that makes you sad!
Chatillon: You're right! I've got to get a hold of myself, and be happy! It's what they all would have wanted!
Chatillon: Every time I see the Crococannon in action, it reminds me of my daughter's favorite crocodile doll... And once she grew up, how cool she looked when operating the cannons with her mother...
Chatillon: Thank you! Your support for the Crococannon and my project means the world to me.
Chatillon: I will make this attraction even more fun! If it becomes popular, then more people will play and forget the troubles of the past!
Traveler: Although I don't know the details...
Paimon: You will succeed for sure, Mr. Chatillon!
Traveler: I wish you the best!
Traveler: We shouldn't dig any deeper.
Traveler: But it's a good thing you survived.
Traveler: We'll catch you later, bye!
Chatillon: Yes, you seem quite busy, I understand. I'll be here waiting, come back whenever you have time!

Basima: A-hmm-hmm-hmm~ Now you've played Bing-Bang Finchball, have you not? Now do you agree with me when I say that finches are the cutest?
Traveler: Another round!
Basima: Ohoho! That's true, nobody should leave after just playing one round of Finchball! Play to your heart's content!
Traveler: Finches really are cute!
Paimon: Yep! Paimon couldn't tell by just reading the rules, but once Paimon started playing, Paimon found out the game was really fun!
Paimon: Hold the Finchball in your palm, and feel its unique round design! Then, study it closely, and you discover incredible details you never expected...
Paimon: After that, you won't be able to resist trying to recall what real finches look like, and comparing them...
Basima: Your reactions are amazing! This is exactly why I designed this game!
Basima: If this game catches on in Teyvat, it'll spark a wave of finch fever! People everywhere will want to share their lives with a precious finch by their side!
Basima: Perhaps there will even be finch cafes, finch taverns, and even finch hotels! That way, even those who cannot raise a finch of their own can still bask in their radiant cuteness.
Basima: The sheer adorableness of finches would supercharge everyone's spirits with love, people would become more patient, and the world would have fewer arguments...
Basima: With time, Teyvat would become a land of peace! That's why I have to work hard on this game!
Traveler: An ambitious plan.
Paimon: Now that Paimon thinks carefully about what Basima has said, it makes a lot of sense, does it not...? Pet people are usually patient and reasonable...
Paimon: Finches are cute, and can be found everywhere. If more and more people fell in love with them, and raised them as pets, it would surely change their attitudes, and create an atmosphere of peaceful discussion!
Basima: Yes, that's absolutely what will happen! And thus, the two of you can be considered the first "Ambassadors of Finchpeace"!
Basima: You may freely use any of my creations, even all of Bing-bang Finchball! The only condition is that you spread the word across the world!
Paimon: Wow, who would've thought Basima had such a long-term plan for this game... Paimon's impressed!
Paimon: #No problem! Finchball is safe in the hands of Paimon and Traveler!
Traveler: We got this!
Basima: Great! Ambassadors of Finchpeace, we have a deal!
Basima: For the sake of world peace, let us shout out those words of wisdom for all of Teyvat to hear—
Basima: Finches are the cutest!
Traveler: Rest easy, the finches will guide our way!
Traveler: Hooray! Cuteness is peace!
Paimon: It may sound a bit dramatic, but it is a distinct possibility... Pet people are usually patient and reasonable.
Paimon: If more people raised finches as pets, it would surely change their attitudes, and create an atmosphere of peaceful discussion!
Traveler: I think Paimon is even cuter!
Paimon: Shh, keep it down! Even Paimon... can get embarrassed sometimes!
Basima: Haha, this I will admit! Now that I look more closely, your floating white companion is every bit as adorable as a finch!
Basima: The tiny body, the carefree attitude, the fluffy white hair, the chubby round cheeks, the big watery eyes like crystals and a delightfully colorful costume with naught a speck of dust or blemish...
Basima: Ordinary folk like me would never encounter such a wondrous traveling companion! Honored guest, you must be one in a million... no, a billion, to have such a friend!
Basima: So, in the eyes of most people, perhaps we should say... "If you don't count the extraordinary Paimon, finches are the cutest!"
Traveler: Correctamundo! Paimon is completely unique!
Paimon: Paimon thinks this conversation has gotten really weird...
Basima: You must take care to protect your companion! After all, many people covet that which is cute! Some of the bad ones may even try to fight you for companion...
Paimon: What are you saying!?
Paimon: Paimon can tell you have good intentions, but let Paimon set you straight on a few things—
Paimon: Companions are not something that can be won in a fight! It's a bond built on mutual trust, shared experiences, going through thick and thin, shared understandings... that's what matters!
Paimon: #No one can take Paimon away from Traveler! And Paimon doesn't trust easily!
Traveler: I can fight off the baddies.
Basima: An amazing speech! Such knowledge! I must applaud!
Basima: I never imagined that Paimon is not just an adorable companion, but also truly wise!
Basima: When I make the next game version, I shall add a new Finchball called "Companion Paimon"!
Basima: This new Finchball will have the ability to... lead everyone on a happy journey, progressing foward with joy, and removing all annoying obstacles!
Traveler: We only make friends with those that are Paimon-approved.
Traveler: Hahaha! I truly am the blessed among the fortunate!
Traveler: What is the true meaning of "cute"?
Basima: Yes, what exactly is "cute"? Your seemingly casual question actually brings us to essential and critical debates on definition.
Basima: Do certain shapes and colors form images that impact our psychology via our vision, and thus create this sensation?
Basima: Or do certain tones and pitches form sounds that reverberate inside us, creating a resonance with our feelings?
Basima: Thousands of papers can be written on the definition of "cute," and the academic world could debate it for decades...
Basima: Hahaha, but debates like those become a battle of academic resources! It is not reason and truth that wins, but power and position!
Basima: I suggest that you stay out debates like that, else you might end up like me... wasting years, losing the debate in the end, and offending an entire cafe worth of scholars...
Basima: Then my days at the Akademiya became a nightmare... I was dispatched into the desert with nothing but a small pack of provisions for a survey on mysterious creatures and almost died of hunger and thirst...
Traveler: I didn't know you'd tell me your life story...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe that a simple debate about cuteness in the academic world could go so far...
Basima: I've decided to let it go. After all, with Idyia's help, I now live in the Veluriyam Mirage and can spend all my time researching cute things, free of worry and care!
Basima: Of course, if you wish to discuss the arcane and mysterious subject of cuteness with me, I won't be like those unscrupulous scholars who will stoop to anything just to make things difficult.
Basima: All I want is a friendly conversation that makes both of us happy. You are welcome back anytime!
Traveler: I guess I know how you feel...
Traveler: We'll talk more about cuteness next time!
Basima: No problem! I believe that, when you have traveled across all of Teyvat and seen all manner of creatures, you will come back and tell me that you agree with me!

Lafeinte: Honored warriors, the shift in your auras suggests... you are supremely confident in your battle results, and your blade dance was a masterful performance for the ages!
Traveler: That's right! And we'd even like to do it again!
Lafeinte: Such dauntless courage! Then please, continue to dance upon the field of battle!
Traveler: I haven't actually tried dancing yet...
Lafeinte: That's just as well!
Lafeinte: Even prior to you dancing the blade dance, your aura is already blindingly powerful. I cannot imagine how intimidating you will be after defeating these enemies!
Paimon: Paimon thinks "intimidating" is a bit too much... It's not like we go around threatening people... Unless it's to give bad guys a warning!
Paimon: #No matter how strong we become, Traveler is going to be just as kind, happy, super patient, and winsome as always!
Paimon: And almost nobody but you has ever said we felt... intimidating or something!
Lafeinte: Yes, that is exactly it! Forgive my shallow description! I remember reading something similar in novels... ahem, strategy materials from Liyue and Inazuma—
Lafeinte: You have already far surpassed "using your imposing aura to suppress potential enemies and avoid combat"! You have reached an even more transcendent level!
Lafeinte: It is exactly because you have no equals that you choose to appear as a completely meek and weak mortal... like even a Boar could take you out.
Lafeinte: But when you run into those harboring ill intentions, you will immediately understand their intent, and acting completely casually, you will observe their every move...
Lafeinte: "Whatever. But the moment you bare your weapon is the moment of your doom."
Traveler: Stop! That's absurd!
Paimon: Enough with your nonsense, Mr. Lafeinte! Paimon is getting confused again...
Lafeinte: Be that as it may, I have been far too impolite! Please, masters, give me one more chance that I might feast my eyes upon your most elegant posture and form!
Traveler: You have understood me, brother.
Traveler: How'd you get here anyway, "Blade Dancer"?
Paimon: Oh, right... Based on how you dress, you're from... Mondstadt?
Lafeinte: The nature of your question is recognition of my supreme abilities in the art of disguise.
Lafeinte: In fact, I am from Fontaine, and I write novels for a living... Hmm, or should I say, apart from being the Blade Dancer, I write heroic novels for some extra pocket money in my spare time.
Paimon: You're from Fontaine? You really don't look like it!
Lafeinte: I dress like a Mondstadter because I once traveled there for a period of time. The clothes are comfortable and convenient. They conceal my identity too...
Lafeinte: When there are not terrible foes with which to waltz the dance of blades, it is wise to hide your weapons and keep a low profile.
Lafeinte: Or else the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, or even the Marechaussee Phantom...
Lafeinte: Ahem! Or else, some strange law enforcement officer will find you, disarm you, and make sure you don't intend to harm the city.
Lafeinte: They are lithe as cats, fast as the wind, and where they have passed, a unique scent of the sea and algae lingers...
Paimon: What are you talking about... some kind of fairy-tale creature? Sounds like an excuse for past failures!
Lafeinte: Anyway, I suggest you don't mess with the law in Fontaine, they can be very difficult...
Lafeinte: Of course, if you must do something in the name of conscience... then you must steel yourself in advance. You must prepare to leave Fontaine with no regrets, so as not to be arrested!
Traveler: (Remain silent and leave.)
Lafeinte: You two... I see it clearly! You have entered the optimal state to begin the battle dance, and I should not disturb you... I look forward to another graceful performance!
