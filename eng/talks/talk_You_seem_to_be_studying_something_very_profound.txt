# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You seem to be studying something very profound.
Woliu: It may sound profound, but if we're talking about the basic principles, it's more like... analyzing the various ingredients and seasoning of a dish?
Woliu: The most difficult part of this job is obtaining samples and determining effective components, both of which require highly specialized equipment to complete.
Woliu: Sometimes, I even use consumable devices from Fontaine in addition to my equipment from Liyue.
Woliu: If you carefully calculate the costs, this work is a pretty expensive undertaking! Without an appropriate organization allocating funds, most people couldn't handle all the required outlays.
Woliu: Even researchers sent by the Akademiya probably can't cover all of the expenses, so just trying to transplant tea trees from Chenyu Vale to Sumeru is a fool's errand.
Woliu: As far as the Ministry of Civil Affairs is concerned, if we can completely understand the composition of the soil, and determine the essential components critical for commercial crops...
Woliu: Then it'll be easy to pump up production of our biggest cash crops!
Woliu: Yeah, when I think about it that way, my work is pretty awesome!
