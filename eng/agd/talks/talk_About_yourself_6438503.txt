Traveler: About yourself...
Katayoun: I'm the librarian who's in charge of lending and sorting books.
Katayoun: My family has been in this line of work for generations. I've had a thing for the smell of newly-printed books since I was a kid. So I'd say I've landed a dream job.
Katayoun: But the work turned out to be more simple than I'd imagined.
Katayoun: Many come here not to borrow books, but instead to look for a quiet place where they can contemplate issues.
Katayoun: So I don't really have much work to do except for tidying up the bookshelves.
