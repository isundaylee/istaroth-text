# Rumors Abound


## Talk 1

Sangonomiya Kokomi: The king is overthrown, only the pawns remain!

## Talk 2

Matsuda: Don't get cocky!
Uchimura: It's no use looking for an escape route!
Naruse: Just you wait until Her Excellency finishes her investigation...

## Talk 3

Sangonomiya Kokomi: The explosion was roughly the size I expected. Hopefully, we've given them a fright.

## Talk 4

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Their movements have become rigid and sluggish. We make a good team!

## Talk 5

Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's been a long time since I last came to this village. There's been a lot to deal with recently...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Next time you visit, I'll take you to visit Watatsumi Island's old shrine.

## Talk 6

Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Excellent work, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Hee-hee, all thanks to your genius tactics!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Actually, even the best tactics live or die on the strength of those executing them.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Winning a battle takes a concerted effort from everyone involved. Victory never belongs to a single person.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon did make a pretty big contribution, huh...
Traveler: I beg to differ.
Paimon: Hey!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.

## Talk 7

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... That wasn't quite what I'd call "by the book"...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But it happens. Battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. It doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
Paimon: Hehe... Seems like as soon as the fighting started, the plan went out the window and we kinda winged it...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. A testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.

## Talk 8

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Watatsumi Island observes different customs than the rest of Inazuma. I imagine it must all seem a little alien to you?
