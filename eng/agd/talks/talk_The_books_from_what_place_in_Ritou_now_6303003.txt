Traveler: The books from what place in Ritou now?
Aratani: Eh? You heard that? Well... Never mind. You're an outlander right? You should be able to understand me.
Aratani: Because of the Sakoku Decree, it's getting harder and harder to get foreign books. But my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
Aratani: Therefore, I will secretly ask people who can enter and leave Inazuma to bring some new books from outside. If there are some confiscated books from Ritou, I will also tell them to smuggle them in.
Aratani: You have to keep this a secret for me. In exchange, I'll let you read the new books.
