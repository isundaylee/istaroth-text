# Barbara Voicelines

## Hello
Tada! *giggles* Barbara is here~ Leave the healing to me, I will not disappoint you!

## Chat: Sleepiness
*yawn* All this standing around is making me so sleepy...

## Chat: Encouragement
Everyone is working super hard, we should be too!

## Chat: Keeping One Refreshed
Are you tired? Try my new spicy energy drink, I'm sure it'll wake you up!

## When It Rains
Don't stay out in the rain for too long, you'll catch a cold!

## When Thunder Strikes
Whoa!

## When It Snows
Ooh, snowflakes! Look at them dance!

## When the Sun Is Out
This weather is so amazing! I could burst into song.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Don't worry! I will not... be blown away!

## Good Morning
Morning~ Let's do our best today.

## Good Afternoon
Oh? You want to hear me sing...? Sorry, the show is... It hasn't started yet.

## Good Evening
I really want to eat some spicy squid at Good Hunter... but my stomach, er... Never mind...

## Good Night
We had a great day today! Get some rest.

## About Barbara
"To the wind that guides me: When I'm exhausted, bless me with the strength to keep going forward. When I'm uncertain, bless me with the wisdom to distinguish good from evil. When I suffer from injustice, bless me with the courage to fight back..." ...Oops, my apologies, I was just doing my prayers. *giggles* You need something?

## About Us: Hopes
My dream is to bring a smile to the faces of all the people in my life! As long as I can help you on your journey, I'm happy~

## About Us: Dreams
Thank you for being with me for all this time, I can feel that I'm getting closer to my dream. Hope we can keep this up in the future~!

## About the Vision
Everyone has their own desires. To bring together and fulfill those desires and make everyone happy — that is the purpose my Archon has bestowed upon me.

## Something to Share
I could never get bored of the breathtakingly beautiful nature that surrounds Mondstadt. I've heard that there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City. I just need to save up a little more, and... What's that? You want to know what I'm saving up for? *chuckles* That's my little secret.

## Interesting Things
Sunflowers always face the sun. They're so bright. In fact, my mother sent me a sunflower-style dress... I wonder when I'll finally get to wear it on stage?

## About Jean
Acting Grand Master... Leader of the Knights of Favonius... Everyone seems to like her a lot. Oh? Me? I... Of course I have nothing but admiration for her!

## About Lisa
I always take good care of Lisa. If she ever wants to become a star, she'll have my unconditional support, I'll cheer at the top of my lungs until my voice goes hoarse... Hmm, that might scare off her other fans though...

## About Amber
I've seen Amber rushing out of Mondstadt on a mission countless times. Being an Outrider doesn't look easy.

## About Diluc
Oh, Master Diluc? Last time, when I was performing at Angel's Share, he kept frowning... Maybe he doesn't like my singing?

## About Venti
Venti's voice is amazing! But all the songs he sings and the ones I'm good at are very different. I tried to learn them but... the melodies are just so complicated.

## About Bennett
Bennett always comes to the cathedral covered in scrapes and bruises... Though it clearly never bothers him a bit, given the big grin he always has on his face. He really should take better care of himself.

## About Varka
My father left on the expedition with Grand Master Varka... I hope they are okay. Oh, what am I worried about? The Grand Master is none other than the Knight of Boreas, of course they will be fine! Still, I will be sure to pray for their safe return.

## About Rosaria
Sister Rosaria is hard to get to know, especially given she never joins in on prayers, but... Oh, I'm sure she believes in the Anemo Archon! Although, I still don't really have the courage to try to talk to her...

## About Noelle
Noelle is just the cutest! She's so kind and patient, you just feel totally relaxed when you're around her. ...Oh yeah, and she makes the tastiest snacks! Best part is, they're also healthy. Hehehe!

## About Dahlia
I really look up to Dahlia. We rely on him to share the word of Barbatos, and it's always a great help to us all. He never sticks around long at the Cathedral, though. Maybe it's too quiet for him? He seems to love the markets and the taverns. And he can be hard to find sometimes... same as Rosaria.

## More About Barbara: I
Knights look so cool when they swing their sword in combat! Don't you think so? I tried using a sword before but... *sigh* Uh, let's just say I have zero talent with a sword.

## More About Barbara: II
I want to heal everyone. This simple thought was all the motivation I needed to become a Deaconess. As long as I'm able to help everyone, I'll be content.

## More About Barbara: III
Being an idol, I learned from Alice that "A true idol should always try to heal the soul of the people..." Yes, I completely agree.

## More About Barbara: IV
I'm doing my best everyday... I hope my efforts earn the trust of the people of Mondstadt.

## More About Barbara: V
Every time I get on stage I always start to doubt myself — can I really heal every person in Mondstadt? But I look at you now, and I feel that as long as we keep marching forward, maybe one day I might just— Huh? I've already healed you? Well, one's not enough! I've already healed a lot of people? I suppose...

## Barbara's Hobbies
The smiles on the faces of the people I've helped keeps me going.

## Barbara's Troubles
My companions keep getting injured, but I'm unable to share the burden of their pain. The only thing I can do is my absolute very best to heal their wounds! I'll make sure that everyone is healthy.

## Favorite Food
Do you like spicy dried fish? I have two in my bag. Here, have one!

## Least Favorite Food
I don't like anything bitter, especially... ugh, bitter gourd.

## Receiving a Gift: I
It's a rare pleasure to eat food that suits my tastes so well. Today is a blessed day! Hehehe.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Thank you for cooking these for me. This time around, you are the one healing me!

## Receiving a Gift: III
Oh, uh, oh dear...

## Birthday
Here you go! This is the gift I got for your birthday, along with my exclusive autograph! Hehe, when my next song comes out, I'll make sure you're the first one to hear it! Happy birthday!
