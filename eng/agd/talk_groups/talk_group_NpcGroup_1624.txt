Traveler: Best of luck.
Chang the Ninth: Haha, I'll take your well-wishes to heart!
Chang the Ninth: Truth be told, I really owe you for helping me so much last time.
Chang the Ninth: Here, you can have these Noctilucous Jades. They're not expensive by any means, but do take them as a keepsake.

## Talk 1

Chang the Ninth: If you're here to make fun of an old man, you picked the wrong one. I don't take any nonsense.

Chang the Ninth: *sigh* The heavens are smiting me... Smiting me to smithereens...
Traveler: Excuse me, are you Chang the Ninth?
Chang the Ninth: Uh-huh. And what do you want? Come on, spit it out!
Paimon: We've heard you've got tons of old books lying around, and we wanna borrow the Liyue volume of the Teyvat Travel Guide.
Chang the Ninth: Hmph. Don't get me started on the topic of my books...
Chang the Ninth: After the Chasm was sealed off, the family mining business started going south. Then, the Fatui started working to sabotage me...
Chang the Ninth: To pay off my debts, I had no choice but to pawn off my beloved book collection. Every last book! Do you have any idea what that means!?
Traveler: You're sad you've got nothing to read now?
Chang the Ninth: Wrong! That was my life's work! I devoted my entire life to curating, collecting, caring for them... And now they're gone! Gone, I tell you!
Chang the Ninth: *sigh* It's useless ranting and raving at you like this. All I can do is try to save enough Mora to buy them back.
Chang the Ninth: Unless you have other business here, I'm done talking to you. Goodbye! Off you go! Go on, go!
Xingqiu: Please tell me that you didn't pawn volume six of Legend of the Shattered Halberd?
Chang the Ninth: Legend of the Shattered Halberd... There's a title I haven't heard in a long time. You have good taste, my boy!
Paimon: What, but we don't?
Chang the Ninth: That work was an epoch-defining masterpiece. Granted, it was almost unknown at the time it was published...
Chang the Ninth: But over time it was the work that came to define the genre of martial arts novels — and sparked a plethora of imitation works.
Chang the Ninth: Barely any copies of the first edition were ever printed.
Xingqiu: The later edition inexplicably went out of print almost as soon as it was released — a shame given what it allegedly added to the original story.
Chang the Ninth: Yes! That's right, how did I forget? The original-edition sixth volume of that work is so rare, I could never bring myself to pawn it no matter how much I needed the money.
Xingqiu: You mean— You mean you still have it!?
Chang the Ninth: Yes. It is my one and only remaining treasure—
Changhu: Ay! Chang!
Changhu: You've got some nerve keeping me and my boss waiting like this. I need an answer! Will you sell the Cor Lapis or not?
Changhu: I'm sure you don't need me to remind you that if you mess with Gentry Maocai, you're messing with the Fatui!
Chang the Ninth: *sigh* You again...
Chang the Ninth: But you know I can't afford to give a seventy percent discount on the price... I'd never be able to buy my collection back—
Changhu: That's your business. The question is, do you want your books or do you want food on your plate? Perhaps you'd like to take your books with you to an early grave?
Chang the Ninth: *Grr* You...*sigh*
Xingqiu: Whoa there, friend. Come on. This gentleman is either willing to make a deal or he's not. You can't force him to sell against his will.
Changhu: Just who do you think you are? Keep your nose out of other people's business!
Xingqiu: My liege, I am but one who comes to the aid of this gentleman in his moment of need. I am Xingqiu, disciple of the Guhua Clan.
Changhu: A-hahahahahahaha...
Changhu: "Guhua Clan"! Did you hear this clown? He thinks he's a Guhua master! In this day and age! Hahahahaha...
Changhu: There was me thinking that the last granddads of Guhua had keeled over and died by now. Who are you supposed to be then, some sort of Guhua messiah!?
Xingqiu: Justice is blind to our backgrounds, my friend. That just makes me someone trying to do the right thing. But you? The weasel who does the tiger's bidding may be less powerful than his master, but he is no less guilty.
Changhu: Get a load of this guy! Just you wait, you'll be sorry you crossed me!
Changhu: And you, Chang... you're selling that Cor Lapis whether you like it or not!
Chang the Ninth: *sigh* Oh, how the wolves prey upon the fallen tiger! My days are numbered.
Xingqiu: ...So just to come back to what we were talking about earlier, could I get a yea or nay about borrowing that book...?
Traveler: Geez Louise, give the man a minute!
Chang the Ninth: Oh, what does it matter now? I can't expect anybody to care about me anymore. But since you did stick up for me, please just take this book and leave me in peace.
Xingqiu: Three long years I have waited for this day! Words cannot express my gratitude... I, Xingqiu, vow to repay this great act of generosity!
Chang the Ninth: Alright, give it a rest! Just bring it back when you're finished. Sorry, but I'm not about to put my hopes in some self-professed Guhua disciple.
Paimon: Hey! Where are you going!? We've still got a job to do over here!
Traveler: Two words: situational awareness...
Traveler: You're bored now that you've got nothing to read?

### Talk 1 related talk 1

Traveler: Who are you?
Chang the Ninth: Not to scare you off, but I'm none other than the once-illustrious Chang the Ninth of Feiyun Slope!
Chang the Ninth: Back in Liyue, in the good old days, so many Mora went through my hands every day that I couldn't give you an exact number. Anyone who wanted to do business knew it was me they had to impress!
Chang the Ninth: Hmph, even those big-shot Liyue Qixing would have to move aside if I told them they were in my way!
Traveler: So... why did you move here to live as a hermit?
Chang the Ninth: It was a somewhat... unexpected turn of events. The business started going downhill, so I thought I'd sell the old abode and move out here, where it's peaceful and quiet, to get away from it all.
Chang the Ninth: The ancients had a saying, "He who has not known poverty has yet to become a true man." I might only have this hut and my book collection to my name, but I'm optimistic that my time will come again sooner or later.
Chang the Ninth: I'm wondering about the mineral trade, maybe... Well, I shan't say any more or I'd be handing you a business opportunity on a silver platter!
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
Traveler: Do you get on with your neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!

Traveler: Have we met?
Chang the Ninth: You don't remember me? It's me, Chang the Ninth! You once bought a mountain of Cor Lapis from me!
Chang the Ninth: I imagine you've met a great many people, it's to be expected that you wouldn't remember...
Chang the Ninth: I remember when I used to do my business on Feiyun Slope. People would fight to do business with me... *sigh* Not like now...

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: So what happened?
Chang the Ninth: Thanks to you, I was able to sell that Cor Lapis at a good price. You effectively saved my life in the process.
Chang the Ninth: I know my gut feeling won't lead me astray. Sure, I've had a few business deals go south, but that which makes money will make money.
Chang the Ninth: Just watch, I used that money to buy more ore. Once my ore business really gets going, I can finally get out of this dump.
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!

Chang the Ninth: Oh yeah, that Guhua kid... Haven't seen him since that day. Getting up to something inexplicable no doubt...
