Traveler: Who told you that?
Tu: I... I figured it out myself. I mean, I've been here so long and I don't have any other hobbies, so what I do is put the various things I hear together.

Tu: And so I thought, could this just be another one of the Lord of Geo's incognito travels?
Tu: I'm not intending to grab here, but I reckon that this is a most rational explanation, by yours truly no less!
