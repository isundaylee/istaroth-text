Brother Qian: You play mahjong?
Brother Qian: Heh, it's what I do best. No one else even comes close.
Brother Qian: And what I really love to do to my opponents is raise the stakes to "if you lose, you join the Adventurers' Guild."
Brother Qian: I think more people have joined the guild now due to losing to me than those who've actually volunteered. I kid you not!
