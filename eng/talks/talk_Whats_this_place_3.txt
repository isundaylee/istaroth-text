Traveler: What's this place?
Kageyama: This is the identification checkpoint under the jurisdiction of the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Kageyama: With the abolition of the Sakoku Decree, the number of people entering and exiting Ritou has gradually increased, while the number of people coming to apply for short-term residential permits and goods exchange permits has increased as well.
Kageyama: But since our restrictions are no longer so stringent, processing these applications has become a far smoother process. Oftentimes, only the most basic of documentation is required, thus resulting in the process being completed the very same day.
