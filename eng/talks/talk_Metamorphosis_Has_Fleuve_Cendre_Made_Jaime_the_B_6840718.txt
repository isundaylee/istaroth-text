La Gouttiere: "Metamorphosis? Has Fleuve Cendre Made Jaime the Brute a New Man?"
La Gouttiere: According to sources, the infamous enforcer and part-time debt collector for merchant's guilds, Jaime the Brute, has undergone a complete change in personality due to a visit to Fleuve Cendre.
La Gouttiere: This frequent guest of the Fortress of Meropide has seemingly made a clean break with the domineering ways of his past, and has suddenly become modest, polite, and scrupulously observant of the law. In fact, he has even announced he wants to use his strength to contribute to society.
La Gouttiere: Though he is completely illiterate, he publicly announced: "The future of Fontaine is in energy, and that is why I want to research topics related to thermal energy in order to give back to society."
La Gouttiere: Though it must be said, the fact that Jaime the Brute could even say the words "thermal energy" properly is enough to draw attention. To encourage him, let us wish this future scholar success in his endeavors!
La Gouttiere: In addition, the Spina di Rosula has yet to comment on this matter.
