# With You


## Talk 1

Paimon: Well, we may have arrived near the end of the festival, but it's still been super fun. Paimon approves!
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I agree.
Kamisato Ayaka: To spend the festival together with you today has been a truly wonderful experience.

## Talk 2

Kamisato Ayaka: This stall sells Prayer Plaques. It's an Inazuman tradition — you draw your wish onto a pentagonal piece of wood called a Prayer Plaque and pray that it will come true.
Paimon: Sounds similar to the way people in Liyue release lanterns during Lantern Rite. Those are used for making wishes, too.
Yoshikawa: Oh, welcome! Looking for Prayer Plaques? Every wish is sacred, and you've still got time to make yours before the festival ends!
Paimon: Looks fun! Shall we give it a try?
Paimon: ...Wait, there's writing and drawing involved? Count Paimon out, then... Paimon's head's feeling kinda fuzzy after eating so much just now... not the best time for an intense burst of mental activity...
Kamisato Ayaka: Two Prayer Plaques please, sir.
Yoshikawa: Two Prayer Plaques for the young lady. There you go!
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, have you decided on your wish?
Traveler: Yep! How about you?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes.
Yoshikawa: You can either draw a picture to represent your wish or write it out in words. Either way, once you've committed your wish onto your plaque, please hang it onto the Prayer Rack.
Paimon: Wait, so they'll be on public display!?
Paimon: #Alright, Traveler, well, let's see what you got!
Kamisato Ayaka: That will do for mine.
Kamisato Ayaka: May I see yours?
Traveler: You got it!
Kamisato Ayaka: #This is you and your {F#brother}{M#sister}, isn't it?
Kamisato Ayaka: It's lovely.
Traveler: #Yes. I want {F#him}{M#her} back.
Paimon: You'll be back together one day. Paimon believes it, and you should too!
Kamisato Ayaka: I believe it too. Your wish will surely come true.
Kamisato Ayaka: And... I will keep you in my prayers.
Paimon: Ayaka, what did you draw? Is that Tenshukaku?
Kamisato Ayaka: That's right. I wish for peace and happiness for everyone in Inazuma, and good health for my family and friends.
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I do hope that wish can come true.
Traveler: It will.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you, that gives me hope.
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I think that might be all we have time for today.
Paimon: Aw... It's time to leave already?
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm afraid so. The festival is coming to a close.
Kamisato Ayaka: Time flies when you're having fun... It seems to flow away from you like a rushing river... As precious and short-lived as a cherry blossom dancing in the wind...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: It's time to leave.

## Talk 3

Shimizu: May your futures be filled with good fortune!

## Talk 4

Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, look, this stall's doing fortune slips.
Shimizu: Miss Kamisato, hello there! You're out with friends today? What a rare privilege — welcome, welcome! Would you like to give it a go?
Kamisato Ayaka: Okay! How much is it per draw?
Shimizu: Hehehe, I wouldn't expect you to know this, but the Yashiro Commission was very good to my uncle on my father's side at one point in time. Thinking about it, it was when your father was around, I think he dealt with it personally.
Shimizu: So you see? How could I possibly take your money?
Kamisato Ayaka: What? A—Are you sure?
Shimizu: Of course! If you like what you see, then please, be my guest. Same goes for your two friends here.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon... What do you think?
Paimon: It seems like everyone wants to do something nice for Ayaka! So if they insist... who are we to resist!
Traveler: If they're offering, who are we to refuse?
Kamisato Ayaka: Well, if that's how you feel, then... okay! We'll take you up on your kind offer, sir! Let's each do a draw.
Shimizu: Alrighty then! Whenever you're ready.
Shimizu: Draw a slip and reveal your fortune!
Traveler: I'm enjoying being a VIP by association!

## Talk 5

Murakami: Good food is good for the soul, and sharing it around is the wholesome thing to do!

## Talk 6

Kamisato Ayaka: This food stall sells all kinds of Inazuman specialties. Anything you want to eat, it's my treat!
Paimon: Wow, it all looks so good... Is it okay if Paimon has one of everything? *chuckle*
Kamisato Ayaka: Hahaha, of course it is.
Paimon: Hmm, but we don't want anything to go to waste. Let's try them one at a time.
Paimon: Ayaka, Paimon wants those Dango!
Kamisato Ayaka: Sure!
Traveler: I'll have one of those pink pancake things.
Paimon: Uh-huh, those look good too! Ooooh, but so do the Egg Rolls... Paimon will try an Egg Roll too, please!
Kamisato Ayaka: Alright then. I too shall have a Sakura Mochi.
Murakami: Alright, coming right up!
Kamisato Ayaka: Mmm! This Sakura Mochi is just delicious!
Murakami: Not bad, huh? It's one of our best-sellers.
Paimon: Please, sir, Paimon would like some more!
Kamisato Ayaka: I don't know if it's rude of me to ask, but how is this kind of snack actually made?
Murakami: Haha, you wanna try your hand at making it yourself? No problem, just give me a second and I'll write out the recipe for you.
Paimon: A new recipe!
Kamisato Ayaka: A—Are you sure about this? If you share the recipe... isn't that tantamount to giving away your trade secrets... or something?
Murakami: Well, it was you who gave Kiminami Restaurant that recipe for an overseas dish, wasn't it?
Murakami: Hehe, she and I are good friends. We trade culinary tips all the time.
Murakami: Here you go, just treat it as me returning a favor on behalf of my friend.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Thank you so much, I will study it very carefully and try my best to do it justice.
Murakami: You there, you want the recipe too? Go on, I can see that you enjoyed it.
Traveler: Thanks, boss!
Murakami: There's no greater feeling than creating delicious food with your own two hands. You should definitely give it a try.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will!
Kamisato Ayaka: Once I've learned how to make it... will you two be my taste testers?
Paimon: Ooh, definitely! Can't wait!
Traveler: Looking forward to it already.
Kamisato Ayaka: Alright... I'll do my best!

## Talk 7

Yoshikawa: There's power in these Prayer Plaques, you know. Have faith, your wishes will surely be fulfilled.

## Talk 8

Sanden: Have fun!

## Talk 9

Traveler: Mine says "Great Fortune From Heaven."
Kamisato Ayaka: Wow... You're so lucky!
Shimizu: Congratulations are in order! Here's what Great Fortune From Heaven means: "The blessings of the gods are upon you. Your voyage ahead shall be plain sailing, and all your endeavors shall prosper." In other words, your good luck isn't about to run out anytime soon!

## Talk 10

Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler... Today was the first time in my life that I've ever been to a festival.
Kamisato Ayaka: You've known me for some time now... I think you understand my personality, don't you?
Kamisato Ayaka: Knowing me... I just know that today could not have been such a happy day without you.
Kamisato Ayaka: So, thank you. Today really meant a lot to me, and the memories will always have a special place in my heart.
Kamisato Ayaka: Festivals are great! There aren't many rules, everyone has that smile that comes from deep inside, and... it's just so carefree and happy...
Kamisato Ayaka: If I ever get the chance... Hee-hee, I wanna go again.
Traveler: I'd like to go again, too.
Kamisato Ayaka: You too? Great!
Kamisato Ayaka: You know, we're kind of similar, with both of us having a brother.
Kamisato Ayaka: #Sometimes, I feel like I can relate to the determination you must have... to get your {F#brother}{M#sister} back.
Traveler: #Yes, {F#he}{M#she} means an awful lot to me.
Traveler: #Finding {F#him}{M#her} is the whole reason for my journey.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: I understand.
Kamisato Ayaka: Family bonds are inseparable — no one can break them... They are the most important roots we have in this world.
Kamisato Ayaka: #You will find {F#him}{M#her}. Come what may, you must never give up.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will always be here for you as your... Ahem! As your friend. I will always support you.
Traveler: Thank you, Ayaka.
Traveler: Today made me very happy, too.
Traveler: Thanks for being a splendid host today.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...!
Kamisato Ayaka: As long as you're happy, I'm happy.
Kamisato Ayaka: What do you think of my dance? Did you... like it?
Paimon: It was so pretty!
Paimon: Beautiful, elegant, and... and something else Paimon can't put into words. *thinking* Paimon doesn't really know what it was, but, it is art.
Traveler: It was delightful.
Kamisato Ayaka: Phew... I'm not very good at this kind of dance. So as long as I didn't embarrass myself, that's all that matters.
Kamisato Ayaka: I just... had a sudden urge, and I ran with it...
Kamisato Ayaka: Hahaha... In a way, that sort of sums up today for me. Dancing like nobody's watching.
Traveler: There's nothing wrong with that.
Traveler: You're a pleasure to be around!
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: That goes for you too.
Kamisato Ayaka: When I'm with you... time seems to slow down and speed up at the same time.
Kamisato Ayaka: Anyway, it looks like this is goodbye for today.
Kamisato Ayaka: I can see myself the rest of the way back.
Traveler: Goodnight, Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: Goodnight, Traveler.

## Talk 17

Kamisato Ayaka: It hasn't closed yet, it's just that there aren't many people left... Let's hurry and see as much as we can!
Paimon: Hey, look at that stall! They have so many masks!
Paimon: Paimon's heard that everyone's supposed to wear a mask at these kinds of festivals. Is that rule still around nowadays, or...?
Kamisato Ayaka: That used to be the custom, yes, and today, it's still a popular way to dress up during festivals. But it's not a hard-and-fast rule.
Sanden: Hey! Is that who I think it is? Miss Kamisato, right?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh! Uh... Ahem. Greetings.
Paimon: People seem to recognize Ayaka wherever we go! Guess that's just what it's like when you're a famous Inazuman...
Sanden: Hahaha, but of course! The Kamisato Clan leads the Yashiro Commission. It's one of the most well-known clans in Inazuma.
Sanden: Not least because back when Master and Miss Kamisato had just taken over the family's affairs, they used to make public appearances all the time.
Sanden: Some of the younger generations have never even seen Miss Kamisato in person before. Being the age I am — I'm lucky enough to have seen her on many occasions over the years.
Kamisato Ayaka: You're too kind. My brother and I simply go where we must to fulfill our duties.
Sanden: Haha, but this is the first time I've seen anyone from your family at a festival. There must be some official business, I take it?
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, there isn't, actually. Today, I'm taking my traveler friend here around to see the sights.
Sanden: Oh? A traveler? Huh, now that you mention it... You do look like you've come a long way to get here!
Sanden: First time in Inazuma? Hope you enjoy yourself, young one.
Sanden: Ah— excuse me one second.
Sanden: Hey, everyone! Listen up! Don't close up yet! Miss Kamisato has come to join the festival!
Kamisato Ayaka: N—No, it's not like that!
Kamisato Ayaka: Please, there's no need to make a fuss, we're just here to—
Traveler: Thank you!
Paimon: Yeah, thanks a lot mister! If you hadn't let them know, they'd start closing down about now, right?
Paimon: At least, it sure looks like that time of day.
Sanden: Haha, yep, you got it! But on account of this being the first time Miss Kamisato has ever come to the festival, it seems only fair to keep things open a little longer!
Sanden: Oh — here's a couple of masks for you. On the house.
Kamisato Ayaka: No no no no no, you've been far too accommodating to us already, we couldn't possibly—
Sanden: Ah, don't gimme all that! Here you go!
Sanden: Here you go. It's not often that we regular folks get some attention from the Yashiro Commission, so I've gotta mark the occasion somehow! Besides, it'll make me look bad if you refuse, haha.
Kamisato Ayaka: But...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Okay, I... think I understand.
Traveler: Thank you for your generosity, sir.
Sanden: Hahaha, it's my pleasure! You have yourself a good time.
Paimon: Sir, do you have anything for Paimon?
Sanden: Ooh, hello there kiddo, um... I'm sorry, but we don't have any masks in your size.
Paimon: Huh!? ...Surely you're not gonna let Paimon be the only one at the festival without a mask?
Kamisato Ayaka: *chuckle* Paimon, don't worry, wearing a mask is optional...
Paimon: But, but... Paimon doesn't wanna feel left out!
Sanden: How about... a tree leaf? That should be enough to cover up that little face of yours.
Paimon: What!? No way!
Sanden: Ooh, okay then... Hmm, in that case, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do right now... But don't you worry, kiddo, I'll have a mini mask made specially for you when I get back.
Kamisato Ayaka: I cannot thank you enough.
Sanden: Ah, it's nothing! But I won't hold you up any longer — you should go and enjoy the festival while everything's still lit up.
Kamisato Ayaka: Alright! Traveler, shall we?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, wait! Um... Just one thing...
Kamisato Ayaka: I need to explain myself. I got a little nervous back there and... I—I just made up any old excuse. But don't think of this as me taking you sight-seeing, please!
Kamisato Ayaka: I brought you here because... because I genuinely wanted to spend time with you.
Traveler: I sensed that.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Okay, great!
Traveler: Don't worry, Ayaka, no misunderstanding here.
