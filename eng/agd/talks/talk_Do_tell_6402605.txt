Traveler: Do tell.
Zhuoying: Long ago, sea beasts were a far greater threat to humans than they are now, so the bones of deceased sea beasts were valuable materials.
Zhuoying: Sailors would adorn the stems of their ships with these bones to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, while skilled artisans could forge powerful weapons from sea beasts' remains.
Zhuoying: People who continue these practices now are few and far between.
Zhuoying: My deepest thanks to the shipbuilders of Fontaine and the researchers who predicted the sea beasts' movements!
