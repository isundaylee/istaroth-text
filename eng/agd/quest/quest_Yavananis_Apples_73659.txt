# Yavanani's Apples


## Talk 1

Yavanani: Language is the foundation of all forms of sociological and historical studies. It makes perfect sense to approach the issue from a linguistic point of view. How stubborn of them to not see that...
Traveler: About the Apples...
Yavanani: Effendi reminded me to explain details about my request in a comprehensible manner...
Yavanani: I'll get right to it, then. Have you got the five Apples?
Traveler: Here are the apples you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Yavanani: Okay, come back when you have them.

## Talk 2

Yavanani: Thank you. It's pretty easy to post requests with Effendi. Not much explanation necessary.
