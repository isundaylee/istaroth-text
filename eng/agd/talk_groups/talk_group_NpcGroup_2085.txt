## Talk

Clerk Zhao: Phew... Lantern Rite is such a tiring time. I should take a moment to rest...
Clerk Zhao: But the moment I stop, the anxiety just hits me all over again...
Clerk Zhao: Can I really take slack off while watching Lady Keqing hurry this way and that, making the Lantern Rite preparations?

## Talk

Clerk Zhao: I can't stand it...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Clerk Zhao: My work with the Ministry of Civil Affairs has really been piling up recently. Right now I'm assigning them to people.
Clerk Zhao: I just finished organizing forms that I need various people to fill out, but I don't have any time to distribute them...
Traveler: I can help.
Clerk Zhao: You'd do that? Great! It's really not complicated. Everything I need is written very clearly on the forms.
Clerk Zhao: Just take them the forms and they'll see what they need to do.
Clerk Zhao: The two most urgent jobs are those for Jiangzhou and Nervous An. Take these forms to them.
Clerk Zhao: Come back here and let me know once you've delivered the forms.
Traveler: Sounds complicated...
Clerk Zhao: No, it's not complicated, really! I already wrote everything out on the forms.
Clerk Zhao: You just deliver the forms and you're done. Simple as that.
Clerk Zhao: Thank you so much. I'm just swamped with work now.

## Talk

Clerk Zhao: Hello. Can I help you?
Clerk Zhao: You have two seconds to tell me what you need.

## Talk

Traveler: What's your—
Clerk Zhao: Role? Clerk at the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Clerk Zhao: Name? Ask me again after my shift.
Traveler: I want to—
Clerk Zhao: Take a proficiency test? Declare a tax liability? Apply for an exit permit? Rent a mooring space?
Clerk Zhao: Which service do you require?
Clerk Zhao: Hurry up! And then hurry up some more!
Clerk Zhao: You're taking too long! Sorry, can't afford to waste precious time on people like...
Clerk Zhao: ...Never mind, no time. Next customer, please!

## Talk

Traveler: Good—
Clerk Zhao: Goodbye. Next time, prepare first!

## Talk

Clerk Zhao: Whew... As soon as I stop working, the anxiety just hits me...
Clerk Zhao: Hello? What is it?

## Talk

Traveler: Anxiety?
Clerk Zhao: Yeah. Do you ever feel like there just aren't enough hours in the day?
Clerk Zhao: That feeling of... I'm enjoying myself, but I can't fully relax because there is still that thing at the back of my mind... But then, you still can't force yourself to go and deal with the thing...
Clerk Zhao: *sigh* People are strange creatures. We know full well that time is limited, but we still kid ourselves by saying things like, "Oh, surely just a bit longer can't hurt..."

## Talk

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Clerk Zhao: You'll laugh at me if I tell you, but... Well, my dream is to work my way up and become one of the Qixing one day. Someone big and successful.
Clerk Zhao: I know it sounds ridiculous, the idea of starting as a minor clerk and somehow ending up as one of the Qixing...
Clerk Zhao: But if I don't at least try, none of my dreams will ever become reality.
Clerk Zhao: Zhao, there's no time to waste...
Clerk Zhao: ...Aah, what am I doing here then!? I must get back to work!
Traveler: You really do work hard.
Clerk Zhao: If I want to become a member of the Liyue Qixing, this work-rate is just what is expected of me, isn't it?
Clerk Zhao: ...And honestly, I'm not working anywhere near hard enough.
Clerk Zhao: I've had to travel to Yuehai Pavilion many times in order to settle some matters. Every time I go there, I can see Miss Ganyu doing overtime work.
Clerk Zhao: Perhaps this is because she works directly for the Qixing at Yuehai Pavilion, while I'm just a small-time clerk...
Clerk Zhao: Argh.. No, I have to work harder!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Clerk Zhao: Back to it? Goodness, you're so hardworking...
Clerk Zhao: I should get back too, I can't keep wasting time here...
