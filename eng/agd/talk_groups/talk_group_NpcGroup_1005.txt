Paimon: Hello, are you here to compete in The Crux Clash?
Uncle Yun: You bet I am, have you put your names down yet?
Traveler: Not yet.
Uncle Yun: Well, I'd have a look at the entrance criteria if I were you. They don't allow just anyone to take part.
Uncle Yun: The Clash is a comprehensive test of fighting ability. Anyone who turns up for show over skill is gonna get their butt handed to them.
Uncle Yun: Tsk, nobody wants to see that, right?
Paimon: Yeah, we heard a rule about that. So Paimon's wondering... are you a renowned fighter?
Uncle Yun: Hahaha, me? Only a former runner-up in the Chihu Rock Freestyle Combat Summit! Oh yeah...
Traveler: Former...
Paimon: Uh-huh... Also, that doesn't sound like the most official tournament out there...
Uncle Yun: What!? You... Nonsense! Have you been living under a rock? It's been going on for years! There were plenty of competitors when I took part!
Uncle Yun: Not to mention, I've helped the Millelith catch Treasure Hoarders before! There were two of them trying to escape — I soon sorted them out.
Uncle Yun: They tried to sneak past me under the cover of darkness... Ha! They didn't know what hit 'em.
Uncle Yun: I planted a left hook on the skinnier one's face and sent him flying. Then, the big guy pulled out a knife!
Uncle Yun: I stood my ground, of course. A roundhouse kick sent the blade hurtling into a beam above us.
Traveler: Sounds, uh... impressive.
Uncle Yun: Hahaha, I told you! Unarmed, outnumbered two to one, but I still got the upper hand!
Uncle Yun: I'm not saying I came out completely unscathed of course, but the fact remains that I did manage to subdue the both of them... AND hand them over to the Millelith. I received quite the commendation! Oh yeah...
Paimon: Uh-huh... But for us, even four or five Treasure Hoarders at a time is all in a day's work...
Traveler: Thanks for letting us know...
Paimon: Mm-hmm... Alright, we're gonna keep looking around.
Uncle Yun: I'll see you in the arena. Tsk, but I don't plan on losing to a pair of children any time soon!
Traveler: Sounds, um... dangerous.
Traveler: Runner-up...
Traveler: We just wanted to take a look around first.

Paimon: Hi there, are you here for The Crux Clash too?
Chai Yi: That's right. Nothing beats real-life combat for honing your skills. That's what our master taught us.
Chai Yi: But this tournament is more than just a chance to put training into practice — it's also a chance for us to obtain the Masterless Vision.
Liang: Exactly! With a Vision, we'd quickly become our master's top students.
Paimon: This master of yours must be pretty incredible, huh... Are they someone famous?
Chai Yi: Famous? He's the founder of the Lingshan Clan, and his skills are unparalleled! Liang and I are both proud disciples of his.
Traveler: The Lingshan Clan...?
Chai Yi: You probably wouldn't have heard of it, it was founded quite recently. The clan is nowhere near as famous as the master himself, anyway.
Chai Yi: He's got to be a grandmaster or something. He's created many different styles of kung fu, and countless other clans have borrowed extensively from him.
Chai Yi: To the Lingshan Clan, he teaches a special technique known as "force dispersal."
Paimon: "Force dispersal"?
Chai Yi: It's a type of breathing exercise where you can train yourself to harness the energy around you and neutralize attacks without moving an inch.
Chai Yi: For example, our master can use it to alter the path of an attacking fist, or change the direction of an incoming stone, all without breaking a sweat!
Liang: One time, he sent a challenger flying into the air without lifting a finger!
Traveler: Is that really possible?
Chai Yi: It sure is! But it's extremely difficult to cultivate this ability. We've been training for ages, and we're still getting to grips with the very basics. There's no way we could use it proficiently yet.
Liang: *sigh* We're clearly not that naturally gifted, or we would have at least gotten the gist by now... If we don't start making progress soon, we'll probably run out of money to pay the tuition fees and still have nothing to show for all our training...
Paimon: There's a tuition fee!?
Liang: Of course! This is a grandmaster we're talking about here. He doesn't have time to waste. If you want face-to-face training, you've gotta show you're sincere about it.
Chai Yi: *sigh* But here we are, having trained under him directly all this time without even a hint of improvement. Master is getting increasingly impatient with us.
Chai Yi: Recently, though, we heard that a Vision bearer joined the Guhua Clan and made pretty much instant progress in their training.
Liang: So, if we can get our hands on a Vision, too, maybe we can finally make our master proud!
Traveler: A Vision won't make you better at martial arts.
Chai Yi: Well, we have to try something new, otherwise, we're stuck in the same situation.
Liang: Exactly, it can't hurt to try. And if it turns out it does work, the Lingshan Clan will go down in history!
Liang: Folks will come from far and wide. Heck, we could even become the dominant martial arts clan in all of Liyue!
Traveler: Well... that's the spirit.
Chai Yi: See you in the arena!
Traveler: Can't fault you for trying...
Traveler: There may be other reasons why you can't seem to master this technique...
Traveler: Doesn't ring a bell.

Zhuhan: Qingce Village Armwrestling Champion, huh... *sigh* Alright, you're signed up...
Zhuhan: Next please... what's your name?
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Zhuhan: #Traveler... Wait! A—Aren't you...!?
Clash Competitor: #Did I hear that right? Traveler?
Clash Competitor: Is it really them?
Clash Competitor: ...Huh? Aren't they a Vision bearer, though? Why are they trying to enter The Clash?
Zhuhan: Uh... I—I have to ask... aren't you the traveler that helped Liyue fight off that ancient god...?
Traveler: Correct.
Clash Competitor: #It's really {F#her}{M#him}!
Clash Competitor: The one that spoke with Lady Keqing at the Rite of Parting!
Clash Competitor: #Oh! Oh! I wonder if I can get {F#her}{M#his} autograph later?
Zhuhan: I—I trust you are aware that... only those without Visions can enter the tournament?
Traveler: I don't have a Vision.
Zhuhan: Really? B—But from what I've heard, the things you're capable of in combat are... nothing short of extraordinary... You walk into the most dangerous situations imaginable, face off against all sorts of monsters — even the Fatui — and always come out on top!
Paimon: #Yup! {F#She}{M#He} still doesn't have a Vision though. See for yourself!
Zhuhan: My apologies, I didn't mean to be rude. I'm sure a great hero like yourself would have no reason to lie. Now, could I ask you to provide a few claims to fame?
Zhuhan: It's just a formality for you, of course, but I have to make a record of competitors' achievements as part of the sign-up process...
Zhuhan: So far I've got "Defeated the ancient god, Osial," so that's one. Do you... have any others?
Traveler: I defeated a Fatui Harbinger.
Paimon: Yeah, and also a dragon, too! Put down "Battle with Stormterror"!
Clash Competitor: Whoa...
Clash Competitor: #Might as well declare {F#her}{M#him} the champion already.
Clash Competitor: I wonder if it's too late to withdraw?
Zhuhan: Okay, um... that's plenty... Actually, this is the most dazzling track record I've ever seen, by a long shot...
Zhuhan: Right, your registration is complete. Now, a brief word about the prize.
Zhuhan: A great hero such as yourself can surely only be here for one thing — to win the tournament and claim the grand prize, namely, a Vision.
Paimon: Oh, we're not here for that. We're here because Captain Beidou promised to take us to Inazuma if we win the tournament.
Clash Competitor: There's another prize too? First I've heard of it!
Clash Competitor: Beidou must have upped the stakes this time to attract top talent!
Clash Competitor: But why would anyone want to go somewhere as dangerous as Inazuma?
Zhuhan: ...I see, so... I take it you discussed your terms with Beidou in advance, then.
Traveler: Everyone's misunderstanding the situation.
Zhuhan: Well, nobody expected you to sign up to a tournament like this... I can hardly believe it myself, to be honest...
Zhuhan: Anyway, the qualifying rounds are about to begin. I'll leave you to your preparation.
Paimon: Hey, so, Paimon's thinking about that whole "no Vision bearers" rule in this tournament.
Paimon: Even though you don't have a Vision, most people in Teyvat think that you can't manipulate the elements without one.
Paimon: So Paimon thinks you probably shouldn't use your elemental abilities during the tournament. Y'know, just to avoid any misunderstandings.
Traveler: I'm just not that interested in Visions, that's all.
Zhuhan: Well, I'm sure a great hero has an important reason for being here.
Traveler: I saved Dvalin.
Paimon: Yeah, put that down! And also, "Defeated the Fatui Harbinger, Childe."
Traveler: I'm the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius.
Paimon: Yeah! Also, don't forget to mention that previous battles include, but are not limited to "Stormterror" Dvalin and Fatui Harbinger, Childe.

## Talk

Paimon: In any case, looking at the competition, it should still be pretty easy for you to win even without using any elements, right?
Traveler: Makes sense.
Paimon: Alright, it's showtime! You got this!

## Talk

Zhuhan: You seem like you're raring to go. Are you ready to compete?
Traveler: Yes, I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Good, then please follow me into the arena.
Traveler: Not quite.
Zhuhan: Not a problem, there's still time. Make sure you're fully prepared!

Zhuhan: You seem like you're raring to go. Are you ready to compete?
Traveler: Yes, I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Good, then please follow me into the arena.
Traveler: Not quite.
Zhuhan: Not a problem, there's still time. Make sure you're fully prepared!

## Talk

Zhuhan: Your opponent in the semi-finals is new to The Crux Clash, but he has quickly become the dark horse of the tournament.
Zhuhan: I do not doubt your abilities, but I would suggest that you make sure you are fully prepared before you begin.
Paimon: #Relax! My {F#girl}{M#guy}'s at the top of {F#her}{M#his} game, {F#she}{M#he} ain't gonna lose!
Traveler: I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Okay. Follow me.
Traveler: Interesting... getting a few butterflies over here.
Zhuhan: Don't worry, take some time to compose yourself.

## Talk

Uncle Yun: Ah, it's you, haha! I watched your match. What a stunning performance!
Uncle Yun: I myself was eliminated in the third round. *sigh* Shame... If only I could have advanced one more round...
Paimon: Ah, maybe next time, huh? By the way, do you happen to know who else advanced to the final round?
Uncle Yun: Why, yes. He's the same one who defeated me. He is a formidable opponent, quick on his feet and swift to take advantage of his opponent's missteps.
Uncle Yun: I faltered for but a brief moment, but before I knew it, he had me on the floor.
Uncle Yun: Given my stature, I have no fear of squaring off with physically strong opponents. But faced with a nimble, agile opponent such as him... I found myself completely out of my league...
Uncle Yun: Still — I'm sure he'll be no match for you, haha!

## Talk

Paimon: Hey there... uh, but where did the other guy go?
Liang: He tried to use force dispersal to deflect a punch, but instead he took it straight to the nose. There was blood all over the place...
Liang: His opponent was pretty freaked out by it. He kept asking him "why didn't you dodge?" But he was pretty much out cold by that point and couldn't reply.
Liang: "Why don't you dodge?" they ask... Because to not dodge is the very essence of Lingshan Clan kung fu. It's just that he hadn't quite mastered it yet.
Traveler: How did your match go?
Liang: Don't even get me started... I spent all my energy helping him get from here to the boat to take him back to the harbor. But by the time I got back, my scheduled match time had already passed, and I had to forfeit.
Liang: I don't dare tell my master about this... Otherwise, I'd never hear the end of it.
Liang: Sorry, I shouldn't be complaining in front of you like this. I'm afraid I'm still a bit out of sorts at the moment, so I probably won't be able to help you with whatever you were here to ask me about.
Paimon: Oh, alright then... hope your buddy makes a swift recovery. Hang in there!
Liang: Thanks, I'll do my best...

Clitopho: Thanks for saving me! I was beginning to think that I might become dog food at this rate...
Traveler: You lot keep dogs?
Clitopho: Hey now, that's not a good joke.
Traveler: And how did you end up in this sorry state?
Clitopho: Me? I was helping Erge out... But I screwed up and got chucked into this cage.
Traveler: And who's this Erge?
Clitopho: Him? He's from Mingyun Village. Used to work over there. After they ran the ore veins dry, he came to The Chasm. Did pretty well too. Made foreman, I believe.
Clitopho: Then... you know the story. The Chasm went "woosh," and the miners went "whoa," and the Ministry of Civil Affairs did a "Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?"
Clitopho: And the Qixing bigwigs did a "ahem-ahem!" and the Millelith came and went "hmph-hmph-hmph!"
Paimon: What the heck is this guy saying?
Traveler: Try speaking the common tongue, please.
Clitopho: Well, in the end, the mine was closed and the miners went out of work. And when miners get put out of a job, what do you think they'll do they do to make ends meet, hmm?
Clitopho: Well, what I'm saying is Erge was an experienced miner who barely ever saw the light of day in his life, and who had just made foreman at 40... and then suddenly, it was all gone!
Clitopho: So, what would he do, and where?
Paimon: Uh, join... the Treasure Hoarders?
Clitopho: Exactly! See, now you're thinking like a Hoarder!
Clitopho: But lemme give you some sage advice: it might be best not to do anything illegal. The Treasure Hoarders aren't good people, no, not at all. And there's no going back once you've gone too far into a life of crime...
Paimon: Uh-huh, that's right... Paimon won't ever become a Treasure Hoarder...
Paimon: —Which is pretty rich, coming from you!
Clitopho: Hahahaha! I mean... Well, let's not joke about this anymore. In any case, what I meant to say was that people don't necessarily join the Treasure Hoarders because of some inherent evil in their hearts.
Clitopho: But for Erge, the compensation from the Ministry of Civil Affairs should have been enough to let him start over in an honest profession, and yet he chose this path.
Clitopho: I guess to each his own, huh? Maybe some people just can't take the pain in the short term, and choose a perilous road of bringing others pain instead. Perhaps this is what we'd call "the other side of freedom" back in Mondstadt.
Traveler: So, tell me about, well, you.
Clitopho: Me? Just me? I'm no one important.
Clitopho: I'm from Mondstadt, and I haven't been a Hoarder long, nor have I been in Liyue long. I just came with a few senior members to get some ore.
Clitopho: I was following Erge around, doing some errands, helping them sneak around a bit, contacting our comrades down in the mines... and then, you know, I got caught by you while doing those things.
Paimon: That's not correct. You were in this cage well before we caught you doing anything.
Clitopho: *sigh* Well, I mucked up on one of my tasks, which caused our lads to get ambushed by someone...
Traveler: Now that was us.
Paimon: Ehe...
Clitopho: So that was really... I knew it was you!
Paimon: Oh, it was nothing...
Paimon: And anyway, we didn't know how you'd get involved in the whole thing, either.
Clitopho: Ugh... Anyway, I was sent by Erge to keep watch on our Weasel Thieves after that... And I made another mistake in allowing them to run amok. They stole all our stuff...
Paimon: Pfft... Hahaha!
Clitopho: Yes, yes, keep laughing. Just make sure your stomach stays in one piece while you're at it... Ugh, that was embarrassing.
Clitopho: Still after that, Erge sent me down to find some secret passage. I did find it... and then the earthquake happened! Nearly buried us all alive, too!
Traveler: You know what? I think... that might have been us, too.
Paimon: Ooh, that's right! That must've happened when we destroyed... uh, unsealed the Bedrock Keys. It was a pretty big earthquake, too!
Clitopho: And if Erge was mad at me before, now he was absolutely hopping mad!
Clitopho: "You worthless piece of trash! I'll bet the Millelith sent you here to sabotage us, didn't they?"
Clitopho: "And you did wreck us, didn't you? Let our Weasel Thieves run off, did you? Boys, put him in the Weasel Thief cage! We'll settle scores with him once we're done with this transaction!"
Clitopho: ...That's what he said.
Clitopho: And then he locked me in this cage. Might have forgotten to mention that.
Paimon: Ahahahaha! Paimon almost feels bad for Erge!
Clitopho: Well, yes, he did get slapped around by the two of you. Twice.
Clitopho: Not... not that I'm feeling sorry for him, of course! I'm just glad that you came to my rescue. I'd be dead meat otherwise.
Traveler: Ah, what a shame that we don't keep dogs either.

Khedive: #Hello, Traveler! It's great to see you here.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Khedive: A field study, to record and research ancient life forms and their remains. Well, and I'm also here to observe the abnormalities in the geological layers.
Paimon: And you're not going down there yourself?
Khedive: Me? Go down there? No, of course not.
Khedive: I mean, I did pay for this exploration team to be set up. I'll fork out the Mora, you do the work. My research gets done, you get paid. I'm happy, you're happy. See?
Khedive: That's how that works.
Paimon: ...This guy is really annoying.
Traveler: Bye.
Khedive: Well, don't let me keep you too long.

Taliesin: #We meet again, golden-haired Traveler!
Traveler: Taliesin, have you come for a duel?
Paimon: Wait, what are you saying?
Taliesin: Haha, I'm here to get some inspiration, of course! Listen to this: the hero without a past, bereft of any clan, and their loyal fairy retainer!
Paimon: No idea who you're talking about.
Traveler: Yup. No idea here either.
Taliesin: Look, look! O modest hero, do not cast your perplexed gaze towards the distant mountains, for in this benighted land, you are the very light itself!
Paimon: Eh?
Traveler: What...?
Taliesin: I'm talking about you! In my current written template, of course.
Traveler: Ah...
Paimon: Huh, so this guy can actually say things we understand.
Traveler: See you.
Taliesin: #See you, gold-haired Traveler!
