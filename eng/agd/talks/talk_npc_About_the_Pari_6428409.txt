Traveler: About the Pari...
Zurvan: We Pari exist to avert the catastrophe and cleanse the defilement.
Zurvan: The divine bird Simurgh drank the Amrita and mixed her Khvarena with the water's essence, thus creating countless beings.
Zurvan: Amongst the countless motes of Khvarena, the ones blessed with sentience are us, the Pari.
Zurvan: Our power comes from the primordial Amrita, and one day, so too will our power flow back to its source.
