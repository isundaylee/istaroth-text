# Saurian Versus Mountain

Tlatem: He doesn't like you, so scram!
Impatient Thief: Little runt... What's with you and the Saurian? You know him or something?
Qica: Roar... Rawrrrr!
Impatient Thief: Oh, look, he's getting impatient. Alright then, whelp, stand aside. We don't hit kids.
Impatient Thief: Bring the bag, boys. Bet you this Saurian'll sell for a good price.
Tlatem: Don't come any closer! And don't blame me if you get hurt!
Impatient Thief: W—Wait, you mean you're going to hit us? Hahahaha! You hear that, boys? He's gonna take us on!
Impatient Thief: Ooh, kiddo, I'm sho scared, I'm twembling in my bwoots. But if you say so... don't blame me if you get hurt.
Qica: Rawr! Rawrrr! Rawr!
Impatient Thief: Tch... Isn't this Saurian a noisy one. Alright, kid, just go have a nap over—
Traveler: You're the ones who could use a nap.
Tlatem: #{M#Big Bro}{F#Big Sis}! They're trying to take Qica!
Qica: Rroo! Wrroo!
Impatient Thief: ...Hey, you. How about you step aside? We won't hurt you. Heck, we'll give you a share. How's that sound?
Traveler: No hurting Qica.
Impatient Thief: Huh. Guess that's that, then. Well, I'm sure you know the rules. Let's get dangerous!
Impatient Thief: Let's go, lads!
Traveler: Who died and made you king?
Traveler: Hope you don't mind if I chip in.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Tlatem: #Thanks for saving us, {M#Big Bro}{F#Big Sis}.
Qica: Hrroo, roooh...
Tlatem: This place was too far from the tribe — if you hadn't shown up, there's no way I'd have been able to alert Illapa before Qica got caught.
Traveler: What are you two doing over here, anyway?
Tlatem: Climbing practice, as always — but we got hungry halfway through.
Tlatem: So the two of us went foraging... But before we knew it, we'd wandered off pretty far...
Tlatem: By the time we'd had our fill, we were a long, long way out. Mom's going to give it to me for sure when we get back...
Tlatem: Thanks again for saving us. Take these Cacahuatls — I only just plucked 'em!
Tlatem: We'll head back as quick as we can. Come on, Qica!
Qica: Rawr! Rawrrr! Rawr!
