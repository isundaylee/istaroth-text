Lisa: Ah, it's you, cutie. I knew we'd cross paths again.
Traveler: What are you looking at, Lisa?
Lisa: Oh, just these painted utensils in this shop, aren't they exquisite? I'm thinking about buying some to take back for decoration.
Lisa: And those plates... if we serve tea on them, Jean wouldn't be able to resist, even in the middle of work.
Traveler: I don't think those are for sale.
Lisa: Oh, not for sale? Honestly, why put it in the shop if you don't intend to sell it?
Lisa: How disappointing! Ah, they're so beautiful, too...
Traveler: I think those are only for display.
