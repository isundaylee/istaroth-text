# The Proud "Beret Society"


## Talk 1

Paimon: Okay, Paimon sees what you meant now...
Paimon: Seems like they really don't want to talk to us, so let's just head back...

## Talk 2

Paimon: It's finally evening... Wriothesley's probably wrapped up his investigation.
Paimon: Paimon has no idea what that guy's thinking... Let's just go find him and ask him what he's really up to.

## Talk 3

Traveler: (The hats are definitely being used to hide a secret. But there's nothing wrong with the hats themselves...)
Traveler: (But if there's nothing on her head, why did Avice feel the need to remove her hat?)
Traveler: (From the way Dougier acted, he must have known from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to find any evidence.)
Traveler: (I need to think about this a bit more... Just what is Dougier trying to hide?)
Traveler: (I can't seem to make a connection here.)

## Talk 4

Rigas: Hey, you there, newbie!
Paimon: Uh, hello? Are you talking to Paimon?
Rigas: Yep, I'm talking to you. Now, why don't you follow my lead and take a deep breath, before letting everything out like this?
Rigas: Hah—!
Paimon: Eek!
Traveler: What are you doing?
Rigas: Haha, that's how I pump myself up every day. A lot of my friends have found it super useful, too.
Rigas: With one shout, you can release all the fatigue, resentment and unpleasantness from your lungs, and return to the day with all the optimism in the world!
Rigas: Why don't you also give it a try? I promise that it will work!
Paimon: P—Paimon's gonna pass...
Rigas: Hahaha, feeling shy? That's alright. As long as you remember this trick, it will come in handy one day.
Rigas: Just remember to take a deep breath and let it all out if you find yourself at your wit's end.
Traveler: That was really loud.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Alright, we've talked to everybody... It sure sounds like they're all pretty happy.
Paimon: That would explain why Wriothesley only had good things to say about this place.
Paimon: Huh, it looks like they're starting to wrap up their conversation as well. Let's go over to them.
Dougier: Of course, Your Grace. I will attend to those matters right away.
Wriothesley: Okay, then I don't have anything else to add. Oh, you're back — what did you think about this place?
Wriothesley: Now, note that your review will also affect my review of Dougier and the Society as a whole.
Dougier: Wait. I didn't know they were also a part of the evaluation process...
Dougier: It's all right with me, though. I'm pretty confident about our growth and activities.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's... pretty good?
Paimon: Don't think anyone expected you to get a society going here of all places!
Traveler: Same here.
Dougier: Ah, so it seems that you were able to get a sense of our vision and values. That's all I can ask for, really.
Wriothesley: The prisoners here all have very different personalities and psychological needs.
Wriothesley: Our needs are like violent beasts. If we can't face them properly, they'll grow restless and enraged, causing pain and conflict.
Wriothesley: But if we can placate them, they will lose their fangs, and even be converted into fuel for far nobler pursuits.
Wriothesley: Which is why in my opinion, learning to reconcile with oneself is the first step on the path to redemption.
Dougier: You've hit the nail on the head, Your Grace. Before I founded the Society, I had met too many people who could not come to terms with themselves...
Dougier: And I'm sure that a part of your support is rooted in your desire to help those people find their way.
Paimon: And Paimon thought everyone was enjoying life just fine working and fighting...
Wriothesley: Of course, that lifestyle is more than enough for some people in the Fortress. For others, though, they would just be useless distractions.
Dougier: Speaking of fightin'... I'm not sure if you knew this, but even His Grace sometimes fights in the ring.
Paimon: Whaaat!? You fight in the ring, too? Wearing those hi-tech boxing gloves of yours...?
Wriothesley: I almost never need them.
Traveler: Almost never, you say...
Faissolle: Ah...
Paimon: Hey, isn't that the guy who lost his hat? Did you come here to relax, too?
Faissolle: !!!
Boulmier: ...
Rigas: ...
Paimon: What's wrong? Did you forget about us already?
Wriothesley: Are you feeling alright? You are looking a little pale.
Faissolle: N—No, I'm fine... Thank you for helping me get my hat back.
Faissolle: I... I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
Paimon: He's still as weird as before... Paimon's kinda used to it by now, though.
Wriothesley: Dougier, do you know what's up with him?
Dougier: Hmm, I'm also not too sure about that. As far as I recall, he's always been a little strange. I'll check up on him later.
Dougier: After all, it's my responsibility as the leader to make sure that no one falls through the cracks.
Wriothesley: We'll leave him to you, then. Hmm... Where were we before we got sidetracked?
Traveler: Something about useless distractions.
Wriothesley: Oh, right, about that. You might have thought that I was joking, but in a place like that, everyone will use everything in their power to win.
Wriothesley: And when emotions runs high, things often spiral out of control. That'd be when I'd need to pull out my gloves to maintain order.
Wriothesley: Sometimes, you might need more than just gloves as well... This pair of handcuffs has also come in handy quite a number of times.
Wriothesley: ...Oops.
Paimon: Oh, isn't that that awful gem? You're still carrying it with you?
Wriothesley: Yeah, I kept it on me because of its special qualities. It won't affect me as long as I don't let it come into contact with my skin.
Dougier: Go on, you guys, pick up the item for His Grace, would you?
Aucelet: Y—Yes, right away.
Dougier: That gem shines with quite the dazzling light. I hope it hasn't been damaged. Your Grace, please let me know if there's something wrong with it now.
Wriothesley: Hmm, it still looks good to me. Say, Dougier, have you ever seen a gem like this?
Dougier: Never, Your Grace. Don't think I've ever been rich enough to afford this kind of thing.
Wriothesley: Hahaha, I guess that's fair.
Wriothesley: We've already gone over most of the things that I wanted to talk about, so let's wrap up for the day. The Traveler also has some other plans, after all.
Paimon: Uh...
Dougier: Got it, Your Grace. Take care, everyone. I'll take you to the exit.
Dougier: Traveler, Paimon, it was an honor. I'm sure everyone would love it if you were to visit again. That goes for you as well, Your Grace — we wish you all the best in endeavors.
Wriothesley: Mm, and same to you.
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon doesn't think we made any plans for the rest of the day... Why did you lie to him?
Wriothesley: Well, what's your opinion of the Society now that you've taken a look around their headquarters?
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon thinks it's pretty chill. Weren't you complimenting them the entire time as well?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember exactly what you said, but wasn't it something along the lines of encouraging people to embrace their new lives with optimism?
Paimon: There's only one potential problem. If the Society does too good of a job managing and rehabilitating its members, you may be soon out of a job...
Wriothesley: Haha, that is certainly a possibility.
Wriothesley: But at this point in time, they are still reducing my workload by managing and rehabilitating prisoners in my stead.
Wriothesley: I wanted to see just how much they've managed to accomplish, and also get a sense of Dougier's plans for the future.
Wriothesley: I arranged for a meeting out of curiosity, but then... I noticed some faint hints of dissonance.
Paimon: Dissonance?
Wriothesley: #I'm sure Traveler has sensed it, too.
Traveler: It's a bit hard to put it into words...
Wriothesley: As expected, you also picked up on it.
Wriothesley: The whole truth is a bit complicated, so I'll explain everything to you later. I can tell you right now, though, that this was an unexpected turn of events...
Wriothesley: I had hoped to take care of it in secret, but now, a confrontation may no longer be avoidable. It's hard to predict what might happen next.
Paimon: Ehh? You've completely lost Paimon...
Wriothesley: Why don't you take this opportunity to check back on the gathering place? Just tell them you left something of yours there by accident.
Wriothesley: If my hypothesis is correct, Dougier should already have left...
Wriothesley: And with his watchful eye removed, you may well get a very different reception from the members.
Paimon: Uhh... Can't you just tell us exactly what to expect?
Wriothesley: I'm just following the most popular playbook in Fontaine. Investigate, obtain evidence, and then use the truth to render judgment...
Wriothesley: It's been so long since I got to watch a performance at Opera Epiclese that I've even begun to miss it.
Traveler: I'll trust you for now.
Wriothesley: I'll explain everything to you later. But right now, we need to seize this opportunity.
Wriothesley: Find out what you can from them now, while they're all in one place. We might not get another chance like this anytime soon.
Traveler: I'll take this as another one of your jokes.
Traveler: But there's something off about that place.
Traveler: Something about boxing gloves.
Traveler: So... instead...
Traveler: It seems alright... on the surface.
Dougier: Ah... Yeah, you're right. By themselves, our resources probably don't feel like much.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh, it's just as Wriothesley said... Seems like Dougier's no longer here.
Paimon: You said you felt there was something off about this place, right? So let's see if we can feel something out.
Paimon: Paimon will do her best to help!
Traveler: Uhh... I also don't know where to start.
Boulmier: Wait, you guys are...
Paimon: We're really sorry, we just realized that we'd lost something, and we figured we might have left it here by accident! We'll be on our way as soon as we find it.
Boulmier: O—Okay...
Traveler: Did anyone see a glass bottle by any chance?
Boulmier: ...
Aucelet: ...
Rigas: ...
Paimon: Nobody?
Traveler: It was about the size of my hand.
Aucelet: ...
Paimon: It's okay, there's no need to be nervous! It's not like we lost a whole bag of Mora or anything.
Paimon: We'll just look for it ourselves if none of you caught a glimpse of it. We're not gonna tell Wriothesley anything, don't worry.
Rigas: I—I'll go find Mr. Dougier...
Paimon: No need! We're just looking for something. Why does he have to know?
Rigas: ...
Traveler: (This is incredibly suspicious.)
Paimon: We can look around for it, yeah?
Boulmier: Uh...
Traveler: (Feels like they're all... terrified of something.)
Traveler: I was using it to store some spice powder.
Traveler: Let's see if we can strike up a conversation.

## Talk 7

Wriothesley: Oh, you're back. How were things at their headquarters?
Paimon: It was as if they had all turned into completely different people...
Traveler: They all clammed up.
Wriothesley: Hmm, that would prove my suspicions.
Wriothesley: The "dissonance" I mentioned earlier was precisely that fleeting moment of fear behind the cheerful facade.
Traveler: Like that one guy we found hiding in the box.
Paimon: Right, he was acting super scared too when we saw him at the gathering place!
Paimon: Hmm... Actually, hasn't he just been acting super paranoid since we first met?
Wriothesley: And that is precisely why I took his hat.
Paimon: Oh, so the one who started it all was...
Paimon: It was you all along!
Wriothesley: It's because I wanted to figure out what's really going on.
Wriothesley: I don't believe any of Dougier's talk about unstable mental states.
Traveler: How long have you been investigating this?
Wriothesley: Not too long. Dougier made very elaborate preparations for my visit, but I don't know... it almost feels like the performance was too elaborate.
Paimon: Okay, but if you think something's wrong, why don't you just take the whole Society into custody?
Paimon: Aren't you the Duke? You can do whatever you want in this place.
Wriothesley: Haha, maybe you're actually a better fit for the position than I am. Just give me the word, and I'll hand you the cuffs.
Wriothesley: In all seriousness, however, cuffs and the like should be used sparingly. They're mostly for show.
Wriothesley: Everything I do is on display. The way people see me act determines the kind of world I can create down here.
Wriothesley: And I've always striven to appear fair and reasonable to the people.
Paimon: Uhh... That sounds a bit deep. Paimon's not sure she got all of it...
Traveler: The Duke's actions will set the tone.
Wriothesley: Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head. I have to lead by example if I want to maintain expectations of justice and order.
Wriothesley: And that's why even though Dougier had already let a few things slip, I didn't want to turn on him without irrefutable evidence.
Paimon: Alright. So you're saying, Dougier has figured out some way to control the members of his society...
Paimon: And even though the members are acting all optimistic and motivated, it's all just a show.
Traveler: I doubt it's that simple.
Wriothesley: Indeed. He certainly seems to be using some coercive methods to turn his members into the most upbeat and motivated group of people you've ever seen. But that won't turn out well in the long run.
Wriothesley: I have some faith, though, that some of the members understood the hint I gave during our visit.
Wriothesley: The line has been set, and it's quite likely that a fish will bite.
Paimon: ...Fish? Bite?
Wriothesley: Let's give them some time. My guards will need it to finish their investigation, too.
Wriothesley: You can find me in my office when the time comes.
Paimon: Hey, don't just leave before you've explained everything to Paimon! Heeeey!
Traveler: I feel like we're still missing something.
Traveler: The Duke's values will be emulated by the people.
Traveler: They were all acting super scared.

## Talk 8

Wriothesley: Oh, here you are. Did you manage to land a lucky pull on the Welfare Meals tonight?
Paimon: Let's just get straight to the point! Has anything else happened with the Society?
Wriothesley: Patience, Paimon. Even as the situation continues to brew, we still need to make sense of what we've learned so far, and go over any sticking points.
Wriothesley: I'm actually still thinking about the first thing that came to my mind when I noticed something amiss. Namely:
Wriothesley: Why didn't anyone come to me about it?
Paimon: Oh, that's a good point! Could whatever they're afraid of be so powerful that even you won't be able to do anything about it?
Wriothesley: But even if such a thing existed, how could they be so sure without checking with me first?
Wriothesley: It'd be one thing if it was just one or two people, but it seems like everyone's convinced that I won't be able to help.
Wriothesley: Which leads me to believe that it's more likely that they think I just wouldn't care to help them.
Traveler: Because you instigated Dougier in the first place?
Wriothesley: Yes, something like that. Dougier must have told them something to make them think I won't take their side.
Wriothesley: So it became imperative for me to refute that, and prove my true stance.
Wriothesley: Of course, I had originally planned to do this in a more covert way, but I had to improvise when you identified the guy who'd lost his hat with everyone present.
Wriothesley: There was no way to keep our investigation a secret after that.
Paimon: That makes sense... Wait, then does that mean it was all Paimon's fault?
Traveler: Now that you mention it...
Wriothesley: The last thing that guy wanted was for Dougier to find out that he'd lost it. He would've never brought the matter up on his own.
Wriothesley: But now, not only has Dougier found out that he'd lost his hat, he's also realized that we were the ones who found it...
Wriothesley: That likely set his internal alarms off all at once.
Traveler: The hats must be hiding something...
Wriothesley: Yes, that's the conclusion I came to as well. It's the only thing that could explain the fear.
Wriothesley: If we didn't act right then and there, Dougier would probably come up with some other way to hide the truth, and we'd be back to square one.
Wriothesley: So after giving the matter some thought, I tossed that black gem onto the ground.
Wriothesley: I must say, I was pretty satisfied with the results.
Paimon: Ah, so you did that on purpose!?
Wriothesley: Yes, that's right. Of course, that box was discovered as a part of our investigation of the Society from the very beginning.
Wriothesley: I had no way to know if any of the members had actually seen the gem before, but since I had to do something, I decided to gamble.
Traveler: So that's the "hint" you were talking about earlier.
Wriothesley: Right, and I said back there that I had no idea what the gem represented. That should've been enough to let people know that it's still early days for my investigation.
Wriothesley: And since I was traveling with you, heroes who have never turned a blind eye to evil and injustice...
Wriothesley: They would also understand that we're here to help, rather than to tolerate or uphold the status quo.
Paimon: You used us as a part of your plan, too!
Traveler: So that's why you wanted us to come along.
Wriothesley: My apologies. There was no time and quite a lot to explain, so I figured it might be easier to just let you see a few things for yourselves.
Wriothesley: But I can assure you that I've now told you everything there is to know.
Wriothesley: Of course, you're under no obligation, but I would really appreciate it if you could continue to lend me your support and help me figure out the true secret behind the Society.
Wriothesley: Would you be willing to lend me your support?
Paimon: Ugh, but Paimon's still mad at you...
Traveler: Sure, if all you need is some help planning.
Wriothesley: You have my thanks.
Wriothesley: Now, there are still two outstanding matters in our investigation. The first is the secret of the hats.
Wriothesley: I've examined one before. There was nothing suspicious about the item itself.
Wriothesley: The other is the true purpose of the black gem. We haven't been able to get anything out of anyone with actual knowledge of it.
Wriothesley: It's my hope that a brave fish will take my bait, and venture outside of their dark and murky pool.
Wriothesley: I'll put some music on while we wait.
Black Screen Text: You spend some time waiting in Wriothesley's office...
Avice: ...Excuse me, Your Grace, but may I come in? I'm afraid that someone's been following me.
Wriothesley: Please do.
Traveler: Sure, if I just need to fight them off.
Traveler: Because you've been working with Dougier all along?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Argh, just what's up with that guy!? He makes Paimon really, really mad!
Paimon: We should have shown him his place!
Wriothesley: Sooner or later, all will pay the price for their arrogance.
Wriothesley: He must have been well-prepared for this exact scenario, or he wouldn't have dared to be so openly hostile — all the more reason for us to be patient.
Wriothesley: The entire Society are his hostages. His subordinates would definitely react if he were taken into custody.
Wriothesley: And that's why he dared to bare his fangs right in front of me.
Traveler: One thing's for sure, we won't let him get away with this.
Wriothesley: The true secret of the Society is neither on the hat, nor on the members' heads.
Wriothesley: Dougier probably knew this from the very beginning, which is why he didn't panic.
Wriothesley: However, if we were to look at the rules, it would also seem like the head has to be the place where they're keeping all of their secrets.
Paimon: Yeah, none of this makes sense to Paimon, either... What are they trying to hide?
Traveler: So now, our biggest problem is...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Avice: I apologize for my lack of composure. These two are the guests that came with you to our gathering place, correct?
Traveler: You know us?
Avice: Yes, my lover Faissolle told me all about you. Please help us, Your Grace, he's in great danger right now...
Wriothesley: Slow down, take a deep breath, and start from the top. What happened at the Society?
Avice: I'm sorry, Your Grace, I will try... I think I should start from when you saw Faissolle last.
Paimon: You mean, when we saw him at the gathering place?
Avice: Yes, he fled immediately, but many members are hot on his heels.
Avice: Thankfully, he still managed to meet up with me, and explain everything that had happened.
Avice: Now that he's lost Dougier's trust, what awaits him is agonizing "censure."
Wriothesley: Censure?
Avice: Censure is Dougier's method of establishing control, as well as the thing we all fear the most.
Avice: Rather than listening to me explain what it is, Your Grace, please just let me show it to you...
Avice: Every secret may be found within—
Avice: !?
Dougier: Ah, here you are. I was wondering where you had run off to in such a hurry.
Dougier: Please excuse us, Your Grace. It was never our intention to disturb you like this. You see, Avice's mental state has been rather unstable ever since she arrived at the Fortress...
Dougier: She rambles often, and has hallucinations. It may be best to dismiss her babbling as random gibberish.
Wriothesley: I don't recall hearing a knock, or giving permission for you to come in.
Dougier: My apologies. I merely did not wish for Your Grace to be alarmed. Had I not been so focused on recovering her, I would have followed all the rules of etiquette to the letter. So, please forgive my discourtesy.
Paimon: Hah, like we'd believe you!
Traveler: We know exactly what you're thinking.
Dougier: Please, there's no need to be upset. It's only natural to want to side with the poor, sick girl, but I know His Grace to be a reasonable man.
Wriothesley: Well then, what if the reasonable man wants to hear the lunatic out?
Dougier: That would be perfectly fine with me. Oh, and just so you know, we've also found the missing Mr. Faissolle. I have no idea why he was so upset about losing his hat, really.
Dougier: Thankfully, he has already returned to his senses. We've brought him back to our place, so there's no need to worry.
Avice: ...!
Avice: I'm sorry, Your Grace... I don't have anything more to say.
Wriothesley: This is what you're afraid of, correct? You can tell me everything. I'll do all I can for you.
Avice: I... I...
Avice: I've never seen that thing in my life.
Traveler: You can do it, Avice.
Avice: ...
Dougier: Your Grace, I don't think there's anything else she would like to say. Pressuring her will not get you anywhere.
Wriothesley: ...
Wriothesley: It's alright, Avice. As long as you tell me what it is that you're terrified of...
Wriothesley: No matter what it is, it will no longer be able to hurt you. I swear this on my name and honor as the Duke.
Dougier: Your Grace... *sigh* Forget it. I'll keep my mouth shut. I've already said everything I could say about the matter.
Avice: I'm sorry, Your Grace, but I really don't have anything more to say. Please... don't press me further.
Paimon: But... why?
Dougier: In that case, Avice and I will be off. Once again, please accept my apologies for disturbing your peaceful evening, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: Miss Avice, please show me your head. That is an order.
Black Screen Text: Wriothesley proceeds to examine Avice's head, but does not find anything suspicious.
Wriothesley: There's nothing there...
Dougier: Your Grace, I know you have long tired of my words, but please believe me when I say you've merely let your worries get to your head.
Dougier: The Society has never caused trouble for you or any of the guards at the Fortress. We've spent all of our time working hard and trying to lead better lives.
Dougier: Why are you doing everything in your power to prove our "guilt"? What's wrong with the current state of affairs?
Dougier: I'll do anything for you as long as you give me the word. Why are you so intent on getting rid of someone who's been unfalteringly loyal?
Wriothesley: Your words bore me. You know the consequences if I find you to be lying.
Dougier: Everything that I do, I do for the Fortress of Meropide. But Your Grace is welcome to visit us anytime to confirm the true intent of our activities.
Dougier: Alright, Avice, let's head back.
Traveler: You've got some nerve, showing your face here.
Traveler: Indeed, like we'd believe you.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler (Examine Books): (There's a good variety of books here, and it also looks like the selection is regularly updated. If nothing else, one can definitely find something here with which to pass the time.)
Traveler (Examine Books): (A member's diary is also displayed among the books. It was probably included for recruitment purposes.)

### Additional Talk 3

Boulmier: Please check out as many books as you may like. Just don't forget to return them to their proper places once you're done.

### Additional Talk 4

Aucelet: Life at the Society is rich and fulfilling. We all enjoy it immensely.

### Additional Talk 5

Rigas: There's no need to be embarrassed about it! Just embrace your emotions, and freely express it for all to hear!

### Additional Talk 6

Wriothesley: I have an idea, but...
Traveler: What a coincidence. So do I.
Paimon: Huh? What is it? Tell Paimon about it!
Traveler: Avice didn't take off her hat to draw attention to her head.
Wriothesley: You mean... this thing?
Wriothesley: So, she handed a key piece of evidence over to us without Dougier noticing.
Wriothesley: That would mean that Avice didn't stay silent out of fear. She stayed silent because she'd already given us what we needed.
Wriothesley: Let me take a look.
Black Screen Text: Wriothesley tinkers with the hair clip for a brief moment.
Wriothesley: I managed to remove this from the hair clip. It's long, slender, and conical, it's hollow on the inside, and looks something like a cross between a nail and a thorn.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's lost again...
Wriothesley: Let's see... What if we do this?
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing... Wait, some kind of dark liquid is leaking out of the gem...
Paimon: And... some of it has been absorbed by this thorny-looking thing...
Traveler: The gem is used as a container for a type of liquid.
Wriothesley: You've probably heard before that water is filled with the strongest emotions of humanity.
Wriothesley: With that in mind, this liquid is probably a highly concentrated solution of "fear."
Paimon: Ooh, so that's why even touching it will make you remember unpleasant things!
Traveler: So, with this infused thorn...
Wriothesley: Dougier would be able to "censure" others. I can only imagine how it would feel to have this directly injected into your brain...
Wriothesley: The moment it hits you... would be like being flooded with all the terrors you've ever experienced in your life.
Wriothesley: Agony, desolation, and an overwhelming sense of despair... No wonder they're all so terrified of it.
Paimon: So... was the hat meant to cover up their wounds?
Wriothesley: That might not even be all. Let's go get them right away.
Wriothesley: We can't let Dougier escape with all of the evidence.
Traveler: She did so to remove her hair clip.

### Additional Talk 7

Dougier: The Society is planning to host another event soon. We haven't had many new recruits recently, so...
Wriothesley: Ah, the one you mentioned to me before? The idea is sound, but I still have some concerns about the specifics...

### Additional Talk 8

Paimon: Then... what are you gonna do?
Wriothesley: Good question, what should I do... Hmm, maybe I'll drop by the Ring and sign myself up for a fight.
Paimon: Wait, so you're really just gonna make us work while you slack off!?

### Additional Talk 9

Paimon: Are you still organizing the bookshelves?
Boulmier: Yeah, and, I'm sorry, but... you can't check out the books right now.
Paimon: We weren't thinking about that to begin with! But weren't you super friendly just a moment ago?
Boulmier: S—Sorry...

### Additional Talk 10

Boulmier: S—Sorry...

### Additional Talk 11

Boulmier: You really can't check them out... Please understand...

### Additional Talk 12

Paimon: Hey, hello? Anyone home?
Aucelet: Hello... How can I help you?
Traveler: Can you give us that run-down again?
Aucelet: The Beret Society offers a variety of resources and benefits to its members, and... Uh... I mean, you've already heard my spiel. I don't know anything beyond what I've already told you.
Paimon: You don't know anything?
Aucelet: Ah, sorry, that's not what I meant... It's just... There's nothing more I can tell you.

### Additional Talk 13

Aucelet: Please... Please just leave me alone...

### Additional Talk 14

Paimon: Heeeey, big guy!
Rigas: Wh—What do you want...
