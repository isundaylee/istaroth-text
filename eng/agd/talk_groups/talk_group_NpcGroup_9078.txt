Traveler: How do you like it here?
Alhaitham: It's alright.
Alhaitham: I see that you opted for a diverse range of decorative styles.
Alhaitham: Doesn't entirely suit my preferences, but that's fine with me.
Traveler: Do you have any suggestions?
Alhaitham: It's hard to say.
Alhaitham: I value practicality. Aesthetics aren't generally something I put into consideration.
Alhaitham: But that's just my personal inclination. It may not work for you.
Alhaitham: After all, I'm not familiar with every single detail of your life.
Traveler: True.
Alhaitham: The top priority when furnishing a space is the owner's satisfaction.
Alhaitham: Everything else is secondary.

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Alhaitham: Sure, if you're mentally prepared.
Alhaitham: But before you say anything — I'm not very interested in small talk. If you need something, just get to the point.
Alhaitham: As for whether I'll help, it'll depend on the situation.
Traveler: Is that mentality because of work?
Alhaitham: You could say it's the product of life experience.
Alhaitham: If you want to live at a more leisurely pace, you can try copying a page or two from my book.
Traveler: Is that something you learned through interacting with others?
Alhaitham: Is it? I don't think I'd gain experience this valuable from standard social interactions.
Alhaitham: But now, you've learned something by interacting with me. Congratulations.

Traveler: Is there anything you want to do?
Alhaitham: I already do what I want every day, so I can't think of a substantial answer to that question right away.
Alhaitham: I'm content with things as they are now.
Traveler: You don't seem very busy most of the time.
Alhaitham: Oh? Do I give you that kind of impression?
Alhaitham: Very well then. I don't like having my hands full — it interferes with my thinking process.
Alhaitham: But that reminds me... I need to make myself look like I'm always occupied, so I can avoid things I don't want to do and people I don't want to interact with.
Alhaitham: You, on the other hand, have a vast social circle, so you must run into difficult people quite often.
Traveler: Is there a solution to that?
Alhaitham: I suggest that you ask them a few questions that they'll never find exact answers to.
Alhaitham: Once you divert their attention and energy into other matters, they should leave you alone rather quickly.
Traveler: Thank you. That was very helpful.
Alhaitham: Don't mention it.
Alhaitham: To some extent, I want everyone to lead the lives they want to live.
Alhaitham: That way, people will cause fewer headaches for each other.
Traveler: That's a pretty unique way of thinking.
Alhaitham: I figure most people would think similarly.
Alhaitham: Wouldn't it be great to live in a world without annoyances?

Traveler: Good morning, Alhaitham.
Alhaitham: Good morning. It looks like you already have everything planned out for today.
Alhaitham: Having things to do means you're being productive, while an empty schedule indicates a more leisurely day.
Alhaitham: Both are fine choices. I wish you all the best.

Alhaitham: Grilling meat looks easy, but it's actually difficult to do well.
Alhaitham: Everything we need is here. You should give it a shot.
