Yanbei: With the improvements to their internal structure, the organizers should be able to attract more sponsors and expand to at least three times this size after just a few more events...
Yanbei: #Hey, if it isn't Traveler and Paimon! I've heard so much about you. What a pleasant surprise to see you guys here!
Traveler: And you are...?
Yanbei: I'm just an ordinary clerk at the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs. I'm on a business trip to Sumeru and came by to check out the competition.
Paimon: Paimon didn't think we'd run into friends from Liyue! Are you competing?
Yanbei: Haha, I'll pass this time. I still have work to do. Being able to watch the event from the audience is satisfying enough already.
Yanbei: Although the event isn't as exciting as a real festival, I think it has potential. Maybe the organizers will make some internal adjustments in the future and attract more sponsors.
Yanbei: When that time comes, the Beast Tamers Tournament should be able to grow and maybe even become mainstream.
Paimon: More sponsors? Don't they already have that wealthy merchant, Elchingen, already?
Paimon: His wealth may not be as mind-blowing as a successful merchant from Liyue, but it's substantial nonetheless.
Yanbei: There will always be some doubt when you put all your eggs in one basket.
Yanbei: I don't know Mr. Elchingen's background too well, but according to the information I've gathered, the origin of a large portion of his Mora remains unknown.
Yanbei: Hosting an event with funds of questionable origin may not sit well with some people.
Yanbei: But I'm not from Fontaine, and it'd be impossible for me to know everything about every single Fontaine merchant. Maybe Elchingen earned his fortune gradually by doing business, and his peers didn't take notice of him.
Paimon: You have a point. It wouldn't hurt to be a little more cautious...
Traveler: That's a very thoughtful way of looking at it.
Yanbei: Thanks! Anyway, I'm just sharing my own thought process. If I were an employee working for the organizers, I would search for multiple sponsors to minimize the risk.
Yanbei: I hope what I said didn't ruin your mood.
Traveler: Improve internal structure?
Yanbei: Yep. The way I see it, many of the organizers are capable individuals, but they, unfortunately, don't have a say in anything. Almost everything is decided by that researcher, Kautilya.
Yanbei: This event would undoubtedly be much better if he were to allow those individuals to make some decisions.
Paimon: Thâ€”That's so complex... Paimon's having trouble following...
Yanbei: Haha, that's alright, everyone has their own area of expertise. It's actually my job to analyze commercial events. Ordinary people should just try to enjoy the event for what it is.
Traveler: I'll let you get back to it. Goodbye...
Yanbei: Sure. You two seem like you have a lot to do as well. Let's grab a cup of tea when you have the time!
