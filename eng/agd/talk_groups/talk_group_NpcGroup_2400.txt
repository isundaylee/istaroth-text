Sun Yu: Huh? What is it?

Traveler: Who are you?
Sun Yu: My liege, I am Sun Yu, disciple of the Guhua Clan; I have journeyed here to harness my inner energies... Well, to practice.
Sun Yu: Did you want something? If not, please do not disturb me.
Traveler: What's the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: Have you not heard of the renowned ancient arts of the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: *sigh* ...Oh well.
Sun Yu: In its glory days, the Guhua Brotherhood roamed the lands freely and none dared to challenge them.
Sun Yu: Their reputation for dual mastery of the polearm and sword was such that all the martial nomads in Teyvat had heard of it, and none doubted its veracity.
Sun Yu: Sadly, no party is everlasting... Centuries have passed, and while many Guhua relics remain, the great practitioners are long gone.
Sun Yu: After a slew of desertions, the Guhua Brotherhood regrouped as the much smaller Guhua Sect, with barely a few hundred disciples. Today's Guhua Clan is now all that is left of this grand tradition, with a mere handful of practitioners ...
Sun Yu: *sigh* ...
Traveler: Are you two all that's left of the Guhua Clan?
Sun Yu: Our numbers are reduced, yes, but not to that extent... It's just that the various disciples of our Clan have been scattered every corner of Liyue.
Sun Yu: Traveler, have you heard of one known as Xingqiu?
Sun Yu: He is a junior of mine, but he was the first among us to grasp the concept of the Martial Principle.
Sun Yu: He once wrote a mantra and utterly changed the legacy of the Guhua Clan.
Sun Yu: I don't know what became of him. Perhaps he's still roaming the land, doing good wherever he goes. Hahaha...
Traveler: Harnessing your inner energies?
Sun Yu: ...I guess there's no point hiding it from you if you're an outlander.
Sun Yu: The true purpose behind my journeying here is to seek divine guidance on the Way, to find a means of reviving the Guhua Clan.

Traveler: You two seem to get on really well.
Sun Yu: I've always treated her like a sister...
Sun Yu: We've always been inseparable when practicing martial arts, like a form to its shadow. I consider us equally matched, both in combat and in courage.
Sun Yu: Hence, I brought her here with me, that we might search for divine guidance and bring about the Guhua renaissance together.
Sun Yu: She has an odd temperament, normally being prone to chatter... Yet with me, she is like a completely different person. I find this a bit of a headache to comprehend.
