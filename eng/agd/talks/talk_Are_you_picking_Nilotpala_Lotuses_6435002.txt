Traveler: Are you picking Nilotpala Lotuses?
Shirin: Not yet, I'm just marking their locations for now.
Shirin: Nilotpala Lotuses are common medicinal plants, but they work best when they're fresh.
Shirin: As the Forest Rangers' doctor, I must do my best to mark areas rich with herbs so that I can pick them easily when they're needed.
Shirin: The rainforest may seem quiet, but its dangers cannot be underestimated. If you do enter the forest, try to stay on the main path and pay attention to your surroundings.
