# Further Observation


## Talk 1

Tighnari: Alright, next let's see your right hand... Hmm, not bad.
Tighnari: But please remember that you still need to be careful, understand?
Collei: Yes, I will. By the way, Master, I still haven't received the patrol route for today.
Tighnari: Look, Collei, today's patrol will be a long one, so you won't be coming along this time. Besides, there's a chance we may encounter... Well, you understand.
Collei: But I have a Vision, too! Am I useless to everyone now...?
Tighnari: Don't talk like that, Collei. This is not something you need to be worrying about right now.
Tighnari: Ah, there you are. Feeling any better?
Traveler: Is there something we can help with?
Paimon: Yeah, since we'll be staying here for now, we thought we might as well try lending a hand around here.
Tighnari: Heh, seems you're not the type to sit back and take it easy for a while, huh. In that case, perhaps Collei could take you two for a patrol south of Gandharva Ville for the day.
Tighnari: And if you're feeling up to it, you can be responsible for cleaning the Statue of The Seven.
Amir: Tighnari, we're ready to head out!
Tighnari: Got it, I'll be right there! Alright, we'll be heading into the forest now. I'll leave any further details to Collei.
Collei: Yes, you can count on me!
Paimon: So Collei, what exactly are we going to be doing today?
Paimon: Tighnari mentioned cleaning the statue just now, but uh... that doesn't really sound like a job for a ranger.
Collei: Well, a Forest Ranger's responsibilities can be pretty diverse.
Collei: We handle a variety of tasks, like checking the condition of outlying roads, maintaining forest facilities, ensuring fire prevention standards are met, and providing assistance to travelers and locals.
Collei: As for Master, well, he has to handle more dangerous areas of the rainforest.
Collei: Today we can perform routine checks on the pathway lamps as we make our way to the Statue of The Seven.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Collei, we're back.
Collei: Welcome back! You must be tired after all that climbing. Let's take a little break.
Paimon: Ah, by the way, Collei, have you ever seen any small creatures scurrying around in the forest? You know... that kinda look like a veggie?
Collei: A creature that looks like a veggie? Hmm... Well, I guess Master would say something like, "All plants are living organisms, so they also fall under the category of creatures."
Black Screen Text: You tell Collei about the thing you saw earlier.
Collei: Wow, fascinating! It almost sounds like an imaginary creature that you hear kids always talking about! I'll be sure to keep an eye out for anything like it.
Collei: Oh, I almost forgot. Are you two hungry? I packed some food and water for us.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Collei, we're back.
Collei: Welcome back! You must be tired after all that climbing. Let's take a little break now. I brought some food and water for us.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, now that Paimon looks at it, the deity that's carved on the statue is... kinda small.
Paimon: Hmm, do you think she's supposed to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Traveler: Maybe Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
Paimon: You might be right. The statue does look kinda old, hmm...
Paimon: Well, anyway, we'll have to figure that out later.
Paimon: Let's get started on cleaning the statue. Paimon'll fly up and take care of the top, and you clean everything below.
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon meticulously clean the statue.
Traveler: Maybe Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Paimon: The name does seem to fit the statue somehow. Hmm...

## Talk 5

Collei: The Statue of The Seven is up on top of that large rock formation. You must have seen it when you came down this road before.
Collei: It's pretty high up there, isn't it? Don't worry, if you're afraid you can't make it up there, I'm sure Master wouldn't mind if you don't clean the statue.
Traveler: No need to worry. I'm a terrific climber.
Collei: Oh? I guess I'll leave it up to you, then. There's not much footing once you reach the statue, so be careful up there.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon'll fly up with you and help with those hard-to-reach areas.
Paimon: Um, by the way, Collei, do you know anything about the Dendro Archon? You know, what's she like?
Collei: Uhh, that depends. Are you referring to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Paimon: Huh? Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
Paimon: Oh, is that the name of the former Dendro Archon?
Collei: Uh-huh. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was Sumeru's first Dendro Archon. She created the rainforests as well as the Wall of Samiel around the desert. Her works provided a means of peaceful living for everyone.
Collei: To the people of Sumeru, she is not only a symbol of wisdom but also of power and kindness. Unfortunately, she disappeared in a great calamity that occurred a few hundred years ago.
Traveler: (Sounds exactly like what happened to Raiden Makoto...)
Collei: According to what Master has told me, the sages later found the newly born Dendro Archon and whisked her back to Sumeru.
Collei: To celebrate the reinstatement of their lost deity, the sages dubbed her "Lesser Lord Kusanali" and let her reside in the Sanctuary of Surasthana.
Paimon: Uh-huh, then what happened?
Collei: Well, and then... uh... I'm not too sure what happened, to be honest.
Paimon: Huh? You're not too sure? But aren't you from Sumeru?
Collei: Yeah, I'm from Sumeru, but...
Paimon: Maybe it's difficult to discuss this topic with strangers... If that's the case, then don't worry, we understand.
Collei: No, no, it's not that. I'm not trying to hide something from you. Besides, I don't consider you two strangers.
Collei: Haha, because you two know Amber, right?
Paimon: Wait, Amber? You mean—
Traveler: Amber, Outrider of the Knights of Favonius?
Collei: Yes, that's her! I once lived in Mondstadt for a while, and she helped me a lot during that time. You could even say that she helped me become a new person.
Collei: There's no one like Amber! She lives life to the fullest while always adhering to her strong sense of justice. She's ready to answer the call for action at any moment, but is also very understanding of others. She's like the spark that lights the fire in everyone's heart around her.
Collei: If you ask me, she's a prime example of a true Outrider. She's the first person anyone coming to Mondstadt will meet. You can't help but be enthralled by her charm and enthusiasm, causing you to fall in love with the lands of Mondstadt, and...
Collei: Uhh, hehe... Sorry...
Traveler: Huh?
Paimon: Huh, Paimon thought the work of Outriders was a little different from what you just described, but one thing's for sure... you really like Amber.
Collei: Ahem... S—Sorry, I was just rambling on just now. It must have sounded kinda weird.
Paimon: Hehe, it's alright, Collei. Knowing that you're a friend of Amber somehow makes Paimon suddenly feel a lot closer to you.
Paimon: So, how did you know that we've met Amber?
Collei: Well, after I returned to Sumeru, Amber and I have stayed in touch by writing each other letters.
Collei: In one letter, she mentioned that Mondstadt was attacked by a fearsome dragon, but the city was saved by a mysterious blond traveler and their floating companion.
Collei: I knew you two were the ones she mentioned in the letter the moment I saw you. But, uh, considering everything you'd been through that day, I thought it'd be inappropriate to bring it up...
Paimon: Ah, so that's how you knew!
Collei: Yep! So please know that you two have my complete trust, really.
Collei: I wish I could tell you more about the Dendro Archon, but I had been away from Sumeru for some time, and I haven't read any books... Sorry.
Paimon: That's alright! You've already helped us a lot, we had never even heard of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or the Sanctuary of Surasthana until you mentioned them.
Collei: Oh, I'm happy that was helpful. There is one thing I want to ask, though... Why do you two want to know about the Dendro Archon?
Black Screen Text: You explain the purpose of your journey to Collei.
Collei: So that's why you're here. Thank you for telling me your story.
Paimon: Don't mention it! We are friends after all, right?
Traveler: Paimon's right, we're friends.
Paimon: Hehe! Alright, we have a statue to clean!
Collei: You both have my thanks! While you two are up there cleaning, I'll go ahead and inspect the forest canopy. Let's meet back here shortly.
Traveler: Wow, we've never seen this side of you, Collei...
Traveler: The avid glider from Mondstadt?
Traveler: (Does it coincide with Khaenri'ah...?)
Traveler: Shouldn't be a problem.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh, now that Paimon looks at it, the deity that's carved on the statue is... kinda small.
Paimon: Hmm, do you think she's supposed to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Traveler: Maybe Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
Paimon: You might be right. The statue does look kinda old, hmm...
Paimon: Well, anyway, we'll have to figure that out later. For now, let's focus on our job and clean up this—
Aranara A: ...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Huh? Wait a sec! Is it just Paimon, or was there something moving!?
Traveler: You noticed it too?
Paimon: Yeah! It was kinda small and round... You know, like a vegetable or something.
Paimon: It really freaked Paimon out! Whatever it was, we should probably go and investigate.
Paimon: Uh actually, on second thought, maybe we should get to cleaning first. Paimon'll fly up and take care of the top, and you clean everything below.
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon meticulously clean the statue.
Traveler: Like a head of cabbage?
Paimon: Yeah, that's it! Small and round like cabbage... but moving!
Traveler: Maybe Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Paimon: The name does seem to fit the statue somehow. Hmm...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Yay, food! What kind of goodies did you bring!?
Traveler: Paimon, some restraint, please...
Paimon: Hey, don't be a party pooper! It's not like Collei is a stranger or anything. Besides, the best way to compliment a chef is to show passion for their food! Xiangling taught Paimon that.
Collei: I prepared a nice, portable dish that Forest Rangers like to eat, called Pita Pockets. I hope you'll like them...
Collei: Wh—Whoops!
Paimon: AH! Nooo!!! You dropped it on the ground!
Collei: Not to worry! I wrapped a few layers of oiled paper around each pita. They should be fine.
Paimon: Oh, whew... Paimon nearly had a heart attack there.
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the pitas together with Collei.
Paimon: Those pitas are amazing! You're quite the cook, Collei.
Paimon: Thank goodness you wrapped them in paper... Paimon wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing something so tasty had been wasted.
Collei: Haha, you really know how to compliment the chef, Paimon.
Collei: Since you liked it so much, I'll be sure to give you a copy of the recipe sometime. I'll even include all my personal cooking pointers, so you'll be making your own Pita Pockets in no time.
Paimon: Yay thanks, Collei! It's hard to believe someone as diligent as you could have clumsy moments too.
Collei: Oh, hehe... I guess it happens from time to time.
Paimon: So uh, Collei... Don't you think that Tighnari's a little too strict with you? He won't let you touch anything without his permission.
Paimon: #Paimon knocks stuff over all the time flying around the Traveler, but {NICKNAME}'s never said anything. Everyone has their clumsy moments!
Collei: No no, you've got the wrong idea about Master. Sure, he may seem a bit harsh at first. With some time, you'll see that he's actually very kindhearted.
Collei: I've heard the veteran rangers say that Master is from some ancient and mysterious race that is known for their cunning wit and reclusive nature. But Master is actually very kind at heart.
Collei: Oh, by the way, you've heard of the Akademiya, right? Well, there's a group called Am... uh, Amu something...
Collei: Well, anyway, because Master does a lot of research on plants, sages from the Akademiya have written him many times, inviting him to take up an official position there.
Collei: But Master declines their offers every time, saying, "Sumeru City is too noisy. It'd be bad for my ears."
Traveler: That does sound like something Tighnari would say...
Collei: Haha, seems you already know him well. Anyway, I'm sure the sages were not happy about his responses.
Collei: Master could obviously have a bright future in the Akademiya, but he insists on sticking to the path of a Forest Watcher. Every day, he helps the locals of the forest and passes on his extensive knowledge to trainees like me.
Collei: In fact, Master's the one who taught me how to make Pita Pockets.
Paimon: Really? Paimon would've never guessed that.
Paimon: Oh, speaking of Tighnari, he was the one who took care of you after finding you passed out yesterday. He even carried you all the way here.
Paimon: Paimon's still kinda upset, though! He kept scolding Paimon the entire way here.
Traveler: What did you do?
Collei: Oh no, I'm sorry. Master might've been overreacting a little...
Collei: #But it's mostly because Paimon wouldn't stop yelling, "Why, oh why!? Is {M#he}{F#she} going to die!?" It probably started to get under Master's skin after a while.
Paimon: Hey! Argh, don't laugh!!! Paimon was genuinely concerned about you!
Collei: Pfft! Hehehe...
Paimon: Hey! Now even Collei's starting to laugh!
Paimon: Ughhh! That's it! Paimon won't forget this! It's time for some Paimonial wrath!
Collei: No! Don't touch me!!!
Traveler: Huh?
Paimon: Oh! Sorry, Collei! Paimon didn't mean to scare you...
Collei: Ah, no I just... I—I didn't mean that...
Paimon: Collei, are you okay? What's the matter?
Collei: No uh, I—I'm fine. I'm sorry, I must've startled you both reacting like that.
Collei: Oh, well it's getting late now. Uh, let's hurry back to Gandharva Ville. I think Master and the others should be back by now, too.
Paimon: Huh, what was up with Collei just now? And why's she in such a hurry all of a sudden...? Look, she's practically running back. Paimon can't even see her now!
Traveler: Collei, what's the matter?
Traveler: Speaking of his ears... I'd really like to pet them!
Collei: Hehehe, I know, right! I've always wanted to pet them, too. Ahem...
Collei: Anyway, Master could have easily left the rainforest to take up a position at the Akademiya. But he chose to stay here instead as a Forest Watcher, helping the locals every day and passing on his knowledge to trainees.

## Talk 8

Nasrin: Ah, Traveler, you've returned.
Paimon: Yep, we're back. Uh, have you seen Collei by any chance?
Nasrin: Oh, Collei? Yes, I saw her go into her room just a moment ago.
Paimon: Oh, okay... Guess we'll just have to wait and talk to her tomorrow then.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Collei: Uh, I'm not a very good climber, so I'll just let you handle the statue.
Collei: I'll go check the facilities up ahead. By the way, once we're done with our work here... would you like to chat some more?
