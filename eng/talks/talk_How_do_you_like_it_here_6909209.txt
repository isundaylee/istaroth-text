# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Gaming: Are you kidding me? Isn't it obvious?
Gaming: Well, I dunno how you haven't noticed, but I totally love it here! I mean, you built this whole place from the ground up! How cool is that!?
Gaming: To get specific though, here's three reasons why I dig this place: It's fun, chill, and I can sleep with both eyes closed!
Traveler: So, in a word, it's dope?
Gaming: Hahaha! You got that from me, didn't you?
Gaming: Anyway, look — I wanna level with you. In my mind, there's a fine line between graciously accepting the hospitality of your host and being a leech.
Gaming: Now, I know you won't let me pay any rent while I'm here, 'cause we're friends and all, but I will at least insist on making myself useful. So, if you catch me cleaning or gardening at any point — don't try and stop me.
Traveler: I couldn't possibly make a guest do my chores...
Gaming: Knew you'd say that. But if all I am is a guest, does that mean you want me to treat this like a hotel?
Gaming: Or would you rather I made myself at home?
Traveler: Of course!
Gaming: Okay, so do you have any objection to me cleaning up after myself while I'm in my own home?
Gaming: I'll give you to the count of three to raise any objections — ready? Three! Okay, great, no objections! Glad that's settled.
