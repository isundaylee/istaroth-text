Traveler: How's business?
Ogura Mio: Thank you for asking.
Ogura Mio: Although stocks of fabric are a bit tight, We are a storied and well-known store after all. Our items are excellent and have a good reputation.
Ogura Mio: Furthermore, my brother is a sergeant serving in the Shogun's Army, so we have the honor of offering our services to many officials of the Tenryou Commission.
Ogura Mio: Most officers of the Tenryou Commission are high-class samurai, and they have many family members who often come here to purchase expensive, high-end kimonos. Our business is doing well thanks to them.
