# Going Upon the Breeze

Amber: Heh, nothing to it.
Amber: Though I've gotta say, you surprised me a little with your moves there...
Amber: Thanks for the backup. How'd it feel?
Traveler: Barely broke a sweat.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, how is it the hilichurls ended up here?
Paimon: These creatures don't seem like the type to set up camp so close to cities like this.
Amber: Exactly. It's more normal for them to be much further out in the wilderness.
Amber: But because the dragon — Stormterror — has been around a lot more recently, our orchards have been destroyed and the local market has been affected as well.
Amber: When the storms hit, we usually end up with at least a few injuries, so the Knights of Favonius have been tied up doing the best they can to defend the area.
Paimon: So these annoying creatures have been getting closer and closer to the city?
Amber: Exactly. That said, clearing this camp helped make the area a little bit safer.
Amber: Come with me! A responsible knight must make sure to see you to the city safely.
Traveler: Those things are tougher than they look.
