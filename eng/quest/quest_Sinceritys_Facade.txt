# Sincerity's Facade


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't expect it to look like this on the inside...
Idrisi: They should all be holed up in here. Dunno how many people they've got left, though.
Dehya: Who cares? We'll round up all of 'em.
Tikriti: Still, we should be careful. Even if they've only got one shot left, it could still take us out.
Traveler: I've fought through many situations like this before.
Dehya: Yeah, we'll know what they're really capable of once we've landed some hits on 'em.
Dehya: Deshret's Relics may have been a force to be reckoned with before, but their name means nothing now.
Idrisi: Yeah, they don't stand a chance with you here. I'll take the lead, I've been here once before.

## Talk 2

Idrisi: This way, follow me! We're almost there!
Bashar: Ugh!
Paimon: Wait, they went charging ahead without checking for any traps!
Dehya: Hey! You guys okay?
Bashar: It seems like we just got trapped in here... don't think we triggered anything else.
Idrisi: Watch out, the enemy's coming from ahead!
Tikriti: Well, now that things have come to this, seems we'll have to fight our way through.
Idrisi: Don't worry about us, we knew something like this could happen! Go and take a look around — there could still be another way through!
Idrisi: Let's go, we can't let the boss down!
Paimon: Let's check if there's another way! The sooner we can make it through to help them, the better!
Dehya: Let's see...
Dehya: I think I see a way through over there, but it's being blocked by something. Let's try our luck with that mechanism.
Paimon: Okay, let's go!

## Talk 3

Mishal: I wasn't expecting anyone to make it through from the other side.
Mishal: But as a desert-dweller, I suppose we should be used to our folks defying all expectations.
Dehya: Don't waste your breath. You have nowhere to run.
Mishal: Run? Heh, had I wanted to run, I would have fled a thousand times already.
Mishal: I witnessed the golden age of Deshret's Relics. Even if I could leave this place behind, all that awaits me now are endless days of humiliation and ruin.
Mishal: Even now, my brothers and I still believe in one thing.
Mishal: "The greatest should never live to remember their fall."
Dehya: Hmph... so you want to go out in a blaze of glory.
Mishal: Let us draw our weapons. We will show them the true power King Deshret bestowed upon his followers.
Mishal: They are but two, while we hold within ourselves the entirety of the Relics' glory.

## Talk 4

Dehya: The commander has finally fallen.
Paimon: But they're still coming at us!
Paimon: This place is like a gladiator's ring... They just keep coming, no matter how many we beat!
Mishal: Yes, keep fighting! There's no need to fear, and no need to back down. This is our last stand!
Dehya: When the next wave comes, try to draw away their attacks.
Dehya: I'm going to see if I can take out that high platform.
Idrisi: Get out of my way!
Bashar: Come and face me, Mishal!
Mishal: Ah, so they've broken through the front as well...
Scared Mercenary: Apologies, Mishal, they just — they fight like absolute mad men! No matter how much we throw at them, they just keep coming for more!
Scared Mercenary: ARGH!
Mishal: So, it would seem like this is the end.
Idrisi: Time to pay for everything you've done, Mishal.
Mishal: Heh, you think I would give you that opportunity?
Mishal: I will be buried in the sand alongside all the rest of our fading glory.
Idrisi: Hey, wait!
Bashar: We were too late...
Dehya: ...It's over, there's no more need to fight.
Dehya: But if you're still going to cling onto your so-called mercenaries' pride, then I'll give you all a good beating as well.
Hesitant Mercenary: ...
Tikriti: Hey, Dehya! I've found the mechanism. I'll get you all back up here right away!
Dehya: Let's go.

## Talk 5

Shakhbout: Who are you filthy rats, and why are you always pestering us?
Dehya: Hah, you call yourself a member of the infamous Deshret's Relics, and you still can't even tell who's made it all the way to your headquarters?
Shakhbout: Who knows what intent a bunch of rats may have? We try to catch a couple, and you all just show up on the other side instead. How are we supposed to figure out what you're after?
Idrisi: Hey, have you ever heard of a man by the name of Kusayla?
Shakhbout: Wh—Why would I know? It's not like I'm in charge or anything!
Dehya: This is your last chance to talk.
Shakhbout: H—Hey, I said I don't know anything! I'm just an average member here. I'm telling the truth!
Shakhbout: If you're here to find someone, why don't you look through the records yourselves? Who can remember every name and face with so many people coming in and out every day?
Dehya: The irony.
Dehya: His life became a light for so many, yet to others, it wasn't even worth remembering.
Dehya: Where's the records room? Answer me.
Shakhbout: It's right over there, all the files are in there! You can go through them as much as you want, it's not like any of them still matter anyway!
Dehya: I mean the old records room.
Shakhbout: Th—The old records room? You mean... the one that got burned down?
Shakhbout: Kusayla! Ah yeah, I remember him now. The guy who could hardly walk!
Idrisi: Watch your mouth! That's our boss you're talking about!
Shakhbout: He was definitely faking it! We all let down our guard as soon as we saw him come hobbling in...
Shakhbout: But in the short time it supposedly took him to take a dump, he'd already gotten away, and started a fire in the records room...
Shakhbout: He couldn't have possibly outrun us if he wasn't a fraud!
Shakhbout: ...And after that, Deshret's Relics fell into complete disarray.
Dehya: Stop wasting our time. Every one of us here is perfectly aware of what he had done.
Dehya: Tell me. Where is the old records room?
Shakhbout: It's just over there, go see it for yourself if it means that much to you!
Shakhbout: There's nothing left in there but ashes. No human could ever survive that kind of inferno.
Idrisi: Bashar, Tikriti, let's go. We'll leave the others here to guard these guys.
Idrisi: Spare them no mercy if they try anything.

## Talk 6

Dehya: So this was his final destination.
Dehya: How did he do it...? Getting past all the guards with a limp, and sneaking in here to start a fire...
Dehya: If he was nimble enough to do that, then he must've been able to get out of here after starting the fire, right?
Paimon: Dehya...
Dehya: I'm sorry, I know it's just wishful thinking. Let's look around. Maybe we can find something that's been left behind.
Black Screen Text: Everyone searches around the room...
Paimon: Hmm? Is this a cane? It must be the one that Dehya's father used...
Idrisi: Kusayla...
Bashar: Thanks for everything, boss.
Tikriti: We're fortunate to somehow find that cane after that fire.
Idrisi: Let's split up and look around some more. What if something else has been left behind?
Tikriti: But what else could survive a fire like that?
Dehya: ...

## Talk 7

Dehya: Wh—What's this?
Traveler: We got you some snacks and drinks.
Paimon: Don't you remember? You asked Paimon what she would do if she were to wake up tomorrow with loads of money!
Paimon: And Paimon said that she would get boatloads of tasty snacks! You looked super confused at the time, but said it was an adorable thing to say!
Paimon: These opportunities don't come by often, so today, Paimon's gonna treat you to a special crash course on Paimon's life philosophy!
Traveler: She rarely spends her allowance on other people.
Paimon: Hey, c'mon! Paimon's not that stingy!
Paimon: Anyway, the point is that you should eat to your heart's content! You'll feel better for sure once you've gotten something in your tummy!
Paimon: Dunyarzad will also be here shortly! She's already heard that we're back.
Dehya: Aw, thanks, you two. Honestly, this is very unlike me. I just had a lot on my mind on our way back, so I didn't know what to say...
Dehya: My chest was filled with all kinds of intense emotions. They just shook me even more than all the feelings we've shared during our previous adventures.
Dehya: But when everything came to an end, those emotions also vanished without a trace, and I was left feeling more empty than ever before.
Dehya: It was as if... I'd lost the thing that was most important to me.
Traveler: Everything just happened so fast.
Dehya: Yeah, you're right. To many mercenaries, Mora is the most important thing in the world. But perhaps to us, it's the most worthless thing of all.
Dehya: Idrisi and the others all used to say that they would quit if there was no Mora to be had. But when it came to avenging my father, there was no Mora to be made anywhere.
Dehya: My reality shattered when I found out that the father who always told me hero stories was in fact a bad guy, but look at me now... am I any different?
Dehya: Despite all my promises about never forgiving him, and never trying to understand him, I still went to such lengths to find out the truth, and nearly even shed tears for his sake...
Dehya: We're hypocrites, all of us.
Traveler: You should never question your true feelings, though.
Dehya: Yeah, you're right. It's just a pity that we often only recognize our true feelings after it's already too late.
Dunyarzad: You're back! Are all of you alright?
Paimon: Ah, there she is!
Dunyarzad: Yeah... Many people from the Corps of Thirty came over, and I just wrapped up everything with my dad. All I can do now is wait for their verdict...
Dunyarzad: Huh? Dehya, you're looking quite down again.
Paimon: Paimon will explain! A lot happened while we were gone...
Black Screen Text: Once Paimon finishes telling the story, Dunyarzad begins to cry. It takes some time for her to compose herself.
Dunyarzad: I'm sorry, I really should have controlled my emotions better, I just... I just...
Dehya: It's alright, my lady. You were hurt by all of this as well. Truth be told, I'm starting to feel a little guilty, watching you cry like this...
Dunyarzad: But Dehya, your pain must be even worse. You shouldn't need to comfort me.
Dehya: Hey, don't worry about me. If anything, this whole thing has finally shown me the difference between illusion and reality.
Dehya: My father probably thought that people could settle into new lives as long as they moved to a new environment.
Dehya: That thought has even crossed my mind a few times. It's like saying, "what's wrong with adapting to a new life?"
Dehya: However, there was always something deep within my mind that refused to accept it. This impulse brought me great turmoil, and even made me feel ashamed for turning my back on your father's kindness...
Dehya: But now that I consider it again, it all makes sense. The desert sands are a part of who I am, and I will never be able to lead a peaceful existence.
Dunyarzad: I understand how you feel.
Dehya: That doesn't mean I won't be making any changes to my life, though. As an example, I'm now thinking about taking on some small, odd jobs.
Dehya: It's just like Idrisi said... I also want to catch up to my father, and become a character in his play.
Dehya: Even if the ending of the story may be childish and ridiculous, it won't really matter...
Dunyarzad: Isn't that neat though? You'll be a whole new kind of mercenary, one that's not out for Mora!
Dunyarzad: Why don't we go for a change of scenery once we finish eating? What about stopping by the Grand Bazaar again?
Dehya: Right, you said you wanted to get a rug for your family...
Paimon: We'll come along, too!
Traveler: It's always more fun when everyone's together.
Dehya: Haha, I can't thank you enough for taking care of me this entire time.
Traveler: It's really my treat, but you get the point.
Paimon: Hey, this way you get something from the both of us for the price of one!
Traveler: All on Paimon's tab.

## Talk 8

Dunyarzad: This rug here is quite something... the craftsmanship is exquisite, and the fabric is also of high quality.
Sattar: Ah, here you are. Finally, I found you...
Paimon: Hey, a—aren't you that mercenary who bit his tongue? You can still talk?
Paimon: Wait... Are you here to take revenge on us?
Sattar: Hah, what are you talking about? Do I look like I could take you all in a fight? I just came here to give you something. I'll be on my way to give myself up to the Corps after this.
Sattar: Once I woke up, I hurried to Dakan Al-Ahmar's camp, hoping to alert them to your presence.
Sattar: But when I got there, I found no one except the members who were still too injured to move.
Dehya: Ah, so you probably got there after us...
Sattar: Yeah, they told me that they had exacted their revenge, and everyone had turned themselves in to the authorities. Even that last camp was not going to last for much longer.
Sattar: I had joined the cause to repay an old favor from Kusayla. Now that everyone's already turned themselves in, I might as well do the same.
Sattar: One of the injured members gave this box to me, and told me that it contained some of the old man's last possessions.
Sattar: Everything left in the camp will get confiscated, so I figured I should get this to you before the Corps could get their hands on it.
Dehya: ...Thank you.
Sattar: No worries. We are all just living our own truths. There's no need to comment or judge anyone for it.
Paimon: So this box contains everything that Dehya's father left behind... Huh, it feels lighter than expected.
Dehya: Well, back in the day, the first thing he did with any Mora was spend it on things like drinks and meat.
Dehya: But let's see what's inside...
Dehya: Wh—What's this? It's just a bunch of junk! ...Ugh, it kinda stinks...
Dunyarzad: Uhh... perhaps it's just been left unopened for too long?
Dehya: A handwritten copy of a storybook... The paper's already yellowed, and it looks like it's about to fall apart...
Dehya: It was against the Akademiya's rules to possess books for personal use. If he was going to break that rule, he could have at least copied something useful...
Paimon: That probably means this was really important to him.
Dehya: Ah, and here are a few bags of children's snacks... the packaging's completely deteriorated. Maybe that's where the smell was coming from.
Dunyarzad: Did he get those for you?
Dehya: Yeah, but here's the thing though... Even when I was a child, I was never a fan of these kinds of snacks. He'd always say that he got them for me, but in the end, he always ate more than I ever did...
Dehya: Who even leaves snacks in a box like this, anyway? Isn't that just common sense...
Dehya: Forget it, let me see what else is here...
Dehya: A razor, some buttons, some round iron tiles, a wooden toy puppet...
Dehya: A wool scarf, which from the looks of it probably belonged to a woman, and a hair clip... why are these things here?
Dunyarzad: I—I'm suddenly feeling a little scared...
Dehya: I'm sorry, my lady, but this is just the kind of man he was. He probably saw this box as some kind of personal trash heap, and dumped any and everything in here...
Dehya: One, no, two empty liquor bottles... Ugh, tell me you guys, are these the kinds of things that a normal person would leave behind?
Traveler: Probably not.
Paimon: Huh? There's something in the bottle!
Dehya: Oh, you're right...
Dehya: ...Alright, I got it out. It seems to be a piece of paper with some writing on it. The bottom part's all damaged from moisture, though... let's hope the writing didn't smudge.
Dehya: "I was suddenly seized with an urge to write a letter after finishing this bottle. I just folded it up and left it in the bottle, though. If I end up forgetting about it, it won't really matter."
Dehya: "To Dehya..." It's a letter for me?
Traveler: You don't need to read it out loud.
Dehya: It's alright, I'll just read it out. If he went to the trouble of writing a letter, there must have been some important things that he wanted to say... or at least, record down.
Kusayla: "My condition's becoming worse and worse. Can't even walk without a cane anymore, much less go out and have fun. Guess I don't have many days left."
Kusayla: "If you're reading this letter, then I suppose I'm already long gone."
Kusayla: "You were adorable as a baby. Everyone loved you, and regardless of whether you were crying or laughing, everyone enjoyed having you in the group."
Kusayla: "But once you grew a bit older, you were no longer nearly as happy or cute. It's probably the guys' fault..."
Dehya: Hah, can you believe this guy? He can point the finger at himself.
Kusayla: "Anyway, back to the point... To summarize, I'm writing this so you would know not to feel sad for me even if you end up finding out the truth."
Kusayla: "The reason being that... Heh, I was never your father to begin with."
Paimon: Wait, what!?
Dunyarzad: Surely... he must be joking, right?
Dehya: I... I don't know...
Kusayla: "Hah, I was quite formidable when I was young! And a hundred times cooler than some so-called 'Flame-Mane,' hahaha."
Kusayla: "It really felt like the whole world was under my feet. With just a teeny tiny bit of effort, I felt I could rule over the entire desert."
Kusayla: "But as fate would have it, I went out into the desert for a drink one day, and discovered a baby in the sands. It was you."
Kusayla: "You were just lying there, small and helpless. You were so tiny that if the wind blew for just a little while longer, you would have been buried forever."
Kusayla: "But your cries were so loud, they made my head hurt. Now that I think of it, you really were a bundle of energy."
Paimon: Uh... sounds like he's serious.
Kusayla: "I told Idrisi and the others that I had slipped up with a woman while out and about. None of them even doubted me."
Kusayla: "I'm sorry that I had to lie to them for so long, but I really had no other choice."
Kusayla: "I was their most esteemed leader, after all. It's not like I could just tell them that I suddenly wanted to play at being a father..."
Kusayla: "Haha, at this rate, I'll puke up all the liquor I just drank from this bottle."
Dehya: ...
Kusayla: "Anyway, Dehya..."
Kusayla: "You possess the kind of freedom and kindness that we could only dream of. As for how you should live your life... that'll be up to you to decide."
Dehya: That's... the end of the letter.
Dehya: ...In the end, he was still thinking of me as a little child.
Traveler: But isn't that also a good thing?
Dehya: I suppose, or I would have suffocated under the sand a long time ago.
Dunyarzad: He was a good father to you. The fact that he wasn't a blood relative doesn't change that.
Dehya: Yeah. It's just a pity that we had to learn the truth of everything like this.
Dunyarzad: Do you already have some ideas about the decision that he wanted you to make?
Dehya: I do. If he first found me alone in the sands, then I want to try my hand at finding the person who abandoned me.
Dehya: I just have one wish, to tell them a story...
Dehya: ...That there once existed a childish and foolish jerk with a heart of gold.
Dehya: And that only under his care was I able to grow and mature into the person I am today.
Paimon: If you end up finding any leads, can you share them with us? We go on adventures all the time. Maybe we'll be able to find some information for you.
Dehya: Sure, I appreciate it. I wasn't expecting you to be so enthusiastic.
Traveler: I also don't want to see his efforts go to waste.
Dunyarzad: I'll help too!
Dehya: ...Thank you, all of you. Thank you so much.
Dehya: My life has certainly had its twists and turns, but I've always considered myself lucky.
Dehya: Because no matter where I've gone, I've always been surrounded by incredible kindness.
Traveler: I don't want you to stop going forward.
Traveler: What an... interesting man.
