Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Shocking news! Shocking news! I just saw the Chief Justice and the young boss of Spina di Rosula coming over together!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Did the cafe's owner run their mouth again and offend both the Palais Mermonia and Spina di Rosula...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Nonsense! If that were true, he would be sleeping with the fishes by now! The Chief Justice is here to conduct an investigation about a threatening letter written to a certain Melusine...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): A threatening letter to a Melusine!? How dare they! What idiot would look down on us Fontainians like this!?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Exactly! I think we shouldn't be waiting around for the Maison Gardiennage to resolve things! Let's patrol the streets to keep that Melusine safe!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Well said! Count me in! I live close to the horlogerie, so leave that area to me!
