# Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain


## Talk 1

Fujin: Ah, I forgot something important! If you see a golden... Can you hear me...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Paimon doesn't think we'll get far investigating the water and soil here. Let's head to Qiaoying Village first, shall we?
Paimon: If we've time on the road, we can try the "power" of that Adeptus Fujin!

## Talk 3

Grandpa Lu: Ah...? Youngsters, over here, over here!

## Talk 4

Jin: Uncle Luo, this batch still isn't any good! They're not fragrant enough when you dry them, and they get so dry and brittle that you can't even put them in the roller... Even the ones that survive the secondary processes come out the other end a complete disaster...
Uncle Luo: ...Are you sure it isn't a problem with the machine? Are you sure you haven't forgotten how to operate it?
Jin: ...What a thing to say. How could we dare to be careless, with you looking over our shoulders?
Uncle Luo: ...Hmph. How could you, indeed...
Uncle Luo: #Aiya, it's Grandpa Lu! Jin, get back to work... And this respectable-looking young man is...?
Traveler: #Haha, I'm the Young Master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Paimon: #(Hey! Just who the heck calls themselves Young Master!?)
Traveler: This is my servant. It will suffice to call her "Mini Pie."
Paimon: Uh... Hahaha! Yes, that's it! Call me Mini Pie!
Uncle Luo: Oh! In that case, welcome, welcome! A guest like you is a rare treat indeed. We have been quite reliant on the assistance of the Commerce Guild for many a year. But as for what's happened this year... I suspect you have already heard about it...
Grandpa Lu: What's wrong? You're looking pretty miserable, did Jin mess up at work again?
Uncle Luo: Hmph! You old... mocking me again! *ahem* My apologies, dear guests. Normally I would invite guests from afar to sample our new teas, but this year's batch... *sigh* Well, you know.
Traveler: #No tea? Are you seriously going to let me, the Young Master...
Paimon: #A-hem AHEM! The Young Master is indeed very concerned about the tea leaves, and uh, is here to see if there's anything that can be done to help, so, um, Chief Luo, there's no need to be so tied up with formalities.
Uncle Luo: Hahaha... Very well then. To tell the truth, this batch of tea leaves is no good either. They can't be dried, and I can't tell if they were bad when they were picked, or if it's a problem with the machine in our workshop.
Grandpa Lu: Ha! How's that difficult? Why not just use some of the older leaves you have in stock, and see if the product you get from drying them is any different? If the product is normal, then you'll know it isn't a problem with the machine.
Uncle Luo: Seriously, I've told you before... Forget it. As we have important guests present, then we'll give your method a try. Jin, do we have any fresh tea leaves remaining from older batches?
Jin: There's some in the warehouses, what's up?
Uncle Luo: What's up? What's up!? Oh, good one! We've been talking here for a good long while now, and you weren't listening to a single word, were you?
Uncle Luo: *sigh* ...Go fetch some of the older batches, and process it along with some of the newer stuff that Grandpa Lu brought using the machine. Don't you dare skip a single step, I'll be watching you!
Black Screen Text: After a bit, Jin brings back two batches of freshly dried tea.
Grandpa Lu: How about this? I see our two guests are quite young. They might prefer snacks to tea-tasting. Why not turn these two batches into teacakes? The quality of each will be evident with a single taste. What do you think, Old Luo?
Uncle Luo: Agreed, we'll do just that. Jin! Listen up. Take these two batches of tea leaves, and make them into two different teacakes, one cake from each batch! Don't you dare get even a single leaf mixed up!
Jin: Yessir Uncle Luo. You want me to mix them all into one cake?
Uncle Luo: Oh for... I can't even...
Grandpa Lu: Aiya, sorry for the long wait! We've got both teacakes here, let's try them one at a time, shall we?
Uncle Luo: Well? How's the taste?
Paimon: Hmm... The first one tasted a bit strange... But the second one was delicious!
Traveler: #Hmph! You're seriously going to let me, the Young Master, eat...
Paimon: #(Hey! Knock it off, Traveler!)
Traveler: #I, the Young Master, share Mini Pie's opinion.
Uncle Luo: ...The teacakes made from the tea we had in stock... taste fine.
Uncle Luo: *sigh* Alright, you win. So according to you, the tea processing machinery is fine — in other words, the problem is with the tea itself. This new batch of tea... it's just not as good as before!
Grandpa Lu: So, the water and soil...
Uncle Luo: ...But perhaps it's the cauldron that's the problem. It's old and in disrepair, which must have offended the Adeptus, causing the tea to deteriorate...
Grandpa Lu: No, no, it's the soil and the water... It's the elements that nourish the soil... The...
Uncle Luo: Enough, enough! Let's get that technician in charge of the tea cauldron in here first. It's that Fontainian, the one from the Fontaine Research Institute, Hot... Hot... What was it again? Ugh, name's such a pain to pronounce. Jin, go get her, would...
Uncle Luo: Jin! Jin?
Uncle Luo: *sigh* Just where did that lazy loafer abscond to this time? That brainless nitwit... I was going to have him go to Yilong Wharf and search for our technician...
Traveler: I agree.
Traveler: No need to stand on ceremony, Chief Luo. We're here to help.
Paimon: #Yeah! The Young Master is very concerned about the tea leaves, so there's no need to be so tied up with formalities, Chief Luo.
Traveler: I am but one who comes to the aid of the oppressed in their moment of need, a disciple of the Guhua...
Uncle Luo: What the heck? And you even proclaim yourself a member of the Guhua Clan...
Paimon: #Ahem! This is the Young Master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Uh, he really likes reading Wandering Hero novels for fun... and, uhm, the landscape of Chenyu Vale is filled with a mysterious... mystique! It must've gone to his head...

## Talk 5

Fujin: #Hehe, Traveler, Paimon, you two are indeed brilliant, as expected. Upon seeing my dissipated adeptal energy, you immediately understood the situation.
Paimon: Of course! We're super-duper experienced adventurers, you know! Still, why didn't you say anything sooner? You didn't just forget, did you?
Fujin: ...
Fujin: Ahem! About that, should not the path of the Adepti be full of challenges? 'Tis merely a test of your wisdom!
Traveler: Call me the master test-taker.
Paimon: Speaking of which, just what's the problem with the soil and water you mentioned before? Grandpa Lu was also sure that this was behind the deteriorating quality of the tea leaves.
Fujin: Yes, you too have seen Qiaoying Village. Should the quality and quantity of tea leaves continue to decline, so will the village, until finally — in the years to come — it degenerates back into what it was millennia before: a desolate mountain forest.
Traveler: You sure that isn't hyperbole...?
Fujin: Hehe. It is true. The Lord of Geo would not stand idly by as disaster befell. Were the sky to collapse, the Conqueror of Demons and other Adepti would do their utmost to support it. Should the waters under Yilong Wharf breach the dikes and flood, Liyue Harbor would aid the villagers.
Fujin: But without "tea," this stretch of mountains would... Or Qiaoying Village, rather, would lose its very reason to exist in human eyes.
Paimon: That makes sense... When you put it like that, Paimon understands.
Fujin: So, are you two willing to help me correct the imbalance in the water and soil?
Traveler: Whaddaya say, Mini Pie?
Paimon: Who the heck is "Mini Pie"!? Never heard the name before! Hmph!
Paimon: But Paimon wants to help Adeptus Fujin and Qiaoying Village. When she thinks about such delicious teacakes being lost forever just because there's no good tea... It would be a big shame, wouldn't it?
Fujin: Yes, that's excellent! ...*ahem* Your willingness is commendable, and one is quite grateful to you both. Now, back to business: When it comes to how to resolve the disharmony in the soil and water, one is indeed well aware of what to do.
Fujin: First, you two must go up, against the currents, and seek the jade treasures thrown into the waters. In the end, we must perform the ancient Rainjade Rite once more, dispelling the miasma that has settled over the mountains and fields and into the rivers, and restoring the water veins and soil.
Paimon: Okay, got it! But, uh, just how do we do the ritual?
Fujin: ...
Paimon: Adeptus Fujin, what's wrong?
Fujin: Oh, nothing. As for the ritual, it's still a bit early for that. Well then, we'll see each other later.
Paimon: Annnd she's gone.
Paimon: According to her, we need to go against the current... that just means upstream, right? Hey, that's the same direction as Yilong Wharf! Let's go!
Traveler: Very well.
Traveler: I understand what you mean.
Paimon: *sigh* That's kinda hard to wrap your brain around... Can bad tea really destroy Qiaoying Village?
Traveler: It was you who brought us here...

## Talk 6

Hautemontagne: ...though I don't understand it in the least, I still think it's amazing!
Hautemontagne: ...Just watching her stand there singing, or sing while walking around, or sing while sitting, and then sing while she lifts her hand, and slowly lets it fall, all the while ceaselessly singing...
Hautemontagne: ...I really don't know just what kind of magical powers the old lady has! Babbling, chanting, singing and reciting, reciting and crying, I haven't got a clue what she's saying, but it's amazing! Little Mao, can you understand?
Little Mao: ...Haha, that's just how opera singing is. And weren't there fight scenes later? There was that old dude who could do 88 flips and tricks. Riveting stuff!
Hautemontagne: ...Yeah, it's great! It's just a shame that I don't understand a thing... A whole bunch of people fighting and jumping all over the place, all super flashy and such. One-on-one, several all fighting each other, five or six taking turns... It's just... almost addictive!
Paimon: Hello! We're looking for a technician from Fontaine! Chief Luo and Grandpa Lu said... Uh, what name did they give us again?
Traveler: Oat Moon-tan-yee.
Hautemontagne: Haha! Yep, sounds like Grandpa Lu sent you all right. Just call me Hautemontagne. I'm a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Would you specifically need someone from Fontaine to fix it?
Grandpa Lu: Heh, well, whether in Liyue or Fontaine, most things powered by elemental energy work on more or less the same principles, yeah? If a Fontainian engineer can fix it, so can our thaumaturges.
Grandpa Lu: It just so happens that this Ms. "Oat Moon-tan-yee" likes to travel around Liyue, passes through here every so often, and loves to offer her services. So as for this round of tea cauldron maintenance, well, let's leave it to her.
Grandpa Lu: So you see, honored guests... Hehe, I'm really sorry, but I need to trouble you to go to Yilong Wharf and find our technician, Ms. Oat Moon-tan-yee. It's more likely than not she's found herself a show there that she can't tear her eyes off!
Uncle Luo: How could you possibly dare to ask our guests to do such a thing!?
Grandpa Lu: Old Luo, you misunderstand me. Our honored guest already had business to attend to at Yilong Wharf, and it would just be passing along a message on their way. It's nothing, really.
Uncle Luo: Is that so?
Paimon: Huh, is that so?
Traveler: ...It would seem to be so.
Uncle Luo: I'm truly sorry... Then if you would, honored guests. Old Lu, I'll leave it to you to accompany them.
Grandpa Lu: Aiya, thanks for your hard work! You scared Old Luo so much he was jumping at his own shadow, hahaha!
Grandpa Lu: You mentioned earlier that you're here to investigate the water and soil, right? Best you head over to Yilong Wharf, then. It isn't far from the headwaters, and there are ruins left by the Adepti along the way, so if you're looking for clues, there's your best bet.
Grandpa Lu: As for passing a message to Oat Moon-tan-yee, well, please lend a hand, would you? Give Old Luo some peace of mind, so he doesn't worry himself to death.
Traveler: #Even Mini Pie can handle a thing so trivial.
Paimon: #Hey! Why're you still acting!? The show's over! And what's with calling Paimon "Mini Pie" anyway!?
Paimon: Anyway, just leave it to us! You can rest easy, Grandpa Lu!
Grandpa Lu: Such great kids you are, really great kids... Oh, right! I noticed that you two really enjoyed the teacake. Why don't I teach you the recipe? Next time you come by some quality tea leaves, you'll be able to make some for yourselves.
Grandpa Lu: In any case, safe travels! Be careful on mountain paths, and mind you don't slip!

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: About Yilong Wharf...
Uncle Luo: The port to the west, haha... It's much smaller than Liyue Harbor, eh? The specialties we export to Fontaine and Sumeru along with the oddities we import from them go through it.
Uncle Luo: A whole lot of our tea is also transported through there. *sigh* Though this batch of tea leaves isn't any good, and until we figure out why and solve the problem, we won't sell anything to outsiders. The last thing we want to do is ruin Qiaoying Village's good name.
Grandpa Lu: So you see, honored guests... Hehe, I'm really sorry, but I need to trouble you to go to Yilong Wharf and find our technician, Ms. Oat Moon-tan-yee. It's more likely than not she's found herself a show there that she can't tear her eyes off!

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: I'm an Honorary Senior Researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute...
Uncle Luo: #Oho! I never imagined the Young Master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to be so skilled! That makes it easy, please, if you'd lend a hand...
Paimon: It's just an honorary title! Ho-nor-ar-y!
Uncle Luo: #Ah, is that so...? Hahaha, well, it still speaks to the abilities of the Young Master! Even the honors of foreign nations are not beyond reach!
Grandpa Lu: So you see, honored guests... Hehe, I'm really sorry, but I need to trouble you to go to Yilong Wharf and find our technician, Ms. Oat Moon-tan-yee. It's more likely than not she's found herself a show there that she can't tear her eyes off!

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: #Haha, I'm the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Paimon: #Alright, alright, that's quite enough acting! Are you alright, Traveler...?
Paimon: #Yup, our young master is... Wait, that's not right! He's Traveler, and Paimon's Paimon. Anyway, it was Grandpa Lu who sent us looking for you.
Little Mao: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, hello! I'm Little Mao, a friend of Mountain's!
Hautemontagne: Yes, that's what my name means. Hautemontagne can be a bit hard to pronounce, so I asked Little Mao to just call me that.
Paimon: Really...? Quite the interesting pair! How did you two meet?
Hautemontagne: It was quite fortuitous! Last year I went to the mountains in the south for a spell, and got lost in the fog. A huge beast the size of a "Cal. Etienne-Louis" was glaring at me, and I thought I was done for! But just then...
Hautemontagne: A little kid suddenly shouted at me! I followed the sound through the mist and got out, and was saved! Otherwise, I would've been eaten, just like that, and my family in Fontaine wouldn't even have been able to claim compensation on my account!
Little Mao: Heehee, I know more about what goes on in the mountains than the grown-ups!
Paimon: Is that so? You're amazing, Little Mao!
Traveler: Hautemontagne, Grandpa Lu and Chief Luo are looking for you.
Hautemontagne: Alright, got it! I'll be there in a jiffy. *sigh* All the shows here are just too good. I ended up watching several, one right after the other, and now my legs have fallen asleep. But I just can't understand a word... What sorts of stories are they telling?
Little Mao: It's about how way back when, a huge carp and a monster from the mountains fought! A "you kill me, I kill you" story. In the end, everyone dies!
Hautemontagne: Uh... That's a pretty concise summary! But don't talk about killing and dying so much, Little Mao! If you think about that kind of stuff too often, you might become the villain when you grow up!
Hautemontagne: Since those in Qiaoying Village are waiting on me, it's time to go! See you all later!
Little Mao: Let's go watch the shows here again when you're about to head back to Fontaine!
Paimon: Okay, now that we've solved the puzzle, we can get back to business. Little Mao, how about you?
Little Mao: What are you two going to do?
Paimon: Huh? To be honest, we're not quite sure how to explain it... The water and soil in Chenyu Vale are kinda out of whack, and we need to cure them for everything in Chenyu Vale to get better.
Little Mao: I get it! Ms. Paimon is trying to say that we need to restore nature?
Paimon: Hey, that's right! You're really amazing, Little Mao, you got it right away!
Traveler: "Restoring nature," you say? Did someone talk to you about that?
Little Mao: That's right — a friend who's always taking care of me told me! She wants to restore nature too. If we restore nature, everything will get better, so I want to help too. She also told me about you two!
Paimon: Oh! So you've seen her too?
Little Mao: Huh? You mean my friend? Of course! Silly Ms. Paimon, how could we be friends if I'd never seen her?
Paimon: Fair point! That makes things easier! Actually, we want to... Paimon remembers we need to find the jade treasures in the water, and then do some Rainjade Rite. But even though we've come upstream, we still haven't found any clues...
Little Mao: Ah! I know! Come with me, I'll show you where to look!
Paimon: What? Is it really that easy?
Traveler: Little Mao, your friend wants to restore nature, right?
Little Mao: Yeah! She's told me a lot, such as stories from before Qiaoying Village became Qiaoying Village, how the tea trees came to be, and more. She said that things will get worse and worse in Chenyu Vale if the natural order isn't restored.
Paimon: Oh! Looks like we're on the same page then.
Paimon: Little Mao, you just said you knew where we could find leads, right?
Little Mao: Yeah... I don't know if it'll help, but when you mentioned "jade treasures" and "Rainjade" and stuff, I just thought of it! Come with me!
Paimon: Yup, let's go!
Traveler: We're here about the tea cauldron in Qiaoying Village...

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: I am but one who comes to the aid of the oppressed in their moment of need, a disciple of the Guhua...
Paimon: #What do you mean, you're from the Guhua Clan? Alright. So he's Traveler, and Paimon's Paimon. It was Grandpa Lu who sent us looking for you.
Little Mao: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, hello! I'm Little Mao, a friend of Mountain's!

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: What? I'll have you know that I'm an Honorary Senior Researcher.
Paimon: #Seriously? Is this really the moment to be comparing? Anyway, he's Traveler, and Paimon's Paimon. It was Grandpa Lu who sent us looking for you.
Hautemontagne: Hahaha, so you're colleagues from the Institute? Excellent, looks like you guys couldn't stand that hopeless wreck of an organization either!
Little Mao: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, hello! I'm Little Mao, a friend of Mountain's!

Paimon: By the way, Paimon's not sure if this is an appropriate thing to say but... your aura seems a bit different from that of the other adepti we've met somehow...

Fujin: ...
Fujin: ...Yes, that's exactly how it is. It's just that... those two friends are probably busy taking care of their own affairs right now. That is why one must leave this business of nursing the water and soil to the two of you instead.
Paimon: Uhh, still not sure what exactly it is we're meant to do, but, uh... we'll go take a look, anyway!
