Traveler: What kind of dangers lie within this village?
Takeru: Heh, since you bothered to ask with such sincerity, allow me to fill you in on the horrors of this place!
Takeru: The village is filled with mysterious incidents and dangers. For instance, my grandfather would never let me near that dried well...
Takeru: However! I know that the Treasure Whirlpool lies within that well! Greedy treasure hunters would get sucked into the huge, horrifying whirlpool at the bottom of the well and become trapped by the monsters inside!
