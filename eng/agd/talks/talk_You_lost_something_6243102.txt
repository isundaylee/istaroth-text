Traveler: You lost something?
Pan Guan'er: Yes. I'm a lumberjack, I work in this area. But I lost my axe â€” again.
Pan Guan'er: Maybe I misplaced it when I stopped to take a break?
Pan Guan'er: But if it's genuinely lost, then as the legend says, an adeptus should bring it back to me...
Pan Guan'er: If that's the case... Maybe it would be quicker if I went looking for the adeptus instead?
