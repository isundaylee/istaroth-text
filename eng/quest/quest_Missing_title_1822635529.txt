## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Ritou bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices regarding all kinds of matters will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: Former Kanjou Commissioner Hiiragi Shinsuke now awaits the Almighty Shogun's judgment regarding his crimes of high treason. Owing to his age and in acknowledgment of his past contributions, he is presently indefinitely detained without bail.
Bulletin Board: However, should he commit any more acts of treason during this detention, he will be branded a public enemy of the Inazuman state and his judgment shall be enacted with extreme prejudice and without any mercy.
Bulletin Board: While the Kanjou Commission debates the matter of his successor, the Commission's duties shall be performed by a personal deputy of Her Excellency.
Bulletin Board: The duties of Kanjou Commission staff will not be adjusted. We urge all staff to remain calm and follow any arrangements sent from your superiors.

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: As we are presently in a state of ceasefire and peace, imports to Watatsumi Island will resume.
Bulletin Board: Once the matter of trade route security is agreed upon by both the Shogunate and Sangonomiya, the commercial port to Watatsumi Island will be opened shortly.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: With Lady Miko's permission, the Grand Shrine will soon host a large-scale event.
Bulletin Board: This is a rare opportunity, so we encourage all shrine maidens, clergy, and commission staff to make preparations soon!
Bulletin Board: Lady Miko, Lord Commissioner, we beseech you both to please exercise some control over Naganohara Fireworks!
Bulletin Board: We of the Fire Brigade are always stretched to breaking point every time Yoimiya takes part in a festival...
Bulletin Board: Please, we implore you, take pity on us!
Bulletin Board: We would like to express our deepest apologies as well. We will be sure to keep Yoimiya in check in the future.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: Yashiori Island's Jakotsu Mine has been closed temporarily, with representatives from the Shogunate and Sangonomiya discussing future development. It will be reopened soon after an agreement has been reached.

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: The special privileges granted to Snezhnayan merchants in trade and in port affairs have been revoked. Any accumulated arrears must be paid within 2 weeks, or Ritou will not extend further protection to your goods and cargo.
Bulletin Board: We ask all shipments of military equipment and material to leave the borders of Inazuma and Sangonomiya immediately. The Fatui and all related personnel are included in this order.
Bulletin Board: "You should've done this a long time ago! We barely had any breathing room with all these Snezhnayan merchants eating up all the privileges and getting special treatment!"
Bulletin Board: "Especially those Fatui loansharks! Now they'll get what's coming to them, hah!"

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: I'm searching for my husband, Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou. He is a tall man without any facial hair and has a scar on the side of his forehead. He has yet to return home despite the ceasefire.
Bulletin Board: If any returning samurai or old friends and acquaintances know of his whereabouts, please inform me. You will be duly thanked for your help!
Bulletin Board: Yours Respectfully, Inaba Shizuko.

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: Their Excellencies, the Almighty Ogosho and Watatsumi's Divine Priestess, both express their deep grief at the many tragedies that occurred at Tatarasuna and on Yashiori Island.
Bulletin Board: From this day forth, the Shogunate and Sangonomiya will begin reconstruction and redevelopment work in these lands in partnership with one another.
Bulletin Board: Together, we will pacify this war-torn land, bring the guilty to justice, and restore Inazuma's prosperity.
Bulletin Board: All the more must we follow the divine wisdom of Her Excellency the Shogun, acting as one to accomplish the great cause of Eternity.

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: "Outlander merchants, if you are facing any issues or difficulties in Ritou,"
Bulletin Board: "Come find Mr. Kurisu at the International Trade Association. We will do our best to help you!"
Bulletin Board: "If there is anything that you don't understand or that troubles you, come look for us."
Bulletin Board: "The International Trade Association's doors are always open to outlanders from any nation."

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: The Outlander Affairs Agency is presently doing away with past unfair taxes and duties to lessen the burden on merchants in Ritou.
Bulletin Board: We will seek deeper cooperation with the International Trade Association going forward in order to better serve local and outlander merchants alike.
Bulletin Board: Additionally, emigres from other regions seeking work here can submit documentation indicating their employment preferences at the Kamisato Clan estates.

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! Didn't we agree to have a sumo duel? Where've you run off to!?"
Bulletin Board: "Bet you lost a fight and can't show your face outside anymore, eh? Hope you're not crying in some corner with your bald wings wrapped around yourself or anything!"
Bulletin Board: "Come on, don't worry about it! You win some and you lose some, am I right?"
Bulletin Board: "Seriously though, I've got no time for your moping. We've got a duel to settle!"
Bulletin Board: Madam Kujou has never been defeated in battle and remains triumphant today. Please do not slander her, you knave!

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "I haven't seen Ritou quite as busy as it has been recently with all these guests from Sangonomiya coming ashore."
Bulletin Board: "Well, that said, it was their protests toward the Shogun that got those corrupt Commissions knocked down a peg or ten..."
Bulletin Board: "It's thanks to them that we outlanders can now look forward to better days."

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: "Farewell, Ritou."
Bulletin Board: "Many matters await me in my homeland, so please forgive my abrupt and early departure."
Bulletin Board: "I have heard that Yashiori Island has been handed over to the management of Sangonomiya and that the once-bustling mines will no longer open..."
Bulletin Board: "It pleases me little to see my hometown change hands... But at least now I have hope to return at all."
Bulletin Board: "I hope that the Shogunate will take this as a lesson. Such a great 'loss' must never happen again..."

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: "The Artificial Onikabuto Tournament is taking in applicants now!"
Bulletin Board: Tough youngsters, hale old folks, depressed uncles, and alcoholic aunties! Everyone is free to participate!
Bulletin Board: "Experience endless proxy battles here! The upcoming match is:"
Bulletin Board: "Village Shophouse Sharptongue versus Baron Vishap Tamagoyaki! Battling it out in a high-stakes, winner-take-all, no-holds-barred brawl!"
Bulletin Board: "The trends nowadays among youngsters are... getting harder and harder to wrap one's head around."

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: "We can expect the various commercial routes between us and the other nations to open up one after the other. Better days are coming soon, indeed."
Bulletin Board: "Many thanks to our friends and competitors here in Ritou for helping us to make it this far."
Bulletin Board: "You're too kind. I think everyone believes that we'll make it as long as there's business to be done."
Bulletin Board: "Haha, that's right! But don't get too chummy or lose your edge now — don't forget that we're rivals out there in the mercantile world!"

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: The Yae Publishing House's reader's forum will proceed as planned. Our outlander readers from Ritou are also welcome to make the trip here to the Publishing House!

Bulletin Board: "Don't ask how it got here — but ask us anything about the quality!"
Bulletin Board: Citizens, please take note! Do not in any wise be taken in by the lying words of smugglers!

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board: "There's been a youngster in Tenryou Commission garb going about recently. Is this some result of the Almighty Shogun's latest decrees?"
Bulletin Board: "I mean, seeing Commission members go about official business in public is not uncommon, exactly, but this kid just looks way too young."
Bulletin Board: "I mean, I swear this kid looks younger than Lord Commissioner Ayato. I just can't convince myself that this is official business, you know?"
