Traveler: And you are?
Woliu: Hello there! I'm Woliu, a hydrologist working for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and currently conducting a routine survey of Chenyu Vale's hydrological and pedological conditions.
Woliu: Hmm, looking at you... You wouldn't happen to be an adventurer, would you? Excellent, perfect... Perhaps we'll get a chance to work together!
