Traveler: Is everything alright?
Guan Hong: I'm fine, it's just that I was diagnosed with an incurable illness a while back. I was told that I didn't have long...
Guan Hong: So I asked myself, what have I done my entire life?
Guan Hong: I've worked hard, sacrificing my health, and what did I earn for it? A pile of things I wasn't born with, and can't take with me when I die.
Guan Hong: Looking back, I didn't do even one thing that I could be proud of in all those decades. Ha...
Guan Hong: It's a shame that I realized it so late.
