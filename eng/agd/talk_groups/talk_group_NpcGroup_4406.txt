Azalai: Hello, what can I help you with?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you selling?
Azalai: Well, take your pick of these wares. But let me tell you first that if you pay with Mora, you'll be up against prices somewhat higher than what you'd pay in the city.

## Talk

Traveler: What is this place?
Azalai: As you can see, you can purchase food and spices here.
Azalai: Aaru Village's soil is not well suited for growing anything, so the lion's share of our goods are imported.
Azalai: But waiting for others to source goods felt like too passive an approach, so I set this store up.
Azalai: In any case, I'll be forward with you — I've nothing to hide in any case — and say that the prices here will be higher than what you'd get in the city.
Azalai: It's just how things are... This is as low as I can go when you factor in the costs for one-way shipping.
Azalai: That said, you don't have to pay me in Mora. If you've brought something to barter, I'll hear your offer.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't have anything at the moment.
Azalai: Don't worry about it. Come back next time!

## Talk

Traveler: That's a pretty good idea, actually.
Azalai: I mean, this is a small place. We've got to stick by each other, you know?
Azalai: Some villagers bring items they no longer use and leave them here with me so that those in need can take them home.
Azalai: In fact, this also helps my business. After all, few people will pass a shop without taking a look at the goods, wouldn't you say?

## Talk

Traveler: Shipping costs?
Azalai: That's right. I mean, just look around you. There's nothing but sand over here. There isn't anything I can ship to the city to sell, so I can't really make a profit with that.
Azalai: Speaking of which, I once encountered a sandstorm while I was bringing in my goods. In the depths of the desert, I met some folks who looked like researchers.
Azalai: They shared some food with me and told me how to return to Aaru Village. However, they refused to reveal their identities.
Azalai: Should I try venturing into the desert again and look for those people? I heard that researchers are quite wealthy, so it would be nice if I could earn their Mora...
Azalai: That way, I could bring my prices down, and the people in the village would be able to live better lives.

Azalai: Thanks for going easy on me. If you'd like, we can play again!

## Talk

Azalai: Such skill! I didn't think that someone this good would visit our village without any fanfare!
