Namecard style.
"One, I've written an exclusive, and it's going to generate a lot of buzz for sure! Two, the newspaper said the situation is developing too slowly, so they're changing to a press release instead...

Namecard style.
If the essence of being an "idol" is simply "being loved," then Dahlia might've found his sacred calling. Barbara still strives to perfect her image, while Dahlia need only guard his privacy — lest someone spot him sharing drinks with a certain bard...
