Bao'er: Hello, traveler. Are you here to pay homage to history?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Bao'er: Trying to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, it feels like... Or, conducting an archaeological investigation, in technical terms.
Traveler: Breadcrumbs? I am a bit peckish...
Bao'er: ...Sorry if I wasn't clear. I'm an archaeologist; I'm researching the historical architecture and relics of the Guili Plains.
Traveler: You're an archaeologist?
Bao'er: Yes. We are standing right now on the battlefield where the Archon War took place all those thousands of years ago.
Bao'er: In other words, where the Geo Lord fought a bloody battle and secured a decisive and unequivocal victory against his enemies.
Bao'er: There must be countless artifacts waiting to be unearthed beneath our very feet.
Bao'er: I do long to know what treasures are buried here...
