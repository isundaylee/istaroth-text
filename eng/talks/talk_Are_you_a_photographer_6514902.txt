# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you a photographer?
Hermosa: I'm afraid not. I'm good at photography, yes, but I prefer the title "adventurer."
Hermosa: I take my cat on various adventures and take many photos that tell a story.
Hermosa: I mean, who says pictures can't tell stories? Some of these get published in the newspapers, and some get used as illustrations for books.
Hermosa: Each one of my pictures will definitely contain my cat â€” makes them easy to identify, you know.
