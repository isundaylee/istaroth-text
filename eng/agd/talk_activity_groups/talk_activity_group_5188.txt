Ranjit: Shall we begin?
Traveler: Let's.
Traveler: Just how are Pyro Regisvines and Natlan's Saurians alike?
Ranjit: ...Haha, I'm sure you didn't know this, but Natlan is home to fire-breathing Saurians! That excessive amount of Pyro on your skin... Now that's the flavor of Natlan for you!
Ranjit: So that's the plan. I mean, the first step of any challenge should be starting on a lower difficulty, wouldn't you say?
Ranjit: A Pyro Regisvine neither dodges nor hides, and you don't have to search for it or worry that it might escape. There could be no subject more suitable.
Ranjit: And even if negotiations with it fall through, its fruit will still make for a good ingredient for some creative cooking...
Traveler: Now that you mention it, I haven't met a single person from Natlan...
Ranjit: Well, about that... They have a lot of reservations about leaving their land... Which I don't feel comfortable talking about as a foreigner.
Ranjit: I'm not too sure about their rules and taboos, but I doubt that it's the unfamiliar environments that are the problem, haha.
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.

Ranjit: Shall we head down, then?
Traveler: Let's go.
Traveler: By the way, how exactly are we going to eat the Pyro Regisvine fruit?
Ranjit: Well, we're out in the wild, so simple works best. First, we'll need to trim the fruit's shape without getting burned.
Ranjit: Next, we cut off a small piece, dig a groove into the middle of the fruit, then put in a couple chunks of butter, Whopperflower Nectar, and your preferred spices. Then we roast — all done.
Ranjit: I'd say that Pyro Regisvine's fruit has a more striking flavor than that of apples. Really sears itself into your memories...
Traveler: Tell me about the Tepetlisauri...
Ranjit: Oh, the little ones are awfully cute! What with their big round eyes and roly-poly bellies...
Ranjit: As I said before, they're probably the first things you'll meet if you travel to Natlan through Sumeru. The mines in eastern Natlan are their stomping grounds.
Ranjit: Those mines are also home to the Nanat{RUBY#[D]Children of Echoes}zcayan people. Fine miners and excavators, they are, and skilled appraisers of gems.
Ranjit: Sound boring to you, right? But they're a happy lot, especially their chief...
Ranjit: Whatever the case, be sure to pay them a visit if you find yourself heading to Natlan in the future... Those little Tepetlisauri, I mean. You'll love 'em, I can already tell.
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.

Ranjit: Are you ready?
Traveler: Yep, let's go.
Traveler: Tell me the tale of Kuntur...
Ranjit: I've gotta admit that my friend only told me the back half. I wonder, what did his father do to warrant such hate from the sun?
Ranjit: If it wasn't enough to punish the poor fellow by blinding his father with its golden arrows, the sun would hide itself behind a layer of clouds wherever he went.
Ranjit: I hear that there are murals that record the tale, though I have never seen them myself.
Ranjit: Speaking of which, Natlan's murals are very unique, and they're as lovely as they are fascinating. Sometimes I wonder if I should be bringing my Kamera to Natlan instead of my pots...
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.

Ranjit: Want to head out now?
Traveler: Let's go.
Traveler: Tell me about the flying companion...
Ranjit: Right. Going back to the story about Kuntur, his companion, Iktomisaurus, was a Saurian with great powers of flight.
Ranjit: You could even say that without Iktomisaurus's help, Kuntur would've found his success much harder to win.
Ranjit: A flying companion's pretty convenient... and come to think of it, yours flies, too. So, she have any special skills?
Traveler: She can make terrifying amounts of food disappear nigh-instantaneously.
Ranjit: Amazing! Any chef worth their salt would be overjoyed to hear of such a skill.
Ranjit: Let me cook for her next time, alright? My friends from Natlan all told me that I should stay and cook for the Saurians — said I'd be a smash hit.
Ranjit: So yeah, I'm sure your companion would enjoy my food too!
Traveler: Tell me about the hot springs...
Ranjit: Ah, I've seen a few in Fontaine, hot enough to scald you! I hear that wherever the Emperor of Fire and Iron dwells, the waters there are exceptionally hot...
Ranjit: But Natlan's hot springs are different. Now, how should I put it... they can heal wounds of body and spirit both.
Ranjit: That's what makes them so addictive, in fact...
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.
