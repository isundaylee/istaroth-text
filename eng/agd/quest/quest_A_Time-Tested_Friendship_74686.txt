# A Time-Tested Friendship

Xavier: Hello, my gallant adventurer friend!
Traveler: Call me the Great Editor, good sir!
Traveler: That's the Commercial Auteur to you, my friend!
Xavier: Haha, I'm glad you didn't find the filming boring! Some self-reflection would have been in order otherwise, for spending our precious time together on something dull.
Xavier: I mean, we don't get many chances to meet. Tracking down a world-walker like yourself is no less challenging than pulling stars out of the sky.
Xavier: Sometimes, like now, I could bump into you in a cafe. But other times, I could ask everyone about your whereabouts and still come up empty-handed.
Xavier: The good news is that I'm sure to hear a new, thrilling tale of your travels every time we meet, so our encounters are never boring. But the bad... Well, we can never know if any given meeting might be our last.
Traveler: C'mon, I'm not that incorrigible, am I?
Xavier: Haha, alright, whatever you say. Any more grousing and I'll turn into one of those empty nesters you see in public service announcements.
Xavier: I'm almost done working with these commercials. After this, it's "nose to the grindstone" â€” I'll start work on my next film. Let's keep chasing our dreams even as we go our separate ways, eh?
Traveler: I will.
Xavier: Ah, but still, let's have a meal somewhere together, should you have the time! If you'd prefer not to dine in Fontaine, that's fine too!
Xavier: Good Hunter, Wanmin Restaurant, Lambad's Tavern, and the like... And if you want to go picnicking or big-game hunting, I'll find a way to keep up somehow... Anyway, please keep in touch!
Traveler: I'll swing by to see you more often.
