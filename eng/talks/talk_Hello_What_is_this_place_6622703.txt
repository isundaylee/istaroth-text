Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Cip: Ah, this is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Obsidian is quite common here in Natlan, though, so we often shorten that to "Totem Pole."
Cip: I know what you're thinking, and I don't think that there's any kind of causal relationship there either, but that's what the guard who was posted here before told me.
Cip: Now, I had my doubts, but as I was the new guard and all at the time, I didn't voice them.
Cip: I suppose it's just a little inside joke... Which, for the record, I don't find funny.
Cip: So I'll just tell the same story to whoever my future successor is going to be â€” might be interesting to see how long something as meaningless as this can be passed down.
