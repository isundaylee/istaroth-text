Traveler: Do you plan to continue?
Philby: Uh... Of course. But give me a while to rest up.
Philby: Since I'm already here, I have to pay a visit to Sumeru City. The locals told me that I should attend the festivals held there if I can.
Philby: For example, there's something called the Sabzeruz Festival, which celebrates the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Philby: But when I asked if Lesser Lord Kusanali is also called the Goddess of Flowers, they shook their heads, and said that the Goddess of Flowers and the Dendro Archon aren't the same god. It seems that the Greater Lord and Lesser Lord Kusanali aren't the same god either.
Philby: I don't understand. Then why is Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday called "Sabzeruz Festival"? That's just being obtuse!
