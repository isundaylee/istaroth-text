Traveler: You look well to me...
Qinglian: Oh, really? ...Is it that obvious? Yikes, I've been outed...
Qinglian: *sigh* Okay, I'll come clean. But please, whatever you do, do not tell my husband.
Qinglian: My husband is a sailor. I barely saw him for years as he spent all his time out at sea...
Qinglian: But since I fell ill, he gave all that up to care for me full time. He even hand-picks medicine for me from way up in the mountains.
Qinglian: Of course, we're poorer now that we don't have an income. But these have been the happiest days of my life. And each time I think about him heading back out to sea when I'm all better...
Qinglian: I can't bear the thought. I don't have the courage to face up to it. So instead, I have feigned illness ever since I recovered...
Qinglian: *sigh* What a selfish woman I am...
