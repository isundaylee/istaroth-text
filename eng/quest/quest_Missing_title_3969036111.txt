Traveler: The blades aren't exactly the same as the ones in Liyue.
Amenoma Tougo: Yeah, the materials and methods used to forge the weapons aren't the same, so the resulting weapons would be of a different style as well.
Amenoma Tougo: I heard that Liyue's Archon, Rex Lapis, was skilled at the forging of weapons. Previously, I was curious about what the blades made in Liyue were like.
Amenoma Tougo: So a while ago, I requested someone from the Crux Fleet to bring a weapon made in Liyue to me. I learned a lot after studying that weapon.
Amenoma Tougo: Now, I have fully grasped the techniques that were used to forge that weapon. Seeing as you have deep connections with Liyue, I'll gift this weapon to you.
