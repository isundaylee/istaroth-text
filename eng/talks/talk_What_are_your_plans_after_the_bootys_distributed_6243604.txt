Traveler: What are your plans after the booty's distributed?
Mora-Grubber: How do I put this? I've always had my eye on the process of making money. Never gave much thought to what to do afterward.
Mora-Grubber: Maybe I'll go get a hundred servings of Zhongyuan Chop Suey and treat everyone... Who knows?

Mora-Grubber: I'd say that if you just look at results, you'll miss out on a lot.
