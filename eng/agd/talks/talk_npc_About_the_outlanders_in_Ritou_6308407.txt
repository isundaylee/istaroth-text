Traveler: About the outlanders in Ritou...
Kurisu: Since the head of the Hiiragi Clan was removed from his post, all the affairs of the Kanjou Commission have been well-regulated.
Kurisu: Taxes were reduced, and the officials and soldiers made things less difficult for the merchants. Everyone is really relieved, to be honest, and the number of merchants willing to set up shop here in Ritou has increased.
Kurisu: We've got quite a few new arrivals who aren't yet used to the paths through which goods may be sourced or transported, and so that's where we come in.
Kurisu: Anyway, the Trade Association and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with the support they need.
