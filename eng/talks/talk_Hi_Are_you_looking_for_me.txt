Yi Zhu: Hi... Are you looking for me?
Traveler: And you are?
Yi Zhu: I'm Yi Zhu. I suppose you might've seen my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: I promised her that we'd spend Lantern Rite together and that I'd teach her how to make a Xiao Lantern for our mother.
Yi Zhu: I was preparing some materials, but I didn't expect Miss Changshun to specially give us some...
Yi Zhu: So I've made her one as well. I hope she likes it.
Yi Zhu: Everyone's been taking good care of my sister and I lately. I'm really grateful.
Traveler: See you around, kid.
Yi Zhu: Goodbye... May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
