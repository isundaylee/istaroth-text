Traveler: That's amazing.
Shajar: It's just my job. Some people don't trust my origins, and if there's one thing I hate above all, it's doubters.
Shajar: Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I used to be an Eremite Mercenary... and then I accepted the Akademiya's employment offer. So now I run things here.
Shajar: No difference between those jobs, if you ask me. "Get paid," "do stuff," and tack on a little "don't mess with me." Easy game.
Shajar: Judging by your looks, you're that sort of person yourself, I'll wager?
