# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hard worker? You look like you're hardly working.
Hiia: If making the most of your breaks helps restore your energy so you can work better, then surely resting should be considered part of your job, too?
Hiia: Agh, I shouldn't joke about it. As someone who does night shifts, I'm one to talk...
Hiia: I'll be at the Weary Inn receiving guests in the evening, so if you need somewhere to stay, feel free to come hang out!
Hiia: Uhh, I mean, feel free to come support my work!
