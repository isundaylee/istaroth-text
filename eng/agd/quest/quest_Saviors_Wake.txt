# Savior's Wake


## Talk 1

Caterpillar: I estimated the height of the tower, and we're almost at the bottom. We may have to face Narzissenkreuz if we continue to descend.
Caterpillar: The world is about to welcome its own answer. Will it be destruction or salvation? Or perhaps Narzissenkreuz's version of salvation?
Paimon: Please, who'd wanna escape the apocalypse their way?
Paimon: #If Paimon has to leave, she'll make Traveler take her away from Teyvat.
Traveler: I'm going to save everyone.
Paimon: Hey, Paimon wasn't saying she'd just watch everyone bite the dust!
Caterpillar: There aren't any riddles or pursuers here, so why don't we get some rest and prepare ourselves here?
Traveler: Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.
Seymour: Everyone, the door to the next level seems to be locked.
Seymour: Do you require me to put my engine into overdrive to get enough horsepower to break through?
Caterpillar: That won't be necessary. We've decided to rest and reorganize here anyway, so we should just be cautious and look around for a key.
Caterpillar: And if we discover that it's a door without a key, then I'll kick it open myself.

## Talk 2

Caterpillar: The combat capabilities arrayed here are quite the terrifying sight...
Paimon: Huh. You changed back, Caterpillar!
Caterpillar: Well, we do need to be ready for a fight, after all. Look.
Caterpillar: These must be the security installations that were left behind when the tower was sealed.
Caterpillar: I'm afraid attempting to access the lowest level will trigger their activation sequences.
Seymour: Your guess is correct. I've checked. These clockwork meka can indeed still be activated.
Seymour: In other words, there's also a possibility that they will fail to activate.
Paimon: They've been here for all these years?
Caterpillar: Well, this is the first time in all these years that the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz has been restored.
Caterpillar: If the design from back then is accurate, the Holy Blade itself is the key that will open the final Seal.
Caterpillar: If everyone's ready, let's get started.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa, it feels like the floor is moving...
Caterpillar: It's the beginning of the end.

## Talk 4

Caterpillar: There are some of Narzissenkreuz's notes and books here. Interesting as they may be, none of them have a conclusion.
Traveler: Caterpillar, I have a question.
Caterpillar: Ask away.
Traveler: The members of the Ordo clearly hate clockwork meka...
Traveler: ...So why are there so many gears in this tower?
Caterpillar: Now that is an interesting question. But all I can offer is my own conjecture.
Caterpillar: In my opinion, the theme of this place isn't "gears," but "bells."
Caterpillar: The chime of a bell holds a special meaning even for people like Jakob and Narzissenkreuz.
Traveler: A special meaning?
Caterpillar: When the bell tolls, the world ends, the adventure is over, or you simply awaken from the dream. Who knows?

## Talk 5

Seymour: Hello. How may I assist?
Traveler: About the Gardemeks...
Seymour: Do not worry. All of them are inactive.
Seymour: If we consider their extreme age and the fact that they are early models, the probability of them waking at all is far from certain.
Seymour: According to the records of those with me, accessing the level below will trigger their activation sequences.
Seymour: At that point, around 60% of them will activate successfully. As for the remaining 40%, it's not guaranteed that they will fail to activate either.
Traveler: Ugh...
Seymour: At least there's a chance the slow march of time has reduced the danger we are about to face.
Traveler: You're starting to confuse me.
Seymour: #Apologies, Mr. Traveler.

## Talk 6

Caterpillar: Let's go. The final juncture awaits.

## Talk 7

Caterpillar: Is there anything else I can help with?
Traveler: Will you go see Lanoire once this is all over?
Caterpillar: Probably, but I should also probably keep wandering. I still have a lot of questions that need answering.
Caterpillar: After listening to what Jakob said, I did recall a "Book of Revealing" related to their activities in their early years. Maybe I'll be able to find some clues about myself in there.
Traveler: Do you still care so much about the past?
Caterpillar: I suppose. That said, I'm more interested in knowing whether the novel I read so many years ago has a happy ending.
Caterpillar: I'll find out, come hell or high water — seriously.
Traveler: You're... joking again, aren't you?
Caterpillar: Just a little. But I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing how a wonderful dream ends.

## Talk 8

Seymour: #Anything else, Mr. Traveler?
Traveler: Have you made plans for the future?
Seymour: Do you mean once this is all over? If I can see Ms. Mary-Ann again, I hope...
Seymour: I hope she will agree to visit Mamere with me, and then the three of us can travel the world together.
Traveler: Aww, you're a good boy, aren't you? The goodest.
Seymour: I don't quite understand what you mean.
Traveler: You're such a reliable prototype!
Seymour: Thank you for your praise.

## Talk 9

Caterpillar: #Well, well. Guess what we have stuck between the pages, Traveler?
Paimon: Whoa! It's a key!
Caterpillar: Indeed, and Seymour's already used sonic imaging to do a rough analysis. It really is the key to that door.
Paimon: If Fontaine's authorities raided this place before, why didn't they find this?
Caterpillar: Perhaps the answer is that it was simply never raided. Having looked through the notes here, I think I can understand why...
Caterpillar: Why he simply closed the door and quietly left.
Paimon: Hmm... What are you trying to say?
Caterpillar: It's nothing. Perhaps this is enough. After all, there are clockwork meka below that may come to life at any second.
Caterpillar: Time to go.

## Talk 10

Ann: Let's bring this to an end.

## Talk 11

Seymour: When the two of you are attacked, my permissions will activate, authorizing me to take action against official armed forces.
Seymour: As such, there is no need for concern.

## Talk 12

Paimon: #Traveler, why are people so fond of immersing themselves in dreams?
Paimon: Mary-Ann weaves a dream encircling everyone, and Narzissenkreuz is living in his dream of saving the world.
Traveler: And I'm the one who's worried about tomorrow...
Traveler: ...So it's understandable if you don't understand, Paimon.
Paimon: B—Because Paimon's the type to live in the present!
Traveler: But if it's a dream, you have to wake up eventually.
Paimon: And there are only two things you can do after waking from a dream.
Paimon: You can try to go right back to sleep and return to the same dream...
Paimon: Or, you can face yourself in the waking world.
Paimon: And since you've woken up, it's time for breakfast. You can reward yourself with a nice Chicken-Mushroom Skewer!
Paimon: It's time to wake up again, and bravely face reality for another day. You can do it!
Traveler: Wait, so that really was foreshadowing!?
Paimon: Foreshadowing? What foreshadowing?

## Talk 13

Ann: #Knight Traveler, Paimon, Caterpillar, Seymour... Is everyone alright?
Caterpillar: Yes, it seems that we can now proceed deeper down.
Caterpillar: Let's go, while there's still time.
Paimon: But there's still a bunch of clockwork meka here...
Caterpillar: Go, now! Leave this area to Seymour and I. We'll regroup at the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Traveler: Good luck.
Seymour: There is no need to worry about us. My combat assessment shows a 100% chance of survival.
Black Screen Text: You nod to Caterpillar and Seymour, and then you leap through as the seal drops.
And on the other side, you find...

## Talk 14

Paimon: Looks like Caterpillar and Seymour are stuck on the other side...
Ann: Seymour, Caterpillar...
Paimon: Don't worry about them, Ann. They're strong! Besides, we agreed that we'd meet back up at the Ordo after all this is over, didn't we?
Paimon: And don't forget, we're both here with you!
Ann: ...You're right, Paimon. I've seen how strong, smart, and kind you both are. There's nothing to fear with you two here.
Ann: Nothing to fear at all!
Paimon: (That said, Paimon's a little scared herself...)
Traveler: There's nothing to worry about.
Traveler: We have to keep moving forward.
Ann (Paimon & Ann): Okay!
Paimon: There's no telling what we'll run into next... Let's be careful!
Traveler: There's no hardship we can't overcome.

## Talk 15

Ann: #How can I help you, Knight Traveler?
Ann: Both Caterpillar and Seymour are helping out, but I don't seem to be of any use now.
Traveler: Don't worry about it.
Ann: Of course, I understand. Though it's obvious that we can just kick it open, we've reached an understanding to do some investigating instead.
Ann: I suppose this is us trying to mentally prepare ourselves... after a fashion, right?

## Talk 16

Ann: #Is there anything else I can help with, Knight Traveler?
Traveler: Is there anything in particular that you'd like to do after this is all over?
Ann: Honestly, I haven't given it any thought. I feel like I have nowhere to go.
Ann: After learning the truth, I can never go back to Petit Chou and Al.
Ann: So where should I go?
Ann: Forget it! Those are all problems for future Ann!
