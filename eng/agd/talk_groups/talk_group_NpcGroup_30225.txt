Traveler: About your mentor...
Jami: My mentor's just awful! I've made up my mind. If I get to finish my research in time, I shall stand on his desk and slap him with my draft manuscript!
Jami: Or so I wish... I am grateful to him, though. He's been strict, yes. But it's for our own good. I know that much.

Traveler: About the "Fayz Potion"...
Jami: I don't have any more of it. I gave all I had to you, and it would be a pain to make more...
Jami: You know, I did always think that there were maybe two steps too many in the production process. I omitted them this time, and the result seems to actually have improved...
Jami: Eh? Why didn't I make that my research topic instead...? ... Agh!
Jami: Curses! There's... there's no time to change topics now, is there!?

Traveler: I'm still working on it...
Jami: I'll leave you to them, then. Good luck!
