# Tepetlisaurus Hide-and-Seek


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa, where is this mysterious place? So many little Tepetlisaurs...
Paimon: Could it be some sort of... Tepetlisaurus gathering spot?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! ...Rrrawr?
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} looks so excited! Not often that you get to meet so many companions all in one go, huh?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Paimon: #Oh, you mean you wanna go over there and play with them? Come to think of it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} hardly ever gets to hang out with other little Tepetlisaurs...
Traveler: Be careful, okay?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Uhh, Paimon's still a bit worried... Anyway, let's find somewhere to relax and have something to eat while we wait for {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Black Screen Text: #You and Paimon find a nice spot nearby to rest until {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is done playing.
Black Screen Text: But you end up waiting longer than you expected...
Paimon: #Strange... How come {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} isn't back yet?
Paimon: Paimon sure hopes nothing bad's happened...
Traveler: Gotten a bit carried away with the fun and games, perhaps?
Paimon: If so, we'll have to give him a good talking-to. The sun's nearly set!
Paimon: Ugh... Let's go track it down before it gets so dark we can't even see.
Traveler: Don't be gone too long!

## Talk 2

Paimon: #Hi! You haven't seen {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} around here, have you? Y'know, the new kid on the block...?
Paimon: It's got a mark on its head and a scarf on its tail...
Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus: Rrrawr?
Paimon: Hmm, seems like it can't understand what we're saying.
Paimon: Looks like we have no other choice but to go through them one by one...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Take a look at this little Tepetlisaurus... This one sure knows how to choose a spot for itself!
Paimon: #No, that can't be {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} either. There's no tail-scarf.
Tree-Climbing Little Tepetlisaurus: Rrrawr?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey, is there any chance you've seen...
Black Screen Text: #Paimon tells the clever little Tepetlisaur what {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} looks like.
Clever Little Tepetlisaurus: Rawr!
Clever Little Tepetlisaurus: Rawr!!
Paimon: #Wait a minute, does that mean you know we're looking for {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? You really are a clever little critter, huh?
Paimon: C'mon, let's catch up!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Alright, looks like we've got ourselves a little Tepetlisaurus digging about underground. This has to be—
Little Tepetlisaurus Learning How to Dig: ?
Paimon: #Ugh, that's not {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} either...
Paimon: #*sigh* How are there so many little Tepetlisaurs here? Where in Teyvat did {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} go?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hello there, how do you do...
Paimon: Uhh, wait a sec... Why has Paimon suddenly started greeting little Tepetlisaurs like this?
Lively Little Tepetlisaurus: Rawr! Rawr!
Traveler: Why, Paimon, you're so polite!
Paimon: Hehe, thanks...
Paimon: #But back to the matter at hand, this little Tepetlisaur clearly isn't {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}...
Paimon: #Well, let's just hope that {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s been having as much fun as this little one.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Aha! So you've been here snoozing away! No wonder we couldn't find you all this time...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroh...
Paimon: Looks like you had so much fun you completely tired yourself out.
Paimon: But the world's a dangerous place, y'know! If you start feeling sleepy or need a rest, you've got to come find us first...
Traveler: I told you to be careful...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rowr...
Paimon: Alright, alright... Nothing wrong with a bit of fun every now and again. But be more careful in the future, okay?
Paimon: Anyway, why don't we go say hi to that big Tepetlisaurus over there? Who knows, we might get another chance to hang out with this lot someplace else in the future!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I said not to be gone too long...

## Talk 8

Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus: Roarrr?
Paimon: #Thanks for taking care of {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} all this time!
Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus: Roarrr...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Uhh, well... Whatever they just said, it went right over Paimon's head.
Paimon: #Anyway, it's about time we were off. Say goodbye, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Traveler: Don't be sad, we'll see them again!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rowrr... Rawr!
Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus: Roooar...
Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus: Raaarrr—
Clever Little Tepetlisaurus (Little Tepetlisaurs): Rawr!
Clever Little Tepetlisaurus (Little Tepetlisaurs): Rawr, rrawr...
Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus: Rrroar...
Black Screen Text: The big Tepetlisaurus turns round, as if to signal that it was time that they were off...
The little Tepetlisaurs follow its lead, and together, they leave.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #Aww, you're not feeling lonely are you, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Paimon: Hehe, don't forget that we're here by your side!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rowrr, rawr!
