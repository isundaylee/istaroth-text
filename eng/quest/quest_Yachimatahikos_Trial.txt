# Yachimatahiko's Trial


## Talk 1

Uda: I am Uda of the Jibashiri. Hero of Sangonomiya, I acknowledge that you are worthy to take on this challenge.
Uda: I am in charge of the trial of "wisdom." Go forth and solve all the puzzles to return the Flames of the High Gate to their places.
Uda: It is not bravery that advances bereft of wisdom, but foolhardiness instead!
Uda: I will await your completion of the challenge at the Tower of the Three Realms above.

## Talk 2

## Talk 3

Uda: I, Uda of the Jibashiri, acknowledge your great valor.
Uda: Indeed, you are both "extensive and meticulous" in your wisdom.
Paimon: How can you tell a person's character from these trials?
Uda: To be honest, these words are praises that the Divine Priestess used to bestow upon skilled youths. They eventually came to be written on pennants at the Jibashiri headquarters.

## Talk 4
