# Talk Dialog

Bernhard: Honorary Knight, Paimon, you've been running the shop for a while.
Bernhard: The current operation method of the store refers to the previous business activities, which is fine, but may not be applicable in all cases.
Bernhard: You are well informed and can think about your unique "business style" based on your experience with other business people.
Paimon: Oh! Is this what Bernhard meant earlier when he mentioned "Shop Stratagems"?
Traveler: We actually have quite a few ideas.
Bernhard: Okay! Then do whatever you feel is best, and I will do my best to carry out your orders!
Bernhard: At the same time, I will also help collect the experience of other businessmen and provide it to you.
Bernhard: I hope these notes will inspire you and give you new ideas!
Traveler: It's time to put them into practice.
