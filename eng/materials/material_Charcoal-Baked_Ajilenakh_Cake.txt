# Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake

A dark-colored pastry. The Ajilenakh Nuts were first roasted and powdered before being sieved, added to a batter, mixed evenly, and then baked. The final product by no means looks impressive, but it exudes the fresh aroma of Ajilenakh Nuts, and it tastes better still with some jam.
