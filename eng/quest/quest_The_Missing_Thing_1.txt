# The Missing Thing


## Talk 1

Gorou: #I apologize again for not being completely honest with you, Traveler. I truly am sorry, but... I had to do it.
Traveler: I understand.
Traveler: By the way, does Kokomi know about all this?
Gorou: Ah yes, Her Excellency... Well, let's just say that the war brought many terrible things while also forcing us to learn a lot.
Paimon: Right, but that still doesn't answer the question.
Gorou: Well, ahem... aren't you curious about who's been pushing for the new commodity bill? It certainly isn't the Kanjou Commission, because it doesn't immediately benefit them, and we don't have any connections there.
Paimon: Yeah... it's kinda as if the gods suddenly appeared to offer you a divine hand.
Gorou: Haha, yeah, the gods...
Gorou: I was invited to attend the Irodori Festival on Narukami Island with Her Excellency a while back.
Gorou: At the festival, I waited in the marketplace while Her Excellency...

## Talk 2

Paimon: This box is packed so tight, it looks like it could burst. Let's see what's inside.
Paimon: Huh? What are all these plants and flowers? Oh, there's a small note here.
Paimon: (A torn bill. The handwriting has been smudged by water stains, making it difficult to read. Only a faint outline of the words "Foreign Trade Association" can be seen at the signature.)

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa! Qingxin! Paimon was expecting to find Sango Pearls...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Glaze Lilies! What are these doing here? Shouldn't it be Crystal Marrow or something...

## Talk 5

Nanao: Officer, don't forget to tell the officials how cooperative we've been! Please put in a good word for us!

## Talk 6

Tokuda: Your intel was spot on. When we arrived, the Nobushi were all still asleep, haha.
Tokuda: We captured them all, and the goods were retrieved and brought back here.
Todoroki: I'll take a look. Hmm... Everything seems in order, good work.
Tokuda: It's nothing. Thanks to the efforts of your caravan, the price of grain in the village has decreased.
Masashi: That's right, and who would have thought that the injuries we sustained during the war would have such a lingering effect on our bodies. But thankfully, you also brought back some life-saving medicine.
Todoroki: Things are improving thanks to the help from those up top. By the way, what is the state of the village's inventory?
Todoroki: Make sure that it's confirmed tonight, I have to leave tomorrow morning after I go to the Sangonomiya Shrine and get instructions from General Gorou.
Masashi: Don't worry. We've already prepared the list. Just follow us.

## Talk 7

Tokuda: Todoroki, the shipment has arrived and is ready for inspection.
Todoroki: Good, let's go.
Paimon: Hey, it's Todo... mmph!
Shikanoin Heizou: Shh! Keep quiet. Let's follow him and see where he leads us.

## Talk 8

Shikanoin Heizou: Alright, let's see what we can come up with here.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Went to see Lady Yae.
Gorou: Yeah.
Gorou: She went to the Kanjou Commission to see Lady Yae — purportedly for a book review, but there were other items on the agenda, too. The meeting wasn't made public.
Gorou: Following her return, we began our attempts at boosting commercial activity, and it wasn't long before there was a push for a new commodity bill on Narukami Island...
Gorou: So, what do you make of it? Do you think Her Excellency knows about this?
