## Talk

Este: I'm counting on you, then. *sigh* How could something like this happen...
Este: I can't just leave everyone else in town to fend for themselves, or I'd be up a gander back to the ruins to investigate... Still, it's a good thing I ran into you!
Este: Please be extra careful.

## Talk

Este: Hello. We meet again. To be honest, seeing you once more makes me wonder if I'm still in a dream...

## Talk

Traveler: What have you been busy with lately?
Este: Since that incident, I've discovered that hypnosis is indeed a most promising research direction.
Este: Just think about it! In a dream, all your fantasies could easily come true, could they not?
Este: As such, I've read the notes Grispan left behind. I'm not sure I'll do better than him, but I can at least add to the field.
Este: He's sure to be impressed when he returns!

## Talk

Traveler: Is Osse doing well?
Este: Most definitely. Despite his tender age, he's a brave little kitty. Shockingly bold, even.
Este: He's utterly unafraid of strangers. I'm sure he'd get along with everyone in town smashingly.

## Talk

Traveler: See you next time!
Este: See you. Do come and see Osse more often. I'm sure he misses you.
