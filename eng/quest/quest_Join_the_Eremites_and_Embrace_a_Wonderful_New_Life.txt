# Join the Eremites and Embrace a Wonderful New Life!


## Talk 1

Paimon: Basically, we just need to get over there as quickly as possible, right?
Paimon: Honestly, Paimon's surprised by how easy that is...

## Talk 2

Sania: How worrying...
Atiyah: Good afternoon, Sania! What are you buying?
Sania: I've told you many times before, Atiyah, Jabari isn't interested in joining you, nor do I want him to go become a mercenary. I'm not going to help you convince him.
Atiyah: Well, that's a shame. With his culinary skills, Jabari'd do really well with us, and your family's financial standing would be improved greatly, too.
Atiyah: And hasn't he said before that he'd like to go out and find work? If that's what he really wants, who better to recommend work than an old friend, eh?
Sania: Don't take anything he says seriously. He'll tell you that one day, and change his mind the next.
Sania: In the end, he just can't bear to leave me here alone in the village... and I couldn't bear to see him slogging away by himself, either.
Sania: What's more, you're asking that he risk his neck out there as a mercenary! Even if he wanted to go, I'd stop him for sure.
Sania: Let's just leave this topic be. I've got things to buy — go bother someone else.
Atiyah: Phew... Well, alright then. You see, traveler? This is what work looks like for me every day.
Atiyah: Next up on my list of people to meet is Fodil. He was one of us once... but he quit.
Atiyah: Sure would be nice if I could convince him to make a bit of a comeback...

## Talk 3

Fodil: Atiyah... Not you again.
Atiyah: Hehe, persistence is one of our virtues, you know.
Fodil: Well, then you should know that sticking to principles is mine.
Atiyah: Come on now, brother...
Fodil: I've left the organization already. Don't call me that.
Atiyah: Right, alright, Fodil. You sure you're not considering coming back at all?
Atiyah: I know that some of us can be a bit... reckless, but most of us are perfectly law-abiding citizens!
Fodil: I've said this before, Atiyah. I'm not going back.
Fodil: The things you speak of, I've already confirmed them with my own two eyes.
Fodil: Perhaps not all the Eremites are a lawless lot, and not every Eremite enjoys kicking those who have already gone down...
Fodil: But ill deeds spread, Atiyah. All it takes is one person to act like the law is merely a suggestion, and everyone else will be affected by them.
Fodil: One person influences another, and if that group keeps acting a certain way, they will influence yet more people...
Fodil: I'm sure you know what that means better than I do, Atiyah.
Fodil: It is all too easy to do evil in such an environment.
Atiyah: ...
Fodil: You wish for me to return... just as I wish for you to leave.
Fodil: Perhaps from your perspective, the Eremites are not an evil organization even if they're not exactly honorable... But you can't always live in shades of gray.
Fodil: This is just a word of advice. You may do with it as you will.
Atiyah: I know, chief.
Fodil: Alright. If you do leave and need a new line of work, I will help you.
Traveler: Are you alright?
Atiyah: Heh, well, there's no way I can win an argument with Fodil, I guess.
Atiyah: What's next? Right, right, let's rest a bit. I gotta say, my throat's getting tired after all that.

## Talk 4

Ayten: Hey, Uncle Atiyah! You still asking people to join the Eremites?
Atiyah: Why, if it isn't Ayten. Did you tell your mother you were coming here?
Ayten: I did! She's working, so I went to go play with Karima.
Karima: Hello, Uncle Atiyah!
Ayten: Uncle Atiyah, what do you think? About the stuff we talked about last time.
Ayten: I've been working out this whole time, and I've even been training with Karima.. She's never gonna catch me again in a race!
Karima: That one time doesn't count! It was because I didn't eat enough for lunch that day!
Ayten: ...Anyway, I've been following the training plan you gave me...
Ayten: So let me take the test again! Let's see if I'm good enough to join the Eremites!
Traveler: Ah, so this is what you meant by...
Atiyah: Ahem! Alright then, Ayten. As a member of the Eremites, I will conduct the test once again!
Ayten: Alright! C'mon, Karima, you join in too. Let's do this together!
Karima: But I don't wanna join the Eremites... I just want to stay here in the village and protect everyone...
Karima: But it would be nice to get Uncle Atiyah to test my skills. I mean, I did ask Miss Candace for advice on how to train before!
Ayten: Wait, what? When did you...
Atiyah: Hahaha! Good, good, that's the spirit!
Atiyah: Alright, Ayten, stop pouting. If we get the chance, I'll bring you to go get some pointers from Dehya! How does that sound?
Ayten: Really!? You'd do that?
Atiyah: We Eremites don't lie, kiddo.
Atiyah: But before we begin the test, let's have this traveler show us the expected standards.
Traveler: Wait, I'm involved in this now?
Atiyah: ...I haven't had the chance to do any demonstrations before. I couldn't just run around doing those and leave these kids here by themselves. That would be too dangerous... Anyway, thanks for your help, Traveler.
Atiyah: #*cough* Anyway, our Traveler here's a very capable adventurer. I had to do a lot to get {M#him}{F#her} to come and give you a demonstration.
Atiyah: Better watch carefully now.
Ayten: Alright!
Karima: An adventurer, huh? As in, someone from the Adventurers' Guild?
Atiyah: No matter whether you're a mercenary or a guard, you will always wind up coming across situations in which retreat is the best option.
Atiyah: When that happens, we often live by the principle that the quicker we can get away, the better.
Atiyah: Thank you, Traveler. Now, let us quickly demonstrate... How to make a swift retreat!
Atiyah: Here's our starting point. Now then, please demonstrate.
Traveler: Don't you usually do the demonstrations?
Atiyah: Oh, come on, do I look like I had time to demonstrate between my job and looking out for these kids?
Atiyah: I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: ...Someone who wants to join?

## Talk 5

Ayten: Wow!
Karima: You're... so fast...
Atiyah: Very good! You were quick... and more importantly, very steady.
Atiyah: Watch and learn, kids.
Atiyah: Don't insist on pushing through every dangerous situation you get in. If you must retreat, retreat decisively!
Atiyah: That means you especially, Ayten.
Ayten: I know, I know...
Atiyah: Good. Let's move on to the next step... It's time for some live combat demonstration.
Ayten: Ooh, awesome! My dad carved me a wooden sword that I carry with me. What about you, Karima?
Karima: I do have a small bow, though my mother only gave me arrows without tips...
Atiyah: Hahaha! That's alright! You have a sword and a bow, and your boundless courage. That's all anyone really needs to begin their adventures.
Atiyah: But remember not to run around aimlessly when you're outside the village. Stick with me and the Traveler at all times.
Traveler: You're really taking them outside the village?
Atiyah: Oh, don't you worry. I've scouted that area beforehand. There's just a bunch of sickly scorpions out there. They barely retain any offensive capabilities, so we should be alright.
Atiyah: And whatever happens, the two of us will be there!
Traveler: So you're counting me in now?
Atiyah: Oh, come on, we're already here. You know, "in for one Mora, in for a thousand" and such! I'll make sure to pay you according to the Guild's regulations!
Atiyah: Well, buckle up, kids. We're heading off!
Ayten: Woohoo!
Karima: I must admit... I'm a bit nervous.
Traveler: I don't remember agreeing to this...
Traveler: We're going out with two kids in tow...

## Talk 6

Ayten: Those scorpions are huge! Uh, should we really get any closer to them?
Karima: I shot them with my bow, but they didn't even flinch...
Karima: But you... you defeated them so easily...
Traveler: Well, that's many years of training for you.
Karima: But... Miss Candace said I'd improved...
Atiyah: Chin up, Karima! You'll become strong eventually — but you've got to take it all one day at a time.
Atiyah: You too, Ayten. If you keep training hard like this, it's only a matter of time before we'll let you in.
Ayten: Ohh, if only I could get Miss Dehya to teach me...
Karima: The next time I see Miss Candace, I'll get her to teach me more!
Atiyah: Hahaha! That's the spirit!
Traveler: And in the end, you didn't get anyone to join.
Atiyah: *cough* Hey now, didn't they ever tell you not to harp on a man's private woes?
Atiyah: We can talk about work later... and it's not as if my advertising has had no effect at all.
Atiyah: Lots of young men and women have left the village to see the outside world after hearing what I had to say... even if they didn't really want to join us.
Atiyah: Well, we can talk about that later. I have to bring these kids back to the village now. Their parents are probably at least a bit worried now that they've been out so long.
Atiyah: Here's a little something for you, by the way. Thanks for coming all the way out here with me.
Atiyah: *sigh* Now, how am I going to explain this to the rest of the Eremites when I go back for a debriefing...
Ayten: Uh, Uncle Atiyah, you haven't given us our tests yet.
Atiyah: That so? Ah, yes... yes. Let's go back to the village first, and then we'll do the test there.
Traveler: What about your job, then?
Traveler: You two are still young.
