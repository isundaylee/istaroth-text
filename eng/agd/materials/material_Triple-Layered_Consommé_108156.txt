# Triple-Layered Consommé

A neatly arranged dish. The Ham, Fowl, and Bamboo Shoots have been sliced into threads of equal length, and they've been laid out neatly in the soup bowl after being steamed at high heat, before being covered in consommé. The layers are distinct, and the mouthfeel is salty yet fresh.
