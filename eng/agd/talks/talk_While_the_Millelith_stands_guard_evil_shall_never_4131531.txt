Jiayi: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
Jiayi: Have you released a Xiao Lantern yet? If you write a wish on the lantern, it's bound to come true someday.
Jiayi: For example, my wish was that my daughter Little Liu would live a peaceful and healthy life, and that she'd make many friends, haha.
Jiayi: ...Perhaps you'll even be able to see the sky filled with Xiao Lanterns from atop the hills of Qingce Village.
Jiayi: *sigh* Little Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...
