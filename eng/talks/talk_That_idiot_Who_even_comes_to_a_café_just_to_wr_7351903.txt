# Talk Dialog

Shriya: That idiot...! Who even comes to a café just to write reports!?
Traveler: Why are you here by yourself?
Shriya: Ugh, let's not talk about that half-witted gearhead! The sun must've baked my brains out for me to have believed that he'd seen the light!
Shriya: The last time we agreed to meet at a café, I spent half a day to get ready, and even changed into a brand new set of clothes...
Shriya: And the first thing he said when he saw me was "Did you bring the materials and writing tools?"
Shriya: Argh! He should just... stay with his precious machines forever! They'll keep him company, I'm sure!
Traveler: Where did Vinayak hop off to?
