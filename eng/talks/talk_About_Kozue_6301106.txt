# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About Kozue...
Nakanishi: Many people have been taken in by Kozue's weak, girly appearance and have paid the price.
Nakanishi: This girl is not just a talker. She can handle herself really well.
Nakanishi: She is the offspring of the Kamisato Clan's retainers. Her swordsmanship is impeccable. Though she's nowhere near as good as me, haha.
Nakanishi: Anyway, with her skills, she is definitely qualified to be the gatekeeper of Komore Teahouse. Perhaps she's even overqualified...
