Guan Hong: *sigh* Life truly is short...

## Talk

Traveler: Is everything alright?
Guan Hong: I'm fine, it's just that I was diagnosed with an incurable illness a while back. I was told that I didn't have long...
Guan Hong: So I asked myself, what have I done my entire life?
Guan Hong: I've worked hard, sacrificing my health, and what did I earn for it? A pile of things I wasn't born with, and can't take with me when I die.
Guan Hong: Looking back, I didn't do even one thing that I could be proud of in all those decades. Ha...
Guan Hong: It's a shame that I realized it so late.

Traveler: I'll leave you to it.
Guan Hong: Yes, thank you. I need some time alone.

Guan Hong: Hahaha, are you here to have fun too?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Guan Hong: What am I doing? I'm enjoying life!
Guan Hong: I always thought that work was the most important thing. I slept little, ate little â€” got myself neither a wife nor kids!
Guan Hong: ...At least, that was until Dr. Baizhu told me I was a goner a little while back. That's when I figured it out! What work? What career? It's all hogwash!
Guan Hong: Good thing all the money I've saved in my earlier years is more than enough for me to wine and dine myself to death here at the Pearl Galley.
Guan Hong: ...Actually, when I put it like that, things aren't so bad! Hahaha!

Traveler: See you around, then.
Guan Hong: Hey now, don't be so quick to leave...
