# The Formula for a Miracle


## Talk 1

Baizhu: ...
Jialiang: Ugh... That strange feeling is back...
Jialiang: It's just like the day I went missing... It's as if something inside me is trying to guide me somewhere...
Baizhu: The mother lode's influence is growing stronger... But is it because we're getting closer to the source, or because the leakage of Chi blood is growing more severe?
Baizhu: Jialiang, can you sense which direction the source is in?
Jialiang: I think it's... this way!

## Talk 2

Jialiang: ...I feel a dull ache in my heart... This must be the way.

## Talk 3

Xiao: Hm? From the looks of it, you've already tracked down the location of the source?
Traveler: We've made some progress...
Xiao: Really? That's good to hear.
Traveler: Have you been standing guard here this entire time?
Xiao: ...I cannot simply look the other way when evil spirits are involved.
Xiao: In any case, the evil presence here is growing stronger. I can sense it.
Xiao: ...Whatever you're planning to do, make it quick.
Xiao: If you leave it too long, and I am compelled to intervene... things may not turn out the way you wish.

## Talk 4

Jialiang: This place feels familiar... I think I've been here before.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa, there's a censer here... Those Treasure Hoarders sure made themselves at home...
Traveler: (I don't see any dust on the censer's surface...)
Traveler: ...I don't think this was left here by the Treasure Hoarders.
Baizhu: ...I believe this censer was used to burn a monster-repelling incense.
Paimon: A monster-repelling incense? You sure? 'Cause we did run into that group of monsters just now.
Baizhu: The incense was burned several days ago. If I had to guess, the monsters we fought just now were enticed here by some entity deeper inside the cave.
Baizhu: No doubt an encounter with the very same entity was what prompted the Treasure Hoarders to flee and abandon their designs on this cave.
Baizhu: After them, Jiangli was the next person to discover this place, and what lies inside... But to her, it presented an opportunity to save Jialiang's life, albeit as a last resort...
Jialiang: That's right... This censer — it belongs to Jiangli! Yes, this was the place!
Jialiang: This is where... I told Jiangli to give me the poison... *cough* *cough*
Paimon: Jialiang!
Jialiang: I'm fine... Let's keep going. I can feel it, sh—she... is right below us... waiting for me.
Traveler: (The burn marks on the inside are still fresh...)

## Talk 6

Qiqi: Everyone, please be careful.

## Talk 7

Jialiang: I can feel it... We're getting close...
Jialiang: We're almost there... It's right up ahead, the place where we made a pact together to... Ugh...
Baizhu (Changsheng): ...

## Talk 8

Message: "We're going to Natlan! Mom told me that there could be herbs there that aren't in any medicine books."
Message: "I've heard that the hot springs in Natlan help with muscle relaxation and blood circulation. Perhaps they will be beneficial for Jialiang..."
Message: "Let's not think too much about that for now, and just focus on the journey! We are going to enjoy every moment we can spend as a family."
Message: (At the end of the message, you see three crudely drawn stick figures. It shows a man, a woman and their son, holding hands as they set off on a new journey.)

## Talk 9

Jialiang: ...

## Talk 10

Qiqi: Now that you are part-zombie, there are some rules that you need to know.
Jialiang: Uhh... Y—Yes, Ma'am. I'm listening...
Qiqi: First. Don't forget to stretch your body regularly. Second. Don't forget to...
Jialiang: Yes? Go on? Don't forget to...?
Qiqi: ...I forgot.

## Talk 11

Jiangli: Time flies... It's been so long since we bade each other farewell in Chenyu Vale.
Jiangli: Changsheng, you're the same as ever. You haven't changed one bit!
Baizhu (Changsheng): You, on the other hand, have changed a lot.
Jiangli: ...You're right. My younger self would have never imagined that things would one day turn out this way.
Jiangli: ...Or that you'd turn out this way, Baizhu.
