Traveler: You can hunt?
Ashpazi: Of course. Where do you think the meat I sell comes from? Did you think stupid boars rush at me and ram their heads against my arrows?
Ashpazi: ...Haha, that's enough jokes. After being with Mr. Tighnari for so long, even the way he speaks has rubbed off on me.
Ashpazi: I oversee logistics for the Forest Rangers, so knowing how to hunt and cook is perfectly normal, right?
Ashpazi: In my opinion, the first step to being a good chef is to be a good hunter.
