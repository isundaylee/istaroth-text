## Talk 3

Verut: Agh, you found me so quickly! I was just planning on switching locations...
Verut: Now I'll have to go back to the meeting point...

## Talk 4

Lovi: Ugh, so you found me... Huh? Wait, who are you?
Traveler: A friend of Aurele and Verut.
Lovi: Oh! They mentioned you before... Verut said you're really good at this.
Lovi: Well, guess I got to see it for myself today. You really are good at this, huh?
Lovi: You got me good. Guess I'll head back to the meeting spot, then.

## Talk 5

Aurele: Why are you looking at me like that?
Verut: You were secretly reading a book again, weren't you? You weren't playing seriously at all!
Lovi: That's right. Come on! Be serious!
Aurele: Well, the two of you took the good spots, and I'm not very good at this... so I just went to read to pass the time, you know?
Verut: Bleh! You're a lying liar!
Lovi: Hmph! Bookworm!
Aurele: Seriously? Spare me...
Traveler: Alright, let him be.
Verut: Hehe, Lovi's really good at hide-and-seek. She knows all sorts of interesting hiding spots.
Verut: Hehehe, this place is pretty awesome when Lovi's around!
Lovi: Verut climbs walls super fast, and he's really strong. He gave me a hand quite a few times.
Lovi: As long as we go together, I bet no one but you would be able to find us!
Aurele: Alright, I think we're more or less done for the day. Let's send you home first, Lovi.
Lovi: And then... you're gonna ask my dad questions again, right?
Aurele: Wâ€”Well, there are some things that I'll need to consult him about, you know...
Lovi: Well, sure, my dad's definitely going to be home right now, so let's head back. My mom said that the two of you should stay for dinner, you know...
Traveler: Weren't you two having fun anyway?

## Talk 6

Lovi: You found me again...
Lovi: Verut's right, you're no ordinary person...
Lovi: You got me good. Guess I'll head back to the meeting spot, then.
