Tingting: Have you finished reading the fan novel that we bought together?
Sasano: Yup, more or less...
Tingting: Wasn't it great? I loved the ending, the way in which the female lead chose to stride towards her new life, convictions in hand!
Sasano: You know, although the plotline at the start was very exciting, I remember that this wasn't the original ending...
Tingting: *sigh* I guess that's the freedom of fan works for you.
Tingting: Getting to see all sorts of characters' stories in fan works is exactly their charm.
Sasano: ...That's true, that's true. You've got a point there...
Sasano: Also, I've heard that a new picture book's come out over there. Wanna go have a look?

Tingting: Hmm... Even if I've met him, I still have to...

Traveler: Something on your mind?
Tingting: Ah, well, I'm a researcher from Liyue. My dream is to travel around the world and visit all seven nations.
Tingting: My journey has been pretty smooth so far in Mondstadt, Sumeru, Natlan, and Fontaine. But things developed unexpectedly here in Inazuma.
Tingting: Because of the Sakoku Decree, I could not enter Inazuma City. When I was about to leave out of disappointment, I ran into him...

Traveler: "Him"?
Tingting: Yeah, he was the first person I met in Inazuma who was willing to help me.
Tingting: Because he saw that I was a lone outlander, he offered a lot of help to me while I was stuck in Ritou.
Tingting: Honestly, he's very kind and warm. I've become quite fond of him...
Tingting: But my worldwide sojourn has not ended yet. I can't just settle in Inazuma.
Tingting: Love is precious, but liberty is more so still... I really need to choose carefully.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Tingting: Goodbye. Safe travels.

Tingting: Oh... What if he insists on staying...?

Traveler: Is something troubling you?
Tingting: Ah, well, I'm a researcher from Liyue. My dream is to travel around the world and visit all seven nations.
Tingting: My journey has been pretty smooth so far in Mondstadt, Sumeru, Natlan, and Fontaine. But things developed unexpectedly here in Inazuma due to the Sakoku Decree, and I was unable to leave Ritou.
Tingting: Now, I can finally explore the islands here.
Tingting: But my journey here will end someday, and at that time, I might just have no choice but to leave him...

Traveler: Freedom...
Tingting: Yeah, if you don't have a desire for freedom, then no matter how long you've been journeying for, you still won't be able to see things with an open mind.
Tingting: From the looks of things, you are also a Traveler, right? These are for you.
Tingting: After you go to more places, I think you'll be able to understand the value of freedom more.
