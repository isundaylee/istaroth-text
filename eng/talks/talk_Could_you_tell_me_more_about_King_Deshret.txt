Traveler: Could you tell me more about King Deshret?
Nawaz: Well, I don't actually know that much myself. Some adults say that we should believe in the Dendro Archon, and others say that we should believe in King Deshret...
Nawaz: Do those gods just not get along or something?
Nawaz: King Deshret has the coolest Scarabs, but those adults who tell me to believe in King Deshret always sound so annoying... I don't like them.
Nawaz: I've heard that King Deshret once had loads of awesome animal friends! Sheep, wolves, and... and... what was that again...?
Nawaz: Well, whatever the case, how could he be an unfriendly god if he was such good friends with the animals?
Nawaz: But if that was true, why are the people who believe in him so unfriendly?
