# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine...
Elphane: A natural point of interest is The Steambird. As for the reason it's recommended... This is what was written — "Whatever, just find a way to recommend it."
Traveler: Sure, sure. Any personal recommendations?
Elphane: Yes. First, Bertin's House of Curiosities and Chioriya Boutique. Both of them sell very... cute clothes. They even have gloves custom-fit for Melusines. Not that I'm interested or anything!
Elphane: Otherwise, my friends and I often go to Café Lutece. The smell of coffee is just too good — even better than Emilie's perfume.
