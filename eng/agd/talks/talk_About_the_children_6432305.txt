Traveler: About the children...
Iosaphat: Oh, those "tiger cubs"... They want to go into the forest every day, but children should have this sort of energy.
Iosaphat: Sudabeh and Kavus are just the child-version of me, haha...
Iosaphat: But I hope they can be more careful. They have been missing for days before. Everyone in the village was worried sick...
Iosaphat: Oh, if only my wife were here... She would be able to keep all the children in line.
Iosaphat: But she's a busy researcher. Right now she's in the Akademiya, conducting some sort of research...
