# Talk Dialog

Souka: Whoa! Our gold and silver bosses! I didn't expect to run into you here!
Traveler: Who are you?
Paimon: What's an Eremite doing here?
Souka: Hehe! You can't recognize me? Great, that means my disguise is a huge success!
Souka: Alright! Hand over your friendship fees!
Paimon: We will never give you any Mora!
Paimon: Wait a minute... Friendship fees?
Souka: A warm hug works too, or maybe a pat on the shoulder? Even a fist bump would be nice!
Souka: Reunions should be celebrated with happiness and cheer!
Souka: Aren't you happy? The Guest of Tenshukaku, the Slayer of Three Thousand Bandits in Seven Days, and the Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor?
Paimon: This string of strange names, and the way you greeted us... with "Boss"?
Paimon: Paimon remembers now!
Paimon: A—Are you... Souka?
Souka: Bingo! You've got it right! Souka, Mercenary Mode, is making her debut!
Traveler: Long time no see! You seem to be in high spirits!
Paimon: Why are you acting just like Haniyyah? You're like a completely different person as well!
Paimon: Are you wearing Haniyyah's clothes?
Souka: Looks good on me, right? It's light, flexible, and breathable, making it perfect for life in the rainforest. And it's just right for Fontaine too. I stay quite cool once I tie my hair up!
Souka: It's perfect for running errands in Fontaine, and I don't even need Mist Flower Corollas for heat relief!
Souka: Speaking of which, have you seen Haniyyah? We're releasing the improved version of Fungus Mechanicus, known as "Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta," here in Fontaine.
Souka: It comes with brand-new opponents! The pieces were carefully selected and designed based on adventurer stories from everywhere!
Souka: Every Lil' Fungi's moves has been redesigned as well, so playing it is guaranteed to be a fresh experience!
Traveler: An even more wonderful experience, you say!
Paimon: Heh, it's more exciting to go up against moving opponents! Commanding our Fungi friends to victory should feel more awesome than ever!
Souka: Recognition from both my bosses, hurrah! Guess I've gotta work harder from now on, huh?
Paimon: We've heard from Haniyyah that you stand in front of The Steambird's office because you're putting advertisements in their paper. Is that the case?
Souka: That's right! I have an appointment with a journalist to write the text for it. Don't worry, writing's my specialty!
Souka: Balfour was invited by the Fontaine Research Institute to look for technical support personnel to improve the Wisdom Orb, so we're each doing our own things for now.
Souka: I want to play a round with you when I'm done, so please, wait for me!
Paimon: You can do it, Souka!
Traveler: Well done, Souka!
Traveler: I don't remember!
Paimon: #Hmm, we last met Souka in Sumeru, so it's understandable that you can't remember, Traveler.
Paimon: A very long time ago, she participated in the Beast Tamers Tournament to gather material, and we defeated her...
Paimon: But she wasn't angered by that, and she even promised to write us into her novel as decent opponents.
Paimon: Later on, she started taking care of our Fungi buddies with Haniyyah, and she has been providing ideas to help create games.
Traveler: Whoa! The Eremites are invading!
Paimon: Eek! Someone get the Gardes...
Paimon: Wait, will that really be necessary?
Souka: Hey! Stop that! Hahaha! You're not afraid at all!
Souka: You're a tough duo. Some mercenaries who managed to escape from you painted your portraits and warned others to avoid messing with you at all costs.
Souka: Forget heroes like you, and let's not even consider the Gardemeks patrolling the streets. A Blubberbeast would knock me out with a mere swing of its tail!
Souka: Not to mention that I'm no invader. I'm just a tourist dressed as a mercenary who is conducting standard business activities.
Souka: Haniyyah got Ms. Turenna to send a photograph of me to the Maison Gardiennage, so the Gardes aren't going to arrest me!
Traveler: Wait... Did you just mention... Haniyyah?
Paimon: A—Are you... Souka?
Souka: Bingo! You've got it right! Souka, Mercenary Mode, is making her debut!

Traveler: Paimon, run!
Paimon: Oh no! A weird Eremite! Run!
