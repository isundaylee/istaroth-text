Traveler: What are you doing?
Chalmet: Honorary Senior Researcher, how wonderful to see you. I'm organizing these files and folders in accordance with Monsieur Raimondo's instructions.
Chalmet: This part of the archive wasn't so badly hit by the explosion and is still structurally sound, so the files are in good shape.
Chalmet: Although I'm not sure how useful they are now... But we should at least get them properly filed first.
