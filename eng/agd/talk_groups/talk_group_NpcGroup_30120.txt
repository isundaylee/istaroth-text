Shenhe: Liyue Harbor by night is even brighter than Mt. Aocang by day.
Shenhe: I couldn't get used to this view at first. But I'm told this is how it always looks at the Lantern Rite. I guess everyone likes brightly lit places, because every time you mention Lantern Rite, people can't help but smile.
Shenhe: Like this, look.
Traveler: Yes, that's the Lantern Rite smile.
Shenhe: #Will you be staying here for good now, Traveler?
Traveler: Just for the festival.
Shenhe: ...Oh, I see.
Shenhe: Well... it's nice to see you.
Shenhe: If Lantern Rite could continue indefinitely... that would be even better.
