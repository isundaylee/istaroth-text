Traveler: Good night, Sara.
Kujou Sara: Going to bed at this hour? Perhaps there is something on your mind?
Kujou Sara: If so, there is no harm in telling me. If not, then all the better. There's no reason for you to worry needlessly.
Kujou Sara: #If there's nothing else, then... good night, Traveler.
