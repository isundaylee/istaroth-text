Traveler: Around here...
Neriman: The long-term residents of Port Ormos are mostly traders and laborers who grew up around here.
Neriman: A lot of visitors and traders come here, but they tend to stick around only long enough to finish their business.
Neriman: For lodging, go to the hotel on the highland by the sea. Make sure to take the lift and spare yourself the long climb up.
Neriman: Who else is there... ah, right, the civil workers and Eremite mercs sent by the Akademiya.
Neriman: I'm not familiar with them, and people usually don't bother them. We'd rather spend time drinking in Djafar Tavern!
