# Uninvited Guests


## Talk 1

Paimon: Eh? The monsters here have all been beaten up!
Paimon: Wow, this place is a complete mess...
Paimon: What happened here? Let's check this area out. We might find some clues!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh, not a single clue in sight. Who defeated all these monsters? Was it... another adventurer?
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: But since these monsters have been defeated, let's just go back to Huai'an and tell him the news.

## Talk 3

Xiao: ...Oh, it's you.
Traveler: What brings you here?
Xiao: I encountered these monsters by chance and defeated them.
Xiao: This area is not safe. So...
Traveler: I'll be careful.
Xiao: Right. I have other matters to attend to. See you.
Traveler: Those monsters...

## Talk 4

Huai'an: You're back. Agh, those monsters were really hard to deal with...
Traveler: You beat them all?
Huai'an: Hahaha, that's right. It took quite a lot of work, you know? Ah, I'm just not the young fighter I used to be.
Huai'an: I suppose you've defeated the ones on your end as well, eh?
Traveler: About the monster camp...
Huai'an: They were all defeated... But there was not a soul in the camp?
Huai'an: That's very strange. Did some passing adventurer defeat them?
Huai'an: Whatever the case, thanks for patrolling the area on my behalf. Please take these.

Huai'an: So he did it? But why would he...
Huai'an: Eh. I'm not going to second-guess him.
Huai'an: Whatever the case, thanks for patrolling the area on my behalf. Please take these.
