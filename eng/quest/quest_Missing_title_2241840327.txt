# Missing title (2241840327)


## Talk 1

Albizzi: Everyone, I have returned. I come with the long-awaited Marquis and their followers to search for the lost origins of our clan!
Giant Guard: Well, we weren't told anything about that this morning. Get out of here. Leave us alone.
Black Screen Text: The giant guards scoop you all up and throw you outside.
No one is able to fight back.

## Talk 2

Giant Guard: Thank you for being honest and surrendering willingly. Now, we will politely escort you out of the restricted area.
Black Screen Text: The giant guards scoop you all up and gently places you outside.
The whole process is extremely civilized.

## Talk 3

Albizzi: This is the guards' headquarters. If we can just explain the situation, I'm sure the giant guard will be less hostile towards us.
Traveler: Hello...
Knock on Door: What are you doing? I'm busy reminiscing about old times with a photo of my friend.
Albizzi: I know that voice. Is that Winston?
Knock on Door: Hahaha, so, you come crawling back... I told you, I am your only friend in this world. What were you thinking, running off on a mission with two complete strangers?
Knock on Door: You were so naive. "Oh, I'll make friends with them, I know I will!" But in the end, I alone am waiting for you. I alone am your friend.
Albizzi: #That's not true... It's not just those two. There's {NICKNAME}-Marquis and {M#his}{F#her} companion, too.
Knock on Door: ...You made other friends behind my back!? Well, look at you, Albizzi, all grown up... That's the last straw. Get out of here! I never want to see your face again!
Albizzi: Actually, no. Why don't you lift the emergency measures for a second and let me in? I have a VIP with me and we're very close to solving the mystery of our sacred site.
Knock on Door: I said, get out!!!
Black Screen Text: Winston sounds the alarm. The giant guards arrive, scoop everyone up, and place you outside.
"You and Winston both need your own space right now. Your friendship needs a cooling-off period."
The guards kindly offer relationship advice.
The whole process is unusually civilized.

## Talk 4

Giant Guard: Suspicious individuals detected! I don't know what law you've broken, but we're currently at the highest level of alert. Come with us, turn yourselves in!
Black Screen Text: Everyone scatters. You hear Cappet's voice shouting out, "It's every man for himself!"
After the guards have gone, you regroup back at the same place. It looks like no one was caught...
Detective: Let's try that again, shall we?

## Talk 5

Giant Guard: Arrest these suspicious individuals, and their associate Albizzi! You're coming with me!
