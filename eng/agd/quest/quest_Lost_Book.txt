# Lost Book


## Talk 1

Lisa: It must be nearby.
Lisa: Using *Elemental Sight*, you can even detect *magic*.
Lisa: Follow the flow of *magic* to find the book.

## Talk 2

Paimon: The thief lives inside *ruins*? Mondstadt people do have some strange quirks.
Lisa: Please do not jump to such a preposterous conclusion about the living habits of Mondstadt's residents.
Lisa: This seems far more likely to be the work of some none-too-friendly troublemakers.
Traveler: Hilichurls?
Lisa: Stealing books is hardly the hilichurls' style.
Lisa: All they would use books for is to keep their campfire going anyway.
Lisa: This is more likely to be the *Abyss Order's* doing. They do seem to have a way of slipping in and out of places like ghosts, after all.
Lisa: Also... There is an elemental seal at the entrance. It looks like the result of an Abyss Mage's magic.
Paimon: A seal? How are we gonna break it? Is this gonna turn into another huge ordeal?
Lisa: Not to worry. If you think a little magic can keep me out, think again!
Paimon: Why is that?
Lisa: Come on.
Paimon: Whoa...
Paimon: So this is what Lisa's like when she's hard at work...
Traveler: The Abyss Order?
Lisa: It's like you can read my mind.
Traveler: The Adventurers' Guild?
Lisa: It's not unlike them, in the sense that they are known for darting around amongst underground ruins.
Lisa: But Adventurers do not typically take others' belongings... Well, not from the living, anyway.

## Talk 3

Abyss Mage: How did you find this place!? It's... so well hidden!
Lisa: I have no interest in finding out where you little rascals hide yourselves away. But I do want my book back.
Lisa: Tell me, how is it that you have the time to conceal your stronghold and apply a magic seal — but not to sign out a library book in the proper manner?
Lisa: You have no respect whatsoever for other people's work.
Abyss Mage: ...You— You just want... *the book*?
Abyss Mage: I was unaware that anyone in Mondstadt was concerned with unearthing the secret hidden inside this book...
Abyss Mage: Who... Who are you?
Lisa: The librarian. Although, I believe that should be quite clear already.
Lisa: Return the book. This is an ultimatum.
Abyss Mage: Hmph. Since you insist on concealing your identity...
Abyss Mage: I have all the less reason to give you that book.
Abyss Mage: After all, it contains... the secret...
Abyss Mage: Huh!? Wh—What are you doing!? Such concentrated elemental power! P—Please don't—
Abyss Mage: *shrieking*
Traveler: Lisa is so strong...
Lisa: Hmph. Naughty boys who don't do what they're told need a little punishment to keep them in line.
Traveler: You didn't let him finish speaking...
Lisa: *sigh* This is why I call it troublesome work.
Lisa: We'll just need to find the book ourselves. It should be around here somewhere.
Traveler: A LITTLE punishment!?
Traveler: Lisa is so terrifying...

## Talk 4

Paimon: It's *The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies*! Paimon remembers that name, is this the one you were looking for?
Lisa: That's the one. It's a good thing it isn't damaged, otherwise...
Paimon: Otherwise what? Are you telling me you have even more crazy punishments up your sleeve!?
Lisa: Hehe. I would probably have needed to dish out a little taste of one of my potions in that case.
Paimon: Ah!
Lisa: Then again... As I said, it isn't from the restricted section. Which is the only reason I would let the average citizen borrow it in the first place.
Lisa: And it doesn't appear to have any abnormal elemental properties, save for the markings I put on it.
Paimon: Yeah... It seems like just an average storybook.
Traveler: So why did the Abyss Order...
Traveler: (How mysterious. I'm so curious...)
Lisa: As far as my duties as a librarian go, my troublesome work is finished.
Lisa: Since this book has piqued your interest, why don't I let you borrow it?
Traveler: What's the, um, due date?
Traveler: Please don't punish me if I return it late...
Lisa: There's no time limit for you. I will register you as "custodian" rather than "borrower."
Lisa: This is an exclusive privilege reserved for trusted citizens only.
Paimon: Exclusive privilege? Why does Paimon feel this is just your sneaky way of offloading your troublesome work onto someone else?
Lisa: Excuse me? Are you in some way dissatisfied with my work?
Traveler: No ma'am!
Traveler: I will take extra special care of this book...
Lisa: Good. You are amenable to reason then. I do wish I could keep you by my side as my personal assistant...
Lisa: My work here is done. I'm going back.
Lisa: Don't forget to register at the library when you have a spare moment.

## Talk 5

Lisa: Ah, you've returned. The paperwork is done — you are now the custodian of this book.
Paimon: Thank you Miss Lisa!
Paimon: ...But Paimon thinks we're forgetting something.
Traveler: The Teyvat Travel Guide!
Paimon: Look, over there on the shelf! Isn't that the *Teyvat Travel Guide*?
Paimon: And look how many copies there are!
Lisa: Hehe... The *Teyvat Travel Guide* is a serial publication. It is not part of the library's formal collection.
Paimon: Oh...
Lisa: Take one. Consider it your compensation for being Lisa's little helper today.
Lisa: With you by my side, my troublesome work was a little less dull than usual.
Paimon: Hmph! The Teyvat Travel Guide was just bait to get us to do a day's work!
Lisa: I hadn't anticipated that a few routine returns inquiries would take us out of the city, let alone down into some underground ruins.
Lisa: As compensation for dragging you into all this bother, take these souvenirs.
Paimon: Wow, Lisa went and bought us some special souvenirs!
Lisa: In fact, they were intended for our next outing, but... Never mind, we can discuss next time's activity when the time comes. I hope you are looking forward to it.
Lisa: *yawn*
Traveler: Remuneration!
Lisa: You are a voracious one, aren't you?

## Talk 6

Lisa: The *Teyvat Travel Guide* is on the bookcase next to you.
Lisa: Have a look.
Lisa: No need to return it.
