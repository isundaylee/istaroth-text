# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): *sob, sniff* ... The show was a resounding success...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): #Our thanks to all of the actors and actresses, and our thanks to everyone who came to support us! Of course, we must thank you as well, Traveler and Paimon!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I really appreciated your undivided attention... *sob*... It felt just like the relentlessly piercing gaze of the evil dragon...
Traveler: About the title though...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Oh yes, the title is 'Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess'!
Traveler: But she only wielded the sword for a brief moment towards the end?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Well... It's just like how The Five Kasen are usually portrayed in four poems...
Traveler: And like how we also call the best travel buddy "emergency food"...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Well, anyway, the important thing is not the sword in the hand, but the courage in the heart!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): #Back to business! Now that the curtains have closed, I would like to take this rare opportunity to invite Traveler and Paimon to take a photo with the crew!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Please don't refuse! Come on!
Traveler: And like how we have a cavalry captain without a single horse...
