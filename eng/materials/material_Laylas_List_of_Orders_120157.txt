# Layla's List of Orders

This is a list containing the items Layla ordered from the Almighty Merchant. The cooking ingredients that Layla was looking to purchase are written down here.
The list mentions the address where she first met up with the Almighty Merchant and the names of the items that Layla was sold. Special mention is made of Layla's purchase of an item "that has never been found anywhere in the Grand Bazaar," as if to prevent the other party from forgetting Layla's identity. But for some reason, the meeting address was not in Sumeru City, but instead on a road outside the city. This Almighty Merchant character seems most adept at scheduling, to have accepted Layla's order while still transporting their goods.
