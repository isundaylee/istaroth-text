Traveler: Do you need any help preparing any feed?
Glaisti: Thanks for the kind offer, but I haven't used up all the current feed I'm using. I'm just wondering what I should use next.
Glaisti: They might suffer from unbalanced nutrition if they always eat only one thing, so I need to switch recipes frequently...
Glaisti: By the way, what do you think would make the best feed? Tidalga membrane, Beryl Conch organs, or dried Lumitoile skin?
