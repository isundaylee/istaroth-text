Traveler: Oh, you are...
Ookubo Daisuke: I am a samurai of the Sangonomiya forces, and I am in charge here while General Gorou is out.
Ookubo Daisuke: I'm sure you've heard the news: we've managed to hold the Shogunate forces off at the front lines!
Ookubo Daisuke: It must be said that General Gorou's leadership has been indispensable in allowing us to achieve such results!

Traveler: See you around.
Ookubo Daisuke: Farewell. Ah, if I were as capable as General Gorou... Haha, ah, who am I kidding?

Traveler: So, tell me more about Gorou...
Ookubo Daisuke: General Gorou is my greatest inspiration. He is skilled and valiant on the battlefield, and he is compassionate to his men off it â€” he sees us as his very own flesh and blood, almost.
Ookubo Daisuke: He's patient with our comrades even in the little things of life, helping them to resolve their problems.
Ookubo Daisuke: I doubt you could find a better general anywhere else!
