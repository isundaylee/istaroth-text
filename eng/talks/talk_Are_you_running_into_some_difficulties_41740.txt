Traveler: Are you running into some difficulties?
Patchi the Curious: Yes... In the interests of his safety, Mr. Doolan seems to think that there is no such thing as being what I would call overcautious.
Patchi the Curious: Sometimes the discovery to be made is so valuable that it merits taking on a certain amount of risk... but he sees that view as just an excuse for being rash and impulsive.
Patchi the Curious: Neither of us will be persuaded by the other, and he also keeps interrupting me... *sigh*
