Traveler: Bamboo? Oars?
Sun Rao: Oars are made from new or old bamboo based on each ferryman's preference.
Sun Rao: Strictly speaking, old and new bamboo from Qingce Village have the same strength so long as they're cut at the right time and processed the right way.
Sun Rao: But every ferryman's hands are different, so they make different choices.
Sun Rao: The ferryman who taught me to sing said that it's just like tea, where the same leaves have different flavors after being processed by different tea makers.
Sun Rao: Some of us are accustomed to using oars made out of new bamboo, and some are accustomed to using oars made out of old bamboo. We each have our unique boating rhythm and hum melodies in unique ways...

Traveler: Folksong?
Sun Rao: Every boatman in Chenyu Vale will hum songs while sailing, and these songs are passed down to the young from the old.
Sun Rao: Nobody knows who composed these songs many years ago, but they have been subtly engraved into the memories of most locals...
Sun Rao: The line that touched me the most is...
Sun Rao: "Sun and earth from each other divide, the eternal whirlpool that never churns, the beautiful jade concealed within..."
