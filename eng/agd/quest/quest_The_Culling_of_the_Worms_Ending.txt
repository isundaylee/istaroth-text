# The Culling of the Worms: Ending


## Talk 1

Vinayak: ...Well, there are still some affected Wenut nearby. If you've got the time, please help take care of them.
Traveler: That's what I'm here for.
Vinayak: Wonderful! Why, this is the best opportunity to test the full output of the Wenutslayer Cannon, if I do say so myself!
Traveler: Maybe next time.
Vinayak: Sure. Just come to me when you have the time.

## Talk 2

Vinayak: I don't understand... She was the one who mentioned the idea of going to the café to write the report...
Traveler: Why are you here by yourself?
Vinayak: *sigh* I don't want to talk about it. She's off to work on the report by herself.
Vinayak: We were supposed to meet at the café yesterday, but it took her a long time to show up. She didn't even bring any pen or paper for her report!
Vinayak: I criticized her for wasting time when we should be working on the report, and then she flew into a rage! She said she'd write the report herself and made me leave!
Vinayak: This is ridiculous, don't you think?
Traveler: ...
Vinayak: Still, I'm used to her fiery temper. She'll simmer down in a couple days.
Vinayak: If only controlling her emotions was as simple as flipping a switch.
Traveler: Best of luck.
Vinayak: Huh? Even you're acting strange... Oh well, never mind. There are still a few affected Wenut around here, though I'm sure the situation will resolve itself if I just leave it alone.
Vinayak: But if you have time, please help prevent them from threatening passers-by.
Vinayak: By the way, the elemental environment and the charging device are now back to normal.
Vinayak: There's never been a better time to experience the Wenutslayer Cannon at full power!
Traveler: Good luck to you.
Traveler: Where's Shriya?
