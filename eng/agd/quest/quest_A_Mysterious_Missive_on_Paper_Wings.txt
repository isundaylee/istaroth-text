# A Mysterious Missive on Paper Wings


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, look! It's Collei! Huh, and is that Eula with her? What's she doing in Gandharva Ville?

## Talk 2

Paimon: We made it! That answers that question...
Klee: There's a path. I'm gonna take a look!
Kaeya: Hey, don't run off and leave us all behind.

## Talk 3

Collei: Hmm, I've definitely heard the other Forest Rangers mention somebody dressed like that before...
Eula: I see. Then it looks like my suspicions are correct... Hmm? Who do we have here?
Collei: #Traveler and Paimon! Oh, Kaeya and Klee are here, too!
Klee: Hi Collei, it's been aaages!
Paimon: Collei, Eula! What are you two doing here?
Paimon: Well, that question's really more for Eula.
Kaeya: What a coincidence. I didn't expect to run into a fellow Favonian captain this far from Mondstadt. How's the vacation going?
Eula: ...Seriously? Bring the whole crew, why don't you? Tsk...
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or does Eula not look particularly thrilled right now...
Traveler: Well since we're all here...
Collei: Oh, cool! Great idea! Let's go.
Eula: If you're trying to accommodate me, there must be some misunderstanding. I'm fine. There's nothing embarrassing about running into colleagues in the wild.
Collei: Uh, but earlier you were...
Kaeya: Great! Well, I'm sure there's a fascinating reason behind why you're all the way out here in Sumeru. Do share it with us.
Traveler: (Kaeya sure looks like he's getting a kick out of this...)
Eula: If you must know, it's a little complicated... But simply put, I'm searching for a cousin of mine from the Lawrence Clan.
Eula: He went missing recently, and after searching his home, we found evidence that led us here. He appears to believe that somewhere in Sumeru lies the key to restoring our clan to its former glory.
Paimon: He came all the way to Sumeru for that? What was he going to do, enroll at the Akademiya?
Traveler: That would be quite a roundabout way to achieve his goals.
Eula: I doubt he came here to learn. He's much too old to start getting a basic education now, and from what I know of him, I doubt he has any interest in intellectual pursuits.
Eula: All he cares about is restoring his clan's honor. Nothing wrong with that idea in principle, but I'm not certain how fanatical he is about it. So there's no knowing what lengths he might go to.
Eula: As a knight and a member of the Lawrence Clan, it's my duty to make sure he doesn't bring harm to others.
Kaeya: Oho... If this is true, then your cousin is quite a man of action. Traveling alone to Sumeru from Mondstadt is no mean feat.
Eula: Nor is daring to make me personally concerned about his safety. Hmph, he has no idea what's coming to him.
Paimon: You know, underneath it all, Paimon thinks Eula's a really caring person.
Klee: Yeah, she's the best! She brought me some Moon Pie last time!
Eula: Ahem! He is family, after all... Anyway, I will make sure to find him and escort him safely back to Mondstadt.
Traveler: You're really going the extra mile for him.
Eula: Hm. Now, back to you... How and why did you all suddenly show up here?
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation to Eula and Collei...
Collei: Hmm, I'm afraid that could be tricky... Master Tighnari is still at Pardis Dhyai delivering his lectures. He isn't due back for a while...
Collei: But I think I'll be able to help out. The description in the invitation letter is vague, but I'm pretty sure it's hinting at somewhere in the desert...
Eula: The desert?
Klee: Eh? Does that mean Mom's friend is from the desert? Hmm... I guess I'll call her Aunty Desert for now...
Collei: I remember Mahamatra Cyno once told me a strange rumor about that part of the desert...
Collei: They say there's a secret domain there that can make all of your wishes come true...
Collei: Ah, wait wait... He said I should just call him "Cyno." I keep forgetting that...
Eula: Huh. A domain that makes people's wishes come true...
Paimon: Wow, so is it true? Does it really exist?
Collei: I probably would have believed it a few years ago. But now that I'm a little older and wiser, I think it makes sense to be more skeptical about things like this.
Eula: This explains a lot... The domain could well be a myth, but he probably figured he had nothing to lose. If you intend to search for this place, then please allow me to join you.
Eula: My cousin has quite a collection of books about Sumeru desert mythology on his shelves. I highly suspect that he, too, is looking for that domain.
Collei: Can I come, too? I—I think you might need me there!
Collei: You'll definitely need a local guide while you're in Sumeru, and... I think I have what it takes to be that person! Plus, it's a Forest Ranger's duty to bravely lend a helping hand to others in need.
Kaeya: We have every confidence in your abilities, Collei. Our party grows bigger and stronger still... What say you to this, Captain Klee?
Klee: I think it's suuuuper cool!
Klee: I read in a story book that "On your own you only have a drop of happiness, but in a group you have a whole ocean."
Klee: So I'm sure Mom's friend will be super happy if I show up to visit and bring a whole bunch of friends with me!
Paimon: That's the spirit! In that case, let's get the Magic Invite to take us there!
Black Screen Text: Klee takes out the Magic Invite, and everyone says the destination out loud...
Traveler: He'll owe you one after this.
Traveler: ...Who's up for some afternoon tea?

## Talk 4

Klee: Whoa, this desert is huuuge!
Collei: Wow, what an incredible sight...
Kaeya: Yes, the scenery is quite magnificent.
Eula: ...
Collei: Are you okay, Eula? You don't look so good...
Eula: I'm fine, just taking a moment to acclimatize... The air here is much drier than in Mondstadt.
Eula: Hmm, this area doesn't look very habitable, and... I don't see a domain entrance nearby, either.
Collei: Oh no... I—I didn't pronounce the destination wrong, did I? I mean, I don't THINK I did...
Klee: Nope, you got it right! It definitely wasn't your fault!
Klee: I said "Gandharva Ville" wrong earlier, but we still ended up in the right place!
Kaeya: Klee's right. We're in the right place, there's no doubt about that.
Collei: Phew...
Paimon: Hmm, maybe the entrance is hidden under a sand dune?
Eula: ...Who knows. We'll just have to start by looking around.
Black Screen Text: The party splits up to search the area, but turns up empty-handed...
Paimon: Paimon's sooo tired... and so thirsty...
Kaeya: Hmm. We should have found something by now. Unless there's a problem with the Magic Invite?
Klee: Huh? How could that happen?
Klee: Uh-oh, did I break it by accident? But I didn't do anything! Dodoco will back me up, I'm innocent!
Collei: It's definitely not your fault, Klee! See? Not even a wrinkle on it.
Traveler: If the domain is somewhere nearby...
Klee: #Hmm? Does Mr. Honorary Knight have an idea?
Traveler: Instead of us trying to find the domain...
Paimon: Ah, Paimon knows where you're going with this!
Traveler: Yes. We can try getting the domain to find us.
Kaeya: Interesting approach. Assuming we're right about this Magic Invite...
Kaeya: That is to say, if it was sent from within the domain, the invite likely has some sort of connection to it.
Klee: Oh, I get it now! Plus, I know a super special trick we can use!
Eula: What kind of trick? Can you teach it to us too?
Klee: Of course! Mom said that if I ever need help, I just need to shout this out loud:
Klee: Magic Invite, Magic Invite, Klee needs your aid! Do something now, so Klee's not afraid!
Paimon: #Look, Traveler! Something flew over!
Eula: Hmm? It looks like... a bottle?
Kaeya: Remarkably effective... That's one trick I'll be keeping up my sleeve in the future. You should make a note of it too, Eula.
Eula: Absolutely not! It's not my style.
Collei: I suppose bottles are pretty common in Sumeru mythology... So, is this supposed to be the entrance to the domain?
Paimon: A domain in a bottle, huh... Well, if there's one thing we learned in Liyue, it's never judge a domain by its cover.
Paimon: Guess there's one way to find out if this is really the way in! Come on, reach out with your hand!
Traveler: (Touch the bottle...)

## Talk 5

Klee: Look, look! There's a huge garden here!
Eula: Incredible... It looked so small from the outside...
Eula: Everyone, I suggest that we stop here for a moment. We should take stock of our surroundings before deciding on our next course of action.
Kaeya: Since we're in a bottle... Has anyone here heard the story of the "magic bottle"?
Collei: Oh, you mean the one about King Deshret and the Jinni-in-a-bottle? I've read it before, but I struggled with some of the vocabulary...
Klee: What's the story about, Kaeya?
Klee: Mom told me a story once about a group of adventurers who went to Bottleland... But I don't think there was a magic bottle in that one...
Kaeya: Don't worry, Klee, I can tell you all about the story of the magic bottle. But if you keep running off on your own, you'll miss all the good parts...
Klee: Oh... Okay, I got it. I'll stay with the group from now on...
Collei: ...
Eula: You sense it too, don't you Collei? Something's not quite right.
Collei: Yeah... The scenery here is beautiful, but it's too quiet. And there's no sign of Klee's "Aunty Desert" here anywhere...
Klee: Maybe Aunty Desert lives way further down inside? This place is suuuuper big, just like Fischl's Immernachtreich. We still have a long way to go!
Paimon: Guess we won't know until we get there. Let's keep going.
Paimon: Hopefully we'll meet her soon!
