## Talk

Elzer: This storm really is annoying...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Elzer: Hmm? Oh, it's you, Traveler. Master Diluc mentioned you. Said you were an experienced and skilled adventurer...
Elzer: Ahem... I'm going off topic. So, did you come to the Dawn Winery to pick some wine?
Elzer: Sorry, but this is a bad time. Due to the storms, the three roads leading out of the winery have all been rendered impassable.
Elzer: The Knights of Favonius were able to clear the obstacles blown in by the wind quickly, but the nearby monsters have all gathered on the road for some reason.
Elzer: People can go around the area, but it is impassable to cargo-carrying carts. We can't move any of our wine out, and the ingredients we ordered can't come in. It is most frustrating...
Elzer: But I've heard of your exploits, and I know of your skills, so perhaps...
Elzer: If you would, could you get those three roads reopened?

## Talk

Traveler: Just leave it to me.
Elzer: Wonderful. Thank you for your willingness to assist. I have marked the three merchant routes on your map. Please help us out.

## Talk

Traveler: There are other things I must attend to...
Elzer: Is that so... Then I must find some other way to resolve this problem.

## Talk

Elzer: Oh? Distinguished guest, may I ask, are you here to discuss business?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Elzer: I am Elzer. Under his grace, when the master of the house is away, I take care of most major affairs.
Elzer: Master Diluc... Does not tend to worry himself too much with the affairs of the winery.
Elzer: So, whatever business you are here to discuss, is probably best discussed with me directly.
Traveler: You have another identity, don't you?
Elzer: My, you have a keen eye for detail.
Elzer: It is true that my other role is Chief Executive of the Mondstadt Wine Appreciation Guild.
Elzer: But I do not do it for appearances, nor do I seek to hide it, my liege.
Elzer: The simple fact is that given Dawn Winery's standing in Mondstadt...
Elzer: There is barely any distinction to be made between managing the affairs of the winery and managing the affairs of the whole industry.
Traveler: Tell me about your past.
Elzer: My past? That's something I can talk freely about.
Elzer: I trust you know of the winery's former owner, Master Crepus? He was Diluc's father.
Elzer: Master Crepus was like a father to me, too.
Elzer: He was in the prime of his life at the time of his tragic accident all those years ago...
Elzer: Master Diluc spent a long time grieving. It was during that time that I started taking care of some of the winery's affairs.
Elzer: I thought that rather than be overcome by sorrow, it was better for me to share some of Master Diluc's load. It was also the only thing I could do.
Elzer: Though it was a little presumptuous of me to act beyond my role, I do think perhaps that's what Master Crepus would have liked to see.
Elzer: *sigh* Sorry, that got a bit deep and depressing, didn't it.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Elzer: Farewell, honored guest. Please come again.
