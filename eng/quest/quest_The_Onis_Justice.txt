# The Oni's Justice


## Talk 1

Daisuke: Please, you gotta believe me! Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, he's not a bad guy!
Granny Oni: I'll take care of Daisuke. No need to worry, dear. Everything will be fine.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wait, could that be him? Is that Arataki Itto?
Paimon: He doesn't seem to be looking this way. Perfect, let's try the beans Detective Sango gave us.
Paimon: It'll save a lot of hassle if we can avoid a fight.

## Talk 3

Arataki Itto: *whimpering*
Paimon: Uh, are you okay?
Paimon: What should we do? Paimon didn't think he'd react this badly!
Arataki Itto: D—Don't be alarmed... It's just my allergies acting up... I've got it under control!
Arataki Itto: It's alright, I got this, just gotta tough it out. I can take it... I can take it...
Arataki Itto: Ah! Who am I kidding! *coughing* I gotta catch my breath here! *coughing* Whatever it is you want, it's gonna have to wait! I need a moment...
Arataki Itto: Ahh, whew... that's better. That sure took a lot out of me, though...
Arataki Itto: Hey, why'd you have to be so mean, huh!? Surprise-attacking me like that!
Traveler: You can never be too careful when dealing with a fugitive.
Arataki Itto: Oh, I get it. So you're here to bring me in. How in the world did you find me all the way out here?
Arataki Itto: Heh, well, whatever... If you think I'm going back with you, you can forget it. I'd walk away if I were you.
Arataki Itto: I pack a mean punch, you know. I don't want to hurt any regular folks like you.
Paimon: That's pretty big talk considering all the beans we have.
Traveler: You're the one behind the robbery and the missing people, aren't you?
Arataki Itto: Yep, that's right. Me! All by myself. Nobody else.
Arataki Itto: As boss of the Arataki Gang, I gotta nab a little food and drink when we're running low. That's only natural, right?
Paimon: Yeah, but nabbing people? That's taking it a bit far, don't ya think?
Arataki Itto: Uh... not when their families will pay good Mora to see them again! Easy pickings.
Arataki Itto: And the extra Mora means I can... uh, give some to my gang to spend on themselves!
Traveler: At least you're honest.
Arataki Itto: Hey, what's with all the questions? Like I said, I'm not going back with you, so stop wasting everybody's time.
Paimon: No way, mister! We've accepted a commission to bring you back.
Arataki Itto: What'd you say, little one? Go on... Say it to my face!
Paimon: #Uh, we... Well, mostly {F#she}{M#he}, took a commission to bring you back.
Traveler: Show some backbone, Paimon...
Arataki Itto: Looks like you aren't gonna let this drop. In that case, we—
Daisuke: Uncle Itto!
Granny Oni: Don't run, now! Careful or you'll fall.
Daisuke: What's taking you so long? You said we were gonna have a beetle fight today! C'mon, you promised!
Arataki Itto: Ah, y—yeah, that's right, still going ahead! But you see, uh... I've been out here for ages and I still can't find a beetle that I like. Just give Uncle Itto a little more time, m'kay?
Daisuke: Huh? Who are they? Are they your friends?
Arataki Itto: Uh, yeah, that's right. I told them not to come, but what can I say? ... They were just too worried about me! Hahaha.
Arataki Itto: It's 'cause of a little thing called, uh... prestige, yeah. 'Cause of all the prestige Uncle Itto has.
Paimon: Huh? What are you talking about? We...
Arataki Itto: Shh! C'mon. Just play along! Leave the kid out of this.
Daisuke: Uh, Uncle Itto, you don't look so good. You look like you're about to fall over.
Arataki Itto: Hehe, that's because Uncle Itto bumped his noggin on a tree branch while looking for a beetle. It's all good, though, these horns are rock solid...
Daisuke: Okay, if you say so. Granny and I will keep heading back now. Don't be too long!
Arataki Itto: Hehe, yep I'll be right there. I hope you're ready to lose today!
Paimon: Who were those people?
Arataki Itto: The old lady was Granny Oni. She's the one that took me in and raised me. And the kid's name is Daisuke, I took him in just a while back. They're both like family to me.
Arataki Itto: They escaped with me out this way, along with my boys from the Arataki Gang. If I didn't bring them with me, the Tenryou Commission would be knocking on their doors, for sure.
Traveler: I had no idea you were so caring towards others.
Paimon: Right, but if you care about them so much, then you shouldn't have done all that stuff that made them worry about you in the first place.
Arataki Itto: I, uh...
Arataki Itto: Listen, how about we make a deal. You two let me go wrap things up with Daisuke, and once we're done battling beetles, the two of us will settle things with a duel.
Arataki Itto: If you win, I'll come quietly. You can take me back to Inazuma City, and you won't hear a peep outta me. Why? 'cause I'm an oni of my word.
Arataki Itto: I'll just tell little Daisuke that my friends and I need to step outside for a moment. That way, he won't worry. Cool?
Paimon: #Hmm, what should we do, {NICKNAME}? There is the kid to consider...
Traveler: Alright, you have a deal.
Arataki Itto: Oh it's on! Heh, I like your style, haha! Alright, but first thing's first, I need to find an Onikabuto to battle with. I've been looking here for ages and haven't found myself a winner yet, so it's time to try somewhere else.
Arataki Itto: Come with me. Saves you worrying that I might skedaddle.
Traveler: Either way, you won't escape.
Traveler: Questionable reasoning there.
Traveler: There's plenty more beans in the bag. You'd better come quietly.
Arataki Itto: Hey, hey, take it easy... just stop with the beans, okay. So you're here to bring me in. How in the world did you find me all the way out here, anyway?

## Talk 4

Paimon: By the way, Paimon's curious... What kind of game is beetle fighting?
Arataki Itto: You guys have seen Onikabuto out in the wild, right? Even though they might look menacing on the outside, they're big softies on the inside. Most of the time they just sit there doing nothing.
Arataki Itto: But let me tell ya, once the Onikabuto start fighting, they won't let anything get in their way!
Arataki Itto: The grand game of beetle fighting is a match where your beetle tries to flip the other beetle onto its back.
Traveler: I played when I was a kid.
Arataki Itto: Hey, it's not just some kids game, okay? It's way deeper than you think!
Arataki Itto: I have taken part in more beetle fights than you would believe. At least 800 — I may have even crossed the thousand mark by this point. Anyway, after a while, you can tell a beetle's fighting potential just by looking at its shape, size, and the patterns on its body.
Arataki Itto: But it's not just about all the physical stuff, oh no! Your Onikabuto's gotta be in the right headspace as well. If it's not up for a fight or doesn't have the guts, then it's game over.
Arataki Itto: Haha! Boy, are you two lucky you ran into me. When it comes to beetles, I'm the expert that the experts go to! I'll show you all you need to know.
Paimon: But, we're not the ones that will be playing... We're just here to keep an eye on you.
Arataki Itto: ...Oh yeah.
Arataki Itto: Anyway, not a problem! You two might think that I'm just tooting my own horns here, but just you wait... I'll make you a beetle expert in no time!
Arataki Itto: And by the way, that kid has one tough beetle, we can't underestimate it. We have to find a real lean mean beetle warrior.
Paimon: Okay, he's not the sharpest horn on the oni...
Arataki Itto: Okay, lemme see...
Arataki Itto: There. Let's head to that hill. I'll bet my bottom Mora we're gonna find some major-league Onikabuto hiding out there.
Traveler: I watched people playing that when I was a kid.

## Talk 5

Arataki Itto: This is the one, this is the one! Hahaha! See? As long as you're in my company, you're guaranteed to find yourself an Onikabuto.
Traveler: It seems a bit different from the others.
Arataki Itto: Yeah, it's on the smaller side. But size isn't everything in a beetle fight.
Traveler: But you said earlier that size matters...
Arataki Itto: Just let the expert explain, okay? What smaller beetles lack in strength they make up for in agility. They usually got a whole bunch o' sick moves just ready to whip out when the right moment comes.
Traveler: Sure, but it doesn't seem to be very energetic, either.
Arataki Itto: Listen, you can never see a beetle's true energy until it's in the ring.
Arataki Itto: It might look a bit young and docile, but that's got its advantages. Haven't you ever heard the saying, "Don't judge a book by its cover"?
Arataki Itto: Young beetles that have never fought before always go all out in their first fight. Older beetles that have already been through the wars tend to just cower in the corner the moment they see a strong opponent.
Traveler: I was hoping we'd catch a larger beetle.
Arataki Itto: Hey, didn't I say not to worry! C'mon, just have a little faith, would ya? My experience is telling me that this Onikabuto was spawned to be a champion.
Traveler: Wait a sec, where's Paimon?
Paimon: Right here! Look what Paimon found!
Paimon: If we're gonna battle some beetles, then Paimon wants in! It's not like we have anything else to do... When you hopped down, Paimon flew off somewhere else nearby and found this one.
Paimon: Whaddya think, Itto? It's big and strong and looks like a real fighter. It matches everything you said about a good fighter beetle!
Paimon: Bet the one you guys found must be way, way...
Paimon: ...b—bigger.
Arataki Itto: Oh uh... Heh. You got some experience catching beetles too, huh?
Paimon: Nope, this is the first one Paimon's ever caught!
Arataki Itto: Well, looks like you've got a real knack for this. You'll be a fellow beetle fighting expert in no time! I mean, not as good as me, but still.
Paimon: Oh... so overall not that good, then.
Arataki Itto: Uh anyway, great! With both your beetle and mine, I can tell this'll finally be the one! This time, I'm gonna win for sure!
Traveler: "This'll finally be the one"? ...You've never won before?
Arataki Itto: Well, ahem... Y'know, that's just life, man. There are so many people in this world who are talented... and passionate... but it's no guarantee that things will go their way.
Arataki Itto: So many unrelated things have to come together at once in just the right way to make victory happen. There's this word that really sums it up nicely, actually. It's, uh, "co-incidence"!
Paimon: As in, pure luck...? Guess it makes no difference whether we have Paimon's beetle or not, then. Might as well just...
Arataki Itto: Whoa whoa whoa, hey! Hehe, let's not do anything rash here!
Traveler: I thought smaller beetles know a bunch of sick moves?
Arataki Itto: I think both of these fine beetles have a shot at winning. Let's just hang on to them and give 'em both a try. A true warrior never leaves a good beetle behind, hahaha.
Arataki Itto: Anyway — time to head back and get this show started! Man, I am psyched for this, wooh! Let's go!
Traveler: Didn't you say that younger beetles are fearless?
Traveler: It's kinda... small.

## Talk 6

Daisuke: Finally! You're back! Can we start our beetle fight now?
Arataki Itto: Yeah, sure thing, buddy! But you'd better watch out, I brought a real winner back this time.
Daisuke: Don't worry, I'm not scared of your beetle. Go, go, Stripy Ghost!
Arataki Itto: I've got this fight in the bag! Let's go, Nimble Ninja!
Paimon: Huh? When did you come up with that name?
Arataki Itto: C'mon, you can take 'im, little guy!
Daisuke: Haha! That's right, finish it!
Arataki Itto: Ah, no!!! My little Nimble Ninja!
Daisuke: Hah! Looks like I win again!
Arataki Itto: Dang it, that's my seventh loss in a row!
Traveler: That is a poor track record...
Daisuke: Hee-hee, Stripy Ghost is invincible. Even Uncle Itto can't beat him!
Arataki Itto: I won't forget this! I'll beat you next time, I swear!
Arataki Itto: Alright, Paimon, you're up. Time to give Crimson Cyclone a shot, maybe it'll end this losing streak of mine.
Paimon: Alright! Go get 'em, Crimson Cyclone!
Traveler: That name caught on quick.
Daisuke: Whoa! That one looks ultra strong!
Daisuke: But it's still no match for you, Stripy!
Paimon: Hehe! Alright little guy, use your Super Paimon Tornado!
Traveler: ...That's a real thing now!?
Daisuke: No, I can't believe it... I lost.
Paimon: Yay, we won! Hah, Paimon knew Crimson Cyclone would be the best!
Arataki Itto: Boy, did that one put up a fight. It wiped the floor with Stripy Ghost...
Arataki Itto: Heh, I know a real beetle trainer when I see one. Way to kick some beetle butt, partner!
Paimon: Hee-hee, see? Paimon's got real talent! Of course, Crimson Cyclone has to take some of the credit too...
Traveler: Why don't we let Daisuke keep Crimson Cyclone?
Paimon: Oh right, yeah, now that the beetle fighting's over and all...
Daisuke: Hm...?
Paimon: This is for you, Daisuke.
Daisuke: Huh, for me? You're really giving it to me?
Arataki Itto: Go ahead, take it, Daisuke. When we finally get back to the city, you can show it off to all your friends.
Daisuke: But... will we ever be able to go back?
Arataki Itto: Of course we will, trust me. I never go back on my word!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, I got some things I gotta discuss with my friends here. Go play with Granny for a while, would ya? There's a good boy!
Paimon: Good, the kid doesn't suspect a thing...
Daisuke: You're from the Tenryou Commission, aren't you? I bet you're here to capture Uncle Itto.
Paimon: Huh?
Arataki Itto: Hey! Didn't I tell ya? They're my friends! ...Uh, in fact, they're in the gang. We're practically family!
Daisuke: That's not true! I already know everyone in your little gang, but I've never seen these two before!
Daisuke: Uncle Itto didn't do anything wrong, don't take him away!
Daisuke: And not only did he not do anything wrong, he also saved my life! He's not a bad guy!
Traveler: So what's the story here?
Arataki Itto: Hey, some things we don't tell to outsiders, remember? *sigh* How should I explain...
Arataki Itto: I'm a real lousy liar...
Granny Oni: Itto, sometimes you need to just say what you have to say. Don't worry about us.
Arataki Itto: I guess... Thanks, Granny.
Arataki Itto: Seems I can't hide it anymore. Come with me, I'll explain everything.
Traveler: Let's try to stay calm.
Traveler: Seems Ogura Mio wasn't kidding.

## Talk 7

Arataki Itto: I'll be honest with you. This thing the Tenryou Commission is investigating, with someone going around taking people and their possessions... It wasn't me. Any of it.
Arataki Itto: I have my own reasons for lying about it, and I really didn't want to get innocent people caught up in this while I'm still trying to solve the real problem here.
Arataki Itto: I'm the same as you. I just wanna avoid conflict at all costs... But it's just not worth it if someone gets hurt.
Paimon: So why in the world would you say that you're the culprit?
Arataki Itto: *sigh* Maybe you don't know because you're outlanders... It all started a long, long time ago with the story of the crimson oni and the blue oni...
Paimon: Hold on a second, if you're talking about that fairytale, we've heard that one already.
Arataki Itto: Oh, so you already know. Well, that makes things a whole lot easier.
Paimon: So... is the story from the fairytale really true?
Arataki Itto: Everything about the fate of the oni is true. The blue oni chose exile, and the crimson oni stayed behind.
Arataki Itto: But the other details aren't historically accurate. Fairytales are nice stories, but there's something they leave out... it's a little thing called the cold, hard truth.
Arataki Itto: The Inazuma of long ago was a dangerous place. If you wanted the Raiden Shogun's protection, you had to have a good relationship with the humans.
Arataki Itto: The oni are a proud kind, so it wasn't easy for them to ask others for acceptance. Over time, the oni eventually split into two factions.
Arataki Itto: The crimson oni were friendly with the humans, but the blue oni, they were more stubborn and insisted on keeping to their own.
Paimon: Paimon thought you were two different species. So really, you're all one family?
Arataki Itto: Yep, that's right. There's no real difference between us. We just paint our horns different colors to show which side we belong to.
Traveler: So why did the blue oni choose to exile themselves?
Arataki Itto: Because humans were still wary of oni at the time.
Arataki Itto: The crimson oni always hoped to find a way to live in peace with the humans, but the blue oni kept clashing with them.
Arataki Itto: Humans didn't see a difference between crimson and blue oni. All they knew was that oni were hard to get along with.
Arataki Itto: If things were to continue that way, the oni were never going to get along with humans. And so, the most revered leaders of the crimson and blue oni decided to resolve it once and for all.
Arataki Itto: Over drinks, they swore an oath. The blue oni would play the role of evil oni to help the crimson oni integrate into human society. But the blue oni's leader gave two conditions.
Paimon: Hmm? What were they?
Arataki Itto: First, the oni must abandon any prejudice they held against humanity. Every oni was to accept humans in their heart before the humans accepted them. Oni were not to use their strength to mistreat humans but also were not to stand for mistreatment against themselves.
Arataki Itto: Second, the crimson oni were to integrate with human society — but not by trying to please the humans. The oni were to embrace their own honest characters, surging tempers, and awesome strength to win respect from humans.
Arataki Itto: In other words, they were to carry on the oni bloodline while also protecting our oni pride.
Traveler: Hmm, I see...
Arataki Itto: After choosing exile, the number of blue oni began to dwindle, until they eventually disappeared altogether.
Arataki Itto: Since I first heard the story of the blue and crimson oni as a kid, I've heard it countless times in my life... Not once did I ever imagine that the blue oni clan had actually survived...
Paimon: So you're saying the real culprit was a descendant of the blue oni?
Arataki Itto: That's right. Most people don't pay attention to the color of an oni's horns. They probably don't even know that blue oni exist.
Arataki Itto: But nothing gets by the Arataki Gang. At the scene of the crime, they saw an oni with different color horns than mine.
Arataki Itto: Still, it'd be strange if the culprit really was a descendant of the blue oni. I can't bring myself to accept it.
Traveler: Because the blue oni also value their own pride?
Arataki Itto: Exactly! They would give up their life before abandoning their pride.
Arataki Itto: I have always respected the blue oni for the sacrifice they made, and I know the aspirations my ancestors had for the future of all oni.
Arataki Itto: Our pride does not allow for any wrongdoing. You don't steal from other people, you don't harm other people, period!
Arataki Itto: My guess is that the blue oni was tricked or forced into it somehow. But I don't have any evidence...
Traveler: So you're trying to buy more time?
Arataki Itto: That's right. If I didn't step in, then the Tenryou Commission would've definitely caught them by now.
Paimon: But what does Daisuke have to do with any of this? He said that you saved him, so he knows your story, right?
Arataki Itto: He was the one I managed to save from the ronin after I sent them running from the scene.
Arataki Itto: He was off playing somewhere when they came by and ransacked his house. By the time he came back, his parents had been taken.
Arataki Itto: The whole reason I'm in this is to help this kid find his mom and dad again.
Traveler: Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place?
Arataki Itto: I never wanted to tell you any of this... Heh, my original plan was to knock you both out and take my family to hide somewhere else.
Arataki Itto: There's more to this than just one blue oni — there's a dangerous group behind everything that's been going on. So I didn't want to get anyone else caught up in this mess.
Arataki Itto: That's everything, the whole story. If you still don't believe me and wanna drag me back to Inazuma City, then I'm going to fight you with all I've got.
Arataki Itto: But if you're willing to believe me, then please. Give me a little time. Once I find the blue oni, I'll turn the both of us in.
Traveler: I will help you.
Paimon: Yep, Paimon too!
Traveler: The real culprits must be brought to justice.
Paimon: Just treat it like we're here to keep an eye on you.
Arataki Itto: So you... Heh, alright! I knew you'd be reasonable, I knew it! I was thinking right from the start — these two fine folks, they're just out here in the pursuit of truth and justice, man. We are gonna get along just great!
Arataki Itto: I should tell you though, things could get a little dangerous, so be ready for anything. Heh, don't say that I didn't warn you.
Paimon: Hehe, don't worry about us. We're seasoned adventurers!
Arataki Itto: Alright, then our first job is to investigate where this blue oni is hidin' out. There's a victim of his that saw him up close currently taking refuge at Sangonomiya's camp. I figure we can start by talkin' to him.
Traveler: We can't let the innocent be accused.
Traveler: You shouldn't have lied to us.

## Talk 8

## Talk 11

Arataki Itto: And by the way, that kid has one tough beetle, we can't underestimate it. We have to find a real lean mean beetle warrior.

Arataki Itto: There. Let's head to that hill. I'll bet my bottom Mora we're gonna find some major-league Onikabuto hiding out there.
