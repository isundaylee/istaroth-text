# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Landa: My name is Landa, and I'm in the wine business. That girl darting about all over the show is my daughter, Tia.
Landa: Did you know that all of Mondstadt's wine exports go via Liyue before being distributed to the rest of the continent?
Landa: And have you heard of the Morn Winery? That's where it comes from.
Landa: ...Sorry yes, Dawn Winery. Not Morn. Dawn.
Traveler: ...No true child of Mondstadt would make that mistake.
Landa: Give me a break, I just haven't been back to Mondstadt in forever is all.
Landa: Meanwhile, I've gotten to know this place like the back of my hand. I've traveled this route on business more times than I can remember.
Landa: Both the innkeeper and the boss of this place will vouch for me on that!
Landa: Isn't that right, Huai'an? Goldet? Hahahaha...
Landa: ...Come on, don't leave me hanging now...
Traveler: You get cuter each time you open your mouth.
Landa: ...What a strange thing to say.
Landa: Anyway, you want to hear a secret that only someone in the wine business could tell you?
Landa: "Angel's Share" actually used to be wine brewers' slang before it was the name of a tavern.
Landa: The idea was that the air bubbles you see during fermentation carry away the angel's share when they float off into the wind.
Landa: Not bad huh? Vintage Mondstadt knowledge!
