# Connor's Brew


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the wheat...
Connor: You... Ah. Saw my commission, did you?
Connor: So, gathered those ten spikes of Wheat yet?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Still working on it...
Connor: Well, pass them to me once you're done gathering them. I need to rest for a while more...

## Talk 2

Connor: Let me see... Yes, I think this is enough.
Connor: Thank you. Please accept a token of my appreciation...
