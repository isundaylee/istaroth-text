Traveler: You've returned home, I see.
Atsuko: I heard from the Crux Fleet's sailors that the Almighty Shogun has abolished the Sakoku Decree.
Atsuko: So I thought to myself, maybe the samurai at the Police Station might give me a pass and let me return home.
Atsuko: So I boarded a ship bound for Inazuma. I found upon my return that many things have changed.
Atsuko: But the biggest change was... Well, my parents had aged a lot. They had been concerned for my safety this whole time...
Atsuko: Still, they were all smiles when they greeted me. That was something that didn't change.
Atsuko: That's why I've decided to stay for a while longer to accompany them.
