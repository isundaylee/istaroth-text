Traveler: And who's "them"?
Tahmures: What a bunch of slowpokes... I wrote to the Akademiya to request an archaeological team forever ago.
Tahmures: As expected, they've made absolutely no progress. I haven't seen a single person from that team.
Tahmures: In Natlan, where you stumble upon a Saurian relic every three steps and a Saurian ruin every ten, a delay of even a single day is a huge loss!
