Traveler: Tell me about the Fatui.
Viktor: You Mondstadt folk could not begin to fathom the affairs of the Fatui.
Viktor: Ahem... Though to be honest, even I don't know about what goes on at the top level.
Viktor: In any case, all you need to know is that there is no greater honor than being under the protection of the Fatui.
Viktor: And as for the archons... Well, compared to having a Delusion at hand, all those religious beliefs and Visions and so on are just child's play.
