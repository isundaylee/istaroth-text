Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Hongyu: Whoa, come on now. When I said we could chat, I didn't mean sensitive topics like that. That's off limits.
Hongyu: Take it from me, no self-respecting Liyue local is gonna want to broach that topic lightly.
Hongyu: ...Ahem, I must stay at my post. If there's nothing else you need, please leave me be.
