Qiuyue: People have been asking me lately if I know where to find Mr. Zhenyu from Liyue, but I've never heard of this person in my life.
Qiuyue: Is he some kind of superstar, even more well-known than the Qixing somehow?
Qiuyue: Ah, sorry for the wait, dear customer. Would you like some ores from Liyue?

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

Qiuyue: Well... I'd say that things are the same as always. The flow of goods from Liyue is as bottle-necked as ever. No special change on that front.

Qiuyue: Hmm. It does seem like more and more people have decided to come to Ritou to set up shop.
Qiuyue: There'll be more competition, but more customers as well, so I suppose it's a net gain.

Qiuyue: Hmm, come to think of it, I've heard that some people saw some ore resembling purplish crystals nearby.
Qiuyue: That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
Qiuyue: I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.

Traveler: How's business?
Qiuyue: We're doing okay. After all, there is always demand for minerals no matter where you go.
Qiuyue: ...If there is demand, there is a market, and Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!

Traveler: How's business been?

Qiuyue: The other thing is the opening of the trade roads, which has resulted in increased channels and buyers alike.
Qiuyue: Once I scrounge up some more capital, I'm opening up a branch in Inazuma City!
Qiuyue: Gotta take advantage of the situation before someone sets themselves up as my competitor here, you know?

Qiuyue: Do you mean the passing of Rex Lapis? I've already heard about that.
Qiuyue: When that incident took place, the lockdown of Inazuma had already happened, so I also missed the Rite of Parting.
Qiuyue: *sigh* I'm still a bit broken up about it. I'm sure every Liyue citizen would've grieved too...
