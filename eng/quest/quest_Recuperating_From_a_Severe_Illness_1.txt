# Recuperating From a Severe Illness


## Talk 1

Anthony: Oh, where has Anna gone this time...
Traveler: Can't find Anna again?
Anthony: Yes. I've searched all over the city for her, but no luck.
Anthony: Please help me look for her. I'm so tired, I can barely move...
Traveler: Gotcha.
Anthony: It's up to you, then. This girl... If she keeps running around like this when she's almost well, I might fall sick myself.
Anthony: Hang on... Anna did once say that she's wanted to go to the Cathedral and thank the sisters there.
Anthony: Perhaps you should check the Cathedral first. You can also check in with Albert...
Anthony: He often, uh, hangs around the Cathedral. Who knows, maybe he's noticed something.
Traveler: Maybe she's gone off to be an adventurer.
Anthony: That can't be. It can't be... Can it?
Anthony: Hâ€”Hey, won't you say something?

## Talk 2

Anna: Wow, the sisters really are alert. They almost discovered me.
Traveler: You're an agile one...
Anna: Wah! How did you know I'd be here? Even the sisters didn't spot me.
Anna: Well, since you've found me, I guess I'll head back now.
Anna: I just wanted to enjoy the scenery, so don't worry about me.

## Talk 3

Anthony: Did you find Anna?
Traveler: She's on the roof of the Cathedral.
Anthony: The Cathedral roof? All those sisters, and not one of them spotted her?
Anthony: How did she manage that? Maybe she really does have talent for being an Adventurer...
Anthony: I'll go get her to come down. We really shouldn't be bothering the sisters.
Anthony: Thanks for your help. Please take these as a token of my thanks.

## Talk 4

Albert: This kid's really nimble...
Traveler: Excuse me, have you seen a girl...
Albert: You mean Anna? I've seen her, she just ran past me and disappeared down that corner.
Albert: Still, the Anna I remember has always been ill, and would sometimes come to the Cathedral to be healed.
Albert: But she doesn't look sick at all. Why, I'd wager that she's got more energy than I do. What happened, I wonder?

## Talk 5

Anna: Wow, the sisters really are alert. They almost discovered me.
Traveler: You're an agile one...
Anna: Wah! How did you know I'd be here? Even the sisters didn't spot me.
Anna: You say Albert told you about me? Huh. Who's Albert...
Anna: Ah, I remember now. He's that man who always hangs around the Cathedral.
Anna: I don't know what he's there for. But I don't think he's a bad person.
Anna: Well, since you've found me, I guess I'll head back now.
Anna: I just wanted to enjoy the scenery, so don't worry about me.

## Talk 6

Anthony: Have you found Anna?
Traveler: She's on the roof of the Cathedral.
Anthony: The Cathedral roof? All those sisters, and not one of them spotted her?
Anthony: How did she manage that? Maybe she really does have talent for being an Adventurer...
Anthony: What? It was thanks to a tip from Albert? Haha, Albert...
Anthony: He's something, he is. No matter how many times the sisters warn him, he can always be found loitering around the Cathedral for no good reason.
Anthony: Well, I'll go get Anna to come down. We shouldn't bother the sisters. Right, and I also need to give Albert my thanks.
Anthony: Thanks for your help. Please take these as a token of my thanks.
