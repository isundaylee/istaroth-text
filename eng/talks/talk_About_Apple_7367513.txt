Traveler: About Apple...
Banu: Do you want to know her? I can introduce you to Apple for sure!
Banu: Apple is my best friend. When I was little, mom brought her back home. She used to carry me on her back and walk me around. She'd help me cook too!
Banu: Whenever we were running short of fish and meat back home, she would go out and buy some fresh fish and meat for me.
Banu: Apple is the best! With her by my side, no one dares to bully me.
