## Talk 1

Anthony: Will this prescription really work...?
Traveler: What's the matter?
Anthony: Traveler! You've got great timing. I was just in a spot of bother.
Anthony: Here's the thing. You remember my younger sister, Anna, right? She's always been sickly, and nothing's managed to cure her.
Anthony: But I heard that there's an incredible doctor in Liyue Harbor who is especially skilled at curing the incurable. So, I asked someone to help me get a prescription from him.
Anthony: The ingredients are all very unusual... but I suppose I can only give it a shot.
Anthony: Um, let me see... Could you help me find a Dendro-Processed Berry?
Traveler: There's such a thing?
Anthony: I have no clue either! Do Dendro Slimes really eat berries...
Anthony: Either way, I'm counting on you! I do know of a place where both Slimes and berries may be found.
Anthony: Please help me take a look. I hope you'll find it...
Traveler: This doctor's a quack.
Anthony: So you think so too, huh? But I don't have any other options.
Anthony: I know of a place where you can find both Slimes and berries. Could you please go have a look for me?
Anthony: I'll try the medication that we make first. No matter what, I can't let Anna's condition get any worse.
Traveler: I could just catch a Dendro Slime for you.
Anthony: Huh... What? Are you telling me to stuff the berry into the Dendro Slime's mouth myself?
Anthony: Spare me, please! The last time I went picking herbs for Anna's medication, a group of Dendro Slimes chased me all the way to Springvale!
Anthony: I know of a place where you can find both Slimes and berries. Please go have a look for me, will you? I hope you find something...
Anthony: But... i—if you really can't find anything, then for Anna's sake... J—Just catch a Dendro Slime and bring it back here. I can do it. I... I will do it!

## Talk 2

Anthony: Have you found it yet?

## Talk 4

Anthony: Have you found it yet?
Traveler: Yup.
Anthony: Is that it? It really doesn't look any different...
Anthony: However you look at it, this is just an ordinary berry...
Anthony: Forget it. Since that's the doctor's orders, let's follow the prescription to the letter.
Anthony: Thank you. This is for your trouble.
Anthony: I might need to bother you again in the future. When that happens, please don't decline.
