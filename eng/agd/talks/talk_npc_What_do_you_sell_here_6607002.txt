Traveler: What do you sell here?
Yelafath: Fishing equipment, mostly. If there's water, there's fish, as they say, and many come to our tribe to do just that.
Yelafath: Thanks to them, business is pretty good! If your rod's broken, I can help fix it as well!
Yelafath: I'm quite good at handicrafts, so I also sell small badges and ornaments.
Yelafath: Many tourists went to bring some souvenirs back, so I do custom work as well â€” if you want to engrave a name or something like that, I can do it, easy!
