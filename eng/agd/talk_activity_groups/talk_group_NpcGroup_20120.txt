Notes with Missing Pages: "I have gone to Bubu Pharmacy to seek a cure for Jiang'er's troubled mind. I believe we should have the results in a few days..."
Notes with Missing Pages: "Once I have finished my last mission, I will retire from the Millelith and move back home, away from this life of diligence that borders on hypervigilance."
Notes with Missing Pages: "I've given most of my life to the Millelith. If I want to enjoy life a bit now, I doubt the Ministry of Civil Affairs will deny me."
Notes with Missing Pages: "If they don't, it's fine. I'll just take Jiang'er and leave Liyue for good. We'll live carefree lives somewhere else."
Notes with Missing Pages: "Still, I am a Millelith for now, and I must serve until my final watch. Don't worry. Just take care of Jiang'er and wait for my return."
