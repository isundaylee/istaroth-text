# Ile flottante

A dessert made out of egg whites. The cooking process is simple: Froth up the egg whites properly, and half the battle is won. Place the heated egg whites on the sauce, and you're done. The dessert has an exquisite look and is the first choice of Fontainian ladies for afternoon tea.
