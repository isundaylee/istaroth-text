# Kanra's Thoughts


## Talk 1

Traveler: Searching for Sakura Blooms?
Kanra: You saw my commission? Have you managed to get 5 Sakura Blooms?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Kanra: Okay. Well, you know where to find me when you've got them.

## Talk 2

Kanra: Thank you. You know, since the man I love left to join the war, I've not heard one shred of news...
Kanra: These days, I worry about him at every waking moment. Only the sight of the Sacred Sakura's blossoms can soothe my mind a little.
Kanra: The reason is that before he left, he swore on the Sacred Sakura that he would return safely to me.
