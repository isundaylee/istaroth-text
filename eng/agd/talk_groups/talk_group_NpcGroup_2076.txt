Sisi: Oh hi. Look, sorry, if you're hitting on me I'll have to refuse. I'm waiting on someone.

Traveler: Who are you waiting for?
Sisi: My lover, Chaoxi. He's a sailor.
Sisi: We don't get to see each other very often, he's never back on land for very long...
Sisi: He's already been gone for so long, who knows when he'll be back...
Sisi: Next time he gets back I'm just going to ask him outright when we are going to get married. All this waiting is just too much...

### Talk 0 related talk 1

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Sisi: Rex Lapis and Liyue, like two lovers for thousands of years...
Sisi: But all relationships must come to an end. If death is the thing that finally separates you, well then surely that's a sign that you had a good run...
Sisi: ...or is it a sign that we have all been dumped by Rex Lapis?

## Talk 4

Sisi: Chaoxi, you've finally returned! Let's settle our engagement plans while you're back this time, what do you say?
Chaoxi: Sisi, I literally just got back from sea and I'm completely drained, mentally and physically. Let's talk about it later...
Sisi: But that's what you said last time, and before I knew it you were running off with some other girl...
Chaoxi: Come now, don't be that way. We're just friends, nothing more.
Sisi: If you two are just friends, then what are you so worried about? Why can't we get engaged?
Chaoxi: There you go again! I don't have any intention of getting married yet. It's not that I can't shoulder the responsibility, Sisi, it's just that I don't want to disappoint you, that's all.
Chaoxi: I'm a sailor and the sea is always calling me, there's no escaping it. You might as well just consider me swallowed by the waves already. You deserve someone better.
Sisi: Don't talk like that, Chaoxi. I know that you'll be just fine...
