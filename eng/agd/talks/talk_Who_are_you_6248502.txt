# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Hanqian: I'm one of the leaders of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. As it stands now, you can think of me as half an owner.
Hanqian: Let me tell you... There used to be three of us leaders, and we were all very good.
Hanqian: At our peak, we were in charge of almost half of the orders here in Yilong Wharf.
Hanqian: After we started working with the Communications Office, the best leader among the three of us lost his drive, and just hung around all day.
Hanqian: He used to be the kind of guy who would train under a waterfall to discipline himself. I can't for the life of me figure out what happened.
Hanqian: Another was ambushed by bandits and took almost a full year to recover. He's no longer as good as he was, so I'm the only one left.
Hanqian: The owner saw what happened and decided to just go hands-off on us.
Hanqian: We'll just have to wait until the newly recruited guards for hire are ready and see if things improve.
Hanqian: Speaking of which... Dip Yeuk isn't slacking off, is he? And I wonder how Huang the Third is doing.
Hanqian: *sigh* I do spend my days just worrying about things, don't I?
