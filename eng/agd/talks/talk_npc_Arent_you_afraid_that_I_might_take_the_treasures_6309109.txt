Traveler: Aren't you afraid that I might take the treasures for myself?
Yegor: Hehe, I don't think you will. After all, I haven't told you the most important piece of information yet!
Yegor: Even if you find out anything about it, you'll still need clues from me to continue.
Yegor: And I on the other hand am no expert adventurer. I'll need a helping hand.
Yegor: Once you get the information, we can strike up a partnership. Rest assured, I will pay you handsomely.
