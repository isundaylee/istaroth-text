Mack: Hold it, I have to stop you right there. Sorry, the name's Mack.
Mack: The Knights of Favonius are carrying out a training exercise near Falcon Coast. Access is temporarily denied to the public.
Traveler: But I don't see any knights on the beach...
Mack: They're still rounding up the troops, but they'll be arriving shortly.
Mack: Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.
Traveler: But there are monsters on the beach...
Mack: Exactly. They will serve as targets for the knights participating in the training exercise.

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Mack: Ah, well do you see those two children over there?

Traveler: Who are those kids?
Mack: That's Will and Jill. Children aren't really supposed to leave the city without an accompanying adult...
Mack: But I thought, they just look so happy playing together. I couldn't bring myself to go and tell them off...
Mack: So I've just stayed here watching them. Otherwise, I'm not sure how I'd be able to face their parents.
