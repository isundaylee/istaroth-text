Huihui: Why do you fans of Yue cuisine always have to bad-mouth Li cuisine?
Hao: You Li lovers started it when you said Yue food was disgusting!
Huihui: But Yue food IS disgusting... You guys practically take raw fish straight out of the sea and swallow them whole! What you call the "rich aroma of fresh seafood," I call the "pungent odor of dead fish..." There is no flavor profile because it all tastes the same...
Hao: Oh yeah? Well every Li dish is pretty much a plate of Jueyun Chilis that have been buried in salt for half the week! "Rugged essence of the mountains"? More like "essence of mountain lion clawing at back of throat"!
Huihui: How can you say that? You clearly have no taste when it comes to food. All that Yue cooking has completely ruined your palate!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!

## Talk 1

Huihui: Yeugh, this soup is so bland they might as well serve boiled water. And this fish just disintegrates when you touch it; it's got no texture at all!

## Talk 2

Traveler: You seem to be enjoying your meal.
Huihui: Enjoying it? How can I? I only came here in the first place because I don't enjoy it; I'm trying to prove a point about the superiority of Li cuisine!
Huihui: I need to experience every last detail of Yue cuisine so I can point out all of its flaws. That's why I've been coming here for the past... year? Huh, it's been so long I can't remember...
Huihui: Ugh... Everything is cooked in such a bland way. The only redeeming feature is that it's freshly caught. Freshness is all they ever talk about; that's the only proof you need that this style of cooking is a complete joke!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Goodbye.
Huihui: Goodbye!
Huihui: Ugh... For the love ofâ€” Use some seasoning...

## Talk 4

Huihui: I always thought that Liuli Pavilion was the only place to go for authentic Li cuisine...
Huihui: But it turns out that once in a while, you just can't beat a good bit of street food!
Huihui: I'm craving some more of that Zhongyuan Chop Suey...
