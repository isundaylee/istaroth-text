Traveler: We didn't do anything... No need to thank us.
Betresa: You may not know this, but Lord Bamoun and I were very close friends.
Betresa: I'm usually in charge of day-to-day matters, and after he fell ill, caring for Lord Bamoun often fell to me.
Betresa: As you see, I am hardly young myself and have lived here all my life...
Betresa: Here, we keep secrets and shoulder our duties. To put things nicely, we have our principles. To be blunter about it... We have nowhere else to go.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun and I have spent our whole lives in the desert. He was full of life and boldness in his youth, just like you, and thus became our leader.
Betresa: I sometimes feel that he was always searching for a way to better the lives of all humans.
Betresa: It was for this purpose that he obtained the Ba Fragments to protect our faith — the contest with you, your companions, and Sir Cyrus was part of it too.

Traveler: You believe that he intended all this?
Betresa: Though I am not sure what you are referring to specifically, I would think so.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun had hoped for change to come all his life, which is why he treasured his relationship with Sir Cyrus.
Betresa: He believed that the challenges he took upon himself could bring the changes to the current situation that we needed.
Betresa: And as you have seen, Lord Sethos has succeeded him as our new leader.
Betresa: As surely as we have eyes to witness it, the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence shall begin building bridges between them once more... It comes a little late, but I believe it is what Lord Bamoun desired.
Betresa: He and his grandson, Lord Sethos, were very close, and they must have agreed on this long ago.

Traveler: Thanks for explaining.
Betresa: Think nothing of it, Traveler. As I see it, you, too, represent many possibilities, and I am glad to have met you here.
Betresa: Lord Sethos, too, says that you are a friend to us and the Temple. Stay a while if you have time. I imagine all of us would be glad of it.
