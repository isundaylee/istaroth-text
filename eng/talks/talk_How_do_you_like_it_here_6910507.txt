Traveler: How do you like it here?
Ororon: Don't worry — I think it's great.
Ororon: I'm good at adapting to my environment. Teapot, water cup, wine barrel... I'd be fine in any container, really.
Traveler: Well, I'm very glad to hear that.
Ororon: And I'm very happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
Ororon: This place is so homey, and all the decor is so unique. I like everything about it.
Traveler: It's nothing special. I just went with the flow.
Ororon: I think that's a great way to live your life.
Ororon: It's the kind of mindset that makes it easier to move past things and overcome life's challenges.
Ororon: Besides, it's your home. Your own comfort should be your first priority.
Ororon: The best homes are spaces where you can sprawl out and live the way you want. Just like my place — I pretty much leave my stuff wherever I want.
Traveler: Then, make yourself at home!
Ororon: Okay! I basically already have.
