# Talk Dialog

Sethos: Whenever I go to the Grand Bazaar, I head straight to the food stalls, grab some snacks and a drink, and then I take my time checking the place out.
Sethos: But, some shops are off-limits if you have your hands full... A carpet shop, for example.
Sethos: How about this... We split the snacks! That way, we can finish them off quickly and then get shopping!
