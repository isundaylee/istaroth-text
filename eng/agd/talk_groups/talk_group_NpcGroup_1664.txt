Traveler: Here's your Chilled Meat.
Harris: Wow, this Chilled Meat looks pretty good to me... Now I just have one more ingredient left to find.
Harris: Have you heard of the Great Snowboar King? People say that it's a fierce beast dwelling deep in the mountains...
Harris: ...And recipes say that its exquisite meat is well-suited to any method of cooking...
Harris: Traveler, would you kindly run this errand for me?
Traveler (Gameplay): Could I boldly inquire what's in it for me?
Harris: Don't worry, I have set something aside ready for your return.

Traveler: Huh... You mean, this?
Harris: What? Wait... Yes! How... Where? Is this pure coincidence, or...
Harris: ...Well, anyway... This means I now have all the ingredients I need.
Harris: While I was waiting for you to get back with the ingredients, I formalized my recipe. If one thing's certain, it's that this is definitely a far cry from the ancient recipe I started with...
Harris: But as long as the end result tastes good, I'm not concerned about how I get there. I think I'm going to name this dish "Goulash." Sounds exotic but it's very easy to make... Why don't you try for yourself?
Harris: Don't worry, I've factored in the difficulty of trying to cook in an inhospitable environment like this. So I kept the preparation time to a minimum and made sure the cooking method is a straightforward one.
Harris: Go on, give it a try. After you've made it once, you'll find it's easy to remember if you ever want to cook it again.

Traveler: Who are you?
Harris: The name's Harris. I'm a chef and the person who built this camp.
Harris: I came here to help the adventurers in the area, to make sure they can get a bowl of hot soup at the end of a long day of adventure.
Harris: I reckon there's no greater joy than the feeling of hot soup in your system when you're just about frozen stiff.
Harris: The essence of the culinary pursuit is to bring people satisfaction and joy, is it not?
Harris: It's a shame that lots of chefs have forgotten this... Personally, I was taught this simple principle by a young female chef who I met by chance while traveling in Liyue.
