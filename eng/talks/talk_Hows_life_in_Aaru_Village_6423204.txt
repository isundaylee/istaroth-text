Traveler: How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: Oh, I've been doing alright. Thanks for your concern.
Sabbah: The neighbors have been very kind to me, and Affan swings around to chat often, so... I'm definitely a lot less lonely than I was before.
Sabbah: Though I fear that I can't just get books or research equipment whenever I want, I believe that as long as I desire to seek knowledge, I shall find it, no matter where I am.
