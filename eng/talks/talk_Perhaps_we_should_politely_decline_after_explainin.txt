# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Perhaps we should politely decline after explaining our reasons.
Bernhard: Understood. I'll talk to the owners.
Black Screen Text: Bernhard leaves to talk to the people involved...
Bernhard: Honorary Knight. Paimon. The owners were very reasonable and understood our reply.
Bernhard: However, the shopkeepers did donate a sum of money to show their support for the charity sale.
Paimon: These shopkeepers are so kind...
Paimon: Anyway, it is fortunate that nothing went to waste this time!
