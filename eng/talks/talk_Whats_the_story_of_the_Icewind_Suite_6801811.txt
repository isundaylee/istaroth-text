Traveler: What's the story of the Icewind Suite?
Maillardet: A fine question!
Maillardet: Like how Coppelius was defeated in a war against temptation, and was thus punished. Or how Coppelia so loved him that she nearly died from grief as a result.
Maillardet: Or how, to save the imprisoned Coppelius, Coppelia would set out on a journey.
Maillardet: Or how, no matter how things go, the drama shall end in a lovers' dance.
Maillardet: Haha! Well, actually, that was just me making some story bits up. I mean, I'm no literary scholar, just a researcher who works with clockwork meka.
Maillardet: As far as I'm concerned, their function is more important than their story.
Maillardet: However, if you're that interested in the story... Well, I'll consider.
