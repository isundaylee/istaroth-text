Traveler: What sort of collaboration?
Hoa: They actually come up quite a lot. Let me think...
Hoa: Sometimes, adventurers would want to hire a guide from the People of the Springs, or request a doctor from the Masters of the Night-Wind. If they don't know how to find such individuals themselves, they'll often ask me to pass on the word.
Hoa: Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It's only right to help each other out.
