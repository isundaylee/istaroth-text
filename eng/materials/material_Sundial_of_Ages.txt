# Sundial of Ages

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It seems quite old now, but the etchings are still very clear, and so it can still be used.
The sun is a rare sight down in The Chasm, and it is easy to lose track of time. But someday, this sundial will once again track the passage of years.
