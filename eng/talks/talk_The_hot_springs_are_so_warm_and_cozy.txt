Visitor's Message: "The hot springs are so warm and cozy..."
Visitor's Message: "After a good soak in the springs, I felt as light as a dandelion."
Visitor's Message: "Which got me thinking... Surely there must be thermal drafts rising from these springs? If I was to float up on them, would they carry me off into the sky?"
Manager's Reply: "Attention, dear guests from Mondstadt: Not only does drinking wine in the hot springs put you at risk of fainting, but if you spill any while bathing, you'll be fined! So whatever you do, don't drink and bathe!"
Manager's Reply: "Golden Dusk not only offers an exquisite dining experience, but a wide variety of drinks too â€” so please save all wine-tasting for the restaurant!"
