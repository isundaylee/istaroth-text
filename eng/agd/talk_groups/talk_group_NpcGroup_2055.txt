Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Heh, even though we've already gone through all the motions of the Rite of Parting, I still don't really believe that the Lord of Geo is dead.
Big-Footed Dajiao: If you ask me, this whole thing is just a big scheme by the Qixing. They're undoubtedly the ones pulling all the strings behind the scenes.
Big-Footed Dajiao: ... Well, that's my two cents, at least. But don't you go around telling everybody what I think now, ya hear?

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis' death? I refuse to believe it.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis has lived for more than a millennium, what would bring someone to do such a thing in this day and age?
Big-Footed Dajiao: If you ask me, the Qixing are up to something.
Big-Footed Dajiao: No wonder the staff at the ministry are so uptight, they must be feeling uneasy...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Look at me, just rattling off whatever comes to mind. I'm just mindlessly blabbering. Don't go repeating anything to the Millelith, okay?

Traveler: What're you taking care of?
Big-Footed Dajiao: I carry bridal sedan chairs, and I've just been contracted to carry a new one, but I wanna get a sign for it so the Millelith won't stop us...
Big-Footed Dajiao: But as soon as I started to speak, I had this certification form thrown at me. I already got certified ages ago, I came here to get a sign...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Before I had even finished speaking, she took back the form and said I could go home and wait to be notified of the outcome of my application.
Big-Footed Dajiao: She didn't listen to me at all... *sigh*

Big-Footed Dajiao: Oh yeah, did you know? Tiger fish actually used to be called something similar, but the sound changed over time... A bride I was carrying once told me.
