Traveler: No alcohol?
Yukio: Hmm, odd, is it? Well, think about it. If you drink too much, your taste buds will get numb, and you won't be able to taste how good the dishes are anymore.
Yukio: So even if most Inazuman snacks go well with alcohol, we don't serve alcohol here.
Yukio: To me, the bitterness and the aftertaste of tea can bring out the taste of the skewers and the sauce better. Alcohol would just cover everything up.
Yukio: Aside from the skewers, you might want to order some kitsune ramen if you want something more filling... Ah, by the way, you aren't allergic to beans, are you?
