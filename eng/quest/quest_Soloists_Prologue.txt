# Soloist's Prologue


## Talk 1

Paimon: It seems we have to use Hydro to collect Romaritime Flowers.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whew, after crossing all that sand and water, we finally made it... This must be Fontaine's port.
Paimon: Wow, everything looks so advanced in Fontaine. Paimon's heard that the industry here is extremely developed, and there are all kinds of unusual machines.
Traveler: So I heard, and it's about what I imagined.
Paimon: Just seeing the sights as tourists is nice, but maybe it would be better if we found something to do.
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: Let's start by meeting the Hydro Archon.
Paimon: Good idea. Nahida gave us loads of useful information.
Paimon: Seeking out The Seven is probably still our best source for information at this point.
Traveler: Our journey is to find my sibling...
Paimon: Yeah! The more we can learn, the better.
Paimon: So what do you think the Hydro Archon's like? Will we get along? Nahida said that she has "a very unique personality"... whatever that means.
Paimon: To learn about a nation's god, start with the nation's people! There seems to be some locals talking over there, let's go see if we can join the party.
Etienne: If you ask me, it's a tragedy how things ended for him. Clearly, he was a pretty decent person.
Rena: Yeah, I didn't expect that kind of ending for him... I thought he would at least fight on a little longer for his family.
Rena: I was expecting a sudden plot twist, but it's a pity that it never happened... Still, his story is quite the tear-jerker...
Etienne: Uh, excuse me, can I help you two? I couldn't help but notice you standing here listening.
Paimon: Uh... Hi! We're travelers new to Fontaine, and we had something we wanted to ask, but you seemed to be really busy talking about some kind of play, so we didn't want to interrupt.
Etienne: A "play"? Oh no, no... We're talking about something that really happened. In fact, it's a case that was just heard a few days ago.
Paimon: Really? Like a real trial? But the way you were talking about it and the words you used just now made it sound like some kind of story...
Rena: Well, good tales are often based on true stories, aren't they? And what you see in reality may also be someone deliberately putting on an act while harboring ulterior motives...
Rena: Whether something is true or not simply isn't that important. The main thing is whether the story being acted out on the stage is splendid enough.
Rena: Oh, but it looks like you're not from around here! You probably don't know that the Fontaine Court of Justice is called the Opera Epiclese, or more commonly known as just "the opera house."
Traveler: So they see trials as a sort of "opera"...
Paimon: But, uh... shouldn't court cases be treated a little more seriously than that? Not to question Fontaine's way of doing things, it's just that putting someone on trial is usually a very serious thing...
Rena: Hehe, no worries. Other visitors to Fontaine have wondered the same thing. You could say that we just don't want to waste the moving stories behind those cases.
Rena: And as for your worries about whether the cases are treated with due reverence, we have the absolutely just and honorable Chief Justice Neuvillette...
Rena: As well as the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a machine created by the Archon. Between the machine and the Chief Justice, false charges and injustice are a thing of the past now.
Traveler: A judgment device created by the Archon...
Paimon: The Oratrice? Is it some kind of machine too? Paimon's curious... We should check it out if we get the chance.
Paimon: Wait, Paimon almost forgot to ask you our question! Do you know what we should do if we want to meet the Hydro Archon?
Etienne: Oh, that's easy! Just go to the opera house. Lady Furina practically lives there, you could definitely say it's her biggest passion.
Rena: Ah, I think what they mean is that they wish to speak with the Archon personally.
Rena: In that case, I'm afraid it's going to be a tad more difficult. You'll have to make an appointment well in advance, and it'll depend on whether or not she has any timeslots available.
Traveler: Make an appointment?
Paimon: Huh? Is the Hydro Archon super busy taking care of official stuff? Wait, didn't you say that she's always at the opera house?
Etienne: No, no, Lady Furina seldom takes an interest with the nation's affairs. The reason it's difficult to make an appointment is simply because she's incredibly popular.
Rena: That's right, after all, she is the Archon. Though she may tend to get a little dramatic from time to time, people can't get enough of her.
Paimon: Huh, first time Paimon's ever heard of an Archon being described that way before...
Paimon: Ah wait, Paimon gets it now! The Hydro Archon is kinda like a big celebrity here, right?
Etienne: Yeah, I suppose you could say that. Heh, perhaps you could even say our "mascot."
Rena: Hang on, this is still Fontaine's Archon you're talking about. You should show some more respect!
Etienne: Yes, you're right. I guess I should at least try to be a little more respectful in front of visitors. Otherwise, I might get arrested and find myself face to face with Monsieur Neuvillette.
Rena: Haha, come on... Sure, there's a lot of laws here, but nobody's going to be arrested for saying something disrespectful about the Hydro Archon.
Traveler: Seems the people of Fontaine really like the Hydro Archon...
Paimon: Alright, I think we get it, thank you! At least we now know that we can find the Hydro Archon at the opera house.
Paimon: But who knows how long making an appointment will take... Guess we could have a look around the city in the meantime.
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler, what are you looking over there for?
Traveler: There's a girl over there...
Paimon: Huh, maybe something's the matter... *gasp* She isn't going to jump into the water, is she?
Paimon: Uh... Maybe we'd better go check on her.
Traveler: She's been standing alone for quite some time...
Traveler: But they don't appear to revere her.
Traveler: Timeslots?
Traveler: So this is the "Nation of Justice"...
Traveler: And also to find the truth.
Traveler: It's even more impressive than I expected.

## Talk 3

Lynette: ...
Paimon: Uh, hello there! Excuse me! Are you alright?
Lynette: ...Huh?
Lynette: Ah, I'm fine... Thanks.
Paimon: Oh, okay then. We just noticed that you seemed to be worried about something.
Lynette: About many things, actually... But there's nothing I can do but just keep my troubles to myself.
Lynette: I was just reminiscing about a place my brother and I would play when we were kids. It was just atop that hill over there, see?
Paimon: Uh, you're pointing at the sea... Wait, are you saying that you and your brother lived in the water?
Traveler: Maybe they're mermaids?
Lynette: Though people call the waters around Fontaine a "sea," it's actually just an inland lake that's filled with fresh water.
Lynette: And though I can still see that hill clearly in my memories, now it's been completely submerged.
Lynette: He would skip and jump, tossing sand in the wind... The sun shone brightly and the air was filled with the scent of the sea.
Lynette: But now the water is gradually swallowing our memories...
Lynette: It won't be long before it swallows us.
Paimon: Uh, sorry, Paimon doesn't really get what you mean.
Lyney: Ah, I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting. Are you Lynette's new friends?
Paimon: Oh, and you are...
Lyney: Thanks for looking after my sister, she often comes here to reminisce about our childhood, that's all. There's no need for any concern.
Lyney: Ah, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Lyney, and this is my sister, Lynette. If I had to guess, I'd say you must be travelers from abroad.
Paimon: #Nice to meet you, Paimon is Paimon, and this is Traveler. We just arrived in Fontaine.
Paimon: We were just talking with your sister, uh... even though we didn't really get what she was saying.
Lyney: Hmm, I see. It's unusual for Lynette to be so willing to talk with anyone, in fact, she seldom speaks at all. I'm usually the only one she ever talks to.
Paimon: Oh, really? Then you two are just like us! Paimon's always the one talking for some reason.
Traveler: There's hardly anything left for me to say with you around, Paimon.
Paimon: Huh! So that's how you think it is?
Lynette: I also think my brother can be too talkative at times.
Lyney: Ah, hehe... Seems you were right, Paimon. We are quite similar.
Paimon: Hehe...
Paimon: So what did Lynette mean just now when she said that the water is engulfing your memories, and that it won't be long before it engulfs you too?
Lyney: Ah, that... It's from a prophecy that's been circulating in Fontaine for some time now.
Lyney: Well, I suppose "prophecy" isn't exactly the right word, because that implies a certain amount of uncertainty. There's no doubt about what's happening in Fontaine now...
Traveler: Oh? What's happening in Fontaine?
Lyney: Where to begin? Hmm...
Lyney: Ah, let's put that question on hold for a moment. We still haven't formally greeted each other yet, have we?
Paimon: Uh... Did all the introductions earlier not count?
Lyney: #Hello, Traveler.
Traveler: Hello, Lyney.
Lyney: And hello, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! Why didn't Paimon get a handshake? You're not poking fun at Paimon, are you!?
Lyney: Haha, please don't take offense. Just consider it a sort of etiquette we have here in Fontaine when making new friends. You should remember it, it might prove useful...
Paimon: Oh, alright then... Well, Paimon's just happy to have a local friend now.
Paimon: By the way, we were just getting ready to go to the opera house to meet the Hydro Archon. Would you be able to show us the way?
Lyney: So you're going to see Lady Furina? No problem at all. In fact, I was planning to go to the opera house later myself. I'll gladly take you once I finish things here.
Lyney: Please follow me.
Traveler: It's a pleasure to meet you.
Traveler: Because you always steal all my lines.
Traveler: Or a fantastical race from Fontaine?

## Talk 4

Etienne: But where would I move to? Snezhnaya? Liyue?

## Talk 5

Lyney: Uh, you said you were going to see Lady Furina? Well, it seems Lady Furina has come to see you.
Paimon: Huh!? So... she's the Hydro Archon? But how did she know we were looking for her?
Furina: My dear people, rich and poor, those with cup in hand and those with nothing at all, raise your glasses in celebration! If you don't have one, then just raise your hand in lieu.
Furina: #As you can all see, two unfamiliar travelers have arrived in our nation. Come, let us make a toast in honor of this Traveler and his companion who have journeyed here from distant lands!
Paimon: Uh...? Is she talking about us?
Traveler: (Nobody here seems to be holding a glass...)
Furina: I've long heard of the turmoil and chaos you've left in your wake as you visited other nations, but I welcome you nevertheless... No, I have come to receive you personally.
Furina: Fear is for insignificant cowards. I am a god, and I will never entertain the notion of such meaningless wariness. You can be rest assured, I see clearly your sincerity.
Furina: Of course, seeking an audience with me is the most sensible thing to do. It will allow you to truly behold my power and witness my authority. Intelligent people always gather under the correct banner.
Furina: I, Focalors, hereby welcome you to the nation of Hydro and acknowledge the value and significance of your trip. Now, you may rejoice in this!
Traveler: Well, finding the Archon was easy enough...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon still can't believe it... It feels like we've only been here for a few minutes.
Paimon: But the Hydro Archon's entrance was, uh... How should Paimon describe it...? A little over the top?
Paimon: Ahem... Uh, Miss Hydro Archon... How did you know we were coming?
Furina: Ah, I see. As outlanders, you inevitably lack even some of the most basic understanding. Don't forget that even the gods can be divided into the mediocre and the excellent. I suppose it's only natural for you to be awestruck by my abilities.
Furina: You had best stop and consider... do you really have the noble qualities and etiquette necessary to communicate with a god? All it takes is a flick of my finger for me to know everything about you.
Paimon: Whoa, talk about sounding high and mighty...
Traveler: Feels like she can't get over herself...
Furina: ...
Furina: Oh? What's with these looks? Perhaps the welcoming ceremony still isn't enough? Hmm, what else should I say then?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Uh, is she waiting for us to start talking?
Rena: Wow, I didn't expect to see Lady Furina here. What a surprise!
Rena: #Wait, does this mean they're the "Legendary {F#Blonde}{M#Blond} Traveler"!? How did I not notice before?
Etienne: Hey, what's all the commotion? Oh, is that Lady Furina? Is there some kinda drama going on?
Lectoure: #Of course! That's the {F#Blonde}{M#Blond} Traveler, the one all those stories are about. Lady Furina came here to personally see him... Oh, I bet this is going to be the duel of the century!
Etienne: Oh! I've got to see this! I knew Lady Furina would never disappoint!
Furina: Ahaha! Yes, but don't get too excited now... My dear believers and spectators alike tend to get quite rowdy, and despite the noise, I've come to tolerate all their ruckus.
Furina: You may consider this my reward to all of you! I have determined that there will be an epic duel between myself and this traveler from another land, just as you were hoping to see!
Paimon: Huh!? Now she wants to fight? Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?
Traveler: ...Bring it on.
Furina: Hmm? Hmph! A—Are you not afraid? Might I remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
Clorinde: What are you trying to do, Traveler? Provoking a god in front of her people?
Furina: #Ahem, stand down, Clorinde. I admire his bravery, few have the courage to draw their sword against a god. He is obviously a true warrior.
Furina: Unfortunately, people nowadays only crave to be thrilled, and a mere duel will not slake their thirst for excitement!
Lectoure: ...Yeah, she's right. Just a duel wouldn't be all that interesting...
Etienne: On Erinnyes, criminals are always requesting duels to defend their honor. They're getting a bit old, to tell the truth.
Furina: You see... then as the god of justice, I shall face this Traveler in another kind of duel... a duel in court!
Lectoure: Whoa! Oooh, alright, now that'll be worth seeing!
Etienne: Right, this is Fontaine, after all. With such a grand opera house, it would be a pity not to use it.
Paimon: Why do you care so much about the crowd's reactions? Seems you've spent a little too much time in the opera house...
Paimon: Besides, how exactly do you plan to have a duel in court? You mean you're going to put us on trial?
Traveler: And we haven't committed any crimes.
Furina: Hehe. Oh, we have reason to put you on trial. It's obvious, isn't it?
Traveler: Obvious?
Furina: According to Fontaine law, no one is permitted to release any flying objects within Fontaine city limits during the first three days of each month. You are clearly guilty of violating this law, no?
Etienne: Oh! So that's what they've done wrong. That's our Lady Furina, no one knows the laws of Fontaine like she does.
Paimon: Huh? You call that obvious? What kind of law is that!? Wait, "flying object"...? You mean Paimon!?
Traveler: Uh...
Furina: Precisely. Now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the Hydro Archon, I order your arrest.
Lyney: My apologies, Lady Furina. I don't mean to spoil the fun, but if you would allow me to interject...
Lyney: ...I don't think that Paimon here meets the definition of a "flying object."
Paimon: You tell her, Lyney! Finally, someone who's not crazy... How could anyone call Paimon a flying object!?
Furina: Ah, Great Magician Lyney, my beloved citizen. I'll permit you to object, but how exactly do you plan to prove your claim?
Lyney: Hehe, as a magician who just rained on your parade, I naturally should shoulder the responsibility of "saving the show"...
Lyney: So, with such an audience gathered here, allow me to perform a trick for everyone.
Lyney: (Snap!)
Lynette: Tada~
Paimon: Waa! What's that on Paimon's back? Hey, when did you do that!?
Traveler: (Ah, when Lyney patted you on the back...)
Lyney: There. As you can all clearly see, Paimon should be classified as, well, something like a balloon. This rope has been in the Traveler's hand all along, it was just that no one could see it before.
Rena: Huh, you call that magic? You've got to be joking...
Etienne: Hahaha, I thought it was pretty good. Nice one!
Lectoure: Huh, I'm not sure what to think. It seems Lady Furina's charges no longer hold water...
Furina: ...
Furina: Hah! Hahahaha...
Furina: Amusing. Very amusing, Lyney. Just the sort of unexpected twist that I enjoy. With you here, today's performance can finally be called complete.
Paimon: Performance? You see all this as a performance?
Furina: In which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. The god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
Furina: But when there are valid grounds, I will not only judge travelers from abroad...
Furina: But even the gods of other lands, hehehe...
Furina: I look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, Mister Lyney and Miss Lynette. That's enough for now. Toodle-oo~
Traveler: We literally just arrived here.
Traveler: (Fighting gods? I've got a resumé.)

## Talk 6

Paimon: And just like that, she's gone. Well, that's the most unpredictable archon Paimon's ever seen... We never even had a chance to ask her anything, but that's a problem for future Paimon! That whole scene just now was really...
Traveler: Thanks for bailing us out, Lyney.
Lyney: Don't mention it. I just happened to remember that there was such a law, so I did a little preparation — just in case. I didn't think it would actually come in handy.
Lyney: So, now do you see what kind of god Lady Furina is?
Lynette: She can be a bit confusing at times, but she is still amenable to reason.
Traveler: Yeah, confusing is a good way to put it...
Paimon: Anyway, Paimon had no idea you were a magician, Lyney. It sounded like you'll be performing at the opera house, right?
Lyney: Haha, I just know a few simple tricks I use to make a living. Lynette is my assistant.
Lyney: It will actually be my first time performing on the most prestigious stage in Fontaine, the opera house.
Paimon: But isn't the opera house where criminal trials are held in Fontaine?
Lyney: When there are no public trials being held, the opera house hosts a variety of other performances. To the people of Fontaine, the line between a trial and a performance can be a little blurred...
Lyney: And speaking of performances, I would be remiss to forgo this opportunity gifted by fate. Might I invite the two of you to see my performance?
Lynette: My brother's always excited to make new friends.
Paimon: Oh, sure. We don't really have anything to do now, and we wanted to go to the opera house anyway.
Traveler: I would be delighted.
Lyney: Splendid! In that case, why don't we go together? I'll show you the way. I just have something to take care of first...
Traveler: Is there any way I can help?
Lyney: You really mean it? Then I'll take you up on your offer.
Lyney: This is a magical item known as a "Magic Pocket." Perhaps you can help me distribute them to the people here.
Paimon: Huh? What are they going to use it for?
Lyney: About that, hmm... You asked me before about the prophecy, right? Let me start by telling you a little more about what it entails.
Lyney: I'm not sure exactly when it began, but a prophecy has been circulating around Fontaine...
Lyney: It says that every person in Fontaine is born with "sin." No matter how the Nation of Justice holds trial after trial, this sin cannot be absolved.
Lyney: Until one day, the water levels in Fontaine will rise, and the sinful people will slowly be drowned...
Lyney: In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne... Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away.
Paimon: That sounds pretty gloomy... Why are people in Fontaine born with sin? What is that supposed to mean?
Lyney: There are lots of guesses... Some say that the ancestors of Fontaine stole the power of the seas, and stirred its wrath.
Lyney: Others say that the people of Fontaine never heeded the first Hydro Archon's warnings, and offended Celestia...
Lyney: But, here in Fontaine, evidence is what matters. There hasn't been concrete evidence for any of these claims, so they can only be regarded as conjecture.
Paimon: If even the people in Fontaine don't know what sin they committed, wouldn't it be better just to ignore the prophecy completely? Why bother feeling guilty all the time?
Lyney: That's exactly what the people did at first. But... in the last few years, the water levels in Fontaine have actually started rising.
Traveler: "But now the water is engulfing our memories..."
Lynette: Many places have already been completely submerged and now lie beneath the sea.
Lyney: Many people carry on with their lives as before and shrug it off as a "natural phenomenon," but my family and I think that the people of Fontaine shouldn't ignore the possibility, which would end up sentencing them to death.
Lyney: We hope that at least the people who reside near the waterfront can move away before it's too late, so we've started distributing Magic Pockets to them.
Lyney: As a magical item, these Magic Pockets have an astonishing capacity. I'm sure they will come in handy when people are moving their belongings.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it! It's like preparing for a rainy day... but this is more than a bit of rain!
Traveler: If the prophecy is true...
Lyney: Hmm, perhaps only absolute power could ever contend with such a catastrophe. Hehe, but who knows? We're just tiny specks in the grand scheme of things.
Lyney: Now, if you'd like to help, then please give these Magic Pockets to anyone nearby. Be sure to convince them to take it, regardless of what they say.
Traveler: Then is there no way to prevent the disaster?
Traveler: "It won't be long before it engulfs us."
Traveler: Is she really that reasonable?
Traveler: Did you know that was going to happen?

## Talk 7

Etienne: #So you're the {F#blonde}{M#blond} Traveler that everyone's been talking about. My apologies for not recognizing you earlier.
Etienne: Oh, a Magic Pocket...? Seems you really thought of everything. I guess it's better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best...
Etienne: Thanks. Please also thank the magician on my behalf when you get the chance.

## Talk 8

Galathee: Huh? Ah, I don't want that thing. Way I see it, if the prophecy's true, it's still gonna be a long time before the water can cover everything.
Galathee: Life is all about living in the moment. What use is there in worrying about the future all the time? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
Paimon: You should still take it, you never know when it will come in handy.
Galathee: Oh, alright... fine. Thanks. It's just that... if I start moving, that means I've already given up on the life I have now. I'd really rather not...

## Talk 9

Augereau: What's this... So you also believe in the prophecy? Hehe, keep it, I won't have any use for it.
Paimon: What? You mean you don't believe in the prophecy?
Augereau: No, no, I believe in the prophecy, but I also believe in another story.
Augereau: The story says that people once lived in the ocean. They were one with the ocean and couldn't live apart from it.
Augereau: But as time wore on, people desired to live on land and developed blood vessels, encapsulating the sea within their bodies. Thus could people set foot on land.
Augereau: So if you ask me, when the water rises and takes us all, it'll be like we're going home.
Paimon: Oh, we hadn't heard that one before... But, people can't live underwater, they'll die... You should probably still take it.
Augereau: Ah, alright, I'll take it. I guess I just feel that being "dissolved into the water" doesn't necessarily mean death.

## Talk 10

Etienne: Hey, how about we get some tickets to the next trial?
Rena: Hmm, I think we'd better wait and see what kind of case it is first.

## Talk 11

Lyney: Oh? You already handed out all of the Magic Pockets? That was fast. So, what did people have to say? I bet you heard some, ah, interesting opinions...
Traveler: No kidding...
Lyney: Yes, but that will change once disaster strikes. I know they'll change their minds, so it's only right to help them prepare.
Paimon: Is there anything else you need to do before we leave?
Lyney: Yes, one last thing. I have the Magic Pockets made by a workshop in the Court of Fontaine. Since we're out and about, I was thinking about bringing him some more materials.
Paimon: So you want to collect materials? Just tell us what the materials look like and we'll help. Many hands make light work!
Lyney: Ah, that would be much appreciated. We'll need some Romaritime Flowers, I remember seeing them near the waterfront on the east side of the harbor.
Traveler: Many are quite stubborn.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Huh!?
Charlotte: Whaaaat?
Charlotte: #Traveler? Paimon?
Paimon: Charlotte!
Traveler: It's Charlotte!
Charlotte: I never guessed I'd bump into you while riding the aquabus. In the story of my life, this is big news!
Charlotte: What are you doing in Fontaine? I didn't hear anything about you paying us a visit.
Paimon: Yeah, it's quite the coincidence! But as Travelers, we're always on the move. It's not surprising that nobody knew we were coming.
Paimon: Uh, though we still have no idea how the Hydro Archon knew about us... Oh! Let Paimon introduce you to our new friends!
Charlotte: Oh, no need for introductions, Paimon. I would recognize the Great Magician Lyney and his assistant Lynette anywhere.
Charlotte: I wouldn't be much of a reporter if I didn't know who they were. It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm Charlotte, a reporter for The Steambird.
Lyney: Nice to meet you. From The Steambird, huh? We've often relied on your paper to promote our performances.
Lynette: It's an honor to meet you.
Paimon: Oh, now that everyone knows each other, Fontaine suddenly doesn't feel like such an unfamiliar place.
Paimon: So, what have you been up to lately, Charlotte? Any big news?
Charlotte: Not too much... when there isn't any breaking news, I mainly cover the trials at the opera house...
Charlotte: You can still manage to keep readers' attention as long as you tell things from a clever enough angle, even if it's the same old topics.
Charlotte: For example, reporting on how a scammer once deceived vulnerable girls into relationships, or how a financial criminal was once so poor that they ate a single piece of bread for five days...
Traveler: That... would definitely get my attention.
Charlotte: *sigh* You're right, seems you know me pretty well. What I'm really after is exclusive, sensational news pieces that could shake the country. These smaller stories are a waste of my talents.
Charlotte: Oh, I just remembered... I've been following a case lately... well, a series of cases, actually...
Lynette: You mean the "serial disappearances of young women" case?
Charlotte: That's right. These stories are the talk of the town right now, and it's probably the most mysterious case we've ever seen.
Charlotte: If I'm the first with a draft ready to publish when the case is finally cracked, and it's the headline story in The Steambird...
Charlotte: When that happens, I bet all the other reporters will shed tears of envy. I've already gathered all kinds of materials, I just can't wait for the truth to be revealed.
Paimon: So what is the "serial disappearances of young women" case? You mean the culprit hasn't been found?
Charlotte: That's right. The first missing girl case happened almost twenty years ago.
Charlotte: And ever since, after a period of time, another girl disappears. What the cases have in common is that the girls are all of a similar age, and that they've all vanished without a trace.
Charlotte: But the scariest part is that to this day, none of the girls have ever been found.
Charlotte: Many suspects have been arrested over the years in connection with this case. But shortly after each arrest, another disappearance would always happen.
Traveler: Then there must be more than one criminal at work.
Charlotte: Yes, it's possible. But either way, I believe that every case has some precise truth behind it, waiting to be exposed.
Lyney: Yes, I agree. And at the very least, the families of those missing girls deserve some sort of explanation.
Lyney: I just imagined for a second what I would do if Lynette were to suddenly disappear... I'd pay any price to get her back and then find a way to track down the culprit.
Lynette: Please don't imagine that, Lyney.
Traveler: Maybe there are copycat criminals?
Traveler: But that's not really the kind of news you're after.

## Talk 13

Augereau: What do you think? Pretty interesting story, huh?

## Talk 14

Galathee: I really can't imagine what it would be like if things changed...

## Talk 15

Lyney: You made quick work of that, I can tell you're an experienced traveler. I've also finished collecting a few here.
Lyney: Maybe next time you'll feel like helping too, Lynette.
Lynette: No way. I'm in power-saving mode today. Otherwise, I fear I may not have any energy left for the performance at the opera house.
Lyney: *sigh* Fine, though the performance is still a long way off. Now that we're finished here, we should get ready to head back to the Court of Fontaine.
Paimon: So we're going to the Court of Fontaine before we head to the opera house? Good, Paimon wants a tour of Fontaine's largest city and try—
Lyney: Wait... Shh! Have you noticed that person over there? The young girl...
Paimon: Huh? What's wrong with her? Paimon didn't notice anything.
Lyney: Heh, she's obviously a thief.
Lyney: Magicians and thieves practice similar methods. We divert attention, and a distracted audience is one that won't discover what you're really doing.
Lyney: Watch her movements carefully...
Paimon: Oh, he's right!
Lyney: Shh! Keep your voice down... We need to think of a way to catch her, but it seems she's very alert. Perhaps we should split up.
Lyney: You two can ride the lift over there and wait up top. I bet that'll be her escape route if she tries to run.
Traveler: Understood.
Lyney: Alright, let's go.
Traveler: Leave it to me.

## Talk 16

Paimon: This is the spot where Lyney wanted us to wait.
Paimon: Oh, look! Isn't that her!?
Traveler: Get ready to stop her!
Paimon: Oh no, did she notice us? She started running the other direction!
Paimon: What should we do? Should we chase her?
Traveler: Our job is to block this path.
Paimon: Ah, you're right. She might also be trying to lure us away.
Black Screen Text: You wait, but there's no sign of the thief...
Paimon: Nothing's happened for a while now. Paimon wonders if Lyney caught the thief...
Traveler: Seems there's no reason for us to stay here.
Paimon: Yeah, let's go.
Traveler: Let's go find Lyney.
Traveler: The rest is up to Lyney.
Traveler: Time to make the arrest!

## Talk 17

Charlotte: Oh! Excuse me, aren't you Great Magician Lyney? And his assistant Lynette!
Lyney: Hello, I don't believe we've—
Charlotte: I'm Charlotte, a reporter for The Steambird.
Lyney: Nice to meet you. From The Steambird, huh? We've often relied on your paper to promote our performances.
Lynette: It's an honor to meet you.
Charlotte: Wait, could that be the legendary traveler who's been making headline after headline in their journey across Teyvat?
Traveler: Uh, I guess you could say that.
Paimon: Amazing, you recognized everybody almost immediately.
Charlotte: Hehe, I wouldn't be much of a reporter if I didn't know who's who, would I?
Charlotte: Wow, today must be my day. Who knew I would end up on the same boat as so many VIPs? Could my Vision finally be showing me some favor?
Paimon: So Charlotte, what do you usually report on?
Charlotte: Well, when there isn't any breaking news, I mainly cover the trials at the opera house...
Charlotte: You can still manage to keep readers' attention as long as you tell things from a clever enough angle, even if it's the same old topics.
Charlotte: For example, reporting on how a scammer once deceived vulnerable girls into relationships, or how a financial criminal was once so poor that they ate a single piece of bread for five days...
Traveler: That... would definitely get my attention.
Charlotte: That's fine and all, but what I'm really after is exclusive, sensational news pieces that could shake the country. These smaller stories are a waste of my talents.
Charlotte: Oh, I just remembered... I've been following a case lately... well, a series of cases, actually...
Lynette: You mean the "serial disappearances of young women" case?
Charlotte: That's right. These stories are the talk of the town right now, and it's probably the most mysterious case we've ever seen.
Charlotte: If I'm the first with a draft ready to publish when the case is finally cracked, and it's the headline story in The Steambird...
Charlotte: When that happens, I bet all the other reporters will shed tears of envy. I've already gathered all kinds of materials, I just can't wait for the truth to be revealed.
Paimon: So what is the "serial disappearances of young women" case? You mean the culprit hasn't been found?
Charlotte: That's right. The first missing girl case happened almost twenty years ago.
Charlotte: And ever since, after a period of time, another girl disappears. What the cases have in common is that the girls are all of a similar age, and that they've all vanished without a trace.
Charlotte: But the scariest part is that to this day, none of the girls have ever been found.
Charlotte: Many suspects have been arrested over the years in connection with this case. But shortly after each arrest, another disappearance would always happen.
Traveler: Then there must be more than one criminal at work.
Charlotte: Yes, it's possible. But either way, I believe that every case has some precise truth behind it, waiting to be exposed.
Lyney: Yes, I agree. And at the very least, the families of those missing girls deserve some sort of explanation.
Lyney: I just imagined for a second what I would do if Lynette were to suddenly disappear... I'd pay any price to get her back and then find a way to track down the culprit.
Lynette: Please don't imagine that, Lyney.
Traveler: Maybe there are copycat criminals?
Traveler: Even I want to read those now...

## Talk 18

Paimon: Hmm? Hey, we're almost there. Look!
Charlotte: Well, I really enjoyed chatting with you. Life should be full of pleasant little surprises like this.
Paimon: Yeah, us as well! The ride went by too quickly.
Charlotte: Ah! I have an interview to get to. I should get going before I'm late.
Paimon: Okay, Paimon hopes we can chat again soon, Charlotte. See ya!
Charlotte: Hehe, bye now. Be sure to stop by and see me at The Steambird when you have time!
Paimon: What a tough job... always running around and interviewing everyone. Well, where should we go now?
Lyney: If you don't mind, how about we stop by my home first? Besides, I still have all the materials we collected.
Paimon: Sure, we wouldn't mind at all. This city is so huge, Paimon wouldn't know where to start anyway.

## Talk 19

Traveler: Leave

## Talk 20

Bulletin Board: Wanted: Name unknown. Seeking any and all relevant information.
Bulletin Board: Male, Fontainian. One leg is a prosthetic replacement. Known alias: Mr. Sawleg. Has conducted illegal performances at Romaritime Station, resulting in a disruption of public order.
Bulletin Board: Rewards are available for information leading to the capture of this individual. If you have any related information, please contact the Maison Gardiennage.

## Talk 21

Lyney: Are you sure that's all she took? You should check to make sure you're not missing anything else.
Lectoure: No, that was all. I can't thank you enough, I didn't notice a thing earlier.
Lectoure: Anyway, I should be going now. Thanks again.
Paimon: Oh, were you returning what the thief had stolen?
Lyney: That's right, pity I wasn't able to catch her. She distracted me by dropping the things she stole on the ground. By the time I looked back, she was already gone.
Lynette: I saw the general direction she went, but Lyney twisted his ankle, and I needed to make sure he was okay.
Paimon: Oh? Did you get hurt, Lyney?
Lyney: I'll be alright. It's just a twisted ankle, that's all. In fact, it's feeling better already.
Lynette: If you want to play at being a hero, at least try not to get hurt doing it. Imagine what would happen if you managed to derail our performance as a result.
Lyney: Haha... You're right, you're right! Sorry, Lynette.
Lyney: *sigh* I have to admit, that thief was even more skilled than I had anticipated.
Lyney: But at least we were able to get the stolen items back, so it wasn't a complete failure.
Paimon: What a slippery little thief... Guess things turned out alright in the end though. Lyney's initiative paid off!
Lyney: Alright, let's put this little detour behind us. We should go to the Court of Fontaine now.

## Talk 25

Paimon: Sure, we wouldn't mind at all. This city is so huge, Paimon wouldn't know where to start anyway.

## Talk 26

Paimon: So we ride this thing to go into the city? What an ingenious way to get around... People in Fontaine really know how to use water.
Lyney: This is an "aquabus." It allows people to travel between several key locations around Fontaine.
Lyney: It's pretty convenient, but the ride can become a little dull after a while... the scenery is always the same. That's why it's better to travel with friends.
Lynette: So you mean it's still boring even when I'm riding with you?
Lyney: Ah, no, that's not what I meant. It's just that, uh... Well, you don't really talk that much.
Lyney: Besides, it doesn't really feel like a real trip when it's just the two of us. It's the same as being at home, haha.
Lynette: Whatever.
Paimon: Guess that's what it's like to be an older brother...
Lyney: Hehe, it's about time for us to leave. Let's get onboard.
Charlotte: Oh! Excuse me, aren't you Great Magician Lyney? And his assistant Lynette!
Lyney: Hello, I don't believe we've—
