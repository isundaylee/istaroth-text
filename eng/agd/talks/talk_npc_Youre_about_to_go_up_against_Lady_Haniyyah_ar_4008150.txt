Hardy Two-Blades: You're... about to go up against Lady Haniyyah, aren't you?
Traveler: What is it?
Paimon: We're also feeling a little heavy about what happened with Haniyyah, so be careful of what you say next... We might get angry...
Hardy Two-Blades: I don't have the right to make any comments about you guys right now. It's just that... I saw the match between Lady Haniyyah and "Fried Tofu With All the Frills."
Hardy Two-Blades: I think something's changed inside Lady Haniyyah... This is the first time I've seen her like this. It's really quite... something.
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon has been wanting to say this to you. How could you have thought Haniyyah was a cold person? That's very disrespectful!
Paimon: You've barely spoken to her, let alone understand her! For example, Paimon doesn't know you very well, but solely from your appearance, Paimon is going to assume that you're...
Paimon: An idiot who would get drunk and dance around the bonfire with your swords in your hands and a burnt mushroom kebab in your mouth, and trip over yourself before falling face down into a pile of mud!
Paimon: Then Paimon would go around telling everyone about it. Wouldn't you get mad if you knew about what Paimon was doing?
Hardy Two-Blades: Silver Companion! How... How did you know all that!?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ...
Hardy Two-Blades: But you do make a point... It's true that I don't know how Lady Haniyyah is as a person... I may have caused her quite a bit of unnecessary trouble...
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have commented on how Lady Haniyyah is as a person... I'm sorry!
Traveler: Wow, Paimon actually got to the big guy!
Paimon: You may be overreacting a little... Paimon learned this from Miko and Layla!
Paimon: Anyways, it's good that you know what you did wrong. Just make sure you don't do it again!
Traveler: Paimon is amazing!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hardy Two-Blades: See you... I need to reflect on this a little more...
