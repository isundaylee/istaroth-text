## Talk 1

Chuno: Hmm, if I had enough samples, I could...
Paimon: Huh, would you look at that? Some strange guy's mumbling over here...
Chuno: Me? You can find people like me everywhere in Natlan. If anyone's strange here, it's you... If there's nothing else, please don't interrupt my research.
Chuno: My expenses this month exceeded estimates, so I have to make up the shortfall by solving some of the Association's research bounties.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon didn't know you could get paid to do research...
Chuno: That's the sort of organization the Saurian Relics Association is. Mora is how you encourage research into all manner of topics.
Chuno: This time, I'm going to take on the deciphering of Iridescent Inscriptions... It's said that this great work has never been completed, and the Mora to be had is most sizable indeed...
Chuno: It's just that...
Paimon: That what?
Chuno: I'll need enough inscription fragments to perform this task.
Chuno: Hmm... How about this? If you could bring me Iridescent Inscription fragments, I'll pay you. How's that sound?
Chuno: I mean, you look like seasoned adventurers. I'm sure you get such commissions all the time, don't you?
Paimon: Well, sure, we could help you. But haven't you run your monthly expenses into the ground already...?
Chuno: Well, since we're over budget, it doesn't matter how far over we are... But that'll stop being a problem if I get those fragments and decipher them — I guarantee it!
Traveler: We'll only be finding those fragments...
Chuno: Not to worry. All you have to do is ensure that you find me "genuine" goods. And I do mean that — just thinking of how some huckster sold me some fake items from the "Remnants of the Secret Source"... Why, it makes my blood boil!
Chuno: That was no small sum of Mora I forfeited in that transaction...
Paimon: Ah, so that's how you burst your budget...
Chuno: And precisely why I need to make a comeback using these inscriptions!
Chuno: So, please! I'm counting on you to find those fragments! Find and bring them to me, would you kindly?
Chuno: I don't even need that many. Just... three? No, four! I mean, I couldn't afford to pay for more...
Traveler: No guarantees that they'll be useful to you...

## Talk 2

Chuno: So, have you found those Iridescent Inscription fragments...?

## Talk 3

Chuno: Haha! Good, good! I'll crack the code on the Inscriptions' golden patterns soon enough... and then... The reward shall be mine!
Chuno: Not that I have a choice — if I fail again, I'll be out of funds, so it's sink or swim for me!
Chuno: Ah, right. Here's your payment, by the by.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Chuno: Ah, it's you! Thanks for bringing me those inscription fragments.
Chuno: Still, the progress I'm making deciphering them is... worrisome. Their similarities to Phlogiston Engravings are merely ostensible — the complexity therein is far greater than I had imagined...
Chuno: But there's no going back now, so... I've gotta get this done either way, hahaha!
