## Talk 1

"Boatman": The near side of the river, hey! The cypress painted silver, hoi! The silver wormwood on the ground, the silver stones lie all around...
Traveler: Excuse me...
"Boatman": Oho, who have we here? Guests? Here to board the boat, perhaps?
"Boatman": Ai yai yai, but let's see, now let's see... Oh, you seem like outsiders. That won't do, no, that won't do...
Traveler: "That won't do"?
"Boatman": The shining silver skiff sails soft to yonder moon, but it was not prepared for you, oh no! Step not aboard, soil not the decks...
"Boatman": Ai yai yai... The fog is long scattered, and long scattered is the fog! Yet who has not boarded? The lady of the golden hall shall be angry. Most angry...
Traveler: Boat...? Where's the boat?
"Boatman": Aha, a-hey... The silver skiff, scion of sun and slope, hey! All must come home, all must return, to the moon-mansion that golden burns...
"Boatman": But for shame, for shame! Some children have lost their way, and still they have not boarded! The lady she shall be angry. Oh, most, most angry...
Traveler: Do you need any help?
"Boatman": Come, come, board the boat, the boat it is for boarding! Wander not, be lost no more, for life no longer mourning...
Traveler: Are you listening to me?
Traveler: What are you talking about?
Traveler: Who are you?

## Talk 2

"Boatman": Now I spy, with my little eye... A grandmother missing her grandchildren. She cannot put them down, no she cannot, and she cannot board the boat!

## Talk 3

"Boatman": I spy the dear little children, who dearly miss their grandmother. A shame yes, a pity indeed, that they cannot board the boat.

## Talk 4

"Boatman": Ah, there, yes there too indeed. One who has grown too swift and wild, but whose soul is yet that of a child. One playful in a funny way, who forgot to board the boat today...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

"Boatman": The silver shining moon, yah-hey, the silver gleaming hearts, yah-ho... Those who guard the foggy plain, fain not in yon misty woods remain. Aye, board the boat, yes, board the boat!

### Additional Talk 2

"Boatman": Ye old who linger on things yet strange and new, let us return, let us return, to the golden halls upon the moon.

### Additional Talk 3

"Boatman": The child who picks shells by the shore, come, board the boat! The brother you knew has left his forebears' souls to seek a life on the far shore. Forget him now, forget the pain of parting...

### Additional Talk 4

"Boatman": And you, child lingering by the shore, pray, what more have you lost? Come, now, board quickly now, be not nostalgia-crossed.

### Additional Talk 5

"Boatman": They have all come, ya-ho, ya-hey, we have our merry cast...
"Boatman": Thank you, fair outlander, ho! We set off now at last...
"Boatman": The far side of the river, hey! The golden oak is yonder, hoi! The golden wormwood on the ground, the golden stones lie all around...
"Boatman": The sights are lovely as can be, much further than the eye can see...

### Additional Talk 6

"Boatman": Lost, lonely, little child, are you playing on your own? Come now, come sail away, to a land where none play alone.
