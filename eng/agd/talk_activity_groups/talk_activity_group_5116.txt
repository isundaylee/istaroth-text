## Talk

Lisa: Hey cutie, we meet again.
Traveler: This place sure wasn't easy to find.
Lisa: Oh, really? I used to live in Sumeru City and now that I'm back, I can't help but want to visit these small, remote shops.
Lisa: It's a pity that my old favorite clothing shop has already been closed for some time.
Lisa: I wanted to buy some accessories and clothes to give to the other ladies in the Knights of Favonius. Hmm... what a pity.
Traveler: I see you bought some new clothes.
Lisa: I was wondering when you would notice. Well, what do you think?
Traveler: It's classy.
Lisa: It's always nice to hear compliments from other people, especially you. Thank you, cutie.
Lisa: I managed to find the owner of that old clothing shop and had it custom tailored.
Lisa: Wearing it reminds me of my days at the Akademiya. What a busy time that was for me...
Lisa: However, my researchers were never lazy, unlike the people who borrow books and don't return them. Now that I think of it, punishing them with a zap of Electro may have still been too lenient...
Traveler: Very elegant.
Traveler: Your new outfit looks great.

## Talk

Lisa: Ah, it's you, cutie. I knew we'd cross paths again.
Traveler: What are you looking at, Lisa?
Lisa: Oh, just these painted utensils in this shop, aren't they exquisite? I'm thinking about buying some to take back for decoration.
Lisa: And those plates... if we serve tea on them, Jean wouldn't be able to resist, even in the middle of work.
Traveler: I don't think those are for sale.
Lisa: Oh, not for sale? Honestly, why put it in the shop if you don't intend to sell it?
Lisa: How disappointing! Ah, they're so beautiful, too...
Traveler: I think those are only for display.

## Talk

Lisa: Hey cutie, are you here at the Grand Bazaar to catch some performances?
Traveler: Do you like the performances here?
Lisa: Yes, they are quite amusing. I even wonder if I should start taking notes on the formats of some of the programs. Who knows? Perhaps it'll come in handy for the next Ludi Harpastum.
Lisa: Kaeya could take charge of the jokes, but dancing might prove to be a little tricky.
Traveler: Have you seen the dancing here before?
Lisa: Yes, there was a lovely girl with red hair dancing yesterday. I had a front row seat, it was really something.
Lisa: I can't help but wonder how great it would be to see similar performances in Mondstadt.
Traveler: You just have to convince Nilou to perform in Mondstadt.
Lisa: Actually, I think the biggest challenge would be to get Eula, Captain of the Reconnaissance Company, to show some interest in dancing, as well as to find a beautiful outfit she would agree to wear.
Traveler: So you're trying to get Eula involved?
Lisa: Eula is surprisingly gullible when it comes to certain things. Rather than inviting the performers to Mondstadt, it would be easier to trick... ah, I mean, ask her to dance.
Traveler: That might be a challenge.

## Talk

Lisa: Hey! What are you doing around the Akademiya?
Traveler: Are you on your way into the Akademiya?
Lisa: Actually, I was just leaving.
Lisa: I had a reunion with Professor Cyrus and some fellow apprentices, as well as other researchers that I worked with in the past.
Lisa: How time flies! I could tell just from their appearances that they've been really busy.
Lisa: I, on the other hand, have had it pretty easy. Hahaha... they must be so jealous.
Lisa: That being said, since I've already indulged so much, I should probably eat less cake next month.
Traveler: Oh, so you were on your way out, then?
Lisa: Mm-hmm, and that's when I ran into you.

## Talk

Lisa: Its name is Sag? Oh, what a nice puppy.
Traveler: Do you like search and rescue dogs?
Lisa: Of course. I love obedient puppies, especially the ones that let you rub their belly and look at you with their little sparkling eyes.
Lisa: Actually, I've always wanted to get a dog. Not only could it help keep me in a good mood, but it could also intimidate others when need be.
Lisa: But if I got a dog, it'd be too much hassle to groom it and clean up after it all the time.
Lisa: That's the trouble with pets. I suppose I'm not really suited to have one.

## Talk

Traveler: About the lady beside you...
Amir: Hey, keep it down! You mean that lady over there named Lisa?
Amir: Lisa... Lisa, what a beautiful, elegant name.
Amir: Too bad you didn't see it. She spoke to me just now, asking about Sag's name, hehe...
Amir: She also seems to have a love for animals. But she doesn't seem to know how to deal with them.
Amir: I could tell by the way she had just touched Sag, but it doesn't matter. I can teach her.
Amir: We could raise lots of dogs together...
Amir: ...
Amir: (He gets lost in thought talking to himself.)

## Talk

Collei: Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
Traveler: Greetings.
Collei: #It's Traveler! Whatcha doing here?
Traveler: Here to see you, Collei.
Lisa: Do you come to visit Collei often, cutie?
Collei: #He's amazing. All of us in Gandharva Ville already have a lot to thank him for.
Traveler: Collei and I are very good friends.
Lisa: Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
Collei: And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
Collei: Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
Collei: Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Kaeya? Oh, and Jean?
Lisa: Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
Lisa: Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
Traveler: And we meet again, Lisa.

## Talk

Collei: Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
Traveler: Greetings.
Lisa: I came here to visit an old friend, but I had no idea that she'd already become a Trainee Forest Ranger.
Collei: Hehe, it's nothing, really. I just wanted to help out Master Tighnari.
Lisa: Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
Collei: And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
Collei: Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
Collei: Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Jean? Oh, and Kaeya...
Lisa: Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
Lisa: Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
Traveler: And we meet again, Lisa.

## Talk

Gafoor: We need more manpower. How are we supposed to manage with so few people? You know what? Just do as much as you can.
Traveler: About Lisa...
Gafoor: So you guys met Lisa in Mondstadt? Are you sure she's just a plain old librarian?
Traveler: Yes, what's so strange about that?
Gafoor: I didn't think there was anything about that backwater that would attract her there. Such a waste of talent.
Gafoor: ... Okay, I know you're Lisa's friend, and I'm not gonna talk to her about that again, so stop giving me that dirty look.
Gafoor: I was kind enough to offer her a chance, but she didn't seem keen. Fine by me, I guess.
Traveler: About Spantamad...
Gafoor: Yes, we carry out regular monitoring of the workings of Ley Lines. This is one of our fundamental research principles.
Gafoor: There are not enough talented folk who are professional and can independently undertake the work of exploring the Ley Lines. I've long said that we should allocate more people to come here...
Gafoor: Alas, I can't find any researchers, so I have to recruit willing volunteers.
Traveler: Farewell.
Gafoor: It's up to you to explore and clean up this Domain.
