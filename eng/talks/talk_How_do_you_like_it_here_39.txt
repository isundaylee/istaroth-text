Traveler: How do you like it here?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I felt a little like a fish out of water when I first arrived.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I mean... After years of studying the art of war, I can't help but consider all the strategic points upon arriving in a new place like this.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Where would the enemy troops set up camp? From which direction could they mount an assault? And what strategies should we implement to counter these factors?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We need a barricade here... another sentry tower there... I began to instinctively consider all these things when I first arrived here.
Traveler: It's quite safe inside the Serenitea Pot, you know.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... Yes, I eventually realized that I was overthinking things.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: After residing here for a while, I've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If you ask me, I would say this is almost an ideal place. I can easily separate myself from the outside world and enjoy some time to myself...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, but could I rent a room to use as a command post? I need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.
Traveler: Of course you can.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Splendid. I would certainly like to stay here for some time. I can just lay on my bed and enjoy my strategy books, far from the pressures of social interaction.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll finally have all the energy I need every day. Mm, just thinking about it makes me happy.
Traveler: But, won't you feel lonely?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps, if I'm all alone.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But, you'll still be here, correct?
