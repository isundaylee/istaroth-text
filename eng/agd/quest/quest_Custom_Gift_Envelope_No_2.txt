# Custom Gift Envelope No. 2


## Talk 1

Kujou Sara: Hmm, I should probably take a look at the other envelopes first...
Kujou Sara: #Oh, Traveler! It's been a while... Why do you look so surprised?
Traveler: I just didn't expect...
Kujou Sara: To see a warrior like me enjoying Lantern Rite?
Traveler: I don't think I've ever seen you relax...
Kujou Sara: The Tenryou Commission bears a great responsibility to the people. As a member, I cannot afford to relax most of the time.
Kujou Sara: Perhaps people think of me as a single-minded warrior, completely out of place in a festive and refined neighborhood like Hanamizaka.
Kujou Sara: But, letting down my guard means allowing crime to slip through... That is not only a detriment to my duty but to the atmosphere of Hanamizaka as a whole.
Kujou Sara: The most I can do is take advantage of any spare moment that comes my way.
Kujou Sara: Ah, apologies. I shouldn't talk about such serious matters during the holidays.
Kujou Sara: I'm trying to make a gift envelope, but it's not quite coming together. Perhaps you could give me some advice?
Traveler: Sure, let me think about it for a second...
