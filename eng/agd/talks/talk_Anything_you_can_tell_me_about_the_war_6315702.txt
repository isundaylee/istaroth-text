Traveler: Anything you can tell me about the war?
Ono: It's all because of the people from Sangonomiya. Not only do they not worship the Electro Archon, they even disobeyed the Almighty Shogun and stirred up this conflict.
Ono: If they would just give up their Visions or whatever, we wouldn't have to fight this war and I could return to the city. I could really use a cold one at the Uyuu Restaurant.
Ono: *sigh* War is just bad all around.
