Traveler: What's on your mind?
Tang Wen: I'm thinking of the current situation of Inazuma and the Raiden Shogun's policies...
Tang Wen: I couldn't return to my hometown to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree, but somehow, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, I'm so sorry. I forgot to mention that I'm a historian from Liyue. Although I can't go home for now, I did get a chance to document the change of policy in Inazuma. It's been such a blessing in disguise.
Tang Wen: Hmm... About these policies. I still cannot come up with a final conclusion. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must document it completely first.
Tang Wen: Therefore, I have decided to stay here for a while and witness future developments in Inazuma.
