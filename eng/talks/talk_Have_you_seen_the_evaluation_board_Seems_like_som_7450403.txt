# Talk Dialog

Arbon: Have you seen the evaluation board? Seems like someone likes those clockwork penguins.
Alberre: I saw it. It's the one that talks about wanting to get to know Freminet, right? Sounds like someone who would like to strike up some further collaboration, if you ask me.
Traveler: Freminet?
Arbon: Oh, we're talking about those clockwork penguins on that table. A diver named Freminet made them, and he then placed them in our store as a consignment.
Alberre: He's a good lad with a pretty face. Soft-spoken fellow, but he's very good at making toys.
Arbon: He seems a little melancholy, though. Like someone who lacks something that should've belonged to him...
Alberre: I know that look, y'know â€” it's the same one that Arbon makes when he looks at his empty wallet. Don't suppose Freminet's in need of Mora, do you?
Arbon: Don't be ridiculous. He didn't even discuss the profit-split when he came to talk about the consignment. He wasn't in it for the Mora.
Alberre: True. But what else would trouble a lad of his age?
Arbon: Yeah, and he's a winsome fellow, too. I haven't seen the boss ever approve of a consignment.
Arbon: He not only offered to set up an outdoor stall for the penguins, but even proposed a fifty-fifty split on the earnings.
Alberre: Unfortunately, one could only call the sales middling. Many people came to look, sure, but there weren't many buyers.
Alberre: That toy is very intricately designed, but I'd say that also makes it harder to play with... and harder to fix.
Arbon: Really, I didn't expect that anyone would leave a message about it on the board. Maybe there's a big client behind it, eh?
Alberre: Either way, we should tell the boss about it. Won't do to miss out on a good deal, you know?
Traveler: Clockwork penguins?
