Traveler: Sorry, I was in a hurry...
Sandino: Huh? Why are you apologizing?
Sandino: Ah, you misunderstand. I'm not blaming you for scaring the fish away, sorry about that.
Sandino: It's my grandchild who's always running around the place — neither fish nor birds will stick around upon seeing him.
Sandino: I'm used to it, though. I love fishing for it requires patience and allows for quiet consideration — the fish not being around is unimportant.
Sandino: Cava's parents don't really accompany him at all, so the fact that he can play by himself is already quite a relief.
