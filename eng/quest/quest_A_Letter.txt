# A Letter


## Talk 1

Choiseul: ...Just like I stressed before, dear Gestionnaire, that's how the procedure goes and there's nothing I can do.
Choiseul: Mr. Roialte did send the list of required documents and I do have them ready.
Choiseul: However, you can't simply come over and take any document. That does not conform with our letter delivery regulations.
Traveler: Huh? Iaune!
Paimon: Hi, Iaune. You're looking good!
Iaune: You as well. It's all thanks to the help I've received from Mr. Roialte and Mr. Semaine.
Choiseul: #You know {NICKNAME} too, Iaune?
Iaune: #Of course. {NICKNAME} did me a huge favor before. Without {M#him}{F#her}, I wouldn't still be working at the Maison Gestion.
Choiseul: #Really? No wonder {NICKNAME} is an Honorary Senior Researcher of the Institute, hahahaha!
Traveler: I'm very good at providing moral support.
Iaune: Regardless, without your support, I'm sure... I couldn't have made it...
Iaune: I believe I heard Mr. Choiseul call you an Honorary Senior Researcher of the Institute just now?
Traveler: Bingo. I even have the certificate.
Paimon: And a photo! Paimon's in it, too, but Paimon didn't get a certificate...
Choiseul: #Yes, in recognition of {NICKNAME}'s merits and achievements, the Institute has granted {M#him}{F#her} the title of Honorary Senior Researcher.
Choiseul: #As for what those "achievements" are... I'll let {M#him}{F#her} speak for {M#himself}{F#herself}. Let's talk business first.
Choiseul: I really cannot hand that document to you right now, Iaune.
Choiseul: But as for what you asked earlier that you'd like a researcher to guide you over and take some pictures near the Institute... That's no problem at all!
Choiseul: #I think {NICKNAME} might just be suited to the job. {M#He}{F#She} knows the surroundings like the back of {M#his}{F#her} hand, and shall be more than equal to the task.
Choiseul: #What do you say, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: No problem. Leave it to me.
Iaune: You're so kind. As long as you're there, it should be fine. When I came, all I saw were out-of-control meka and monsters...
Iaune: But taking pictures isn't the priority here. Truth be told, Mr. Choiseul...
Choiseul: I'd love to help you too, Iaune, but the procedure is procedure and my hands are tied. Please don't make it hard on a lowly public official who only knows how to stamp documents.
Iaune: All right, I'll discuss this with Mr. Roialte later, after I return...
Iaune: Goodbye, Mr. Choiseul. Have a nice day.
Choiseul: Thank you. I hope you enjoy your time at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Iaune: #It's your turn to be the guide now, {NICKNAME}. Why don't we go to the Mary-Ann Memorial Park first?
Traveler: I'm happy to help Iaune out.
Traveler: All I did was fix the Autostamper 3000.
Traveler: Then I'll fly over here with you later.
Iaune: #{NICKNAME}! So glad to see you. What luck!

## Talk 2

Iaune: Uh, is this the Mary-Ann Memorial Park? I can't tell it's a park at all...
Iaune: Mr. Roialte will be disappointed. He was hoping to have someone make a speech here.
Iaune: Looking around, a speech is out of the question. There's not even an iconic landmark here, and it's not good for group photos.
Traveler: You can take some meka back with you as a memento.
Iaune: You're funny, but there's no room in the Maison Gestion for such things.
Iaune: And even if I could, I'd still have to have the meka appraised, reported, categorized, then stored...
Paimon: Hey! We're only joking. No need to get so focused on work all of a sudden...
Iaune: Speaking of reports... I still can't get that document. Mr. Roialte will be disappointed again...
Traveler: Is Choiseul making it difficult for you?
Iaune: Not exactly. My request was not quite by-the-book, so it's no surprise that he rejected it.
Iaune: As you may know, the Institute is making plans to rebuild, right? Certain resources and personnel arrangements have to be made through the Maison Gestion.
Iaune: The Maison Gestion takes this matter very seriously, so it had Mr. Roialte select a team to conduct field studies in and around the vicinity.
Iaune: Therefore, Mr. Roialte stayed behind at the Maison Gestion to do the head count, while I am to visit the Institute to coordinate the reception.
Iaune: It happens that the Institute has a letter for the Maison Gestion, so I thought since I'm here already, I might as well bring it back with me...
Iaune: But Mr. Choiseul insisted it was a violation of proper procedure and simply would not give it to me.
Paimon: Violation of procedure? What procedure?
Traveler: There are proper procedures for picking up a document?
Paimon: Uh, don't tell Paimon there's gonna be running around for approvals, signatures, and listening to bureaucrats babble on endlessly as well...
Iaune: Simply put, most official correspondence within the Maison Gestion must be mailed.
Paimon: What? Then... What if the departments mailing the letter are on the same street, or even right across from each other?
Iaune: Yes, you still have to mail it. That's for the purpose of being "traceable."
Traveler: Gestionnaires sure aren't afraid of work.
Iaune: I suppose everyone is just used to it all by now...
Iaune: Never mind, let's just go to the next spot. Let me check the memo Mr. Roialte left for me... Uh...
Iaune: This place is called... the Institute's Academic Assembly Hall. Strange... I didn't see any buildings with such a sign when I came.
Traveler: I know where it is, just follow me.
Iaune: I knew I could depend on you! What would I do without you?
Iaune: Let's hurry, then. There might be more out-of-control meka around here...
Traveler: What were you and Choiseul discussing back there?

## Talk 3

Iaune: Is this the Academic Assembly Hall?
Iaune: I admit, the structure does look like a hall, but what's academic about it?
Traveler: The academic part is in the researchers' heads.
Iaune: All right, good thing I didn't come for anything academic today. Anyway, the building seems relatively... intact.
Traveler: Intact is all it has left.
Iaune: Ahem! Come on, let's look around. I think this place is perfect for a group photo.
Iaune: I should go find a good vantage point so I won't be at a complete loss if Mr. Roialte grills me.
Iaune: #Please take a few pictures for me too, {NICKNAME}. I heard you're a good photographer, certainly better than me!
Traveler: I got this.
Traveler: The rocks aren't academic, that's for sure.

## Talk 4

Iaune: This one isn't bad... Have you finished taking pictures yet?
Traveler: Yes.
Traveler: Almost.
Iaune: Once you're done, please show them to me.

## Talk 5

Iaune: Oh my... Too high, far too high!
Traveler: Are you describing the Institute's academic level?
Iaune: No, I'm marveling at the height of this place! Though the Institute's academics were certainly up there too...
Iaune: But now... *sigh* Who could've foreseen so many hardships for the Institute? And who knows how smooth the reconstruction will be...
Iaune: The last stop is... The Fontaine Research Institute Qualifications Review Representative Office.
Traveler: All in one breath, impressive.
Iaune: Thank you. But where is it? I didn't notice any such office in the Institute.
Traveler: Is Desnos in charge of the office?
Iaune: Yes! That's right! You know even this place? I shouldn't be surprised that the Honorary Senior Researcher knows everything about the Institute!
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers now! Is it that office in the ruins? If you can count that as an office...
Iaune: Maybe Mr. Desnos shortened the name to make it easy for you to understand.
Iaune: Please lead the way. I have to get some files from Mr. Desnos too. Once I have them, I can return to the Maison Gestion.
Iaune: It's been such an uneventful day today. I should be able to go back and relax soon. The Fontaine Research Institute sure does things differently from... Ahem, I didn't say a thing.

## Talk 6

Desnos: O Archons save me, may no more meka cause trouble... What are you doing here, Iaune?
Iaune: Mr. Roialte has sent me here to conduct an inspection, so I thought I'd drop by and bring you some coffee.
Iaune: But I have to say that your working environment is indeed... quite difficult. I thought this "office" would at least have an actual room.
Desnos: Thank you for the coffee, my dear Iaune. As for the work environment... I'm content with what I have. Look around, at least I'm working under an intact ceiling.
Traveler: Are you still in charge of the qualifications review?
Desnos: #{NICKNAME}! No... I should call you Honorary Senior Researcher! Glad to see you.
Desnos: And what's with that sad look, Iaune?
Iaune: *sigh*... It's like this...
Black Screen Text: With a long face, Iaune recounts all that has happened...
Desnos: Hmm... Is the correspondence some sort of classified document?
Iaune: It can't be. Replies like this are typically in the vein of "Got it," "I have no questions," "I don't know," or something similar...
Iaune: At most, it's copied to different departments to let them know it's something they should care about.
Desnos: Oh, no wonder I got a copy of the letter too... Have a look, is this it?
Iaune: What!? But Mr. Choiseul clearly said he hadn't mailed it yet!
Iaune: ...Oh, he must've meant that the external letters haven't been sent out yet.
Traveler: Once more, he failed to tell the whole story.
Paimon: People from the Institute are really good at getting under your skin, huh...
Desnos: Judging from your reaction, this must be the document you wanted. I've read it several times already, myself.
Traveler: This is identical to the document you wanted.
Desnos: #Very astute, {NICKNAME}. I'm sure all the letters that Choiseul sent out are the same, Iaune.
Desnos: Why don't you just take my copy back with you?
Paimon: Wait, what? If Iaune takes it, then won't you have lost yours?
Desnos: Hahahaha, look at me! Nobody will care if someone in my position accidentally loses a nonessential letter.
Traveler: Not a bad idea.
Desnos: See, Iaune, I'm not just mooching coffee off you!
Iaune: No, Monsieur, I cannot do that. It's against regulations. I'll go back and wait for the official letter to be delivered.
Desnos: My dear Iaune, think outside the box, don't be a fool! Why must you insist on making it hard for yourself?
Desnos: Who knows when that letter will get to you! The sooner you get it, the sooner you can start working and settle all that mess.
Iaune: No, Monsieur. Thank you, but I will not violate regulations. My duty as a civil servant demands it.
Iaune: #{NICKNAME}, Mr. Desnos, and Paimon, I must leave now. Mr. Roialte is still waiting for me to report back.
Black Screen Text: Iaune walks away with solemn, heavy steps...
Desnos: *sigh* Iaune can be such a fool. His brains have gone all rotten, haven't they?
Desnos: Everyone else tries to make things easier for themselves, yet he insists on going through the motions, even for small things like this.
Traveler: That's just his character.
Desnos: Admirable, yet scary at the same time. No wonder he has few friends in the Maison Gestion other than Roialte and Semaine.
Traveler: I'm his friend too.
Paimon: So is Paimon, so is Paimon!
Desnos: That's good. You should be around him more often. I feel Iaune's nerves are getting more and more frayed by the day...
Desnos: As for the letter, I'll see what I can do. I'll pay Mr. Choiseul a visit and ask him to let me mail them out.
Desnos: If he agrees, I'll send one to Iaune as quickly as possible.
Desnos: *sigh* It takes a lot of effort to be friends with a fool...
Traveler: That's just the person Iaune is.
Traveler: That does solve the problem, doesn't it?

Choiseul: Raimondo still isn't back yet... What is he up to?
