Quezhi: Oh, forgive me. According to Ms. Vert Jr.'s suggestion, a more elegant name for it would be... a simple meal.
Quezhi: Indeed! It's a simple meal for those coming and going on business!
Quezhi: Of course, we serve regular lunch and dinner as well. However, we usually don't serve them in our outdoor dining area.
