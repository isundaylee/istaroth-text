# Missing title (706651223)


## Talk 1

Abe: Hey! I'm over here, you know?
Abe: Young people these days... Don't you kids have any kind of courtesy at all?
Traveler: S—Sorry!
Abe: Hmph! That's more like it. As for those mushrooms, let's just call that my gift... But don't you touch the rest however you like!
Traveler: Are these your mushrooms?
Abe: None of your business! Just stop picking them however you like and get out of here!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Eek! That guy just now... Did you see that!?
Traveler: Nope.
Paimon: Uhh, that's just too spooky. Let's just grab a few mushrooms and get out of here, shall we?
Traveler: Must've been an illusion.

## Talk 3

Abe: Hey! Hey! Didn't I warn you lot before!? Are you hard of hearing, or do you just not have eyes, huh?
Traveler: Oh, look, a ghost!
Abe: Eek! Ghost? Where? Where!?
Traveler: Right here.
Abe: Aaaagh! Go! Shoo! Evil begone! By my clan's name, Abe, depart from this place!
Abe: ...What? N—No! That can't be! I've... I've never encountered such a wicked spirit in all my years! Wh—Why aren't you leaving?
Traveler: Why, I've come from beyond this island.
Abe: An evil spirit from beyond the Sea of Fog? I—I'm not afraid of you! Just you wait! Th—The Great Thunderbird will exorcise you!
Traveler: Your Thunderbird is long gone.
Abe: Wh—What did you say?
Traveler: Everyone's left.
Abe: What... What are you saying? D—Don't you try to scare me like that. Ohhh, I—I'm getting goosebumps already...
Abe: Still, there have been fewer and fewer people on the island lately. Kina also told me that everyone was getting onboard the boat... *sigh* Who knows where that kid's run off to now...
Abe: Wait a moment. Spirit from beyond this island... Aren't you leaving too? On the silver boat by the seashore?
Traveler: I saw no boat there.
Abe: Huh... I knew it. I knew outsiders wouldn't be able to see that boat.
Abe: Still, thanks for telling me to get onboard, evil spirit. It's... It's just that I've lived here for so long, and yet there's so much I still haven't seen or done... I can't just leave this place!
Traveler: What will you need?
Abe: Need? Eh? I mean, it's not as if I need anything. I'd just like to see something new, you know?
Abe: Once, when I was still very young, I made a bet with Una that there were different kinds of mushrooms outside our island, but she wouldn't believe me.
Abe: Later, her husband went out to sea, leaving for lands where the outsiders live. He never returned, and they say his spirit wanders the lands beyond... Poor guy.
Abe: Una's been living alone ever since then. Every time I think about it, I... *sigh*
Traveler: Don't worry about her too much.
Abe: I even begged the priest, you know? At the very least, we had to give someone a place to stay... Ah, right, right! The mushrooms!
Abe: *cough* Well, I'll be boarding the boat soon, and I don't really have that many regrets... I just haven't seen anything that lies beyond our island. Still, that which concerns me most has to be those mushrooms I take care of every day...
Abe: Please, help me bring back some mushrooms from beyond the Sea of Fog. I'd love to see what they look like!
Abe: Please help me, evil outsider spirit!
Traveler: So about the mushrooms...
Traveler: That ship was not made to bear me hence.
Traveler: It's time to leave.
Traveler: The Sea of Fog is a thing of the past.
Traveler: That's me!

## Talk 4

Abe: How's it going? I'm ready and waiting to have my horizons broadened!
Traveler: Will these mushrooms do for you?

## Talk 5

Abe: Ooh! Haha... Wow, they've got such odd shapes! Do they have souls, too? Do they contain peoples' memories?
Abe: And these soft, wing-like things... Can they fly?
Abe: Ah, me and my endless curiosity! The boatman's getting annoyed now, I think. I'm sorry, but I reckon I must go. Yes, I must...
