# Hunters, Prophets


## Talk 1

Paimon: Oh, we're near the Steambird office. Let's go look for Charlotte and have a chat!

## Talk 2

Sedene: Y—You're here! Finally!
Paimon: Uh, is something wrong?
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette and Lady Furina... they seem to have gotten into a dispute! Please, go see for yourself.
Furina: Like I said, I've already explained everything!
Neuvillette: And yet, the problem has not been properly solved. There is little space for excuses between us.
Neuvillette: It is not my intention to offend you, but please, tell me where you stand. You are the Hydro Archon Focalors, are you not?
Neuvillette: Look at this. This is a list of the victims from the recent Poisson incident.
Furina: ...
Furina: Y—You mean... They're all...
Neuvillette: We did not arrive in time to avert this disaster, and I will not have it happen again.
Furina: ...
Neuvillette: I will say this once more. You must tell me everything you know.
Neuvillette: Yesterday, I found three stone slates in some ancient ruins near Poisson. Do you know anything about those?
Furina: ...Seriously? You're questioning me like this is a court case now. I don't know anything about that.
Furina: But... you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
Neuvillette: That's correct, which is why I came to ask you some questions. There should have been four slates, but one of them was missing. The other three feature different images that seem to correlate to the prophecy.
Furina: The prophecy...
Neuvillette: The second of these slates depicts the previous Hydro Archon Egeria kneeling before a floating island in the sky, as if confessing something. Do you know nothing of this, either?
Furina: I don't. I've never seen such slates.
Neuvillette: I'll ask you again... Do you really have no information regarding the previous Archon?
Neuvillette: My deciphering of the slates indicates that the Hydro Archon Egeria once had to confess to, or apologize for, a certain sin. If anyone would know about it, it should be you.
Furina: All gods don't have the same secrets, you know. She was herself, and I'm me. Is it really so strange that I know nothing?
Furina: I understand your concerns, but... I'm sorry. I just don't have anything to tell you.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: Forgive me for saying this now, Lady Furina, but I have long known of your various secret investigations into certain matters.
Neuvillette: There are several indications that you have been investigating the prophecy on the sly.
Neuvillette: This is not strange in itself, considering that you are the Hydro Archon. But it is strange that you also should claim not to know any of Egeria's secrets, as well as do nothing following your inquiries.
Neuvillette: You have never been as superficial as you have presented yourself to be, nor are you a fool. And yet, your behavior is very inconsistent...
Furina: Haha... Hahahaha! So you've been watching me all this time, have you? I didn't think you were that type!
Neuvillette: You...
Furina: Well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know I'm actually working to take care of it.
Furina: There's no point questioning or suspecting me. You're the Iudex, but you're still my subordinate — you should be following my lead.
Furina: Just trust in me, your Archon, and do as I say — never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. It'll all turn out fine.
Furina: ...That's all I have to say. We do not discuss this matter again.
Furina: Ah, the opera's about to start. Toodles!
Neuvillette: ...
Paimon: Did Furina not notice us standing by the door? Wonder what's up with her. She was smiling... Huh, she didn't seem in the mood to care if we were listening in or not...
Traveler: She seems deeply troubled...
Neuvillette: I assume you've been outside for a while now?
Paimon: Oh, you noticed? Seems Furina didn't even realize we were here.
Neuvillette: She was in a great panic, though I cannot discern the reason. Our discussion reached impasses time and again — a state of affairs that we cannot allow to continue.
Neuvillette: Still, I do not understand. Dialogue is the basis for understanding, so why did she keep refusing to engage?
Traveler: I'm afraid questions alone might not suffice...
Traveler: We need to make her understand how dire the situation actually is.
Neuvillette: Everyone in her inner circle has noticed that she is hiding some secret. The issue is her attitude. I fear that she will not reveal anything unless absolutely forced to.
Neuvillette: We may have to create a situation in which she will have no choice but to speak.
Paimon: Oh? Like what?
Neuvillette: Normally, people will only reveal the truth when standing trial. Perhaps we must have the Hydro Archon experience just such a scenario.
Paimon: But Furina's seen so many trials, and she's really good at dodging questions. How do we make sure that she won't just slip away at the first chance she gets?
Neuvillette: We will need to consider this thoroughly, join forces with various parties, and then do what we can.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: If at all possible, I would prefer to recuse myself from this affair, but... We must prevent the prophecy from coming to pass.
Neuvillette: This may be cruel to her, but all Fontaine is in crisis — the "information a god possesses" is too precious, and so we must take a chance on this.
Traveler: In that case, we will need help.
Neuvillette: But who will lend us their aid to do such a thing?
Traveler: Oh, I think I know who to call.
Traveler: She seems to be deliberately hiding something...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Lady Megistus!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's everyone, huh?
Paimon: Speaking of which, it was pretty smart of you to think of hiding here.
Lynette: Poisson was just involved in a disaster, so it's presently devoid of people. That naturally makes it the best choice.
Paimon: And here you are, drinking tea like it's the most natural thing in the world, huh?
Lynette: That's what family should do — sit and enjoy a leisurely time together.
Lyney: Haha. It's nice to enjoy tea here, you know. Care for a cup?
Navia: Ahem! Lend me your ears, everyone... Hmm. Or perhaps one of you might like to start us off? How about you, friend?
Freminet: Uh, me!? N—No, I don't think I can...
Navia: Then, how about you, good sir?
Neuvillette: I fear that I will cause the mood on this boat to become as somber as it is in court...
Navia: Well then, I guess we're lucky we've got a local like me to organize things. Wonderful — the spotlight, at last! I guess I'll be facilitating things from here.
Clorinde: That was a little long-winded, don't you think?
Navia: #Oh, you might be right... Anyway, to cut to the chase, our friend here, {NICKNAME}, has brought us together to discuss something.
Navia: As for what that is... Well, let's start by saying that we'll be pooling our efforts together to create a series of "traps."
Lyney: Oh? How intriguing.
Navia: Well, it's just an expression, really — one that I just learned from Clorinde, and used on the spot... so let's invite her to explain in detail. A round of applause, please!
Clorinde: Huh? Didn't you say that you would be facilitating this?
Navia: Oh, come now, your work doesn't involve much public speaking, right? This is a good chance to practice — you might even pick up some fancy oratory tricks to impress your boss with in the future.
Clorinde: I see. And what does my boss say?
Neuvillette: Ahem... He is glad that you consider him your boss. Do go on.
Clorinde: In that case, do any of you have experience in... hunting?
Lynette: Not that I recall.
Lyney: Freminet and I once used a wooden stick and a basket to catch wild rabbits when we were younger. As for Lynette... Ah right, you were sick that day, weren't you?
Freminet: I've also gone diving to catch some fish before. Does that count?
Clorinde: I'm afraid not. You may or may not have heard, but Fontaine once played host to a group known as the Marechaussee Hunters.
Clorinde: Though that was their name, they did not hunt animals, but rather various monsters left behind by the ancient dynasty of King Remus.
Clorinde: Today, Fontaine's monster population has already thinned greatly, so the Hunters have blended back into society, taking up arms in other lines of work. They even left a unique methodology of hunting in their wake.
Clorinde: A trap comprises of the following components: bait, a trigger, and a containment device. Sometimes, a lethal implement will also be necessary to deal with the prey.
Clorinde: So if we were to build a trap together right now, what would you choose to build it with?
Lyney: For me, I would prefer something basket-shaped. Pigeons and rabbits will see the bait and naturally enter the snare.
Lyney: Our line of work requires a deft hand, and we're some of the best in the industry, so you can count on our techniques.
Navia: You used some of those techniques while moving the people of Poisson, didn't you? My subordinates mentioned that you even performed some magic for the bawling children.
Lyney: Yes, and I even managed to gather some intelligence in the meantime — I'm quite the multitasker if I do say so myself.
Freminet: I'm afraid I can't claim that as my strong suit... I prefer more stable methods, like placing bait in the water and waiting for the fish to come within reach... That's the kind of method I would count on.
Paimon: Hehe, calm and steady — exactly the kind of person who would catch loads of fish.
Lynette: And I can be their assistant.
Clorinde: With discretion, I'm sure.
Navia: Hmm... I'd probably use some sort of mechanical animal. Papa once bought me some small clockwork squirrels, mice, and such. When placed in the forest, they can attract others of their kind.
Navia: I remember that you liked those too, didn't you?
Clorinde: I did, and that would be a good way to go about it. If they're realistic enough, animals of the same kind will follow them all the way to the trap.
Navia: What about you, Monsieur Neuvillette?
Neuvillette: I... fear I do not have any related experience.
Clorinde: That makes sense. You usually solve problems directly, without the use of any such tricks.
Clorinde: But I do have one more question for you, Monsieur.
Clorinde: If we were to create a trap now, how would you design it?
Neuvillette: Hmm, I would like for it to be effective but bring no harm to the prey. A more gentle trap would be ideal.
Clorinde: Kind, as always. However, our intention doesn't necessarily change the containment device and the type of implement we need.
Clorinde: If we wanted to kill the prey in one strike, we would need a powerful implement. However, that also goes for prey that must be captured and safely contained.
Navia: Wait, why's that?
Clorinde: Only a hunter who is a true expert at subduing their prey can snare it without harming it. The line that divides life and death is often exceedingly thin.
Freminet: ...So, are we going hunting together?
Paimon: Uh, we hadn't thought of seeing ourselves as hunters. It kinda works... but maybe it's still not the best metaphor.
Neuvillette: If our means of capturing and dealing with our prey is to put them on trial, then the hunting metaphor is actually quite accurate.
Neuvillette: But we shall require much more courage than any hunter to judge a god — a being whose seat is an exalted throne.
Traveler: That's right.
Lyney: Oh, so that's what is going on... sounds very interesting.
Black Screen Text: Clorinde's hunting metaphor was just that... a metaphor.
You will not call this a "hunt" because that is not what you should do at present, nor has the relationship between you and Furina reached such a dire stage.
Black Screen Text: What you need is simply the secrets she is keeping.
Attempting to take her secrets is an act of sacrilegious disrespect, but must be done to prevent Fontaine from sinking into the waters as foretold in the prophecy.
Black Screen Text: There is neither hunter nor prey, but there must be a "trap."
That is what you will need.

## Talk 5

Mage "N": Ah, so you've caught on.
Mage "N": Just as prophecies are usually only the future as seen from the perspectives of the gods, could things be happening in hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall?
Mage "N": Are the things that you shall see different from the fate that the gods perceive?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Wh—What is she talking about? It all sounds really impressive and important and stuff... but it also sounds kinda scary.
Traveler: (The tea in the teacup is just about gone as well...)
Mage "N": I believe that you understand, right? Some things are insignificant... but others, you must reach out to change.
Mage "N": Ultimately, fate shall serve as your only guide no matter what will happen in Teyvat's future. All you need to do is to play your part.
Mage "N": This was good tea, by the way. Thank you for your hospitality. Well, that'll be all for today.
Paimon: The voice... it's gone.
Traveler: (Mage N... is this the clue you're leaving for us?)

## Talk 6

Paimon: That's right! Paimon's glad to hear something sensible for once.
Mona: Ah, yes. About what we had discussed before... I did try, but I'm afraid I couldn't reach the old hag. I'll try again tonight, but I wouldn't get your hopes up...
Traveler: Actually, someone already came over...
Mona: Huh?
Black Screen Text: You tell Mona about your mysterious guest...
Mona: Goodness gracious... Are you serious?
Traveler: I believe she came to pass a message to us.
Paimon: She said that even the gods' gaze has blindspots — pretty bold if you ask Paimon. Most people would believe the gods to be all-knowing, right?
Mona: The Hexenzirkel members are certainly anything but ordinary. As for the mage named N... The old hag has mentioned her a few times. She said that N's sense of direction is incredible, and that she loves guiding those who are lost.
Mona: But I've never met her, and if she were still alive, she'd be... Well, suffice it to say that the hag's at least a few hundred now, and N's been around for longer than that!
Paimon: Whoa... The Hexenzirkel sounds like a scary group... But they must really stay in shape to live so long!
Mona: Their abilities alone are pretty terrifying. If she came to see you personally, then the problem you're facing must truly be of great importance.
Paimon: Well, it's not like Paimon could understand anything she said.
Mona: Yes, she was quite cryptic, but I suspect she means that there is still a way to turn things around. She didn't say when or what that would be, though, so...
Mona: Perhaps it is something that you cannot know right now...
Traveler: (True. Her words were meant as a helpful hint, but when will we realize their value and meaning...?)
Traveler: (Was that the best answer that my question could have gotten?)
Mona: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, are you two alright?
Paimon: Oh, we're fine, we're just a little down right now... It kinda feels like the end is coming, you know?
Mona: I see. I feel that same sense of desperation, too.
Mona: I guess you could consider me someone who has often witnessed "fate." So far as I have seen, it cannot be swayed.
Mona: But even so, I still hope for — and believe in — miracles. Astrology is eternal and rational, but fate may not be. It is cruel... but it can also be beautiful.
Mona: Perhaps that's what N was trying to tell you. Not to lose heart, and to believe that what you were seeing playing out before you is not yet set in stone.
Mona: I did originally think of steering clear of all this, but I couldn't. Even if this is all futile, I still wish to help everyone. If we don't struggle to the last, then how can we face the end when it comes?
Paimon: Huh. You do have a point...
Mona: *sigh* Haha, there I go talking about astrological principles again. Sorry about that, the moment I start talking about work-related stuff... Oh, I need to get going!
Traveler: Don't worry about it, Mona — and thank you.
Mona: It was worth trying to comfort you, even if only a little. I believe that you'll help those who're struggling in the same way I did.
Mona: I suppose that might be why we always seem to meet by coincidence.
Paimon: Paimon feels kinda moved by what Mona said... but also kinda sad, too.
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}... Paimon suddenly feels like going outside for a walk. Let's go.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Huh? Our names are written in this newspaper. Uh, what's going on?
Traveler: Maybe we're famous?
Paimon: Let Paimon see...
Paimon: "The underwater stronghold, the Fortress of Meropide, has continued in its noble autonomy, but that does not mean that others cannot interact with it."
Paimon: "My recent attempts to enter the Fortress bore little fruit..." Huh? Guess Charlotte still hasn't given up on that...
Paimon: #"Thus did an outlander friend become the focus of this report — a {M#blond}{F#blonde} adventurer with their white fairy, legends trailing in their wake. It is said that this mysterious traveler once visited the underwater Fortress."
Paimon: "So while the Fortress's interior remains a mystery behind closed doors, do not fear, for the tales of the Traveler contain surprises in spades!"
Paimon: "Journalist Charlotte's biggest scoop yet — 'The Traveler's Trail: World-Walker.'"
Paimon: Huh? Charlotte took so many awesome photos of us, and we never even noticed her!
Paimon: She hasn't been able to get ahold of anything at the Fortress, so since we're easier to find, she's using us as the subject matter instead?
Traveler: That sure seems to be the case...
Paimon: Ugh, seriously... Well, fine. Those headlines and photos do look cool, so Paimon will forgive her this time!

## Talk 8

Mage "N": Ah, have you forgotten me already?
Paimon: Wait... You *are* familiar... You're the voice we heard from the sky in Sumeru!
Mage "N": "The voice from the sky," hmm? I fear that description is wrong — though not completely wrong.
Mage "N": You're feeling lost now, just as you were feeling previously. I sensed that confusion, and thus came to you. Guiding people is an irresistible hobby of mine, after all.
Traveler: Who are you? And what do you want with us?
Mage "N": Consider me a passerby, just accepting a commission from my friend's disciple on a whim.
Traveler: Allow me to ask you...
Mage "N": The prophecy... Yes, what has been prophesized will be fulfilled. You may view such things as "the history of the future."
Paimon: What... Th—Then, is there any way we can stop it?
Mage "N": I believe you have witnessed a failed attempt with your own eyes. Can everything in Teyvat so easily be changed?
Traveler: There it is again... "fate."
Traveler: Can there really be no exceptions?
Traveler: Will Fontaine's prophecy come true?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, quick! Look... That's...
Paimon: That's the limited-edition, only 16-slices-a-day cake!
Traveler: It hasn't already sold out for the day?
Paimon: It was so delicious the last time we tried it, despite the tense situation we were in. Let's give it another go — Paimon's sure it'll be great!
Traveler: We can't let anyone get ahead of us!
Sedene: One slice of cake, please.
Paimon: Ah! Someone showed up after all!
Paimon: Oh? Wait, you're the one from the Palais Mermonia...
Sedene: Oh, are you here to buy cake too? Haha, it seems Monsieur Neuvillette was right — you really can eat.
Paimon: Wait, did he really say something like that?
Sedene: That's right. Even he has his own preferences when it comes to food. As for me, I love the cake and coffee here.
Paimon: Do you come here often?
Sedene: Mhm, usually every day.
Paimon: Every day...
Sedene: It's part of my daily schedule apart from work — I shall have my cake and coffee.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Then what if someone told you one day that this place would be closing soon, and you wouldn't get to eat cake here anymore? What would you think?
Sedene: But why would it close?
Paimon: Well, Paimon doesn't know either, but maybe... Maybe the waters will rise tomorrow... You know, like in the prophecy.
Sedene: Oh, the prophecy... To be honest, I haven't paid much attention to that. No. Still, even if there'd be no more cake tomorrow, that wouldn't keep me from having some today.
Sedene: No no. It's the same for eating in general. You might not be able to eat tomorrow, but if you can do so today, then you should carry on. That's what people call "living," you know?
Paimon: ...Huh.
Sedene: Don't be sad. Excuse me, could I have two more slices of cake to go?
Sedene: These two slices are for you. Sigewinne said that this kind of expression you're making is what humans call "being sad."
Paimon: Oh, you know Sigewinne?
Sedene: I sure do. She was born before me, and she sometimes comes to the surface to teach us things about humans.
Sedene: She said that humans are creatures that are saddened easily, yes, and you can only lift their spirits by feeding them delicious food — so, please try the cakes here.
Sedene: I've got something else to do, so I'll be going now. You two try to stay in a good mood after eating, alright? Bye.
Paimon: And there she goes...
Paimon: Alright, let's dig in. Paimon's sure this cake will be delicious.
Black Screen Text: You share a glance with Paimon and snarf down the cake.
Paimon: It's more delicious than last time — and the flavor gets even better with a sip of tea! It sure would be nice if we could come again tomorrow...
Paimon: ...Sure would be nice if we could always eat delicious food here.

## Talk 10

Mage "N": Ah, have you forgotten me already?
Paimon: Wait... You *are* familiar... You're the voice we heard from the sky in Sumeru!
Mage "N": "The voice from the sky," hmm? I fear that description is wrong — though not completely wrong.
Mage "N": You're feeling lost now, just as you were feeling previously. I sensed that confusion, and thus came to you. Guiding people is an irresistible hobby of mine, after all.
Traveler: Who are you? And what do you want with us?
Mage "N": Consider me a passerby, just accepting a commission from my friend's disciple on a whim.
Traveler: (Friend's disciple... So, this is one of the friends of Mona's master? The enigmatic N of the Hexenzirkel?)
Traveler: Allow me to ask you...
Mage "N": The prophecy... Yes, what has been prophesized will be fulfilled. You may view such things as "the history of the future."
Paimon: What... Th—Then, is there any way we can stop it?
Mage "N": I believe you have witnessed a failed attempt with your own eyes. Can everything in Teyvat so easily be changed?
Traveler: There it is again... "fate."
Traveler: Can there really be no exceptions?
Traveler: Will Fontaine's prophecy come true?

## Talk 11

Charlotte: You defeated the Hydro Archon in the very first duel you took part in at the opera house. That's one for the history books, alright!
Charlotte: I didn't think that you'd wind up getting to the bottom of the case I'd been following all this time. I guess you could also see this as a happy coincidence...?
Charlotte: This is the first time Monsieur Neuvillette's had a difference of opinion with the Oratrice. Even the Hydro Archon can't figure it out.
Charlotte: A Fatui Harbinger... She's an extraordinary person. Her instinct must mean something.
Charlotte: The Fortress of Meropide was almost destroyed in a single day... That I didn't witness that scene personally will always be a source of professional regret, I think.
Charlotte: According to Monsieur Neuvillette, both Childe and that whale should have been in the Primordial Sea at that time.
Charlotte: I nearly lost my awesome friend Navia... To be honest, that still gives me the shivers.
Charlotte: The words of someone as extraordinary as a witch can probably only be truly understood when something surreal happens to you.

## Talk 12

Paimon: *yawn* Feels like you'll grow mold if you stay here long enough...
Paimon: But it's still better than the Fortress of Meropide, that's for sure. It's not only damp there, but salty, too...
Isadora: Ah, so the two of you are still here. Wonderful.
Paimon: Ooh, you're from the Palais Mermonia, aren't you?
Isadora: Yes, I'm Isadora. Monsieur Neuvillette sent me to look for you two before... I heard that afterward, you went to the Fortress of Meropide.
Traveler: Err... So are you under the impression that we might be wanted criminals?
Isadora: Haha, not at all. I'm well aware that you're friends of his. Actually, I'm here to pass along a message from him...
Traveler: Let's hear it.
Isadora: Yes, inside the opera house. The Marechaussee Phantom has declared the incident a small-scale riot.
Paimon: A riot?
Isadora: Well, that said, I don't personally think it was that serious.
Isadora: Lady Furina was watching a performance at the opera house, and while she was resting during an intermission, some other audience members suddenly started harassing her...
Isadora: Loudly accusing her of doing nothing about the "prophecy crisis."
Isadora: And before she could respond, others started to join in.
Isadora: The crowd continued to grow and protests against the Hydro Archon started to break out.
Paimon: So, people have started to put the blame on Furina... Guess they finally found an outlet for the pressure they've been under due to the prophecy.
Isadora: I agree. People will naturally rely on gods as is customary, but the moment people feel threatened, gods are also the first to be blamed.
Paimon: So what happened after that? Is Furina okay?
Isadora: Seeing that the situation was spiraling out of control and that further argument was pointless, she claimed that she'd "gotten tired of this" and left in a hurry.
Isadora: The Marechaussee Phantom had their hands full maintaining order and did not catch where Lady Furina had gone. Only when things had stabilized did we realize that she had gone missing.
Paimon: So, you mean she's still missing?
Isadora: That's right. The Marechaussee has dispatched many people to search for her, but we don't have any leads yet.
Isadora: That said, I don't think there's much to worry about. She is a god, after all. Even if she were to fall into the hands of rioters, what could ordinary people do to her?
Traveler: I understand the situation.
Isadora: Good. Monsieur Neuvillette sent me to tell you about the situation, but he didn't say anything else...
Paimon: Don't worry, this is more than enough to go on. Thanks for keeping us informed!
Isadora: Ah, is that so? Well, alright then. In that case, you two take care. I'll be heading back to the Palais now.
Paimon: Well, sounds like we should hurry over to Poisson, then.
Traveler: You sure caught on quickly.
Paimon: If we know Furina, she won't try to fix things in this situation. Instead, she'll look for a place to wait out the heat.
Paimon: And as we also know, she may be loud and dramatic, but she doesn't have a heart of stone.
Paimon: When Neuvillette was talking to her in the Palais Mermonia, and she heard about Poisson, she couldn't hide her sadness and remorse.
Paimon: It would be hard for her to ignore being accused by the public today.
Paimon: Paimon thinks Furina's probably taken the opportunity to slip away to Poisson and try to relieve the sense of guilt that she's feeling.
Paimon: Heh... Well, whaddya think? Paimon knows the answer, of course, but Paimon can do the analysis to back it up too. Cool, huh?
Traveler: I see becoming a detective's done you some good.
Paimon: In that case, there's not a moment to lose. Poisson, here we come!
Traveler: Looks like those detective novels have had an effect on you.
Traveler: Did something happen?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Let's take a walk around the city, shall we? There's a few spots we always like to walk by...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Did the stars not tell you that we might meet here?

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: The sea breeze and scenery can be a pretty soothing combo, huh?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Paimon's been thinking...
Traveler: Yes?
Paimon: If it wasn't Fontaine, but all of Teyvat that would be destroyed tomorrow, where would we go, and what would we do?
Paimon: No, Paimon should ask, if you could choose, what would you like to do?
Traveler: (If I could choose, huh?)
Traveler: (...Hmm, it's just like Charlotte said... Suddenly trying to consider what to do is pointless.)
Paimon: We've always been moving to the next destination, so we haven't spent much time thinking about these kinds of things. We didn't have to either, with us always being on the road and whatnot...
Traveler: Until that moment comes, I think I'll keep journeying on.
Paimon: You mean still traveling?
Traveler: Yes, cherishing every single moment...
Paimon: Huh. Wait, isn't that what we've always been doing?
Black Screen Text: The banter goes back and forth between the two of you as time slips by.
As night falls, you return to your accommodations and end this busy day.
Black Screen Text: The next few days are just as calm.
Charlotte comes to find you and conducts the interview in the Spina di Rosula safehouse at the Fleuve Cendre.
Black Screen Text: Navia, having finished her business in Poisson, even drops by to take a photo with the two of you.
All goes well.
Traveler: That I have to look upon this world.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Phew, it's been a tough few days, hasn't it? So much has been happening!
Traveler: Those meetings sure did make me hungry...
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon didn't think the meetings would go on for so long, but everyone seemed pretty fired up, huh?
Paimon: Paimon thought they'd be at least a little frightened... Well, Freminet was, now that Paimon thinks about it. But everyone else just looked a little surprised.
Traveler: Do you feel more confident after the meetings, Paimon?
Paimon: Uh... Well...
Paimon: It's hard to say — Paimon doesn't have any experience with this sort of thing. But with you around, Paimon's sure we'll do great!
Paimon: After all, you're the most reliable person in the world, aren't you? Hehe... Huh?
Traveler: Uh, is something wrong?
Paimon: Uh, did you just pour some tea? Paimon didn't notice you doing that at all!
Traveler: No, I didn't.
Paimon: Th—Then what's that?
Paimon: ...Paimon's never seen that cup before!
Mage "N": Don't be frightened. I'm just joining you two for tea. I merely refrained from saying anything till now.
Paimon: Ah! Who's that voice!? But there's no one here!

Mage "N": What a strange conclusion, but also such an interesting one... You two make such a fascinating combo.
Mage "N": And yet, even you feel confused. As such, I couldn't resist but come by for some tea and a chat.
Traveler: Who are you? And what do you want with us?
Mage "N": Consider me a passerby, just accepting a commission from my friend's disciple on a whim.
Traveler: Allow me to ask you...
Mage "N": The prophecy... Yes, what has been prophesized will be fulfilled. You may view such things as "the history of the future."
Paimon: What... Th—Then, is there any way we can stop it?
Mage "N": People call such things "fate," and it is written in the stars — it cannot so easily be altered.
Traveler: There it is again... "fate."
Traveler: Can there really be no exceptions?
Traveler: Will Fontaine's prophecy come true?

Traveler: (Friend's disciple... So, this is one of the friends of Mona's master?)
Mage "N": Precisely. Call me N, a mage who wanders the world. At least, that's how my friends have suggested that I introduce myself.

### Additional Talk 7

Black Screen Text: The unexpected news leads to complicated feelings. You lie in bed for a long time before finally falling asleep.
Black Screen Text: When you wake up, someone seems to be outside...
Paimon: Huh? Paimon hears someone talking...
Paimon: *yawn*~ Alright, alright, coming...
Traveler: You're getting more diligent, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! It's you who's getting lazy, okay?
Mona: Well, I see I've walked in on some lively banter.
Paimon: Mona!
Traveler: How've you been these past few days?
Mona: Fine, just fine. I went to take part in that Steambird panel. It turned out to be more interesting than I expected.
Mona: Not all Fontainians are pessimistic about this. One journalist mentioned that sitting around and waiting for the end to come would be wrong, and that they should make their own rescue preparations. I agreed, so we had a brief chat with her.
Paimon: Uh, did she have pink hair, by any chance?

### Additional Talk 8

Mona: Why, yes — it was Charlotte! You remember her, right? That daredevil journalist?
Mona: I'm in full support of her view — prophecies are very important, but how can people allow their lives to be commandeered by just a few words?

Mona: Why, yes — it was Charlotte! I assume you've heard of her, no? That daredevil journalist?
Mona: I'm in full support of her view — prophecies are very important, but how can people allow their lives to be commandeered by just a few words?

### Additional Talk 10

Charlotte: #Wow, if it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Have you seen the article I wrote about you?
Paimon: You've got some nerve! You just used us to make some quick Mora!
Traveler: Can we negotiate a profit split?
Charlotte: Oh, you needn't worry about that! I heard that you were in Poisson some time back, so I sent you a letter to discuss just that — it appears you didn't receive it, though.
Charlotte: It's alright, though. I've set aside the amount intended for you. I've even set the table with some food!
Paimon: Really? Ooh, you're the best!
Charlotte: Heh, you're almost a little too easy to win over, Paimon. If I were a journalist with ulterior motives, you'd be in trouble now, you know!
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows you're not like that!
Charlotte: Still, what brings you here all of a sudden? Were you looking for me?

### Additional Talk 11

Paimon: A friend of ours met you a while back, and when she mentioned it, we thought of coming to see you. Her name's Mona!
Charlotte: Ah, so you know Miss Mona as well? She's a guest columnist for our paper — a really good one, too! She's so young, and already such a brilliant astrologist!

### Additional Talk 12

Paimon: When Mona mentioned you, we thought of coming to see you at work.
Charlotte: Haha, I see. It seems you've already bumped into Mona here in Fontaine.

### Additional Talk 13

Paimon: We're here! Phew, Paimon's hungry. Should we go in and get something to eat?
