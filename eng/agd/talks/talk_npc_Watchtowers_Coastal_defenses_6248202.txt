Traveler: Watchtowers? Coastal defenses?
Xuanzhu: You're interested in military engineering too?
Xuanzhu: Hmm... I can see the righteous spark in your eyes. Perhaps you'll join our foreign aid unit or become a reliable ally of ours one day.
Xuanzhu: In that case, allow me to give you a brief explanation.
Xuanzhu: In short, we have a long coastline with complex terrain around Yilong Wharf, and there are many blind spots all across it...
Xuanzhu: If more simple and low-cost watchtowers can be built, we will be able to control the border efficiently.
Xuanzhu: Forget bandits. Even a ferocious hawk wouldn't be able to get through then.
Xuanzhu: Of course, this assumes that we can figure our duty schedule first out.
Xuanzhu: If we perfect a sound tube transmission system while building the watchtowers and coastal defenses, we will be able to coordinate better...
Xuanzhu: At that point, our first line of defense will be considerably resilient, and it can act as a severe deterrent to even the most formidable foes.
