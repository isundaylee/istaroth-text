## Talk

Aclla: Hi there, what can I help you with?
Aclla: Or is there anything you wanted to help the Scions of the Canopy with?

## Talk

Traveler: About my reputation with the Scions of the Canopy...
Aclla: So you really are a helper after all! Thank you so much!

## Talk

Traveler: Hello. What did you mean when you said "help"?
Aclla: Ah, let me explain. Often, members of the tribe just have too much on their hands, so some turn into commissions that are open to outsiders as well.
Aclla: Anyone who wants to take on a commission can just come here, to the Obsidian Totem Pole.
Aclla: Naturally, you'll be compensated for completing commissions! Feel free to stop by and help!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Aclla: I'm a vet who specializes in treating Saurians. Pleasure to meet you!
Aclla: Haha, it may sound cool, but I really just give baby Saurians their meds and talk to them. At most, I could be considered a medical intern.
Aclla: For seriously injured Saurians, it's best if you see a professional Sauro-vet.
Aclla: Like Ifa, from the Flower-Feather Clan! If you give him a call, he'll rush right on over!
Aclla: Of course, I've got some pretty neat talents too! You know how Yumkasaurs usually don't like being around people? Well, they don't mind me!
Aclla: Sometimes, just spending time with them is a kind of healing.

Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Aclla: Take care, then.

Aclla: Sometimes, little Saurians look unwell, but they're actually just in a bad mood... So, spending time with them can be an excellent form of "treatment," you know!
