# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Diona: Uhh...
Diona: #...Actually... there is something I wanted your help with, Traveler.
Diona: See, most of the time I'm either making cocktails or hunting, so I always tie my hair up like this.
Diona: But... it's so relaxed here, there are no chores to do, plus nobody else has to see, soooo...
Diona: I was wondering... would it be better if I... wore my hair down...?
Traveler: Whatever you like.
Diona: Heh, really!?
Diona: Well, in that case... could you help me with it?
Diona: ...Wait! Firstly! I want to make it quite clear that this is not because I just enjoy the feeling of having my hair brushed, okay!? Ahem...
Diona: And be gentle by the way. If you start tearing out hairs, hehe... I might just bite back!
Traveler: I'm sure wearing it down would look just as lovely.
