Traveler: Another Katheryne...
Katheryne: Another? Hehe, have you ever seen more than one Katheryne at once?
Katheryne: If not, you have probably seen the same me each time. To meet the demands of the adventurers from all over the world, I use a special tool to teleport myself and work in multiple places simultaneously.

Traveler: I'd love to teleport, too!
Katheryne: Oh dear, you actually believed that?
Katheryne: Sorry, that was a joke. Please don't take it to heart.
Katheryne: In any case, you probably know how to use the Teleport Waypoints, right?

Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque, Adventurer. We're thankful for your arrival.
Traveler: Any new commissions for me?
Katheryne: Indeed. We are about to begin a new round of ecological surveys, in fact.
Katheryne: Nonetheless, let me begin by explaining the situation.
Katheryne: Recently, eyewitness reports concerning "Specters" have been increasing at an alarming rate.
Katheryne: This is usually a very rare sort of elemental creature. As such, there must be some special reason behind their sudden resurgence.
Katheryne: The Guild's understanding of these creatures is still very lacking, so we are currently mobilizing for an all-hands-on-deck investigation.
Traveler: Is it really such a powerful creature?
Katheryne: Due to the suddenness and strangeness of this event, we know little about the state of these Specters or the amount of danger they pose to people.
Traveler: Then I accept.
Katheryne: Thank you for accepting this commission. What we need you to do is quite simple, actually. You simply need to travel around Inazuma with your companions and observe the peculiarities of these Specters.
Katheryne: The form these investigations will take is very similar to the Expeditions you've undertaken in the past. We've already sorted out the various sightings of these Specters.
Katheryne: Here, allow me to show you.
Katheryne: Due to the fact that Specters are elemental creatures, you should get optimal results so long as you follow the elemental guidelines recommended by the Guild when dispatching your companions.
Katheryne: There will be special commissions in which you will have to go and perform an on-site investigation personally, owing to a lack of good intel. Once you've completed such missions, I will continue to organize the dispatches.
Traveler: So this is preliminary prep work, then.
Katheryne: Indeed. These commissions would usually be quite tough, but I believe that you will see them done with ease.
Katheryne: I will update you with new information concerning the Specters every day. You can have faith that I will support you and your companions in any way I can.
Traveler: You're mobilizing that many people?
Traveler: I think I know where we're going with this...
Katheryne: Oh? You've done such commissions before? That's great, then.

## Talk 8

Katheryne: Thanks for your efforts thus far, Adventurer. We have been able to gather sufficient data concerning these Specters.
Traveler: Glad I could help.
Katheryne: Mm-hmm. The observational reports you gathered were very important indeed.
Katheryne: I believe that you need not worry about Specters threatening the ordinary people going forward. I will organize the intelligence we've gathered and submit them to professional researchers for study.
Katheryne: Ah, and yes, please don't forget to claim your rewards from the Guild!
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! The Adventurers' Guild thanks you for your services!
Traveler: Some extra rewards would make for a nice thank-you.
Katheryne: Haha, no problem. In that case, be sure to take part in future commissions as well.

## Talk 9

Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: You've come at last. I've been waiting for you, Adventurer.
Traveler: An—Another Katheryne...
Katheryne: Another? Hehe, have you ever seen multiple Katherynes in a single location?
Katheryne: If you haven't, then they were one and the same.
Katheryne: As the only year-round receptionist in the Adventurers' Guild, I can use a special tool to instantly move between various locations in the world to deal with various important matters...
Katheryne: After I help you with your matters here, I need to head over to Fontaine. The adventurers over there are notorious for frugality, so I need to receive them well.
Traveler: Re—Really?
Katheryne: Hmm... You believed me? Sorry, I was joking. Please don't take it seriously.
Katheryne: Also, I thought you knew how to use Teleport Waypoints?
Katheryne: Anyway, I won't bother you with pointless trivia. Come, I'll help you process the work that's needed by the Inazuma Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: Once things are processed, you can accept commissions here and also enjoy other benefits.
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque, Adventurer.
Traveler: I also want to teleport!
