Maillardet: #Sir, ma'am, I wish you a good morning, afternoon, and evening!
Maillardet: My name is Maillardet, a researcher with the Fontaine Research Institute. I believe the two of you are here to witness the Icewind Suite?
Maillardet: According to Mr. Bossuet's original plan, Coppelius and Coppelia are clockwork meka dedicated to the art of dance.
Maillardet: But after I took over the project, I also added in some of my understanding of Pneumousia...
Maillardet: So as you can see, not only are they good at dancing, but they are also highly capable fighters!
Maillardet: However, I believe that there's still much room for improvement. We require large amounts of experimental data to further increase their combat prowess.
Maillardet: I might have gotten too passionate during the development phase â€” and from that came two different combat modes for Coppelius and Coppelia based on the differences between Pneuma and Ousia...
Maillardet: They are *Dirge of Coppelia* and *Nemesis of Coppelius*. That is to say, we'll need two times the research data!
Maillardet: As long as we can iterate on them smoothly, the joy of our success will be doubled.
Maillardet: And the coming of that joy now rests upon your shoulders, brave warrior!
Maillardet: #What do you say, bold sir? Would you be willing to join our machines in their dance?
