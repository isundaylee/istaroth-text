# Three Wishes


## Talk 1

Paimon: According to the letter, this should be the place.
Kozue: Sorry, we don't serve the general public. I'm afraid you'll have to leave.
Paimon: Wait! We're not the general public...
Kozue: Well then... you must be a couple of wandering outlanders that snuck into the nation... judging by your attire.
Paimon: Are our clothes really so— oh! Uh... What Paimon means to say is—
Traveler: Here's our Invitation Letter.
Kozue: Hmm, the Yashiro Commission's seal... this must be from Mr. Thoma. It seems there's more to you than meets the eye.
Kozue: In which case, welcome to the Komore Teahouse, a safe haven for the Yashiro Commission.
Paimon: Well, that sounds more like it.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, now that we're here, where's Thoma?
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon doesn't see him anywhere, do you think he forgot his promise to meet us?
Thoma: Who forgot their promise? I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me!
Paimon: Wh—Wh—What!? Is that dog talking to us!?
Thoma: Hahaha, relax, no need to look so surprised. I take it this is the first time you've seen me in this form?
Traveler: So you're a... dog?
Thoma: Huh, so you didn't see anything like this when you were in Liyue Harbor?
Paimon: Ah, now that you mention it, this does suddenly seem less out of the ordinary...
Traveler: But it still doesn't really add up...
Thoma: Hahaha. Alright, alright, I've had my fun.
Paimon: Hey! You're this close to getting an ugly nickname, mister!
Thoma: Hehe, well, I've had some time to kill, given that I've been waiting here for you for so long... as was the case in Ritou...
Thoma: So I came up with this little fun greeting for when you arrived.
Thoma: But, in all seriousness, I would like to apologize about that little "test" you went through earlier. Though it was quite necessary...
Thoma: It helped us determine whether or not to bring you before Miss Kamisato, and whether you had the courage to face the lightning alongside us.
Paimon: Hmph. Don't think that Paimon's gonna forgive you just because you're getting all serious now!
Thoma: Haha... Sorry, did I overdo it? My apologies.
Traveler: So, how did we do in our "test"?
Thoma: Let me just say this, you've often found yourself skirting "the rules" from the very beginning, haven't you?
Thoma: Naturally, this is due to your unwavering and resolute determination.
Thoma: A long time ago, we had a friend who was much the same... but when the lightning struck...
Traveler: You mean Kazuha's friend...
Thoma: Ah, so you've heard of his story, hmm...
Thoma: His light still burns all the more brightly...
Traveler: So will we be allowed to meet the Shirasagi Himegimi?
Thoma: Yes, of course. I will bring you to the Kamisato residence, where the Yashiro Commission is located.
Thoma: But before that, there is one other place I was hoping you both would accompany me to.
Paimon: Oh? Where?
Thoma: I would like you to come with me to the Statue of the Omnipresent God. It's still under construction now, but you can already see it from practically anywhere on Narukami Island.
Traveler: You mean he died in a duel before the throne...
Traveler: "The courage to face the lightning"...?
Traveler: I know a dog when I see one.
Traveler: Where did the human-looking Thoma go?

## Talk 3

Paimon: So this is the kind of place where the big shots of Inazuma live, huh? Paimon kinda expected it to be... snazzier.
Traveler: It's hard to top the Jade Chamber.
Thoma: Welcome, at last, to the Kamisato residence, honored guests. Miss Kamisato is delighted to finally meet you.
Paimon: Is this the Shirasagi Himegimi you keep going on about? So, uh, where's she at?
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem...
Paimon: Oh... uh, behind the screen?
Thoma: Yes, haha, as the daughter of the Yashiro Commission, this is how Miss Kamisato is accustomed to receiving guests.
Thoma: Consider it a time-honored tradition within the Yashiro Commission. Forgive me if this is an unwelcome surprise.
Traveler: I think I understand.
Paimon: Makes sense, she's a super-important person after all.
Kamisato Ayaka: Please forgive my lack of courtesy for receiving you in this fashion... especially following such a long and wearisome journey over the sea.
Kamisato Ayaka: I have awaited your arrival with great anticipation, and Thoma assures me that you do indeed possess the power to change the tide of the times.
Kamisato Ayaka: At present in Inazuma, in the name of the Vision Hunt Decree, the people's aspirations are being senselessly trampled underfoot.
Kamisato Ayaka: Though the Yashiro Commission serves the shogun, it is the people with whom we share close bonds, given the contact we are required to have with them in the performance of our duties.
Kamisato Ayaka: A commission's power rises and falls with the trust of their people. Thus, we cannot remain indifferent to this situation without also remaining indifferent to our own fate.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, lend us your power, and we can—
Traveler: I'm just here to meet the Raiden Shogun.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh...
Thoma: See, milady, it's just like I said... this will take us nowhere...
Traveler: I'm going to leave now.
Kamisato Ayaka: No, please... wait! Please... Don't go...
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh*
Traveler: What?
Kamisato Ayaka: I will introduce you to the Raiden Shogun, on one condition... You must fulfill three small wishes on my behalf.
Paimon: What are your wishes?
Kamisato Ayaka: They pertain to three whose Visions were taken from them... Perhaps once you've met them, you will understand...
Paimon: A warrior who guards a village, a former samurai who helped carry out the Vision Hunt Decree, and a swordmaster determined to become the best in the world... Does Paimon got that right?
Kamisato Ayaka: Correct. Please do all you can to help them. I will await your return here.
Traveler: I will do as you wish.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe... Then, you have my gratitude.
Thoma: I'm sure you'll do great.
Traveler: This is a tall order...
Traveler: I did not come to start a rebellion.
Traveler: (This is slightly anticlimactic...)
Traveler: It's hard to top the Dawn Winery.
