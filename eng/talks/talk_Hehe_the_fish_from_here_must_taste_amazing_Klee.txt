Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Hehe, the fish from here must taste amazing! Klee really wants to try one..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Alright, let's go catch some fish together! But we need to be quiet, okay? We mustn't let my big sister find out."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Really? You like eating fish too?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Haha, I sure do, but I like catching them even more! When we were kids, my sister and I used to go catching fish together sometimes. She might look super-serious now, but let me tell you, when she was a kid, she was so much fun. She even had a pet tortoise! Hehe, can you imagine?"
