# Taste of Happiness


## Talk 1

Arapacati: My brothers have all done some self-reflection. Festival Utsava is a happy occasion, so Arapacati shouldn't get mad.
Arasaka: That's right, Arapacati. Don't get mad. Happy occasions should be celebrated with the "taste of happiness"!
Arachatora: It's time to show off the results of our cooking training!
Araphala: I have been ready for a long while.
Paimon: Yay, it's the Festival Utsava Feast! Paimon's been waiting for this!
Traveler: Alright! The Festival Utsava Feast!
Arapas: Water from Vanarana is the best water and makes the best soup. Nara will love it for sure.
Arapacati: #I shall deliver the "taste of happiness" to Nara Traveler and Paimon, and let them "teach" my brothers.
Arapacati: It's the only way to make food Nara will like. That's how guests should be treated.
Arapacati: #Would you mind teaching them to cook, Nara Traveler?
Traveler: Best we not get our hopes too high...

## Talk 2

Arapacati: #Would you mind teaching them to cook, Nara Traveler?

## Talk 3

Paimon: We're back, Arapas! This is the Best Water!
Arapas: #Terrific! I can make the Best Soup so long as I have the Best Water. Nara Traveler will love it for sure!

## Talk 4

Arapas: #The Best Water... But there's nothing's left of it after my practice runs. Would Nara Traveler mind getting some water from the north of Vanarana for Arapas?
Paimon: #Well, guess we ought to help out, Traveler.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Woohoo! And that's our piping-hot Radish Veggie Soup all ready to go! The Aranara should be done with their dishes too.

## Talk 6

Araphala: #Don't you worry, Nara Traveler, Araphala has prepared the Unrivaled Fresh Fruit for the festival!
Paimon: Araphala sure moves fast, huh? Let's go check elsewhere.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Will this do?
Arachatora: Yes! We'll have a supreme delicacy, you can bet on that!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Y'know, since the Aranara are making food for us so eagerly during this happy occasion, we should return the favor. What do you say?
Paimon: Hmm... Maybe they'll like some Radish Veggie Soup! Let's show them what Nara cooking's all about!

## Talk 9

Paimon: #You still have to ask Traveler to help, or you will end up cooking the same dishes as before.
Black Screen Text: According to the improvement method from Paimon, Aranara finishes the dish under your guidance.
After that, you enjoy the dish with Aranara...
Paimon: How's the taste of true-blue gourmet Nara food, eh?
Arapacati: #Hmm... While it was Arapacati's suggestion for Nara Traveler to teach my brothers...
Arachatora: Nara dishes... Is this what Nara call "the taste of happiness"?
Arasaka: Happiness is fleeing from me...
Arapas: Vanarana's water is obviously the Best Water, so how did something like this get made from it?
Araphala: The Unrivaled Fresh Fruit is still delicious, though. Yum.
Paimon: Eh? You Aranara think it's awful? Paimon thought it was pretty yummy, though...
Arapacati: I have no idea how "awful" is supposed to taste, but the flavor of this dish... has "impact." You know, like the kind you get from running full-speed into a tree...
Paimon: Wow... This has gotta be a massive case of culture clash.
Arapacati: #Still, it's rude to say that, my brothers. You should be thanking Nara Traveler instead!
Arachatora: *whimper* I'm sorry...
Arapacati: Don't say "sorry"! Say "Thank you!"
Arachatora ("Brothers"): #Thank you, Nara Traveler...
Arapacati: #But it's okay as long as Nara Traveler and Paimon enjoy the food! Don't mind them. If our Nara friends are happy, we're happy.
Arapacati: #That said, Nara Traveler is totally different from Nara Varuna, who told us a lot of things about "brothers."
Arapacati: #But Nara Traveler is very quiet. Are you feeling unwell?
Paimon: #Uh, say something, Traveler.
Traveler: Thanks for your concern.
Arapacati: #Is that so? I'm glad. Once again, thank you. These petals are from Arapacati and her brothers. They're for you, Nara Traveler and Paimon.
Arapacati: We hope the two of you will enjoy more of the "taste of happiness" here in Vanarana!
Traveler: (Remain silent.)
Paimon: #Anyway, no need to worry, Arapacati! Traveler's fine!

## Talk 10

Traveler: Sure.
Arapacati: They're all ready. We can start now.

## Talk 11

Arasaka: Needs more of that "taste of happiness"...
Paimon: Whoa, that's enough!
Arasaka: Huh? Hmm, Arapacati mentioned that we must make Nara happy with food, so Paimon is right. I'll add less of it...
Paimon: There you go. That should do.

## Talk 12

Arachatora: The Head Mushroom has been ready for a while now! My super fragrant Head Mushroom...
Arachatora: #But I'm not very good at gauging the heat, so please come take a look, Nara Traveler...
Paimon: Fire is kinda dangerous to Aranara, so let's go help to control it.
