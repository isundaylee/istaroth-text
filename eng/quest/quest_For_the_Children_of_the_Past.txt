# For the Children of the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: *huff*... *huff*... You're flying too fast, Arama!
Arama: Is that so? Sorry. But based on how you float, you shouldn't be exhausting any stamina.
Paimon: Paimon must be fully focused to fly, so it is exhausting! Arama, just fly at the speed of a Seelie, alright?
Arama: A Seelie? In the ancient stories, Seelie were a great race with wisdom and beauty beyond the pale of this earth. They traveled with Nara and taught Nara languages and the philosophy of nature.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon thought that they were just large but annoying fireflies that lead us around by the nose...
Arama: Seelie are just empty husks that race left behind. This is because they were born with a curse: If they fall in love with Nara, they shall lose their intelligence and strength, and their bodies will regress.
Arama: There was once a survivor of that race deep within the golden desert who was friends with Queen Aranyani and the ruler of Valuka. Perhaps there are more stories to be found in the eternal oasis.
Paimon: Hmmm...
Traveler: Anyway, don't fly too fast...
Arama: Yes. So you see... at their prime, the Seelie were probably faster than a storm. Plus, isn't Paimon tired? We can rest while I tell stories about Sarva.
Paimon: You even know how to be evasive now, Arama. You've really changed...
Arama: Anyway, this was our first home{RUBY#[S]Vanarana}land. Aranara used to live here before the disaster, and many Nara had visited us.
Paimon: Before the disaster... Are you saying that...
Arama: Yes, and you've been to the second Vanarana. Meanwhile, Marana's Avatar is imprisoned by three seals deep within this place.
Arama: Three Inscriptions of Remembrance are needed to undo the first seal. While the landscape here is a little different from the memories I received, I have a rough idea where they are.
Arama: #Anyway, Marana is very dangerous. Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, I recommend we match each other's pace. Let me know when you're ready to set out.
Paimon: Three seals, and we must find three Inscriptions of Remembrance just for the first seal... This is so troublesome. Why does everything have to be done three times?
Traveler: They don't call it "The Rule of Three" for nothing...
Paimon: Yeah... If Ruu were here, Paimon's sure he and Arama would become friends real quick...
Arama: Ruu?
Paimon: Yes, he's a friend of ours.
Arama: #I see. I too wish to meet Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon's friend. A Nara who's friends with both of you is for sure a great Nara.
Arama: But it's alright. The past and the future meet in Sarva. A day will come when I'll have the honor of meeting this Ruu and becoming friends with him.
Arama: By the way, there are actually four seals imprisoning Marana. The first seal is the Door of Vana, which is right behind us.
Traveler: Let's go.
Paimon: Yeah! It feels like we have so much to do! Let's get moving!
Traveler: Yeah, let's go.
Traveler: Let's rest a while longer...
Arama: Alright. We'll set out whenever you are ready.
Traveler: I wanna rest a while longer...
Arama: Alright. We'll set out whenever you are ready.
Traveler: Anyway, Seelie annoy me...
Traveler: ...Is there a reason why you told us that story?

## Talk 3

Mural: (A slightly crude mural of Aranara with a golden Aranara among them. They seem to be happily celebrating something.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wh—What was that? Was that Ararakalari? It just...
Arama: No, it wasn't. Paimon needed help, so I hit the Marana very, very hard. I'm very pleased to say that I eliminated that evil tumor.
Arama: May we never meet again, evil tumor.
Paimon: If hitting a Tumor of the Withering very, very hard can destroy it, the Aranara should be able to deal with The Withering once and for all, right?
Arama: No, it has to be hit very, very hard, specifically. Most Aranara aren't that strong.
Arama: Many, many suns must pass, then many, many moons must pass. When seed turns to tree, when stream turns to river, only then will an Aranara possess such strength.
Paimon: Paimon gets it now. But y'know, you're speaking normally again, Arama...
Arama: Used too much strength just now. So, many words, many memories, gone with the wind.
Paimon: Oh... Paimon remembers someone saying that memories are Aranara's bank of strength...
Traveler: It's all Paimon's fault.
Paimon: Paimon was just trying to eliminate The Withering here...
Arama: It's fine! Used energy will come back slowly. I've absorbed the Ashvattha Tree's memories, so I recover even faster. We destroyed Marana's evil tumor, very good, very good.
Arama: The seal is nearby. Many different Ararakalari here keep Marana's Avatar in. So, it sent the evil tumor to damage the seal.
Arama: That looks like Aradasha's stone lock...
Paimon: And this... This is the flower that sealed Ashvattha's Concourse...
Arama: Oh! It's Arayama's flower. In the past, many Aranara fought Marana here, and together they sealed this place.
Arama: Marana's Avatar is very, very deep underground. Break this seal, then break the next seal, and we can face it and defeat it.
Traveler: Leave the seals to us.
Paimon: Whatever the case, let's do our best for a little while longer. We'll eliminate Marana's Avatar and get the Bija!
Arama: #Yeah! We can do it, Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon! I will stay and build up some strength. I need strength to face Marana's Avatar.
Arama: Oh, right! Nara "rest" so that they can build up their strength and defeat Marana! Nara are amazing!
Paimon: Rest is meant to build up strength, yeah, but not everyone has to fight Marana...
Arama: #Is that so? Well, luckily Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon "rested" before coming. We'll definitely defeat Marana's Avatar now!
Arama: #There are some tiny lights around us that can resist Marana's corrosion and protect Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon. You can rest if you want.
Traveler: How do we break the seals?
Arama: #I don't know... This place has changed so much, many memories lost too. I'm sorry, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: #Well! Solving these puzzles will be a piece of cake! Right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I'm pretty smart, I reckon.
Traveler: Paimon's very intelligent.
Paimon: Of course! Hehe.
Traveler: But I don't want puzzles...
Paimon: Eh, really? Haven't we been able to solve so many puzzles and find so much treasure along the way because you're fond of puzzles...?
Traveler: So what should we do now?

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: Missing text (1509034522)

## Talk 6

Paimon: Arama! We're back! How are you feeling?
Arama: Oh! I've built up some strength! I'm fine! I can sense that the seal is broken. Now, leave the rest to me.
Arama: There's so much sand here. I think it used to be stone and soil. But Marana took away the life and moisture in the soil, turning it into sand.
Arama: Aranakin hates sand. If only he could see this!
Paimon: See what?
Arama: See sand vanish!

## Talk 7

Paimon: There aren't any clues...
Arama: I see. But this place is very calm, very good.
Paimon: Yeah. But it must be really difficult for you to keep the ring up and fend off The Withering, Arama...
Arama: #I'm fine! Being with Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon is a very happy thing. I won't forget!
Arama: I recovered some strength while resting, so I remember now! This used to be Aramuhukunda's home!
Aramuhukunda: #Hello, Arama, Nara {NICKNAME}, and Paimon.
Paimon: Whoa! Where did you come from...
Arama: You're Aramuhukunda...
Traveler: Whoa!
Paimon: ...Aren't you that mysterious Aranara we met during Festival Utsava? That Aranara who speaks unlike any other Aranara?
Aramuhukunda: #You still remember. That gladdens me. Nara {NICKNAME} made a garland from my flower and the flowers of many Aranara. To me, that is a great honor.
Traveler: Thank you for the flowers.
Arama: Aramuhukunda! I've heard so many stories about you, and I played with you in the memories of Arayama and the others!
Aramuhukunda: Then you've inherited their memories, I see. As a past friend of theirs, this fills me with pride.
Arama: Yes... But during the battle her{RUBY#[S]Old Vanarana}e, many memories vanished, like fruits falling to the ground or clouds blown away by the wind...
Aramuhukunda: I see. They won't be sad about it, and you have no reason to either. There's no end to the precious memories you can create and the strength you can gain while you're with your friends.
Arama: Yeah, I understand...
Paimon: Arama was really impressive when he took down that Tumor of the Withering with just one punch! He did the same to a Ruin Grader too! He really helped a lot!
Aramuhukunda: Very good, Arama. It's just as I heard in Sarva... You're a brave Aranara.
Aramuhukunda: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you've come. Intentional or not, it fills me with great pride. I've always wanted to hang out with Nara friends here.
Traveler: Do you know how to break the seal?
Aramuhukunda: Worry not, I know why you're here. The Ashvattha Tree told me many things, before it used what strength it had left to give Arama the fruit of dreams.
Aramuhukunda: Go through that cave and you'll arrive at the place where we defeated and sealed Marana hundreds of years ago. It hasn't fully recovered yet, but there's no time to lose.
Arama: Yeah! We've gotta break the last seal and defeat it as soon as possible! Only then can a new Ashvattha Tree grow to produce the Bija.
Aramuhukunda: And I am the final seal. I am the one who's keeping an eye on Marana's Avatar, and yet its strength still seeps through the sand like water, creeping through Sarva.
Aramuhukunda: I will undo this last seal and open the path for you. I'm certain that you can defeat it and put an end to this final enemy.
Paimon: #Alright! {NICKNAME}, Arama, the seal's gone! Thanks, Aramuhukunda!
Aramuhukunda: #Do not worry. Rather, it is I who should say thank you. Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, I have a question for you before you go...
Aramuhukunda: I've been busy preparing an environment comfortable for Nara, just for your visit. But I've not traveled alongside Nara for far too long, so I do not trust my own judgment.
Aramuhukunda: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, do you like this place?
Paimon: #Hmm... It's really nice and relaxing. There isn't anything to eat, but Paimon thinks it's pretty nice! What do you think, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I like it.
Aramuhukunda: #...You're not very fond of talking, quite unlike Nara Varuna. {M#She}{F#He} kept talking about {M#her}{F#his} {M#brother}{F#sister}. {M#She}{F#He} was a terrible example for Arapacati and the others.
Aramuhukunda: If I have time, and with your help, I can definitely do better. But based on the current circumstances, I'm afraid time is of the essence for you and the Nara friend you want to help.
Aramuhukunda: My only regret is meeting you in an age like this one.
Aramuhukunda: Or I should say that, had we met in another age, I could have introduced Nara Varuna to you. How wonderful that might have been.
Arama: #But I wouldn't have been able to meet Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon if they came from a different age!
Aramuhukunda: Indeed. So this is fine. It was a little short, but I'm still very happy to have had a conversation with you. Thank you.
Aramuhukunda: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, go on ahead. I have something to give to Arama.
Arama: #...I understand. Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, please go on ahead! I'll be right behind you!
Paimon: Alright, be quick, or we'll defeat Marana's Avatar on our own!
Traveler: Can't say I have any particular feelings on the subject...
Traveler: I don't like it.
Traveler: Sorry, but we have other matters to attend to...
Traveler: We can hang out!
Paimon: Yes, let's hang out later! But we've gotta break the seal here and defeat Marana's Avatar first.
Traveler: Arama made the garland.
Traveler: We met during Festival Utsava...
Aramuhukunda: You still remember. That gladdens me. You made a garland from my flower and the flowers of many Aranara. To me, that is a great honor.

## Talk 8

Paimon: *huff*... *huff*... You're flying too fast, Arama!
Arama: Is that so? Sorry. But based on how you float, you shouldn't be exhausting any stamina.
Paimon: Paimon must be fully focused to fly, so it is exhausting! Arama, just fly at the speed of a Seelie, alright?
Arama: A Seelie? In the ancient stories, Seelie were a great race with wisdom and beauty beyond the pale of this earth. They traveled with Nara and taught Nara languages and the philosophy of nature.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon thought that they were just large but annoying fireflies that lead us around by the nose...
Arama: Seelie are just empty husks that race left behind. This is because they were born with a curse: If they fall in love with Nara, they shall lose their intelligence and strength, and their bodies will regress.
Arama: There was once a survivor of that race deep within the golden desert who was friends with the Lord of Verdure and the ruler of Valuka. Perhaps there are more stories to be found in the eternal oasis.
Paimon: Hmmm...
Traveler: Anyway, don't fly too fast...
Traveler: Anyway, Seelie annoy me...
Traveler: ...Is there a reason why you told us that story?
Arama: Yes. So you see... at their prime, the Seelie were probably faster than a storm. Plus, isn't Paimon tired? We can rest while I tell stories about Sarva.
Paimon: You even know how to be evasive now, Arama. You've really changed...
Arama: Anyway, this is Old Vanarana, and it was the home of Aranara for hundreds of years before the disaster. We once hung out with Nara here.
Paimon: Before the disaster... Are you saying that...
Arama: Yes, and you've been to the new Vanarana. Meanwhile, Marana's Avatar is imprisoned by three seals deep within this place.
Arama: Three Inscriptions of Remembrance are needed to undo the first seal. While the landscape here is a little different from the memories I received, I have a rough idea where they are.
Arama: #Anyway, Marana is very dangerous. Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, I recommend we match each other's pace. Let me know when you're ready to set out.
Traveler: Let's go.
Traveler: I wanna rest a while longer...
Paimon: Yeah! Three seals... It feels like we have so much to do! Let's get moving!
Traveler: Yeah, let's go.
Traveler: Let's rest a while longer...
Arama: Alright. We'll set out whenever you are ready.
Arama: Alright. We'll set out whenever you are ready.

Arama: Alright. We'll set out whenever you are ready.
Traveler: Anyway, Seelie annoy me...
Traveler: ...Is there a reason why you told us that story?

## Talk 10

Inscription of Remembrance: ...
Traveler: (Try to sense the memories within the inscription...)
Inscription of Remembrance: ...Ah, so you too are a child of the forest. Since you're reading my Inscription of Remembrance, Marana is gone, right? Or perhaps you're here to put an end to it?
Inscription of Remembrance: There are many stories I wish to hear. Is Araja's dream beautiful? Are Arana and Aramani doing well? I'm sure the new songs born into this world are absolutely beautiful!
Inscription of Remembrance: Oh, there's no rush to tell me anything. For I hear no more and see no more. But fret not, for we shall meet in Sarva.
Inscription of Remembrance: When the time comes, you can take your time to tell me the stories of the earth! This inscription is the work of Araji, Arayama, and myself — our pride and joy. It's yours now...
Inscription of Remembrance: "May the new dre{RUBY#[S]Vanarana}ams never experience Marana's corrosion."
"And may the old sto{RUBY#[S]Vanarana}ries be forgotten alongside it."

## Talk 11

Inscription of Remembrance: ...
Traveler: (Try to sense the memories within the inscription...)
Inscription of Remembrance: Araji really wants to see Vanarana filled with many, many flowers again, and birds on green trees while Nara sing with us under the trees.
Inscription of Remembrance: Marana really is terrifying, but thinking about scenes like that makes it less scary. Arayama said that Araji is very brave, and that Araji should think about happy things when afraid.
Inscription of Remembrance: So Araji decided on the inscription's content, with the hopes that it will bring courage to you who have come to Vanarana that is beautiful no more...
Inscription of Remembrance: "May the green fields and mountains never wither."
"May the streams stay clear and the flowers remain in bloom."

## Talk 12

Paimon: Is this the seal? What a huge tree hollow...
Arama: #Yes, it's all thanks to you that I've been able to witness Old Vanarana, and lay eyes on our original home. Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Arama: ...Thank you, Aramaha, Araji, and Arayama, thank you for guarding the seal. Marana eventually managed to escape to the outside world, but it's not your fault.
Arama: Now, I shall undo the seal which has existed for hundreds and thousands of moons...
Arama: May the new drea{RUBY#[S]Vanarana}ms never experience Marana's corrosion, and may the old stor{RUBY#[S]Vanarana}ies be forgotten alongside it.
Black Screen Text: "May the new dreams never experience Marana's corruption, and may the old stories be forgotten alongside it."
"May the green fields and mountains never wither. May the streams stay clear and the flowers remain in bloom."
"Friends will stroll through the forest again. That which is good will return, and the painful memories will vanish. Just like a stream purifying itself or a withered tree sprouting once more."
Paimon: The seal's been lifted! Is the path forward... downward?
Arama: Yeah, the second seal is up next. Let's go.

## Talk 13

Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME}, would you like to rest?
Traveler: About Aradasha...
Arama: Aradasha is very strong. In the stories, a very, very long time ago, there was once a metal beast the size of a mountain, and it could spit fire like shooting light beams.
Arama: But Aradasha bested the beast and imprisoned it with a lock of stone! He saved many Aranara!
Arama: His legend was as dazzling as the sun, and many Aranara wished for their Ararakalari to be as powerful as his!
Traveler: About the disaster...
Arama: It was very scary! Even the sky turned black. Trees swayed like a field of grass under strong winds, and they all fell to the ground. And then very, very scary monsters were everywhere.
Arama: Many of the monsters in the memories I obtained look very much like the monsters we've seen. Like the black dogs, the huge metal beasts, and the hilinara.
Arama: Marana appeared during the disaster too, and many grasslands were turned to sand. That's why we fought Marana and sealed its avatar underground.
Traveler: About the seal...
Arama: The seal was made by many Aranara. We... They wanted to imprison Marana and stop it from harming Aranara, Nara, and the earth.
Arama: Later on, Marana slowly seeped into the ground like water. But we were in the dreams already and unaware that it had turned out so terrifying...
Traveler: No. Let's get it over with first.
Arama: #Alright! Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME}, and good luck!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Paimon never thought that there'd be such a deep space beneath the sands...
Arama: The earth is made of soil, stone, sand, and tree roots. So if sand is removed, a very, very large space will appear. Aranara, Nara, and animals can move within it.
Arama: But more sand should have vanished to make more space and let us go deeper. Bad sand.
Paimon: Paimon saw many ruin machines while descending... So a fierce battle really did occur here...
Arama: Yes. The monsters here and the monsters in the Ashvattha Tree's dream, I've seen them in the memories too — the black dogs and huge metal beasts.
Paimon: Let's look for a way to go further down!
Arama: Okay!

## Talk 15

Arama: Bad sand. Rough and coarse. Ugh, green grass won't grow from it.
Arama: There's a very, very huge Valuka outside the forest, and there are Nara in it. Nara must be suffering.

## Talk 16

Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME}! Paimon! I'm glad you're alright!
Paimon: #Yeah! Paimon's fine! But {NICKNAME} always has it rough! Are you alright?
Traveler: Don't worry about me.
Paimon: Paimon didn't expect to see a space like this here... Paimon doesn't sense The Withering either...
Arama: #This should be the final seal. Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, for coming here with me. Marana's Avatar should be close by now.
Arama: Once we defeat Marana's Avatar, I'll plant a new Ashvattha Tree, and then it'll produce the Bija for us.
Paimon: Then let's finish this! We'll help Rana and complete Arana's request.
Arama: Yes!
Arama: But I don't have enough memories. I don't know how to undo this seal...
Paimon: Don't worry, it's not a big place. Paimon's certain we'll find something if we look around!
Paimon: Arama, you rest and build up your strength! You'll need it if you plan to fight Marana's Avatar!
Arama: Alright! I'll rest well!
Traveler: I'm a little tired...
Traveler: Piece of cake.

## Talk 17

Mural: (A mural of many Aranara with their fronts — or backs — facing something strange. There's a golden Aranara with them.)

## Talk 18

Mural: (A mural of many Aranara with their fronts — or backs — facing something strange. There's a golden Aranara with them...)
Mural: (No, there seems to be a change in the mural. There are two golden Aranara now.)

## Talk 19

Mural: (A mural of some Aranara forming a circle.)

## Talk 20

Mural: (Four Aranara, one golden Aranara, and a column... Or is that a tree trunk? It's hard to tell since the drawing is rather vague.)
Mural: (...The scene looks somewhat familiar.)

## Talk 21

Mural: (A mural of three Aranara and a golden Aranara. They seem to be entering a huge whirlpool.)

## Talk 22

Aranara House: (This seems to be the home of some Aranara, and looks just like those houses in Vanarana. But its "owner" is nowhere to be found.)
Aranara House: (If Aranara don't need to rest, why do they need houses?)

## Talk 23

Vine Thicket: (Vines that have completely sealed the path off. There doesn't seem to be a way through.)

## Talk 24

Pool: (Cool and clean water. It's impossible to tell where the water came from.)

## Talk 25

Arama: #If only Nara {NICKNAME} was here very, very long ago. Then you could have fought the huge metal beasts with Aramuhukunda, Aradasha, and the others!
Traveler: What was that?
Arama: #While Nara {NICKNAME} was fighting just now, I could sense that the huge metal beast was very bad. It absorbs Marana's strength and grows stronger.
Arama: #It would be exhausting for Nara {NICKNAME} if the battle went on. Then I remembered! In my memories, Aradasha used this Ararakalari to trap and destroy many huge metal beasts.
Arama: So, I tried his Ararakalari, and I hit it very, very hard.
Traveler: So, where are we?
Arama: I don't know. This place doesn't exist in the memories I received. It feels like the home of Aranara, but it shouldn't be like this...
Arama: But this place is very good. No Marana, and there's water, light, and grass.
Traveler: See you.
Arama: Yes! This place is very good. We can rest.

## Talk 26

Aramuhukunda: ...I'm glad that you understand. Arama, help your friends, and let the new Ashvattha Tree become the anchor of Aranara's dreams once more.
Arama: I'll live up to your legacy. Aramuhukunda's name has filled us with courage since many, many moons ago, and that will not change for many, many moons to come.
Arama: We will defeat Marana's Avatar. With your memories, I hear everyone call out to you, and it fills me with more than just courage, with pride as well.
Aramuhukunda: I believe in you. Like clouds know they have to release rain, the rain knows that it must fall onto the ground. Meeting all of you made me realize... that the time has finally come. I'm very happy.
Aramuhukunda: Now, I can finally return to Sarva and meet Nara Varuna again.

Inscription of Remembrance: ...
Traveler: (Try to sense the memories within the inscription...)
Inscription of Remembrance: We will be victorious. The living will overcome the dead, and we'll meet again one day in Sarva.
Inscription of Remembrance: "Friends will stroll through the forest again. That which is good will return, and the painful memories will vanish. Just like a stream purifying itself or a withered tree sprouting once more."
Inscription of Remembrance: ...This is my inscription. Goodbye.
