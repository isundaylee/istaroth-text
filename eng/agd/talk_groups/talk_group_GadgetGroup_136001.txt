Old Storyteller Raven: Now then, children, what tale would you like to hear today?
Traveler: I'd like to hear the story of the childhood friends.
Old Storyteller Raven: Alright then. Once upon time, there was a pair of childhood friends. They grew up together and loved each other dearly, but both of them were too shy to say so. Their love only bore fruit once well-meaning people gave them a push...
Old Storyteller Raven: But the good times did not last, and while they were out playing, they were attacked by monsters. The young lad sacrificed himself to let the other escape...
Old Storyteller Raven: Ah, yet do not fret, for the young lad's cries for help were heard by a passing hero who rescued him. Thus were the two childhood friends reunited.
Old Storyteller Raven: And they lived happily ever after.
Traveler: I'd like to hear the story of the person who wished to become a guard.
Old Storyteller Raven: Haha, sure. Once upon a time, there was a young man who looked up to his brother, and wanted to be a castle guard and serve Her Highness the Prinzessin...
Old Storyteller Raven: But this was no easy task. He could only sneak into the palace each day to study what it takes to become a guard. And he studied hard indeed, tiring himself out so much that he would fall asleep in the elevator...
Old Storyteller Raven: The day he was about to become a guard, someone discovered that he had used the palace facilities. This vexed him greatly, as he feared that he would not be able to become a guard were he to be discovered...
Old Storyteller Raven: Yet the person held true and did not tell on him, and so did this young fellow become an excellent guard.
Old Storyteller Raven: And so, too, would this story be passed down in tales.
Traveler: I'd like to hear the story of the brave person who pushed the limits...
Old Storyteller Raven: Hehe, alright. Once upon a time, there was a person most bold. He longed to soar through the skies, to feel the rush of wind against his body. He hankered after the unfettered freedom to be found above the clouds.
Old Storyteller Raven: So he feared neither nimbus nor gale, and he pierced through storms and great waves. Many times he was struck down and many times did he fail, but just as many times did he set out once more... Until one day, he became a master of flight.
Old Storyteller Raven: None could match his deeds, and so he retired in glory... They say that he lives as a recluse on this island and that any who wish to receive his tutelage must go to a lone tower in the skies.
