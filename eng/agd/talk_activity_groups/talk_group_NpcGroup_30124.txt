Xiao: #...Traveler.
Xiao: You're here.
Xiao: I'm guessing this Lantern Rite is the same as every year.
Xiao: The demons have retreated and the humans are safe and well. If Pervases knew... it would be a lifelong wish come true for him.
Traveler: Xiao...
Xiao: I trust you're not here to invite me to watch the fireworks in the city?
Traveler: Guilty as charged.
Xiao: I think I'll be fine right here.
Xiao: As long as the fireworks fly high enough, you can see them from wherever you are. Besides, if anyone wishes to see me, I know they'll come and find me.
Xiao: So whether I'm here or in the city... it makes no difference.
