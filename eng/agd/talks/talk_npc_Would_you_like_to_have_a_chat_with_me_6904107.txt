# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mona: Alright, I'm in good spirits. Is there anything you wish to know?
Traveler: I want to hear some of your knowledge!
Mona: Oh... how studious of you.
Mona: I am indisputably an erudite scholar, for my learning encompasses the stars above and earth below.
Mona: ...But it would consume a considerable amount of time to explain the tenets of astrology...
Mona: For now, some practical advice will do!
Traveler: Oh? Like what?
Mona: Hmm... For instance, ingredients approaching their expiration date can be used to create very cost-effective meals as long as you thoroughly cook them with the appropriate cooking methods.
Mona: Many stores have monthly sales. Find an opportune time to stock up on grains and dried foods. As staple foods, they will keep you feeling full for a long time.
Mona: Also... Processing your own meat products is much cheaper than buying them ready-made.
Traveler: Your knowledge is all about saving money...
Mona: Ah...! Huh!
Mona: How impolite of you to generalize it as such!
Mona: These techniques are all a crucial element of living a disciplined life. They are the result of refinement of the objective laws of the world.
Mona: Sâ€”So I'll be stricter with you. You need to be more disciplined if you are to understand this world's truths!
Traveler: Got it!
Mona: Heh, you will understand how useful these are once you try.
Mona: After you have mastered these, I will impart more of the secret wonders hidden deep within this world.
Traveler: You seem to have a lot of life experience...
Mona: Well, of course!
