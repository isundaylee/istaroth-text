Traveler: What sort of case was that?
Nolette: *sigh* Actually, I spotted a photographer doing business at the plaza some time back, and I went to have a picture taken.
Nolette: I walked about until dinner time, and when I was about to eat, I felt someone touch my wallet! Shame that the kid was too quick, though — I couldn't keep up...
Nolette: But just the next day, one of my juniors came up to me and told me that the wallet had been retrieved — and indeed, the photo taken of me had helped to crack a big case!
Nolette: *sigh* It saddens me to say this, but I didn't really help much... If I had been fast enough to catch that fellow then...
Nolette: *cough* Don't worry about me, though. My bones are still sturdy! I'll get him next time...
