# Prophets of Pop


## Talk 1

Milu Nui: Seriously, there's no getting through to Pakaa... He doesn't understand my musical ideals at all!
Traveler: What happened?
Milu Nui: Hmm? You're a... traveler? Greetings. Call me Milu Nui. I'm a musician.
Milu Nui: If you've been to Xochicuicatl Records, you'll have seen my records in the pop music section.
Milu Nui: They contain all that I understand of "pop" itself.
Milu Nui: It's just that Pakaa doesn't understand me at all, and insists that my music resembles "kiddy music" more than it does "pop."
Milu Nui: And no matter what I say, he wants my records placed in the children's section!
Milu Nui: I mean, yes, children do like my songs, and some parents do buy them as gifts for their kids...
Milu Nui: But in truth, children are the keenest listeners! And there's a lot of them in the tribe anyhow...
Milu Nui: So if my records are so popular amongst the kids, I should have a spot in the pop section!
Traveler: That... does make some sense...
Milu Nui: Right? Hmph! I knew Pakaa was just being his usual ignorant self. But no more! Once I'm done writing this new song, he'll have no choice but to admit how impressed he is!
Milu Nui: Not that I trust his taste in music anymore, though... Anyway, traveler, how familiar would you call yourself with music?
Traveler: Uhh...
Milu Nui: Do you play an instrument? It's fine if you just sing or hum!
Traveler: I'm as musically versatile as they come.
Milu Nui: Awesome! In that case, I'm sure you'll understand my philosophy of music!
Milu Nui: Someone like you is exactly who I need if I'm to create this all-new jam.
Milu Nui: Don't worry, I'll have a most ample reward ready — it'll be well worth your while.
Milu Nui: Alright then. Just use your intuition, and tell me — what should I do first to create an excellent piece of music?
Traveler: Not in the slightest...
Milu Nui: No matter! Only someone like you can truly enjoy music from the heart. I'm sure your judgment will be all the more objective and fair for it.
Traveler: You could consider it "children's pop."
Traveler: And what are these musical ideals you speak of?

## Talk 2

Milu Nui: Look at those birds, listen to their cries! My, oh my, if those wouldn't make excellent material for my next work!
Milu Nui: Still, things could get pretty one-note if we only recorded a few of them. If we could find a whole flock and record the sound of their collective calls...
Milu Nui: Hang on, that's a Koholasaurus just up ahead. You hear how it scratches the stone with its claws?
Milu Nui: Koholasaurs are the sensitive sort, so let's not get too close. I'll get some professionals from our tribe to gather what I need afterward — if anyone can pull this off, it'd be them.
Milu Nui: Oh, ho... warriors testing themselves against one another. Good, good, the sounds of battle are lovely indeed...
Angry Tribal Warrior: Oi! What're you skulking about for? You here for a fight?
Milu Nui: We're just... gathering materials...
Angry Tribal Warrior: Gathering? Well, I'll show you "gathering"!
Milu Nui: #H—Help! {NICKNAME}, stop him!

## Talk 3

Traveler: We should hear from customers first.
Milu Nui: Well, that... I don't disagree, and I've actually made some inquiries myself...
Milu Nui: But it feels like they just default to pleasantries when they see me, so I never get to hear their honest opinions.
Milu Nui: #{NICKNAME}, could you help me ask around instead?
Milu Nui: I imagine they'll... feel more comfortable being honest with you.

## Talk 4

Traveler: You could try gathering some sound samples...
Milu Nui: Sounds...? Oh, do you mean to say that we could sample the sounds of nature and use them directly in the songs?
Milu Nui: Hmm... That does sound like a good idea. Yes, very good indeed! See, I knew you were a sharp shovel! Come on, let's get going!
Traveler: Wait, you're not bringing anything with you?
Milu Nui: Of course not. Or are you expecting me to drag a gramophone around out there?
Milu Nui: Don't worry, we're just going to see what sorts of sounds we can use.
Milu Nui: A duck flapping its wings, for instance, or the splash made as a Koholasaurus hits the water, or the rumbling footsteps of a Tepetlisaurus walking...
Milu Nui: Once we've selected out targets, I'll make the preparations to take those sound samples... but that's all for later.
Milu Nui: As for the here and now, let's head out — time's a-wasting!

## Talk 5

Haloa Nui: Ooh, a new record! The baby Saurian's gonna love this!
Traveler: Tell me about Milu Nui's music...
Haloa Nui: I love Uncle Milu's songs — and really, the baby Saurian we have back home loves them more than I do!
Haloa Nui: Whenever it gets too rowdy, Mom plays one of his songs, and then it quiets down real quick.
Haloa Nui: Hmm... Those songs are super long, though. I can barely remember the lyrics, let alone sing 'em for it...
Haloa Nui: Hehe, if he could write some songs with fewer lyrics, I'd be able to sing them every day for that kid's listening pleasure!

## Talk 6

Mahina Nui: Mr. Milu's released a new record! Should I buy it or not...
Traveler: Tell me about Milu Nui's music...
Mahina Nui: Hmm? Oh, he's great! Haloa and the baby Saurian love it.
Mahina Nui: Every time they get all rowdy and stubborn and don't wanna sleep, I'll play them Mr. Milu's "Spring-Day Song."
Mahina Nui: As soon as they hear it, they're asleep in no time — voila, sweet dreams, see you tomorrow.
Mahina Nui: Still, though... Haloa has been saying that she'd prefer something a bit more intense.
Mahina Nui: If Mr. Milu could come up with a couple of tunes with a bit more energy, I'm sure she'd have more fun with 'em.

## Talk 7

Haloa Nui: Hehe, if he could write some songs with fewer lyrics, I'd be able to sing them every day for that kid's listening pleasure!

## Talk 8

Milu Nui: How did it go? Did they have any feedback?
Traveler: I've heard these opinions...
Black Screen Text: You convey the customer feedback to Milu Nui...
Milu Nui: A—Ah. Is that how things are? Thank you, the feedback is quite valuable. Let me see what I can change...
Milu Nui: Still, from the sound of it... aren't they all treating my records like kids' songs!?
Milu Nui: ...No, no, all the more reason to make some changes... Still, where do I begin?

### Additional Talk 5

Milu Nui: #Phew! You're quite the dab hand yourself, aren't you, {NICKNAME}?
Milu Nui: You seem good at persuading the more agitated types...
Traveler: That wasn't even my full power.
Milu Nui: I could tell. In every possible aspect... it is quite obvious.
Milu Nui: Well, that was quite the adventure, but either way, I've selected plenty of sounds to sample.
Milu Nui: After just a bit of prep work, I'll be able to officially start recording the audio...
Milu Nui: Hmm... We should start with the "sounds of battle"...
Milu Nui: Wait, no. That's not a good place to begin. We should open up with something more normal...
Traveler: I thought it went okay.
Milu Nui: That's very modest of you. Thank you, in any case.

### Additional Talk 6

Tirda: ...Milu's style is the same as ever.
Traveler: Tell me about Milu Nui's music...
Tirda: Hmm? Oh, I love his style of composition. I listen to his songs after work. Really helps me relax.
Tirda: But if you asked me personally, I'd call his lyrics... a bit, well, overly complex.
Tirda: *sigh* I wish he'd make a record without lyrics, y'know? Only instrumental tracks.

Milu Nui: Pop... *sigh* What is pop, anyway?
Traveler: And how are you going with your musical ideals?
Milu Nui: #Ah, {NICKNAME}, a pleasure to see you again! As for my musical ideals, I can only say that... I'm hard at work seeking a breakthrough.
Milu Nui: *sigh* But what sort of "pop" is everyone looking, really? And how is "pop" supposed to feel?
Milu Nui: #I know you're someone who appreciates music, {NICKNAME}.
Milu Nui: So please, would you mind giving me some more suggestions based on your intuition? What should I do first to create an excellent piece of music?
