Traveler: What do you have to report?
Fusilier: Changes in the local hydrological environment, the way those meka operate in the wild, and... some residual Arkhium energy flow.
Fusilier: I think these energy flows are just remnants from the explosion. Some shattered Arkhium crystals were washed down here, but it's not like there's anything serious going on.
Fusilier: But just to be on the safe side, I'll compile a report and send it back to the Institute.
Fusilier: ...But I don't want to set foot in the Fontaine Research Institute ever again, if I can help it.
