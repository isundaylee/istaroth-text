# Talk Dialog

Iron Tongue Tian: Have you heard? This year's Lantern Rite has a new event: a musical performance!
Iron Tongue Tian: If you want to fit in, you should talk about music.
Iron Tongue Tian: But it's hard to attract an audience when you have a romantic atmosphere without a powerful scene...
Iron Tongue Tian: Do you think it's possible to combine singing and fighting?
Iron Tongue Tian: Winning a battle while being accompanied by a dynamic rhythm... Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Iron Tongue Tian: You wouldn't be able to hear of this story from my fellow, Tea Master Liu Su. All he does is talk about dry, prissy, genteel stuff!
