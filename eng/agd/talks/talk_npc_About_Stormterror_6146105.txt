Nimrod: While the concrete losses weren't heavy, I'm still shaking right now.
Nimrod: You can laugh if you want, but I really thought we were done for back there.
Nimrod: Never mind not being able to drink. As long as my wife Eury was safe, I thought then, I would be alright even if I never drank another drop again in my life!
Nimrod: Ahem... But since all's well now, I suppose we shouldn't take such rash words too seriously, eh? Hahaha...
