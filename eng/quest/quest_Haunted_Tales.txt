# Haunted Tales


## Talk 1

Paimon: Well, the second round of the Test of Courage is about to begin.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon wonders if the shrine maiden knows anything about what Heizou told us... Let's go ask her.

## Talk 2

Arataki Itto: Hahaha! I've gotcha now!
Kappa: Ah, just run! Don't worry about me!
Arataki Itto: Hah! Don't underestimate this oni! None of you are getting away today!
Paimon: Hey, it's Itto! It looks like he captured those three we were looking for!
Paimon: Let's go see!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh, another stall? It sure looks familiar...
Paimon: Wait, this is the same stall we saw earlier!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Something just fell from above! Ah, keep it away from Paimon!!!

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: C'mon, let's go. We can't let anyone beat us to it!

## Talk 6

Sayu: Something just fell from above...

## Talk 7

Sayu: I can hear your teeth chattering, Paimon. You must be really scared.
Sayu: I understand, I'm scared too...
Paimon: What? Paimon's teeth aren't chattering.
Sayu: But I heard a rattling sound... Was that not you?
Paimon: It's definitely not Paimon! Wait... It seems to be coming from inside the shrine!
Paimon: There's something over there...

## Talk 8

Sayu: It's so dark here. It's hard to make out anything.
Sayu: It's so dim that Paimon almost looks like a flying Lavender Melon...
Paimon: Hey, that's not Paimon! It doesn't look anything like me!
Paimon: Paimon's over here!
Sayu: Ah! It's a... Lavender Melon ghost!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or is there an eerie shadow over there?
Sayu: Ah... You're right... Run!

## Talk 10

Sayu: I usually like to hide here and take a nap...
Sayu: Don't worry. There doesn't appear to be anything scary here.

## Talk 11

Paimon: We've been running for so long that Paimon's starting to get thirsty.
Paimon: Oh look, there's a stall set up. Let's go buy something to drink.
Sayu: Good idea!
Paimon: Hello? Anyone here? Strange, there's nobody around.
Sayu: Oh, I dunno... This stall looks kinda spooky.
Paimon: Waaaah! You're right, it's starting to creep Paimon out! Let's just get outta here!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Ah, it's back again! Maybe it's following us. Ah, help!

## Talk 13

Paimon: Huh, another stall? It sure looks familiar...
Paimon: Wait, this is the same stall we saw earlier!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Ah, it's b—b—back again! Maybe it's following us!
Thoma: I'm not sure whose stall this is, but pestering people to buy your stuff is definitely a poor business practice...

## Talk 15

Thoma: Good thing these lanterns are here, they sure make the path a lot brighter.
Paimon: You think so? Paimon thinks they look a little spooky...
Thoma: Haha, I don't think there's any reason to worry.
Thoma: Despite what the lanterns look like, whoever placed them here probably didn't mean any harm.
Thoma: Believe me, there's plenty of other options if they intended to cause us harm. Alright, let's continue, shall we?

## Talk 16

Thoma: Wait, where are you going?

## Talk 17

Thoma: I'm feeling a little worn out myself, let's stop and take a break for a while.

## Talk 18

Yoimiya: Really? Lemme see... Oh! It's some Onikabuto!

## Talk 19

Yoimiya: Hey, did you guys hear that?
Paimon: Huh? Hear what?

## Talk 20

Yoimiya: That's strange... How did Paimon transform into a Lavender Melon?
Paimon: Hey, Paimon's over here! That doesn't even look like Paimon!
Yoimiya: Hmm? So, what in the world is this...? Hey, it's flying away. Don't go! Let me have a look at ya!

## Talk 21

Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or is there an eerie shadow over there?
Yoimiya: Oh, you're right! That wasn't there when we arrived!
Yoimiya: There's clearly no one around, but there's a shadow on the ground. Oh, this is like a real kaidan story!

## Talk 22

Paimon: Phew... This should be far enough.
Yoimiya: Are you tired, Paimon? Do you want to take a break?

## Talk 23

Yoimiya: Hmm? What is this stall doing here? Maybe it's for participants who need a break?
Yoimiya: Excuse me! Three glasses of juice, please...
Yoimiya: Hehe! Don't worry, this time it's on me!
Paimon: Yay! Thanks, Yoimiya.
Yoimiya: Uh, excuse me! Anyone here? Strange... seems like no one's around. Guess we'll just have to keep going.

## Talk 24

Paimon: Huh, another stall? It sure looks familiar...
Paimon: Wait, this is the same stall we saw earlier!

## Talk 25

Paimon: Ah, it's back again! Maybe it's following us. Ah, help!

## Talk 26

Yoimiya: Wow, look at all the lanterns here! It's so beautiful!
Yoimiya: But now that I look closer, it seems like the lanterns are floating in midair. How is that possible?
Paimon: Uh, that's definitely not normal!
Yoimiya: #Hey {NICKNAME}, can I borrow your shoulders for a second? You can give me a boost and I'll pull one of them down!
Paimon: No! Now's not the time!

## Talk 27

Yoimiya: You want to explore somewhere else? Uh, how about we finish the Test of Courage first!
