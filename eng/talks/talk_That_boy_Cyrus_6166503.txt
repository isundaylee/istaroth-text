Traveler: That... boy, Cyrus?
Iris: Yes, Cyrus is my younger brother.
Iris: We used to go on adventures together â€” you could say that we were quite the famous duo, too.
Iris: But he's been tied down by all sorts of trivial matters ever since taking up the role of branch master of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild. We haven't traveled together in quite some time.
Iris: I did receive an offer to become a Guild branch master myself, but I refused. As far as I'm concerned, it's much easier to be a regular adventurer.
