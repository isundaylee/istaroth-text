# Adventurer's Flower

## Piece 1: Adventurer's Flower

Description: A resilient flower that survived the harsh environment of an ancient city. It is now proudly worn like a medal.
Story:

An old, golden goblet that the adventurer used to drink water. It is said that he found it in an old ruin.
The exterior is engraved with ancient symbols and inlaid with a faded gemstone.
Eventually, the adventurer bid farewell to the nomadic lifestyle.
This old, golden goblet was traded in for new, shiny Mora.

## Piece 2: Adventurer's Tail Feather

Description: The feather of an exotic bird rarely seen on this continent.
Story:

An adventurer once traveled through a forest in search of rare beasts never seen before.
As he tore his way recklessly through the foliage, the adventurer tripped on a tree root.
When he regained consciousness, he saw a girl so beautiful that he was willing to give up the adventurer's life to be with her.
Her appearance was surreal, with a cluster of feathers adorning her hair.

## Piece 3: Adventurer's Pocket Watch

Description: It's easy to lose track of time when you're adventuring where the sun doesn't shine, whether that's the depths of the abyss or the ruins of a lost city.
Story:

There is nothing special about this green bandana, save that the fabric is rather robust and highly absorbent.
Just like the bandana, its wearer was an unexceptional, ordinary person.
But countless secrets lie hidden in the stars high up above and the abyss deep down below.
All of these things are awaiting discovery by mere mortals.

## Piece 4: Adventurer's Golden Goblet

Description: The spoils of one of an adventurer's many expeditions. Though a little damaged, it is still an excellent find.
Story:

The ambitious adventurer came across this resilient flower in the depths of a gloomy ruin.
Moved by the sight of life sprouting in defiance of a lifeless land, he almost forgot about the treasures buried deep in the ruin.
After pausing to ponder it for a while, the adventurer plucked the flower, wore it as a brooch, and ventured forth into the darkness.

## Piece 5: Adventurer's Bandana

Description: A cloth garment worn at the forehead. Though soaked in sweat and covered in dust, it still beams with an adventurer's pride.
Story:

A pocket watch that once belonged to an adventurer. It was crafted by a master watchmaker with simplicity and practicality in mind, aligning with the philosophy of the Adventurers' Guild.
The adventurer spent most of his days in darkness. The rhythmic sound of its moving hands was the only proof he had of the passage of time.
Long after he had grown accustomed to a normal life, having given up the adventurer lifestyle he once loved so dearly, 
this forgotten pocket watch still sat quietly in the cabinet, waiting for its next adventure.
