# Festival Afterword

Mamoru: Bad news!
Traveler: What happened?
Mamoru: Boss got arrested again!
Mamoru: Just now, someone from the Tenryou Commission came to post a notice on the bulletin board saying our festival has to be suspended.
Mamoru: I don't know what happened. I think maybe the boss sent some flyers to Tenshukaku.
Mamoru: He did say that the Shogun would definitely not wanna miss the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, after all!
Akira: Hmm... Well, I think Boss is right. The Almighty Shogun would definitely wanna come to the festival.
Genta: Yeah... don't you agree?
Mamoru: Come on, who cares what we think?
Mamoru: Anyway, the boss was arrested on the spot by the Okuzumeshuu. They took him to the Tenryou Commission.
Traveler: What are you going to do?
Mamoru: Shinobu's probably on the case by now.
Mamoru: I heard the Okuzumeshuu charged the boss with causing a disturbance in a restricted military zone.
Mamoru: Then Madam Kujou Sara changed it to obstructing the public order.
Genta: Ahhhhh, that despicable Kujou Tengu! How can she get away with charging Boss with a felony over something like this!
Mamoru: You idiot! That's a misdemeanor, she downgraded the offense. Usually, you just get a warning for that...
Mamoru: Anyway, I guess we'll just have to wait until the boss gets out before seeing what to do about the festival.
Mamoru: Don't worry, Traveler. With Shinobu on the case, everything's gonna turn out just fine.
Mamoru: You've been so supportive of our festival. When the boss gets out, I'm sure he'll want to thank you in person!
Mamoru: I hope your journey, like our festival, will go from strength to strength.
Mamoru (Arataki Gang Members): From strength to strength!
