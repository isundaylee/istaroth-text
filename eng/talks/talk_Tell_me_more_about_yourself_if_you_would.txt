Traveler: Tell me more about yourself, if you would...
Suling: I'm the Alcor's chief smith. I'm also in charge of all the weapons used in this fleet.
Suling: If you're looking for a metalsmith, go hit Hanfeng's Ironmongers up. The boss there, Master Zhang, is my cousin. His craft is the finest there is in Liyue Harbor.
Suling: When it comes to smithing metals, I'm not his equal... but if we talk about familiarity with weapons, I don't believe myself inferior to anyone.
Suling: I joined Captain Beidou's crew to get a chance to look at rare and unusual weaponry.
