# Ororon Voicelines

## Hello
Oh, hello. I'm Ororon from the Masters of the Night-Wind. Want some vegetables?
Oh, don't worry — I'm not trying to sell anything to you or get anything in return. There's no rhyme or reason for it, really. I just like to see what every seed grows up to be, so I end up with a lot of produce. As long as my vegetables wind up in the stomach of someone who enjoys them, that's all that matters.

## Chat: Weirdos
Someone told you the Masters of the Night-Wind is a tribe of weirdos? Huh, who else is there? Thought I was the only one.

## Chat: Target
Having a favorite animal, or vegetable or fruit, can help us recognize what kind of people we want to become.

## Chat: Smoke
Sometimes, a shrouded path is not meant to be walked. Move forward with blind ambition, and the smoke might suffocate you.

## When It Rains
If I run, mud will get on my clothes. If I fly... the rain will make my cape too heavy. Better find somewhere to wait out the weather.

## When Thunder Strikes
Lightning bolts remind me of snakes. I wonder if people use their shape and appearance to divine the future... On second thought, that seems a little dangerous.

## When It Snows
...There are things buried beneath the snow. Careful, now — let's not wake them up.

## When the Sun Is Out
The sun is an eternal flame, and the people of Natlan never shy away from meeting its gaze head-on. Of course, sunglasses are always an option if it gets too intense.

## In the Desert
Can anything... even grow here? Maybe we should leave.

## Good Morning
Sorry. My eyes are open, but I'm still half-asleep... Can this wait?

## Good Afternoon
My stomach says it's time for lunch, but I can't think of anything to eat... Maybe my brain is still asleep.

## Good Evening
I could really go for some sparkling coffee flavored with Saurian Claw Succulent. I take mine black... Huh? You should only drink coffee in the morning? Well then... Good morning.

## Good Night
My brain is always wide awake this time of night, so go ahead and rest. I used to try and force myself to fall asleep, but I gave up a long time ago. I think I'll just go check on the radishes instead.

## About Ororon: Communication
I know I say things that are hard to understand sometimes. If you're ever confused, just ask me. I don't mind.

## About Ororon: Unsolved Mystery
I don't know where I come from, but that doesn't bother me too much... I care more about where I'm going.

## About Us: Apology
I'm sorry... No, I'm more than sorry. I know lying to you right out of the gate didn't make the best first impression. I have explained to you the reasons why, and I promise I spoke only the truth. Still, it's okay if you don't accept my apology. If that's the case, I'll try to stay out of your way.

## About Us: Thank-You Gifts
Here, this is a Saurian claw succulent picked at four in the morning, a Quenepa Berry bigger than my head, the sweetest batch of honey from last week, and... Oh! And a voucher for a free appointment with Cacucu.
Huh? Why do you look confused? It's a thank you for all your help. I wasn't sure if you needed anything, so I just went with gifts that I like.
Oh, who's Cacucu? A saurian. I'll introduce you sometime.

## About the Vision
Some people say lightning helps crops grow. So, I tried using my Vision in the middle of my vegetable field once, but the cabbages and tomatoes didn't like it, so I gave up.

## Something to Share
Here's a tip — don't be the first person to put yourself out there. The first fruit that ripens is the easiest target, and people work the same way. Those who take the initiative usually wind up with the short end of the stick.

## Interesting Things
Flying squirrels may seem like proud and aloof creatures when they glide through the air, but they're much more cunning than they look, always zooming in from nowhere, clinging to you until they get a treat... Little rascals, honestly.

## About Xilonen
She seems to enjoy relaxing in high places, especially trees. In my experience, hanging upside down from a tree branch is more relaxing than lying on top of one. Maybe I should share that with her sometime... What? But don't we all need a change of perspective every now and then? Shouldn't that be even more true for an inventor like Xilonen?

## About Kinich
Ajaw is an interesting case. He's old, but also young... And Kinich is just the opposite — young, but also old. You know what I mean, right?

## About Chasca
Chasca is famous for a reason. She's an amazing mediator. The minute she shows up, all the fighting stops, and everyone starts shaking hands like the best of friends. She has a pretty convincing method, apparently — "armed deterrence"... Not a bad name.

## About Ifa
Ifa may scold his patients a lot, but he actually has a great relationship with the saurians. Whenever he has some time off, he'd play the guitar in front of the clinic, and a bunch of saurians would gather around and sing along.
Although, it's more like noise than actual singing. I like to join in when I'm around, too... with the saurians, I mean.

## About Citlali
Granny is actually a very straightforward person. She wears her emotions on her sleeve, you know? It's hard for her to hide what she's feeling. You're the same age as her, right? Or... are you even older?
Sorry, I shouldn't ask. That was probably rude... But, if I'm right, maybe you could spend more time together. Granny's been surrounded by people younger than her for a long time, and she's probably had enough. I know she'll be happy to see you.

## About Iansan
Iansan is a famous sports coach, and well... All I can say is, I'm grateful the Pyro Archon didn't send her after me. I may have an advantage when it comes to height, but I'm pretty sure she can outrun me... Oh, the smoke-cloud trick? Heh, after you use it a bunch, people start to see it coming.

## About Mavuika
I didn't really know the Pyro Archon before all this.
I mean, I knew of her, but I didn't KNOW know her, you know? I used to think of her like a totem engraved with the word "strength," like a symbol of total power and control. But, it never went deeper than that, so doubt started to creep in.
Now that I know her better, I feel grateful, but I'm also a little disappointed in myself... She seems so sure of her purpose. She has a fire inside her and knows exactly why it burns, so she won't ever let the flames go out. I want that... I want to be someone who can help Natlan.
Anyway, so there's that, and um... I also noticed her eating a lot of leafy vegetables at the victory feast. When I asked her about it, she said she likes to keep a balanced diet. Kinda surprised me somehow. I guess she's more mindful of the little things than I expected.

## About The Captain
Meeting The Captain was a strange and unexpected twist of fate for me.
My tribe is known for our ability to predict the future, but I never expected things would turn out so complicated. Is helping someone really about trading favors until the score is even? If so, why do I still feel so indebted to him? So grateful for what he did for me?
Or... maybe I'm overthinking everything. No matter what happened in the past, he helped save Natlan's Ley Lines. He's a hero worthy of respect, and I'll always remember him.

## More About Ororon: I
Hello. Oh, a handshake? Our greetings aren't usually so formal in Natlan, but... Okay, we can shake hands. In the future, you can just shout at me from afar. I have good hearing, so I won't miss it.

## More About Ororon: II
You always seem so busy. I want to be like that, too — the kind of person who always has something to do. Then again, sometimes I like doing nothing at all. I keep flipping back and forth. It's annoying, but I can't help it.

## More About Ororon: III
In Natlan, it gets really hot during the day, so I choose to go out at night if possible. The moonlight makes the surface of the water glisten. Have you noticed? Although, at night, the water turns pitch-black. It's impossible to tell how clean it is, so I would avoid contact.

## More About Ororon: IV
I'm more sensitive to souls than most people. I was born that way, but it's also kind of hard to describe... Human souls are like unpredictable masses of energy. Imagine a bunch of little saurian marshmallows of all different kinds... That's basically what a soul looks like. Your soul is warm, like it's been lightly toasted above a glowing fire.

## More About Ororon: V
Other people don't understand me, and to be honest, I don't fully understand myself, either. I have so many doubts, so many unanswered questions, and new ones keep on coming.
But, there's no quick-fix for something like this... Just gotta keep moving forward, right?

## Ororon's Hobbies
Do I have other hobbies? Besides gardening and aphid-watching, you mean? Oh, yes... Of course. Just give me a second. It'll come to me.

## Ororon's Troubles
Sometimes, going from dreaming it to doing it... it's a really tough step.

## Favorite Food
Whenever I eat a Tataco, I like to put an extra tortilla underneath to catch all the ingredients that fall out. That way, you basically get two Tatacos in one.

## Least Favorite Food
Military rations... especially compressed biscuits. They kinda remind me of The Captain's soul, actually... Good at the core, but a little tough.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Wow, even better than what I can make.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Not too strong, not too bland... The flavor is just right.

## Receiving a Gift: III
What avant garde technique is this...? I'm unfamiliar with it.

## Birthday
In Natlan, we believe a person's birthday decides their fate. Sharing a birthday with a great hero means being blessed with their protection and inheriting their character.
I'm not sure the people out there who share your birthday know how lucky they are... Happy Birthday.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
What did you give me just now? Can I have another look?

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
#Maybe I should start calling you "master"... Thank you, Master {M#Gramps}{F#Granny}. I've learned a lot from you.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
My body feels so light... feels like I can get to even higher places now. Still, it's all about control. Hitting my head is no fun.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I am not yet powerful enough to probe the boundaries of death, but thanks to you, the end now seems a little further away. Don't worry — I won't take advantage of that to do any irresponsible things. On that, you have my word.

## Elemental Skill: I
Not too far, now.

## Elemental Skill: II
Farewell.

## Elemental Skill: III
Be free!

## Elemental Burst: I
Go, you're free now.

## Elemental Burst: II
Time to say hello.

## Elemental Burst: III
Tell me what you see.

## Opening Treasure Chest: I
Your passion for treasure-hunting is turning these chests into an endangered species.

## Opening Treasure Chest: II
You can always tell which ones are ripe for the picking by the sound they make when you tap on them.

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
Careful, some saurians like to hide in chests like this — probably an introvert thing.

## Low HP: I
Please, hold up...

## Low HP: II
Not good...!

## Low HP: III
Bad omen.

## Ally at Low HP: I
Need me to get a doctor?

## Ally at Low HP: II
Filling in.

## Fallen: I
See you... in the Night Kingdom.

## Fallen: II
It's getting... dark.

## Fallen: III
The voices... are calling...

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Argh, too slow...

## Heavy Hit Taken: II
Something's wrong...

## Joining Party: I
Want me to join?

## Joining Party: II
Where to?

## Joining Party: III
What's the occasion?
