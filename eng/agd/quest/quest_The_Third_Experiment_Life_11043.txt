# The Third Experiment: Life


## Talk 1

Paimon: You... You want us to jump!? From up here!?
Albedo: Not necessarily â€” not if you know of a better method, that is.
Traveler: We'd better have a better method.
Albedo: Whichever method you choose, the experiment will end when you reach the opposite shore of the lake.
Albedo: I will factor the time expended and your top speed into my comparative analysis.
Paimon: The opposite side of the lake... So... We're gonna be swimming?
Albedo: Without limitations, we complete tasks intuitively using the method that seems most rational to us.
Albedo: Some of us would be unable to stand the icy waters... Others might find the whole thing rather refreshing.
Albedo: No matter what choice you make, it's all a part of the experiment. For me, every detail is invaluable to the research.
Traveler: My kind of experiment.
Albedo: Then if you would, please. I eagerly await the results.
Traveler: This is actually less stressful than the superpower part.
Traveler: That's not very reassuring.

## Talk 3

Paimon: So if we do decide to go swimming, you gonna dive in with us?
Albedo: No, unless you're thinking of conducting competitive research?
Paimon: Oh, uhh... Forget Paimon said anything.
