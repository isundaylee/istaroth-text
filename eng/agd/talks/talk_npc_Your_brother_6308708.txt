Traveler: Your brother?
Tiger Li: That's right! He's a great businessman!
Tiger Li: I heard from our parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
Tiger Li: He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I followed him out to sea in secret!
Tiger Li: But since he misses Mom, I decided to come back together with him.
Tiger Li: I'm not sure when we'll be able to go out together again...
