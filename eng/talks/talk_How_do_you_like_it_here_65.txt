Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Yoimiya: Pretty good! I'm surprised how awesome your place is!
Yoimiya: This is an adeptus relic from Liyue, right? It's incredible. I thought you were joking when you asked me to get into this pot.
Yoimiya: I had no idea what to say, I didn't know if I should object or just follow along...
Traveler: What was your objection going to be?
Yoimiya: Something like, "Are you blind? I can't squeeze into that!"
Yoimiya: Haha, Paimon told me that she had the same reaction when she first saw the pot.
Yoimiya: If she couldn't get in, there would be no chance for me.
Yoimiya: Who would have thought that a little push from you, and poof â€” we're in here!
Yoimiya: A wide open view, fresh air... It's such a nice place!
Traveler: I'm glad you like it.
Yoimiya: Of course I like it. I could easily live here forever.
Yoimiya: *sigh* Maybe I can open a second "Naganohara" here?
Yoimiya: You can invite all of your friends to see the fireworks. Consider it a gift from me to you!
Traveler: What would you have said to humor me?
Yoimiya: Like, "Let me send over 'Tarou the Goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
Yoimiya: I'm sure it'll be able to get in. It's a goldfish after all.
