Traveler: You seem to be enjoying your meal.
Huihui: Enjoying it? How can I? I only came here in the first place because I don't enjoy it; I'm trying to prove a point about the superiority of Li cuisine!
Huihui: I need to experience every last detail of Yue cuisine so I can point out all of its flaws. That's why I've been coming here for the past... year? Huh, it's been so long I can't remember...
Huihui: Ugh... Everything is cooked in such a bland way. The only redeeming feature is that it's freshly caught. Freshness is all they ever talk about; that's the only proof you need that this style of cooking is a complete joke!
