Venti: The tavern closes *at midnight*, right? Then I'll have another drink or two... Don't worry, I won't get drunk.

## Talk 2

Venti: #Great job, Traveler. Now, look at what I can do!
Traveler: Tell me about Dvalin.
Venti: Dvalin used to be my friend... I still regard him as such.
Venti: We used to listen to the songs of the wind and sing Ode to the Dandelion together...
Venti: That's why I remember him as someone gentle.
Venti: Huh? Of course, you're already my friend.
Traveler: Tell me about wine.
Venti: Mondstadt is famous for its wine. It's the city's most prized treasure, I'd say.
Venti: Its dandelion wine is the best!
Venti: Actually, the scent of dandelion in the wind alone is enough to get you drunk.
Venti: Ah, I almost forgot that you're underage. Such a shame...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Venti: I should prepare to meet my old friend.
