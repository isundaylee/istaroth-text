Traveler: That seems suspicious. I'm going to report you.
Terada: Hey! W—W—Wait a minute. What are you doing? Let's talk this out nicely...
Terada: I'm not bothering anyone else, and I'm not up to no good. Just let me be already!
Terada: I'm just a samurai on patrol, that's all. Let's just go our separate ways, please.
Terada: If you keep messing with me like this, outlander, *I'll* report *you* to my superiors! You'd better watch out, because they're gonna come for you!
