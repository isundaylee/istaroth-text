# Warrior's Spirit


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's about time to head over to the Kamisato Estate and pick up Ayaka! Oh, Paimon's been waiting to finally see Ayaka in her exhibition outfit!

## Talk 2

Kamisato Ayaka: What an overwhelming presence... Certainly worthy of being the Almighty Shogun's chosen envoy.
Kamisato Ayaka: But with you by my side, we will emerge victorious. Let's go!

## Talk 3

Yuu: Hey look, Miss Kamisato and the Traveler have arrived!
Sae: Although I've seen illustrations of this outfit before, seeing Miss Kamisato wear it truly brings some unique flair.
Matsumae: It was worth lining up super early to get front-row seats. I'm really looking forward to today's match!
Paimon: Wow, Ayaka became the center of attention the moment she appeared.
Reina: Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. The Warrior's Spirit exhibition match is about to begin. Please enter the arena in an orderly fashion and take your seats.
Reina: Miss Kamisato, Traveler, please come with me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Are you ready, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm ready. Let's go.
Kamisato Ayaka: Good. Let's give it our best. I look forward to fighting beside you.
Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, don't worry, there's still some time. Once you've taken care of everything, we can enter the arena together.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Traveler, Ayaka, we're over here!
Hiiragi Chisato: That was an extraordinary match. I don't know much about swordsmanship, but even I was caught up in the tense atmosphere of the arena. My heart's still pounding even now.
Paimon: Your opponent's moves kept surprising Paimon, but it seems like the two of you were prepared for that.
Kujou Sara: Traveler, Miss Kamisato, congratulations on winning the exhibition match.
Paimon: Hey, it's Sara. You came to watch the competition too?
Kujou Sara: I was ordered by the Almighty Shogun to observe this competition. You two displayed remarkable swordsmanship and cooperation. Not only did you present the beauty of the sword arts to the audience, I was also able to learn quite a bit myself.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm flattered.
Kujou Sara: All of you have been busy with various preparations for the competition. Today marks a perfect ending to this Warrior's Spirit event. Your efforts have been recognized by the Almighty Shogun.
Kujou Sara: I must return to the Tenshukaku and report on what happened at the exhibition match to the Almighty Shogun. Everyone, please excuse me.
Hiiragi Chisato: By the way, does everyone have plans now? If not, why don't we go to Uyuu Restaurant for a victory meal?
Paimon: Great idea! We've been so focused on the competition lately that it's been a while since we've had a good meal! Let's go!
Kamisato Ayaka: Whew...
Traveler: What's wrong, Ayaka?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, it's nothing. The effects of winning are only now starting to sink in. Kujou Sara said that she learned a lot from the fight, and so did I.
Kamisato Ayaka: Although the audience members might not have noticed, there were many moments where I would've been in trouble if it weren't for you by my side drawing away the opponent's attacks.
Kamisato Ayaka: Without you, it would've been impossible for me to win on my own. It's just as I expected, my swordsmanship is still far from your level.
Traveler: Ayaka, you helped me many times as well.
Kamisato Ayaka: Really? Hearing you say that makes me want to spar with you all of a sudden.
Kamisato Ayaka: To tell you the truth, I've been hoping for an opportunity to spar with you ever since we first met. That wish was half fulfilled today at the exhibition match.
Traveler: Next time, we'll find a chance to go a few rounds.
Kamisato Ayaka: Sure. But... until then, make sure you take good care of your sword. If I ever manage to steal it one day, your life will also be in my hands.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe... I've always wanted to say something like that. Did it sound strange?
Traveler: It sounded very much like Miss Orith.
Paimon: Hey, what's the hold-up here? What are you talking about?
Kamisato Ayaka: We were just talking about having a match to determine which of us is the superior swordfighter.
Paimon: Wow, you are so serious when it comes to swordsmanship. But, aren't you friends with the Traveler? Why do you need a match?
Kamisato Ayaka: It's precisely because we're friends that we should spar often and learn from each other.
Paimon: Oh. Guess that kind of makes sense.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, keep all I just said a secret?
Paimon: Huh? What did Ayaka say?
Kamisato Ayaka: Nothing, let's get going.
Traveler: It was cute.
Traveler: You're being too modest, Ayaka.

## Talk 5

Reina: Everyone is looking forward to this exhibition match. Good luck, Traveler!

## Talk 6

Matsumae: I wonder what Ayaka will look like wearing a Fontaine outfit...

## Talk 7

Yuu: In the past, the Archon's Emissary always wore traditional outfits, but today is different.

## Talk 8

Kamisato Ayaka: Are you ready, Traveler?
Traveler: No problem. Let's go.
Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Kamisato Ayaka: Good. Let's give it our best. I look forward to fighting beside you.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, don't worry, there's still some time. Once you've taken care of everything, we can enter the arena together.

## Talk 9

Sae: The Kamisato Art versus the Maguu Kengou... and don't forget the champion from the competition! This ticket was so worth it!
