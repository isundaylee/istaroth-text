# So-Called Work


## Talk 1

Linling: I'm finished, it's all over for me this time...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Linling: *sobs* Nervous An said that I might not be cut out for this line of work...
Linling: Isn't he just firing me? What do I do? I... I'm always working so hard...
Traveler: Huh? Why so sudden...
Linling: Well... Didn't I ask you before to help me count boats?
Linling: I trusted in your ability, so I didn't double check the data you gave me, and handed it in directly.
Linling: A lot of the numbers turned out to be wrong... Nervous An really lost his temper.
Linling: Won't you help me talk to him? I—I'll do my job seriously from now on! And I won't call on you to help me out again, either!
Linling: But I dare not go to ask him myself...
Traveler: Were the previous boat tallies wrong?
Linling: Yes! Didn't I ask you to help me out with them before?
Linling: I trusted in your ability, so I didn't double check the data. I handed it in directly... and a lot of it turned out to be wrong.
Linling: But I only asked for your help from time to time. I also tallied a great deal of numbers myself...
Linling: So when put side by side, I didn't know where I had gone wrong at all, which made Nervous An lose his temper...
Linling: Please help me talk to him! I—I'll do my job seriously from now on! And I won't ask you to help me out again, either!
Linling: But I dare not go to ask him myself...

## Talk 2

Nervous An: *sigh* Really, this is...
Traveler: Can we talk about Linling?
Nervous An: Hmm? You're asking about Linling? Well... How do I say this? She's just not really suited for her job.
Nervous An: Specifically, the mistakes she's made in her data entry are far too egregious.
Nervous An: As for this week's data, only one or two days out of seven have the correct numbers. Even a purely visual inspection would be more accurate.
Nervous An: How can I leave this job to her with that attitude?
Traveler: Well, if it's just numbers...
Nervous An: There is no "just" when it comes to work.
Nervous An: If a single plank in a wooden barrel is a little short, then the volume of the whole barrel goes down.
Nervous An: It is the same with work. If we get careless about even one matter, we will drag the larger work through the mud.
Nervous An: Let's take tallying up the number of boats, for example. If the numbers are not accurate, then the various activities we conduct at the harbor will also be imprecise.
Nervous An: Imprecision there can be costly, and even if someone remedies the issue, the time unnecessarily lost fixing the problem cannot be gained back.
Nervous An: Do you understand now?
Traveler: I... I understand.
Nervous An: Still, we do lack manpower here at the harbor, so I most likely won't fire her.
Nervous An: How should I put it... "a plank shorter" is better than "a plank short," no?
Nervous An: The person in charge of reviewing cargo is unable to be here due to an emergency. Tell Linling that her help there will be expedient.
Nervous An: If nothing serious goes wrong with her work there, then she can return to her job tallying boats when the person in charge of the review returns to work.
Nervous An: Hmm... I guess this can be considered a test, and something of a second chance.
Nervous An: Give this manifest to Linling. Ask her to conduct checks according to it, and make markings on the back once each check is completed.
Nervous An: Also, please tell her to pull her socks up. If she slips up here as well, then there won't be any more second chances.
Traveler: I'll go tell her...
Nervous An: What will you tell her? That she's fired? No, she's not fired just yet.
Nervous An: We have a dire lack of manpower here at the harbor. How do I say this... "a plank shorter" is still better than "a plank short," yes?
Nervous An: The person in charge of reviewing cargo is unable to be here due to an emergency. Tell Linling that her help there will be expedient.
Nervous An: If nothing serious goes wrong with her work there, then she can return to her job tallying boats when the person in charge of the review returns to work.

## Talk 3

Linling: Oh, what shall I do about work...
Traveler: Nervous An says he's giving you another chance.
Linling: Really! Wonderful! That's great!
Linling: Eh? A cargo review? Oh no... I've never done that before...
Linling: If I make another mistake, I'm definitely finished. No, I have to make preparations first...
Linling: I need to find the previous review standards, and also the previous standard formats...
Linling: Could you help me confirm the amount of cargo first? You just need to check the cargo numbers against the document and see if they're accurate. I will conduct a more detailed review later.
Traveler: I got it.
Linling: Thank you so much. I'll be making preparations here in the meantime.
Linling: I can't mess up this time...
Traveler: You can leave everything to us.
Linling: No, I can't, not this time. A cargo review is way more complex than tallying boats. I have to do this myself.
Linling: So, please just confirm the amounts of cargo. I will do a more specific review afterwards.

## Talk 4

Linling: Have you ascertained the numbers?
Traveler: Yup.
Linling: Great. My preparations are almost complete as well. I will review all those goods once again in a while.
Linling: Oh, right! Please take this as thanks for your help. I will go and review the cargo in a moment. This time, nothing can be allowed to go wrong...
Traveler: You weren't writing poetry, were you?
Linling: Of course not! I do have a sense of priorities, you know. This isn't the time to be writing poetry...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Linling: ...I can't write poetry at work anymore. I've got to focus...
Traveler: Work comes first in the end.
Linling: I know that. But doing the same thing day in, day out, year on year... you eventually get bored, you know?
Linling: And, well, it's precisely because it's this kind of sideline job, you know? It's not that important, and no one really pays you mind, so you start to drift off after a while...
Linling: Nervous An always says things like "every job is important" and "every job is decisive..."
Linling: But if that's the case, why's everyone still so picky about the kind of work they want to do?
Traveler: You need to take responsibility for your work.
Linling: I only ask for your help occasionally. I do it myself most of the time.
Linling: I know I should take responsibility for my work. But the busier it gets, the more I feel like slacking off. That's why I ask for your help at times.
Linling: If I really were to become idle, I find myself looking for things to do instead...
Linling: Well, you haven't worked a day in your life, have you? There's no use telling you all this...
Traveler: Why do you want to write poetry so much?
Linling: Why are you suddenly asking me this? Let me think... Well, why do you think a person works?
Linling: The way I see it, "working for the sake of continuing to work" is a little too boring.
Linling: How I say this? Everyone has got to have their dreams, right? A dream that's totally separate from the daily drudgery of work.
Linling: That way, even in moments when you're so tired that you think you might break, you can take refuge in your dreams.
Linling: But this is just my way of thinking, of course. I have no idea how adventurers would think of this problem.
Linling: When I look at the way they do nothing but live for their dreams, I feel like I need some kind of daily work to ground myself instead.
Linling: Still... Hahaha, take it from me: dreams are just dreams. When you work, you still need to keep your feet firmly planted.

### Additional Talk 2

Nervous An: I'm a cooper: I'm neither particularly good with my hands, nor do I have any particular talents.
Traveler: A cooper?
Nervous An: Well, that is to say that I'm like someone who repairs barrels, and who needs a single plank of wood to finish my wooden barrel.
Nervous An: But the plank I have in hand isn't of good quality. It's just a little short, and if I use it to make my wooden barrel, its capacity is going to be lowered significantly.
Nervous An: Still, if I want to get a new plank, who knows when I will finish that barrel.
Nervous An: And given that the deadline for finishing the barrel is drawing near, I have to choose the lesser of two evils.
Nervous An: Who knows how many people there are under the sun who are coopers like me, who are facing a dilemma similar to mine.
Traveler: Can we talk about Linling's job?
Nervous An: Her job? Ah, yes. She did ask you to help her tally boat numbers in the past, didn't she? I know about that.
Nervous An: Don't look so surprised. As long as we get results, I'm really not picky as to how she does her work.
Nervous An: Besides, the rewards she gives you are taken out of her own pocket.
Nervous An: But as for her reporting data without reviewing it first...
Nervous An: That irresponsible attitude is what really made me angry.

### Additional Talk 3

Linling: Reviewing cargo is much more of a hassle than tallying boats.
Linling: This time, I have to be very careful. I can't make a single mistake...
