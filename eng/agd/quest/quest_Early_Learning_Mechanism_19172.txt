## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nadwah: Archon be praised, I can finally send a report to my superiors! Thank you so much!
Nadwah: I have no idea how we might have persuaded her otherwise...

### Additional Talk 2

Anis: Is Madam Faruzan really going to mentor me? What an honor!
Anis: Ah, I'm sure she'll say "helping with illustrations isn't mentoring"... So, ah, don't tell her I said that.

### Additional Talk 3

Mamdouh: No wonder she's so well-respected at the Akademiya. When I first saw her, I thought she might be unreliable because she's so young...
Mamdouh: Ah! Don't let her know I said that. Anis warned me about that before...

### Additional Talk 4

Qasit: We need to wait two whole days before we get the new toys...
Ruhi: It might just be all reference stuff. It'll be a loooong time before we can play with the real toys.
Alia: Guess all we can do is play Genius Invokation TCG in the meantime...

### Additional Talk 5

Tighnari: Have you met with Madam Faruzan yet?
Traveler: Yes. She's still kinda busy...
Tighnari: It's fine. Collei has already filled me in, more or less.
Tighnari: I've also managed to settle some of the problems on my side, so I've got time to wait for Madam Faruzan to arrive.
Tighnari: Can you help me find out how she's faring in two days' time?
Traveler: She needs about two more days...
