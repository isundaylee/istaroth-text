Traveler: Tell me about the clocks...
Caron: Clocks — or to be more precisely, exquisite clockwork-powered clocks — are our family craft, famous throughout Fontaine.
Caron: Have you heard of the Lady of the Lake's Tear?
Caron: That was the name Lady Furina gave to one of my works.
Caron: What a lovely name, like a song that encapsulates such sadness.
