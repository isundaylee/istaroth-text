Hunza: Phew... I finally got my change of clothes. Been a while since I felt this good!

Traveler: What was wrong with the old clothes?
Hunza: It kinda fell apart.
Hunza: Eh, that kind of thing happens all the time! You can't really do extreme sports without accepting that things will get damaged or broken. In the end, it's just a change of clothes. I can afford that much.
Hunza: Still, I've gotta admit, it was pretty wild skateboarding on a mountain crest less than half a meter wide without any protective gear.
Hunza: Thankfully, I had my most faithful and considerate Saurian sidekick with me! Katari has always been there for me... Wait, where did he go?
Hunza: Weird... I could have sworn he was with me just a moment ago!

Traveler: See you.
Hunza: See ya! Gotta say, you've got style!

Traveler: Maybe they're resting.
Hunza: Oh, well, that's certainly possible. But if I recall correctly, he's never had problems with stamina before...?
Hunza: ...Haha, who knows, maybe he's just shy?
Hunza: A lot of Yumkasaurs are like that. They're not too used to hanging out with humans all the time, probably because we're too high energy.
Hunza: Eh, just give him some time. I'm sure that one day, he'll become just as outgoing as yours truly!
