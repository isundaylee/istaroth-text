# The Great Tree: State of Growth


## Talk 1

Yasmin: It's about time now...
Traveler: Are you still working on the roots of the Divine Tree?
Yasmin: Ah, Traveler, you are always showing up just in time...
Yasmin: Many thanks for all your help. The Divine Tree is now in perfect condition.
Yasmin: After discussing the matter with Ladep, we think it should be able to stay in that condition for quite some time.
Yasmin: Now we can finally dedicate some time to preparing our theses.
Yasmin: See, I borrowed a Kamera from Pharez, which I am going to use to record the condition of the Divine Tree.
Yasmin: Traveler, could you take a picture of the Divine Tree in its entirety? I have marked the spot on your map.
Traveler: Leave this to me.
Traveler: Why can't you do it yourself?
Yasmin: Well, it's... too high up for me...
Yasmin: I've always been terrified of being in high places on my own... The feeling of being blown away... Or losing my manuscript to a gust of wind keeps coming to me...
Yasmin: Pharez is usually the one up there, but he seems to have other things to attend to right now. You're the only one I can rely on, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Yasmin: Please take a picture of the Divine Tree in its entirety. I'm counting on you, Traveler.

## Talk 3

Yasmin: How did it go? Did you take the picture?
Traveler: Of course.
Yasmin: Wow! Let me see...
Yasmin: Well done. Perfectly angled, and the image is pretty clear as well.
Yasmin: Here is your payment. Thank you for helping me, Traveler.
Yasmin: The trunk is fine... And the shape of surrounding branches hasn't changed...
Yasmin: Great, I'll wait till Ladep and Pharez finish gathering their data, and we can move on to the next subject.
