# Garcia's Paean: Key Items


## Talk 1

Garcia: Lutong, my dear Lutong, are you sure... this is the place?
Lutong: Yes, Mr. Garcia, this is where Slimes are most often found.
Garcia: I am most certain of that. However...
Garcia: Would you agree that the Slimes are mildly overwhelming in quantity?
Lutong: Mr. Garcia, this is how we end up when we are caught short financially.
Traveler: You are... Garcia?
Garcia: Traveler! What a coincidence!
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Garcia: Haha. Why, I'm here for...
Lutong: Trouble.
Garcia: Valiant adventure! Please, Lutong, could you not...
Lutong: As you wish, sir.
Garcia: In truth, I'm here to look for Slime Condensate to use as the lubricant for my Numbering Machine.
Garcia: Unfortunately, most of the Slime Condensate on sale is of low quality as it's kept for too long. Besides...
Lutong: Mr. Garcia purchased too many books...
Garcia: Oh come now, those were... necessary expenditures — that left us short of Mora, yes, but still!
Garcia: That's why we came here, to collect some fresh Slime Condensate ourselves.
Garcia: But as you can see, though our good Lutong is from Liyue, he knows neither martial arts nor culinary skills.
Lutong: Fortunately, I have a gift for accounting... all thanks to the complex tax rules of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Garcia: ...As for me, I can't possibly hit anyone with the components of my Numbering Machine.
Traveler: Do you need my help?
Garcia: Well, in a sense...
Lutong: Yes.
Garcia: Lutong, do we... um... do we have any Mora left?
Lutong: Well, I believe we'll find a way to get by after we pay the Traveler.
Garcia: Splendid. Traveler, I'd appreciate it if you could kindly retrieve some Slime Condensate for me.
Traveler: What brings you here?

## Talk 2

Garcia: Lutong, our Mora...
Lutong: We'll get by, Mr. Garcia.
Lutong: There is an old saying in Liyue, "When your path is blocked by a mountain, there will be a way through." I think this describes precisely where we are right now.
Lutong: It means that when a mountain stands in our way, we will always find a way to get over it.
Garcia: Aha! That's a clever metaphor. Then I suppose our situation is not quite so dire.
Lutong: Still, Mr. Garcia, do you think the person who originally penned those words found a way across the mountain?
Garcia: Eh? Come now, Lutong, don't jinx it...

## Talk 3

Garcia: Traveler, have you obtained the Slime Condensate?
Traveler: Got it right here.
Garcia: Wonderful! This should suffice. I'll continue my experiments once I return. With this as the lubricant, my Numbering Machine will definitely...
Garcia: I must attend to my research now. Lutong, please take care of the remaining affairs.
Lutong: Yes, sir.
Lutong: Here's your payment, Traveler. Thank you ever so much for your help.
Lutong: And um... in my humble opinion, we might be in need of your help in the future.
Lutong: Rest assured. As long as the accounts are in my hands, you will be paid fairly.
Lutong: *sigh* ...Actually, I came to travel with Mr. Garcia because I didn't want to spend my whole life doing accounts in a department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs like my parents do.
Lutong: But now... in addition to working with Mr. Garcia on his calculations, I also need to help him sort out his accounts...
Lutong: I guess this is what they call destiny...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lutong: Once again, Mr. Garcia, I sincerely suggest that we sell a few books to raise some Mora.
Garcia: No! Not for the world! Lutong, my dear, you are asking me to put my soul up for sale!
Lutong: But sir, no one bids for souls.
Traveler: Why are you still here?
Garcia: Oh, Traveler? What brings you here?
Garcia: Um... My last experiment failed. There was something wrong with my dilution of the Slime Condensate...
Garcia: Instead of lubricating the bearings of the Numbering Machine, the lubricant actually made them more likely to get stuck.
Garcia: As such, I need more Slime Condensate for further experiments. Could you...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Lutong: Traveler, please help us collect the Slime Condensate. I'll have your payment ready.
Traveler: Don't you have a way to earn Mora?
Garcia: It's not that we don't...
Lutong: It's a question of ability.
Garcia: Thank you very much for this timely explanation, my dear Lutong.
Garcia: Well, it's most certainly a shame... Although I have finished building the Numbering Machine, its functions are incalculably underwhelming.
Garcia: It cannot even fully function as an automatic calculator, requiring manual aid to facilitate its operation.
Garcia: But... I will enhance it! I firmly believe that my Numbering Machine will be a great invention!
Garcia: An... An invention that heralds a new era! And after that, I'm sure I'll find a way to earn Mora...
Garcia: H—However, before that...
Traveler: Do you need some more Slime Condensate?

### Additional Talk 2

Lutong: Sir, this might be the place we're looking for. Now we just have to return with some hires...
Lutong: Sir? Mr. Garcia, are you listening to me?
Garcia: Yeah? Oh... Of course, I'm listening. Let's go back and hire someone. It won't take long.
Traveler: Is... is everything alright?
Garcia: Traveler, ha... It's all right. I'm fine. Do I look I have a problem?
Garcia: Now I am 100% committed to the research on the Numbering Machine, and I feel that I am only one step away from success.
Garcia: If you're willing to help, would you please get some Slime Condensate for me?
Garcia: Since you are here, I don't have to go back to the city to hire people. Now that I have made a little money now, I can offer you a better payment.
Traveler: Sure.
Garcia: I will leave this part to you, Traveler. As for me, I have to think about how to change the structure of the mechanism...
Traveler: That sounds good to me...

### Additional Talk 3

Lutong: Traveler, thanks for coming.
Traveler: About Garcia...
Lutong: You're right, it's Ms. Kaia. Though Mr. Garcia doesn't talk about it, he gets distracted more and more often at work.
Lutong: And he never went to that café again. Now he just asks me to buy it for him.
Lutong: Even Mr. Ahangar came to tell me that he could talk to Mr. Garcia if it's necessary.
Lutong: I don't know how to straighten Mr. Garcia out, as I have no experience dealing with this kind of situation.
Lutong: *sigh* Looks like there is another hurdle in front of me and Mr. Garcia...
Traveler: He is still...

### Additional Talk 4

Garcia: Traveler, have you obtained the Slime Condensate?
Traveler: Got it right here.
Garcia: Well, that's enough. Lutong, can you pay the Traveler first?
Garcia: I need to check the quality of these Slime Condensate first...
Lutong: Here's your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Lutong: You are welcomed to swing by anytime.
Lutong: If Mr. Garcia's mental state is too... unwell, maybe I'll need your help.
