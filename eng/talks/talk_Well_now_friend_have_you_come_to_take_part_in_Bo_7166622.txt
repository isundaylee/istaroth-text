Listen to the Next Breakdown: Well now, friend, have you come to take part in Boss Arataki's Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp as well?
Traveler: Leeeet's beetle battle!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Wonderful! Our previous duel was most exciting. Indeed, I was planning to review it quite carefully! In any case, let us go for another round, just like Boss Arataki would want!
Traveler: Tell me about the way of the beetle battler...
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Ah, a great question! Indeed, I could go on for quite some time about this!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Liyue has its own types of contests between insects, and like Onikabuto battles, each has its own unique features.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: For example, there are contests of agility, as well as competitions to see which bug can cry the loudest.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Each one of these battles has its own set of mysteries that, with a few flourishes of a pen, can transform into many a tale I can tell my regulars time and time again!
Traveler: Have a nice day!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: See you next time, then!
