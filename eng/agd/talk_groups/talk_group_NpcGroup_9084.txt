## Talk

Lyney: #Hey, Traveler!
Lyney: I just knew you would be making an appearance here!

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lyney: Your home is breathtaking! Even a legendary magician like myself can confidently say I've never seen or heard of anything like it!
Lyney: But were I to say I've already gotten completely used to it... Would you think I'm lying?
Traveler: Sure doesn't seem like the truth.
Lyney: Aw, that really hurts my feelings...
Lyney: But, I was really being honest this time!
Lyney: Well, looks like I've got no choice but to stay here for a while longer! After all, it will take some time for me to win your trust again.
Lyney: ...You won't kick me out, right?
Traveler: No, I trust you.
Lyney: Hehe, I'm honored to have gained your trust.
Lyney: It's almost impossible for me to lie to your face... Maybe it's because I can't bear to see that hurt expression of yours.
Lyney: Ahem, but back to the topic at hand! Since you care about me so much, surely you would also want me to extend my stay?
Lyney: In which case, I'll be looking forward to more of your hospitality!

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Lyney: Sure thing! Say, why don't you take a look at my hat? Do you see anything different about it?
Traveler: Huh... Don't think there's any difference.
Lyney: Ah, but that just means you need to look at it more carefully! Just come a bit closer.
Traveler: Well, alright then.
Lyney: So, do you have the answer? Is it the pattern, or the color? You should have seen this hat many times before.
Traveler: ...Nope, still not seeing it.
Lyney: *sigh* What a pity... Although, your conclusion is actually correct.
Lyney: I just played a little trick, and stole something of yours. And after that, I also slipped a card into your bag.
Lyney: Now, can you guess what I stole from you?
Traveler: My wallet?
Lyney: Haha, I really am quite the little thief with a nose for Mora! No wonder my pockets are always overflowing.
Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your "attention." That's something far more valuable than Mora!
Lyney: As long as you understand and master this trick, and put some time into practicing movement, you, too, can become an outstanding magician.
Lyney: ...Okay, you can return my card to me now.
Traveler: My heart?
Lyney: A most unexpected answer! I have to say, even my heart has begun to race too.
Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your "attention." Even though it's not nearly as valuable as your heart, it's still very important to us magicians nonetheless!
Traveler: My... attention?
Lyney: Bingo! Congratulations, that was the right answer.
Traveler: Is it bigger or smaller than before?
Lyney: No, the whole thing was misdirection.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Lyney: As you're the owner, there is one matter on which I would like to inquire your opinion.
Traveler: ...Huh? Why so formal all of a sudden...
Lyney: From what I can see, not only is the environment here quite comfortable, but the security is also beyond reproach. It seems this would be a great place to raise pets.
Traveler: Yeah, I have a few.
Lyney: Just so you know... I've already greeted them. Politely, of course.
Lyney: I refrained from touching them or feeding them anything I had brought with me. Such actions require your permission first, no?
Traveler: Why do I feel like you're being exceptionally earnest today...
Lyney: Hehe, is it because I'm usually dramatic and flamboyant? That could have left you with a rather one-sided impression.
Lyney: If that's the case, I really ought to do a good bit of self-reflection!
Lyney: Anyway, I just want to find a warm, free, and peaceful home for all of my animal assistants.
Lyney: A place where they'll always enjoy care and being lovingly looked after, with no need to worry about food or shelter...
Lyney: To be perfectly honest with you, this is by far the best choice for them that I know of... but I wouldn't want you to feel pressured to take them in, or to persuade you using honeyed words.
Lyney: But if you really were willing to take them in of your own free will, truly, that would be wonderful.
Traveler: I don't really have much experience with pets...
Lyney: No problem. As long as you aren't opposed to the idea, I'm happy to share my knowledge on the subject with you.
Lyney: Naturally, if you have any concerns, I will respect your thoughts and decisions.

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Lyney.
Lyney: #Good morning, Traveler!
Lyney: It would be great if I could see you every morning.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Lyney.
Lyney: #Good night, Traveler.
Lyney: If you ever have trouble falling asleep, I'd be happy to count cats with you until you drift off.

## Talk

Lyney: Wow, you really thought of everything! I just love this style of table and chairs! The color, the design... so many memories.
Lyney: It takes me right back to when Lynette and I were little, and we used to do magic tricks on the street. Just like this: Check your pockets.
Lyney: Haha, yep, you guessed it — I made my move while you were focused on the table and chairs.

## Talk

Lyney: I assume, since you've taken the trouble to set up this gorgeous stage, that you're hoping to host a spectacular performance here.
Lyney: Hey, how about the greatest magician in all of Teyvat? It just so happens that he has an open slot in his schedule at this very moment...
Lyney: It looks like you may be the only audience member — but don't worry. The show will go ahead as scheduled.
