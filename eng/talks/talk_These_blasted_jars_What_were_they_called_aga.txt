Notebook: ...These blasted jars... What were they called again? <color=#00E1FFFF>Energy storage devices</color> or something... They've been disappearing without a trace lately. I put one down, then it disappears. I put another one down, and it disappears too...
Notebook: ...I even posted someone to watch over it at night... They disappeared along with the jar...
Notebook: They even left a note too, something along the lines of "working night shifts is a waste of my youth, I might as well go be a research assistant and at least get a decent paycheck..." How baffling...
Notebook: ...I placed the last <color=#00E1FFFF>energy storage device</color> on the first floor. If this one disappears too, then whoever was responsible for patrolling that day is going to have to report it to Shumilov themselves...
