Traveler: Are you the village head?
Serene: The village head... do you mean some person who's in charge of everyone?
Serene: I don't think that describes me. I'm just a little older than the other kids. As everyone's big sister, it's my responsibility to help with day-to-day issues.
Serene: That's right â€” I've gotta look after everyone.
