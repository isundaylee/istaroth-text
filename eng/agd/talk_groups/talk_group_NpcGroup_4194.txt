Traveler: Sounds much too strong...
Arapas: #Really? Nara Traveler, so strange. You said water with scent is delicious, but you hate water with too much scent.
Arapas: Guess clear water is better for soup.

Arapas: The soup at Festival Utsava... Very "shocking." So I am going to look for nicer water in the north.

Traveler: The north?
Arapas: I heard that there is Vana's river source's source in the north. The water there is clearer than moonlight. A pot filled with that water looks as if is holding nothing but air.
Arapas: #Soup cooked with that water, will make Nara Traveler and Aranara happy. I am sure.
Arapas: So, in my "special cooking training," I will follow the direction that tree shadows point to, and find nicer water than Vanarana water.
