Unsealed Letter: "...Excuse my lack of graces, but please, old man, you're getting on in years, and your eyes and legs are both not what they used to be... Stop following us young lads up and down the mines..."
Unsealed Letter: "Things haven't been looking too good recently, but some of us have scrounged up some Mora for you. Should be enough for you to get out of the business. With your artisanship, you should be able to find decent work in Liyue Harbor and never have to worry about making ends meet in your old age..."
Unsealed Letter: "...Don't worry 'bout us! The lads have all grown up. We can handle ourselves. Please, old man, just take this as a little somethin' from us to you..."
Unsealed Letter: "Brass Bull Zhao"
