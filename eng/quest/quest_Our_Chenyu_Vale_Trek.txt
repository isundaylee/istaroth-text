# Our Chenyu Vale Trek


## Talk 1

Paimon: Phew! Paimon took a look at the photos we've got: Qiaoying Village, the Lotus Pond, Jademouth, and Mt. Xuanlian! We've got 'em all!
Paimon: There won't be any other participants as hardworking as us, will there? If we don't win a prize after all this, it'll be a total travesty!

## Talk 2

Zhuchun: Heyo, friendo! You've been all over, I imagine you've had the pleasure of admiring quite a few sights in your time?
Zhuchun: I wonder if the Chenyu Vale's spots for this contest will be able to top the ones you've experienced?

## Talk 3

Akai: Hang on! Don't come any closer! Are you... are you good people?
Paimon: Hey, we're the ones who saved you just now! Did you hit your head on something or...
Akai: Ah! You're right... I'm really sorry about that. My "Chenyu Vale Trek" has been nothing but dizzyingly bad luck... Thank... you...
Traveler: So you're participating in the photography contest, too?
Akai: You are as well? What a coincidence! I'm just an ordinary tourist, though... So I couldn't do anything about those hilichurls.
Akai: I came across those louts on the road, and they captured and brought me back here without letting me get a word in lengthwise. Hilichurls don't also collect tolls, do they? Preposterous... Luckily, I ran into you guys.
Paimon: Ah... Today was a tough day for you indeed.
Akai: Not just today! Yesterday was terrible as well. I bought a rather expensive Kamera from a Fontaine merchant, but it broke after only a few uses. When I went back to find him, he was gone...
Akai: What a shady guy... Be sure to keep an eye on your wallet while you're out and about!
Akai: Ah, sorry. Got a little sidetracked there. Since you're also taking part in the competition, you must be here to photograph Mt. Xuanlian, correct?
Akai: What say I share the best photography spot that I found around here with you as thanks? Here, I'll mark it on your map for you.
Akai: You can see it from here. In fact, it's right over there!
Paimon: Eh? What about you then? Aren't you participating in the contest as well?
Akai: This area's rather dangerous, so it'd be best for me to switch things up. I remember the guide spoke of other locations... I think I should check out the Tea-Tasting Adeptus...
Akai: Yeah! That sounds good. Goodbye, you two! Hopefully, things start turning out well for me now!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Is this pelican here yours, kid? Could we photograph it alongside Qiaoying Village?
Mingjing: Hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!
Paimon: Eh? What are you saying?
Mingjing: It's pelican talk, which means "great, great!"
Traveler: You speak pelican?
Mingjing: Only a little... because I noticed when they eat, they don't stop going "hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
Mingjing: I'm sure they're happily saying that it's "great, great"!
Mingjing: So I learned to call to them in that manner too. They come over as soon as they hear, probably because they think there's food.
Mingjing: If you wanna photograph one, then maybe you could try calling out to one yourself! It's too bad I gotta get home now, otherwise, I could teach you some more!
Paimon: No worries, kiddo! We'll try it ourselves! Thanks, and get home safely!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's give it a go over there! If we can attract a pelican, it'll increase our work's chances of success!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Let's try calling the pelicans.
Traveler: "Anng anng! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
Traveler: "Hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
Traveler: "Quack quack, Paimon, quack quack."

## Talk 6

Paimon: This should be the Lotus Pond by the Ancient Teatree King? Whaddaya know â€” just like the guidebook said, there are monsters!

## Talk 7

Akai: Let's see... Where should I go next?

## Talk 8

Fangju: Seeing how relaxed you look, I suppose you must be here to submit your photos. Just leave them with me.
Fangju: Hmm, not bad at all. You must've put in a lot of work to capture such beautiful scenes. Well done.

## Talk 9

Fangju: Hmm... these photos...
Paimon: What's wrong? Are ours not good enough?
Fangju: It's quite the opposite... I've seen some excellent submissions these past few days, but your works are refreshing all the same.
Fangju: Let's take this shot of Qiaoying Village. The pelican adds a touch of liveliness to the tranquil village, contrasting stillness and movement... A one-of-a-kind approach, indeed.
Fangju: If it were just up to me, your works would certainly be selected for use.
Paimon: Wow! What a compliment! You're making Paimon blush a little.
Traveler: Blush? You're not the one who took these photos.
Paimon: Paimon was just feeling flattered on your behalf! Paimon knows all about your modesty.
Fangju: Well, in any case, our selection process will be completed before tomorrow morning.
Fangju: From eight in the morning until six at night, we will exhibit the selected works on the street outside Hezhe Post.
Fangju: Thank you for participating in the "Our Chenyu Vale Trek" scenic photography contest. Don't forget to come back around tomorrow!
Paimon: You bet! We're not gonna miss out on the final surprise!
Traveler: I'm starting to feel a little embarrassed now too.

## Talk 10

Fangju: From eight in the morning until six at night, we will exhibit the selected works on the street outside Hezhe Post. Don't forget to come back around tomorrow!

## Talk 11

Fangju: Ah, you've made it.
Fangju: Have you seen the exhibited works? A total of eight works have been selected for this iteration of "Our Chenyu Vale Trek," and half of those are yours.
Fangju: Congratulations!
Paimon: Wow! That's awesome!
Paimon: #See, {NICKNAME}? Paimon was right about getting four out of four! Paimon's math skills really are something!
Traveler: It's four out of eight, actually.
Fangju: Heh, the judges also showed great appreciation for your other two works, much like I said yesterday.
Fangju: And so, please take this limited edition "Our Chenyu Vale Trek" commemorative photo album. It features all of the contest's selected works. You have earned it.
Paimon: This was the surprise? Ooh, it looks amazing!
Fangju: If it's alright with you, I also have some Mora for you. Please take it. I'd like to thank you again for participating, this time on a personal level.
Fangju: This is my hometown, and you have forever captured the beauty of this place. These works will surely cause more people to fall in love with it.
Fangju: Thank you.
Traveler: Wow! Quite the mathematician, aren't we?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Mali: Uh-oh! That dupe from Inazuma is here as well. I'd better pretend I didn't notice him... Luckily, there's someone in between us, so he probably doesn't see me.
Mali: Darn it, why are these scenery photos so captivating? I don't wanna leave this place yet...

### Additional Talk 2

Zhuchun: These photos were shot quite nicely. It's just a shame that the atmosphere around me seems rather off...
Zhuchun: Maybe I should pick a different spot from which to appreciate them...

### Additional Talk 3

Akai: There he is! That shady Fontaine merchant! Has my luck really begun to turn around!?
Akai: I should just rush over and grab hold of him right now, but then I wouldn't be able to appreciate these charming photos of Chenyu Vale...
Akai: No... I would just suffer further loss that way. I'd be better off doing so after viewing them, especially for my selected work...

### Additional Talk 4

Fangju: I wish you all the best of luck.
