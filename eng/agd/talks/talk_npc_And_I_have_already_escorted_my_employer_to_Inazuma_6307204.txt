Master Qin "Thunder Hand": And I have already escorted my employer to Inazuma safely. The job is considered done anyway. Isn't it up to me, then, where I want to go next?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": It's such a rare opportunity. I even passed through that stormy ocean. Why shouldn't I go see the world a bit more?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Since I am here, I have to figure out what it's like to live in Inazuma, haha!
