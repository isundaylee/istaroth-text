Traveler: So, what can you tell me about Dragonspine...
Iris: Alfry from the Intelligence Department says that Dragonspine has some sort of connection with the evil dragon that fought Dvalin in the past, though none of that really interests me.
Iris: As far as I'm concerned, this is just a place worth adventuring in.
Iris: One thing to note is that this place is more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt. In this extreme cold, your first priority must be maintaining your body temperature.
Iris: ...Bravery and foolhardiness are not to be equated lightly here. It is best to proceed with a plan, lest you lose your life in vain.
