# Clean and Healthy


## Talk 1

Golshan: *sigh* How will we find anyone who will help at this hour...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Golshan: Oh! Hâ€”Hello there, Traveler. Are you here for treatment?
Traveler: I'm just passing through...
Golshan: Hehe... Was it that obvious? Well, you are right. I am worried about something.
Golshan: I don't know why, but there's been an increasing number of people seeking treatment here at Bimarstan lately. Our staff have their hands full taking care of the patients.
Golshan: Still, Dr. Zakariya insisted that I find ways to keep the surrounding area clean...
Golshan: He said that only if the hospital and patients were kept clean, then they could more easily receive the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: *sigh* But we can't spare any hands at the moment, and it's not like I can ask the patients with mild symptoms to help out...
Traveler: How about you leave the cleaning to me?
Golshan: You'll help? That's very kind of you! I'll have the payment ready. It's just that... you might have to lower your expectations in that regard.
Golshan: *sigh* May the Dendro Archon keep people safe from sickness...
Traveler: Can't you just hire someone?
Golshan: Few would volunteer to work in a place full of patients. Besides, we don't have the budget to hire that many people.
Golshan: Normally we would split the cleaning into shifts, but no one is available right now.
Golshan: So, Traveler, could... could you help out?
Golshan: We will pay you! It won't be too much though...
Traveler: What's with the patients here, anyway...
Golshan: Most of our patients only suffer from minor ailments, such as headaches.
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya has told people many times that these conditions are not as scary as they think, but no one buys his explanations.
Golshan: I suppose that it might not be the disease they're afraid of, it's getting sick itself...
Golshan: I'll leave the cleaning to you then, Traveler.
Traveler: I just noticed that you looked so worried...

## Talk 2

Golshan: Traveler, is there anything you'd like to ask?
Traveler: Could you tell me more about Zakariya?
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya is a great doctor and a devout believer of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: He treats patients around the clock and hardly ever has time to eat.
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya even said that it's his duty to extend the blessings of the Dendro Archon to more people.
Traveler: Does the blessing of the Dendro Archon really matter that much in healing?
Golshan: To be precise, the act of "treatment" itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: It was by the grace of the Dendro Archon that we could find cures for patients and grow herbs to treat illnesses...
Golshan: Thank you, O Dendro Archon, for your blessing. May everyone be kept from maladies...
