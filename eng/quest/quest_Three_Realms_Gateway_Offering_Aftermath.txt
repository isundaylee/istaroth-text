# Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath


## Talk 1

Paimon: Tsumi, we did it!
Tsumi: I can tell. It looks like all three towers have been successfully taken care of.
Tsumi: The evacuation is now going much more quickly thanks to the improved environmental conditions. Most of the soldiers have gotten out...
Tsumi: But it seems like something happened that I hadn't foreseen. Please come with me.

## Talk 2

Paimon: It's him!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This must be the mechanism he mentioned, but how do we reach it?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ohh, that's where the mechanism is!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Oh no, Tsumi's gone...
Paimon: We couldn't have missed her on the way here...
Traveler: ...Why does it always end like this.
Paimon: Aw, c'mon, it's okay. Don't be sad.
Paimon: On the bright side, most of the soldiers have been successfully evacuated. If any vishaps did come through here just now, at least no one will have gotten hurt.
Paimon: Even though just thinking about that guy drives Paimon nuts, it seems we've got no choice but to give what he said a shot. Let's get some light in here.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Paimon's shocked. It actually worked!
Paimon: For once, he didn't lie to us.
Traveler: Technically speaking, he's never really lied to us.
Paimon: Well maybe with his sneaky way of explaining things, he doesn't have to! Why does Paimon feel like you two have reached some sort of mutual understanding!? That is not okay!
Paimon: The Dainichi Mikoshi should be accessible again now. Let's get down there and see.

## Talk 7

Paimon: After a careful headcount, it seems like the baby vishaps aren't here anymore. Guess they got rescued...
Paimon: If the Bathysmal Vishaps really did come down here, that means that guy was telling the truth...
Paimon: So... Tsumi really is a Vishap-person?
Paimon: But we still haven't seen her anywhere. Where the heck is she?
Paimon: *sigh* Whatever. Let's head back up.

## Talk 8

Paimon: It's Tsumi! Uh, what is she doing in front of the Dainichi Mikoshi?
Tsumi: Since you came back, I'm curious to know — did our rescue operation succeed?
Paimon: Some baby vishaps were rescued before we got there. But the old and weak vishaps went back in the water to hide after we defeated the elites.
Paimon: Um, Tsumi... Are you really a Vishap-person?
Tsumi: I have no intention of explaining anything. Although I can communicate with you, I know all too well that interaction with humans can only end in betrayal.
Tsumi: The conflict between our two kinds will go on forever.
Tsumi: Before I leave, I'm going to destroy this light.
Traveler: You think you have what it takes?
Tsumi: Do not come any closer. And don't even think about trying to sneak up on me.
Tsumi: This tower seems to hear my wishes... I just need to think the thought and it will change its brightness.
Tsumi: And if I so desire, it will collapse before me.
Tsumi: With the cognitive equivalent of a click of the fingers, I could destroy this source of great pain for the vishaps.
Tsumi: So why... why can't I do it...?
Paimon: #Oh no, this is way more serious than losing access to the Bloodbranch Coral! What're we gonna do, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Tsumi, do you recognize these?
Tsumi: It's...
Black Screen Text: Tsumi remembers her pendant. She combines it with the other pieces.
Paimon: It's a pendant in the shape of... are those three entwined snakes?
Tsumi: This pendant has been with me for as long as I can remember. Why does it fit with your two pieces?
Traveler: I think deep down, you already know the answer.
Tsumi: Don't be ridiculous. Are you trying to say that... that I...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't understand... This one is Kokomi's, this one is from the Dainichi Mikoshi, and Tsumi's has been with her all along...
Traveler: You belong to Watatsumi Island.
Tsumi: ...
Tsumi: I grew up with the vishaps. My only possessions were this pendant and a few boxes of books. I learned human language and writing from them.
Tsumi: But not long after that, Enkanomiya was left without a single human being. It became completely empty.
Tsumi: Only recently did I finally have the chance to make contact with humans and learn what the things I'd read in the books really meant.
Paimon: Tsumi...
Tsumi: There is a saying in your human books that I've never understood until right now.
Tsumi: "People belong where they are born, but creatures belong where they are fed." I am a vishap, not a human. So I'm going back to where I belong.
Tsumi: I guess the Dainichi Mikoshi isn't my concern. But we'll be back one day.
Paimon: Tsumi is gone.
Paimon: Why did she suddenly change her mind in the end?
Traveler: Maybe Kokomi knows.
Paimon: Right. Kokomi will have definitely anticipated this possibility. That would be why she gave us the pendant fragment in the first place.
Paimon: Everything's resolved here. Let's go back and tell her.
Traveler: Tsumi, these are for you.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, Kokomi!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, you're back. The soldiers briefed me about what happened.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You successfully worked with a shrine maiden named Tsumi to clear the darkness, but then there was an unexpected change at the Dainichi Mikoshi. Is that so?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. But after that is where things started to get all kinds of weird.
Black Screen Text: You tell Kokomi what had happened.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really?
Paimon: Uhh, sorry, Kokomi... Paimon feels kinda bad that we ended up giving your pendant away.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: There's no need to apologize. As I said, Watatsumi Island has no further need for it.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's a relic from back in the very beginning, when the Watatsumi Omikami reorganized the court and reformed Enkanomiya. The three pendants were given to the Dainichi Mikoshi, the Sangonomiya line, and the Vassals of Watatsumi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The original intention was that the common folk, the officials, and the divine vassals would all hold each other accountable. But today, only the common folk have flourished, while the other two bloodlines have declined. So the pendant is of little use anymore.
Paimon: Funny you should say vassals... One of the soldiers seemed to think that Tsumi was one of those. But actually, her vertical pupils meant that she was a reptile... She fooled us all.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's not true. Vassals of Watatsumi typically take on a half-human, half-snake form, symbolizing that they are the familiars of our serpent god. At least, they used to. Over time, the vassals gradually became identical to humans — all except for the pupils of their eyes.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But Vishap-people and Reptilians... they're pure fiction. There is no evidence for their existence anywhere among Sangonomiya's classified documents.
Paimon: Oh, so Tsumi isn't actually a vishap?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Watatsumi Omikami exhausted its power to create Watatsumi Island, and after that, it grew weaker and weaker. No more Vassals of Watatsumi were born after that. But the records do mention the very last of the vassals...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: All our hopes were placed onto her. She was going to be the one who could communicate between the vishaps and the humans. But when she was just an infant girl, she and her guardian shrine maiden were attacked by vishaps at the border of Enkanomiya. Her whereabouts have been unknown ever since.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Most believe she died that day. But some believe she was raised by the vishaps.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The people of Watatsumi owe a great debt of gratitude to the Vassals of Watatsumi. Now that the vishaps and Watatsumi Islanders no longer have a territorial dispute, I sincerely hope that she will find her way to where she belongs... wherever that is for her.
Paimon: What a story...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, now that we know how Bloodbranch Coral works, I, as Divine Priestess of Sangonomiya, may need to think of a new way to counteract the Holy Soil phenomenon.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: For the time being, however, the issue is resolved, and all thanks to you. Watatsumi Island will be at peace for many decades to come.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I can't thank you enough.
