## Talk

Kaveh: Hello.
Kaveh: Huh... This place sure is interesting.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kaveh: I'm still getting used to it all.
Kaveh: Never have I seen a place where you can decorate to your heart's whimsy... You don't understand what this means to an architect like me.
Kaveh: It blows my mind... So much free space for building and designing! It's like a sketchbook that'll never run out of pages.
Kaveh: I guess what I really want to say is... I'm so grateful that you invited me here as your guest.
Traveler: Relax the formalities and make yourself at home.
Kaveh: Err... That might not be the best idea...
Kaveh: To be perfectly honest with you, my blood has been boiling with excitement ever since I first stepped foot in this realm.
Kaveh: Guess it's a designer's instinct? I mean, if you ask me, I think all artistic folks are kinda like this.
Kaveh: Looking at your realm, all I can think about are things like architectural composition and façade designs.
Kaveh: Speaking of which, can I see your gardens and ponds? Or how about your water fountains? If you don't mind, tell me what you had in mind when decorating your realm!
Kaveh: I want to know the reasoning behind why you arranged the roads and buildings like this...
Traveler: I'm sorry, I threw everything together on a whim.
Kaveh: A... whim? Wait, why would you just put things together on a whim? None of this was planned?
Kaveh: When it comes to design, placement shouldn't be arbitrary... Don't tell me, the boundless potential of this place has robbed you of your principles and pride as a creator!?
Kaveh: I see now... These weirdly spaced furnishings, and all the things that seemingly serve no purpose... Hm...
Kaveh: Ugh... I—It's okay, I'll chalk it up to you having a unique sense of style.
Traveler: I arranged them using the insights I've gained on my journey.
Kaveh: Ah, I see. Taking what you've learned from your travels and applying them to your principles of design... Excellent!
Kaveh: You have the eye for this kind of work. If the life of an architect wasn't so difficult, I'd recommend that you enroll in formal study.
Traveler: I didn't feel like the Palace of Alcazarzaray was all that impressive...
Kaveh: What did you say!?
Kaveh: I... Ahem! It's fine, it's fine, people have different tastes... I can't force you to like my style. Besides, some aspects of it are difficult to appreciate unless you have a certain level of understanding about aesthetics...
Kaveh: Hmph! I'm not so easily offended. Pfft.
Traveler: But... there's literally nothing here.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: Look, I've been pretending that you know something about decorating, so can't you play along, too?
Kaveh: I'm an architect! I build and design things! Seeing your home devoid of anything makes me feel really... really sad.
Kaveh: Can't you try, just a little? Don't let such a wondrous space go to waste.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kaveh: Sure. Anything you want to talk about?
Kaveh: It's probably best if I don't pick the topic of conversation. I've had people tell me that I just end up rambling on endlessly about my profession.
Traveler: Tell me about your life, then.
Kaveh: My life? Hmm... There's a lot I could talk about, but I don't know where to start...
Kaveh: I guess I'll share this... There was once a time in my life when I lived in abject poverty. Bankruptcy led to many a misfortune — in this world, if you don't have money, you essentially have no dignity.
Kaveh: I hated living like that, but I also had no quick way out of that situation. Every day was a struggle between my ego and my reality.
Kaveh: I had a lot of pride about being a master architect, so I detested the idea of doing anything else for a living... Only later did I learn about the more difficult aspects of life.
Kaveh: I was far more idealistic during my years as a student. I hate to admit it, but... an overly naive person cannot survive in this world.
Kaveh: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to take the conversation to such a heavy place. Please pretend I didn't say anything.
Traveler: Tell me about what you like.
Kaveh: Hm, things I like... I recently bought a new coffee grinder. It's been great.
Kaveh: It's so elaborately made, and, most importantly, each component is perfectly in its place.
Kaveh: It doesn't have any extra screws or parts, and it grinds beans quickly and silently. It was a great purchase.
Kaveh: Ah, I left the house in a hurry today, so I didn't bring anything with me... I'll bring you some finely ground coffee next time.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kaveh: I want to go to the most distant point from here. With such a fantastical realm, I want to know where its boundaries roughly lie.
Kaveh: It's not every day you come across technology like this. If it could be replicated one day for architectural projects...
Kaveh: Sumeru's buildings can be divided into several primary categories. Buildings in the rainforest are mostly wooden, while those in Sumeru City and Port Ormos are generally made of stone.
Kaveh: You've been to Port Ormos, right? Its lighthouse is a paradigm of Sumeru's architecture. I was responsible for its last round of renovations.
Kaveh: Although we managed to renovate the building's weathered exterior, restoring the lighthouse's heavily eroded foundation was a massive struggle... There was only so much we could do.
Kaveh: If only we had a place with a stable foundation and an unobstructed view... We could then experiment with builds to improve the lighthouse's structure.
Traveler: It sounds like you need this teapot much more than I do.
Kaveh: In some ways, yes.
Kaveh: But I'd never try to buy this place from you, even if I had the Mora to do so. This little magical teapot must have a special place in your heart.
Traveler: You could say it's my "home."
Kaveh: "Home," huh...
Kaveh: I've designed many houses for others, but a house isn't really the same thing as a home.
Kaveh: A house can simply be a pile of wood on a plot of land, but a home cannot exist without inhabitants — the presence of people is what turns a house into a home.
Kaveh: I heard that you embarked on your journey to reunite with your sibling. While I can't completely relate to your situation, the yearning for loved ones is a universal feeling.
Kaveh: #I pray that your dream soon comes true — that you find your sister and have her in your life again.
Traveler: Thank you, Kaveh. Can we commission you when that time comes?
Kaveh: Hahaha, of course! When that day does come, I won't charge you any commission fees. I'm sure your happiness alone will be more than enough for me.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Kaveh.
Kaveh: Good morning. A new day brings new tasks and responsibilities.
Kaveh: A little tip: Take your time — everything will get done.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Kaveh.
Kaveh: You've worked hard. Take some well-deserved rest.
Kaveh: Cast your troubles to the wayside, and let yourself fall into the sweet embrace of sleep. You might see things in a new light once you wake up.

## Talk

Kaveh: This style is one of the most widely used in Sumeru. You can see its influence on many of the Akademiya's buildings.
Kaveh: If I could recommend only one of Sumeru's architecture styles, this one would be it. The central, white section really brings the whole composition together.
Kaveh: As for any shortcomings... I suppose the sections extending from the floral vault are prone to collecting dust? It must be a pain to clean them.

## Talk

Kaveh: Oh, I just love theaters.
Kaveh: They take you away you from your troubles, and you just feel so free...
Kaveh: I quite like this fountain. It's on the smaller side, but it serves its purpose well. The decorations on the side are quite lovely, too.
