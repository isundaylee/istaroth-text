Traveler: What's on your mind?
Muirne: A lot of things. Sometimes I think of more and more things, and I stand for longer periods of time.
Muirne: Once, Monsieur Neuvillette saw me watching the sea, and he stood beside me in deep thought.
Muirne: And slowly, more and more people started gathering behind us.

Muirne: Humans are so cute.
Muirne: But in truth, the thing I was considering was very simple. It's an everyday thing â€” what am I going to eat later?
