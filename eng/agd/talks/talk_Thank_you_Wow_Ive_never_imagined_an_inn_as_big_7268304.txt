Asagiri: Thank you. Wow! I've never imagined an inn as big as this one...
Asagiri: To be able to build an inn out in the wild and manage it so well, its owner must be a very capable person...
Asagiri: The panoramic view of the snow mountain is the very definition of perfection!
Asagiri: Awesome! I'm gonna draw a big panoramic picture of it!
Asagiri: Then I'll send a smaller one to Ms. Moriko. She has always loved the sight of snowy mountains.
