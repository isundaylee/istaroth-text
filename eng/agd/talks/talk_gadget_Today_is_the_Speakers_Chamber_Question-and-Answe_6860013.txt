Guest Message: "Big Sis Lady Mavuika! What are your glasses made of? Why don't they get burned by fire? I asked Dad, Mom, and Big Sis, but none of them know..."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "My sunglasses? I had 'em custom-made from Xilonen. If you want a pair, too, kiddo, you can ask her. I'm sure she's happy to help."
Another Guest's Message: "Lady Archon. I'm an athlete, but I've been in subpar form lately, and a breakthrough has eluded me constantly."
Another Guest's Message: "...I sometimes wonder if I simply... lack talent. If I should give up. Dear Archon, could you give me some advice?"
Pyro Archon's Reply: "If you wish to gain fame and wealth through 'sport,' then I urge you to work within your limits and be realistic about your chances."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "If you're in this line because you love it, however, keep pushing on."
Pyro Archon's Reply: "The sweat you have poured out and the pain you've endured will serve as the stepping stones toward your victory."
