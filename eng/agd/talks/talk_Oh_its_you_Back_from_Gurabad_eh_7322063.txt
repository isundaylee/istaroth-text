# Talk Dialog

Jeht: Oh, it's you. Back from Gurabad, eh?
Jeht: Ah, yes. Is there something you need? Things have been quite busy back here with the Tanit...
Traveler: About Liloupar...
Jeht: Yes, I heard. She left and went back to that cursed place.
Jeht: Hmph. She was peacocking around the whole time, driving me up the wall... and now she's finally silent. What a relief.
Jeht: Still, she did help us a great deal... Come to think of it, what do you think she'll find there? And if there's nothing to be found... I wonder if she'll feel lonely... Like how we felt lonely?
Jeht: It's a shame that I couldn't go with you...
Traveler: Any problems with the Tanit?
Jeht: Agh, it's nothing major. Can't talk about it right now, though...
Jeht: It's about something within the tribe, and maybe those northerners too. I don't know the details either, to be honest.
Jeht: However... Ah...
Jeht: However...!
Jeht: Agh. Sorry. The reason I'm acting like this... What I mean to say is... If I...
Jeht: No! Iâ€”If you meet with danger, then believe me when I say that I'll always be there to help you.
Jeht: And if I'm the one in trouble... I believe you'll come for me too, won't you?
Traveler: Certainly.
Jeht: Alright... Thanks. You should... keep an eye out for enemies, okay?
Traveler: Of course, but don't forget to pay once I'm done.
Jeht: Hmph... Don't dodge the question with that mercenary talk.
Jeht: Just... be careful.
Traveler: Then, when you have the time...
Jeht: Yeah, we'll talk more when I have more time...
Jeht: Oh, right! Right...
Jeht: It's nothing... If you run into any trouble, any danger at all, I'll be right at your side. So... Be careful.
