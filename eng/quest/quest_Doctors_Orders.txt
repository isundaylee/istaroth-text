# Doctor's Orders


## Talk 1

Zakariya: *sigh* What a headache...
Traveler: Do you need a hand with anything?
Zakariya: We have been really shorthanded lately, and I haven't slept for days on end.
Zakariya: If you would, Traveler, could you help me deliver some medicine to the patients nearby? Please check on them as well.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Zakariya: I'm counting on you. For the Dendro Archon's sake, I could really use a helper capable of saying something other than saying "Dendro Archon bless you."
Zakariya: Hah, "For the Dendro Archon's sake"... I've been saying that a lot lately, haven't I?
Traveler: You should take a break.
Zakariya: I'm afraid I simply cannot. I have placed patients with more serious conditions elsewhere, and I have to prepare medicines for them.
Zakariya: *sigh* They will definitely ask me how they might embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: I am counting on you. I could really use an assistant capable of something other than talking about the blessings of the Dendro Archon...
Traveler: What's happened here?
Zakariya: You must be a traveler. This is Bimarstan, a hospital that aids the masses... Um... by spreading the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: No matter rich or poor, anyone in need shall get medical help here.
Zakariya: But as a result... We have too many patients and not enough hands to see to them all.
Zakariya: *sigh* The benevolence of the Dendro Archon might be endless... But our budget and manpower are not.
Zakariya: And then there are patients who ignore all medical instructions, but just keep asking about how to better embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: Haha, blessings of the Dendro Archon... My goodness!
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon really could just rain down blessings, they wouldn't have gotten sick in the first place!
Zakariya: ...Phew, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Please don't tell Golshan about this, or she might lecture me again.
Traveler: Aren't you a pious believer of the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: Of course I am. Can you find someone in Sumeru City who isn't?
Zakariya: But you can leave "piousness" out of this. I would consider myself a rather... rational believer in the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: Ugh... Sorry, I must be too tired out. I was just venting. Please don't take what I said too seriously.
Traveler: Some say that treatment itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon...
Zakariya: *sigh* But just consider these stories, alright? Don't be so serious about it like some of our patients.
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon were as mighty as the legends claim, I would only need to feed people some mushrooms, and bam, they would be healed.

## Talk 2

Zakariya: The medicine delivery this time is for Gurgen, who is at the medicine farm.
Zakariya: He strained his arm from doing too much work a few days before.
Zakariya: Please give him this medicine. By the way, tell him to also stay at home and pray silently to the Dendro Archon. Farm work can wait.
Traveler: Sure.
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
Traveler: Pray silently to the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: He won't listen to a word I say if I don't say that. Just do as I instructed, alright?

## Talk 3

Zakariya: I'm counting on you for the medicine delivery. Don't forget to pass the medical instructions on either.

## Talk 4

Gurgen: Huh? This is...
Traveler: Here's your medicine, remember to pray quietly to the Dendro Archon.
Gurgen: Ah, thanks. Pray quietly to the Dendro Archon... Yes, I must do that...
Gurgen: But there are so many <color=#00E1FFFF>weeds in the field</color>... If I keep doing nothing, it's going to affect the yield.
Gurgen: Um... I'll just <color=#00E1FFFF>deal with the weeds</color> first, then do my silent prayers when I finish.

## Talk 5

Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
Traveler: He wanted to deal with the weeds first...
Zakariya: *sigh* So even the silent prayer line didn't work... I suppose I'll have to come up with something else.
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Please, take this as payment.

## Talk 6

Gurgen: The weeds... You've removed them all? I... You're too kind!
Traveler: Just go back home and rest.
Gurgen: I will, thank you. May the Dendro Archon bless and protect you!
Gurgen: I should hurry home to conduct my silent prayers to the Dendro Archon as well.

## Talk 7

Zakariya: You are back. How did it go?
Traveler: About removing the weeds...
Zakariya: Ah, that's great. This way, Gurgen can finally have some proper rest. He should be able to recover sooner.
Zakariya: I can't thank you enough. Please take this as your payment.

## Talk 8

Zakariya: The medicine this time is for Azra at the theater entrance.
Zakariya: She has been coughing lately, but she refused to take the medicine I prescribed, saying that it tastes too bitter.
Zakariya: Please give her this medicine. Also, tell her that... Um...
Zakariya: This... bitterness in the medicine is but a... test, yes, a test, bestowed by the Dendro Archon.
Traveler: Sure I will.
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
Traveler: Where did you learn this stuff?
Zakariya: I didn't exactly learn it? I've just heard these kinds of things too often.

## Talk 9

Gurgen: *sigh* I guess my body isn't what it used to be... No, I can't give up yet. I must persist for a while more.

## Talk 10

Azra: Hmm... This smells familiar...
Traveler: Here's your medicine. Remember to finish all of it...
Azra: Ugh, this <color=#00E1FFFF>super bitter medicine</color> again. I can't take it...
Traveler: This is but a test from the Dendro Archon, you know?
Azra: Eh? Is that so? But <color=#00E1FFFF>it's so bitter</color>... Can't the Dendro Archon be just a wee bit nicer?
Azra: ...Alright, alright, hand me the medicine. I'll take it later...

## Talk 11

Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
Traveler: She complained that the medicine was too bitter.
Zakariya: Well, there's nothing I can do about that. After all, the nature and components of the herbs... Ahem, I mean blessings, come with some bitterness.
Zakariya: Hopefully, she will finish it all this time. There was so much left over previously...
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Please take this as payment.

## Talk 12

Azra: Eh? Are these for me? Thank you...
Azra: Alright! I'll give the medicine another go... I'll finish it all for sure this time!

## Talk 13

Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
Traveler: I gave her some candies.
Zakariya: Candies? They'll reduce the efficacy of that medicine, though.
Zakariya: ...Ah, never mind. Reduced efficacy is better than no efficacy at all, and at least she can finish the medicine this time around.
Zakariya: I really can't thank you enough. Please take this as payment.

## Talk 14

Zakariya: The medicine delivery this time is for Aftab at the farmhouse.
Zakariya: That fellow's been living on a greasy diet, so he has serious digestion problems.
Zakariya: So please give him this medicine. By the way, tell him that... Um...
Zakariya: Tell him that eating lighter foods and having less alcohol and meat is the way to better embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Traveler: Sure.
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
Traveler: Where on earth did you hear such things?
Zakariya: Some Akademiya researchers have said that we can do something like that, though I don't understand why...

## Talk 15

Aftab: I just need to hold on for several days more...

## Talk 16

Aftab: Hmm? What is this medicine?
Traveler: Here's your medicine. Please maintain a light diet.
Aftab: *sigh* Okay, I will. Honestly, I <color=#00E1FFFF>haven't touched a slice of meat</color> in days. I'm sure that this will definitely help me to embrace the Dendro Archon's blessings better...
Aftab: But why do I feel worse than before? *sigh* No, no, I must've just spent too little time dieting, that's all...

## Talk 17

Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
Traveler: He has kept away from meat for quite a few days now...
Zakariya: What? I was telling him to eat lighter, not to completely stop eating meat!
Zakariya: Does he think that he can best embrace the Dendro Archon's blessings this way?
Zakariya: Alright... I guess I have to come up with something else...
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Here, this is for you.

## Talk 18

Aftab: What is this? No... The scent is just too...
Traveler: So here's what happened...
Aftab: Really? A light diet doesn't mean a full ban on meat? Even the Akademiya researchers don't do that?
Aftab: Sâ€”So that's it! I was afraid of making the Dendro Archon angry by eating meat.
Aftab: If even the researchers do eat meat... I won't worry about eating meat anymore. Thank you!

## Talk 19

Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
Traveler: I told him that he could just eat a steak or two...
Zakariya: Oh? It didn't occur to me you could put it like that...
Zakariya: Well, as long as Aftab is treating his body right, everything should be fine.
Zakariya: I can't thank you enough. Please take this as your payment.
