Traveler: About Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Royinjan: Ah... Though Greater Lord Rukkhadevata has long departed, she will always be the greatest deity of Sumeru.
Royinjan: She defended Sumeru from calamities and troubles and left us inexhaustible knowledge and treasures after her death.
Royinjan: So, usually, when I see an antique related to Greater Lord, I do my best to buy it and add it to my collection.
