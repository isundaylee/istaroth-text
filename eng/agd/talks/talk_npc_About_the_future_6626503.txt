Traveler: About the future...
Nepecha: I... want to be a Name Engraver too, just like Xilonen.
Nepecha: Though I still can't get my head around all those books, and... I'm also kinda scared of the furnace...
Nepecha: I'll do my best! When I grow up, I'll be super powerful...
Nepecha: At least... I don't want everyone to have to keep worrying about me.
