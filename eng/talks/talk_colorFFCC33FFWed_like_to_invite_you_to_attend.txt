Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Xingxi: A music festival, you say? Thank you. I do confess to being in the habit of collecting Radiant Spincrystals...
Paimon: Ooh, then you must have music you really enjoy, right? We could play it for you â€” we're serious musical types!
Xingxi: Oh? Really? Well, there is this one tune... What say I hum it for you, and you play it for me in turn?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Xingxi: Thanks for your trouble.
