# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mika: Of course!
Mika: It's rare to have time alone with you... I have so many things I want to ask you about.
Mika: For instance, your mastery of the sword allows you to defeat strong opponents that are even beyond the reach of arrows.
Mika: Distance and firing range are never a problem to you... How do you manage it?
Traveler: I can show you on the field someday.
Mika: Okay, sure... Since we'll be traveling together, watching you fight will definitely be the best way for me to learn.
Mika: Um, anyway, let's move on to a lighter topic... What kind of story do you want to hear?
Traveler: Anything you'd like to share.
Mika: Um... Let me think... Ah, here's an interesting one about the Reconnaissance Company.
Mika: When I first started, we'd pluck the petals off a Sweet Flower to decide who was on cooking duty after work.
Mika: Some of us weren't that good at cooking, but no one ever complained. We'd just polish off everything and then give constructive criticism.
Mika: With everyone's feedback and a period of trial and error, everyone's culinary skills significantly improved.
Mika: Obviously, our cooking can't compare to what you'd find at restaurants in the city, but they're pretty delicious as field rations go.
Traveler: Why don't we try that method as well?
Mika: Good idea! It introduces an element of surprise, too...
Mika: Hehe, I'm already looking forward to our next meal... I'll go and collect some Sweet Flowers!
Traveler: It would be an interesting way to choose the chef of the day.
Traveler: But for now, I want to hear your stories.
