Menthe: Oh, esteemed Iudex, the life of a small person truly is difficult...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you alright?
Menthe: Thank you, kind soul. Would you be willing to hear a Melusine's troubles?
Menthe: Perhaps I'm at fault for having been too enthusiastic about integrating into human life, but I've gradually found that there are a lot of difficult things to adapt to.
Menthe: Humans use such... large things in their daily lives. Take clothes for example — sure, we can just buy a shirt and use it as a dress, too, but we still need to get the cuffs tailored...
Menthe: And if we want to rent an apartment, we can only buy children's furniture — and even then, I have to step on a stool to reach the windows...
Menthe: If only I had a body like Sigewinne's... or maybe I should just go underwater...

Traveler: Um, don't do anything rash, alright?
Menthe: Huh? ...Oh, don't misunderstand! There's no need to worry, in any case — we Melusines are excellent in the water.
Menthe: When I say "underwater," I'm referring to the place where Sigewinne works. She's a companion of ours, but she looks more like a human.
Menthe: She welcomes friends from the Marechaussee Phantom to drink tea with her in her infirmary, but she's against us working there for a long time, unless we want to switch to work of a more medical bent.
Menthe: That's because many of those underwater have been sent there by the Marechaussee Phantom, so they probably wouldn't want to see uniformed Melusines...
Menthe: Is it too late for me to change jobs?

## Talk

Traveler: Keep your chin up!
Menthe: Yeah... Yeah! Just give me a moment to drink a cup of tea first, and I'll...

## Talk

Traveler: It's never too late to start.
Menthe: Whoa, spoken just like Monsieur Neuvillette. It's just that with my hands and eyes, there's a lot of human work that I can't do...
Menthe: In terms of ability, I'm more suited to the work at the Marechaussee Phantom. Everyone has their own strengths to utilize and duties to perform. I guess that is probably the order in life.
