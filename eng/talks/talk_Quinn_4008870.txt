# Talk Dialog

Beatrice: Quinn!
Quinn: ... It's you again, you're not gonna drag me into giving you another discount, are you?
Quinn: Before you say anything, I'm way too busy for this Weinlesefest!
Beatrice: Even if you're busy, you shouldn't forget about me!
Beatrice: No matter fruit or fruit wine, for the sake of childhood friendship, can't you get me a discount?
Quinn: I've told you many times, the fruit is not on sale. And I'm just helping deliver fruit to the drink stands. How can you insist on a discount?
Beatrice: Come on, hook a sister up!
Beatrice: I know you love wine. I'll get some and share with you. Then I'll help you make some refreshments. Could you just give me a discount?
Quinn: No discounts. No matter what you say!
