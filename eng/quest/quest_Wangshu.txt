# Wangshu


## Talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about that adeptus
Verr Goldet: Oh? You've already met Xiao?
Verr Goldet: Not bad. Not often he's in a good enough mood to agree to see people.
Paimon: That's his good mood?
Verr Goldet: Oh yes, the adepti are very hard to come by. Many people go their whole lives praying to them, never once actually getting to see one.
Verr Goldet: When the Geo Archon built Liyue, he borrowed power from the adepti.
Verr Goldet: But most of them only know how to protect Liyue by fighting.
Verr Goldet: So for many millennia, it has instead been humans who have led Liyue, whilst the adepti have lived hidden away on the outskirts.
Paimon: You really know a lot, huh boss lady.
Verr Goldet: It's not "boss lady," it's just boss...
Verr Goldet: Anyway, seen as you have the favor of the adepti, things should be a lot easier.
Verr Goldet: Well... If you wanna know my opinion... If you keep Xiao in a good mood, things should be okay.
Paimon: Good mood? Can't really imagine what a "good mood" looks like for that "Vigilant Yaksha."
Verr Goldet: Haha! Will be interesting, won't it?
Verr Goldet: (Come to think of it, I've never seen him smile either...)
Verr Goldet: How 'bout this — you go see the chef for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and a plate of whatever it is you are best at making.
Verr Goldet: Almond Tofu is one of the few human foods Xiao likes. The other dish is up to you.
Paimon: #Up to us, eh...? Traveler, what do you think you're the best at cooking?
Traveler: Satisfying Salad I guess?
Paimon: Really hard to screw that one up, right?
Paimon: But, if we're gonna be cooking for an adeptus, perhaps the Satisfying Salad would be the safer choice...
Traveler: Perhaps a Maha Manjusaka Hot Pyro Slime?
Paimon: Wow! Never heard of that one! Paimon wants to try it!

## Talk 2

Smiley Yanxiao: Can't you see I'm on a break kid? Scram.
Traveler: Excuse me, we'd like an Almond To—
Smiley Yanxiao: Scram!
Paimon: Whoa, this chef guy's service is about as good as that Wagner guy's back in Mondstadt.
Traveler: It's for the boss, Goldet.
Smiley Yanxiao: ...
Smiley Yanxiao: I see. If it's for the boss, then guess I don't have a choice now, do I?
Smiley Yanxiao: But my heart's not really in it right now, not enough to make a dessert as painstaking as Almond Tofu.
Paimon: And why is that?
Smiley Yanxiao: A fencer's hand must be steady, so too must the hand of a chef.
Smiley Yanxiao: But my hands, I'm... they're not steady...
Smiley Yanxiao: Because ahh, a traveler once told me that this inn... is haunted.
Smiley Yanxiao: And then, just now — just now! In the kitchen... I saw something... something not right.
Paimon: (This chef looks so intimidating, but speak of ghosts and he becomes weak.)
Smiley Yanxiao: I keep thinking... even Wangshu Inn isn't safe. I—I can't keep a steady hand for something like Almond Tofu.
Paimon: #Alright Traveler. In the name of high-quality Almond Tofu, we need to go check this kitchen out.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Doesn't seem to be anyth—
Paimon: ...
Paimon: ...
Paimon: ##@&%*!

## Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: What!? You saw it too! There really is a ghost!
Smiley Yanxiao: What... How can I...
Paimon: Okay, so he's useless now. What do we do?
Paimon: Forget it. Let's just go see the boss lady again.

## Talk 5

Verr Goldet: Hehe... Scared of something so insignificant. Hard to believe he was once a notorious bandit.
Paimon: You don't seem that afraid of ghosts, boss lady.
Verr Goldet: Gods and ghosts, I've seen it all before.
Paimon: Come to think of it, others don't seem to know there's an adeptus here at the inn, except for the boss lady...
Verr Goldet: Shh!
Verr Goldet: Say any more and you'll be divulging my little secret.
Verr Goldet: Right. Best you two be off. Go see to it that little ghost doesn't go scaring anybody else.
Verr Goldet: Not that I'm ordering you around. It's like the adeptus said, mortal souls are not as robust as those of the adepti.
Verr Goldet: So as to not be harmed when dealing with the adepti, you can start by practicing with that ghost.
Traveler: Sounds good.
Paimon: But how should we persuade the ghost?
Verr Goldet: There is a calligraphy painting in the inn known as the Witness Sigil. It's been in circulation for over a thousand years. Go take a look at it.
Verr Goldet: Once you have, look for a place outside where you can see the exact same Witness Sigil formation.
Traveler: But how should we persuade the ghost?

## Talk 6

Dusky Ming: ♪ Silly-churl, billy-churl ♪...
Paimon: Phew... Finally caught you. Paimon's pooped.
Dusky Ming: ♪ Silly-billy hilichurl ♪ ...
Paimon: Haunting things isn't nice! Little girl, are you listening?
Dusky Ming: ♪ Chilly-churl, frilly-churl ♪ ...
Paimon: Now listen here young lady!
Dusky Ming: ...
Dusky Ming: Okay.
Dusky Ming: Dusky Ming won't tease the travelers at the inn anymore.
Dusky Ming: #Next time Traveler can come play with Dusky Ming.
Dusky Ming: If you don't come and play, Dusky Ming will come find you~

## Talk 7

Smiley Yanxiao: Wh-What... You really got the ghost to promise to stop haunting the inn?
Smiley Yanxiao: Wow... You really are something...
Smiley Yanxiao: I am in your debt.
Smiley Yanxiao: Please wait a moment. I'll make you the smoothest, silkiest bowl of Almond Tofu.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haha, my hands are steadier than ever now that she's gone.

## Talk 8

Xiao: ...You two again.
Paimon: Wait! Don't go disappearing again.
Xiao: What's this?
Paimon: It's your favorite, Almond Tofu! As well as this distant traveler's best dish — a Satisfying Salad.
Paimon: #Traveler! Quick! Tell him everything before he finishes eating!
Xiao: Rex Lapis... How could this be?
Xiao: I... can't imagine it. Though times have changed, I've never imagined a Liyue without him.
Xiao: The ruling Qixing... Just what role have they played in this?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I will seek Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and Cloud Retainer. It is time they too made their decisions.
Traveler: Will the adepti take over his role in Liyue?
Xiao: Adepti do not turn on their responsibilities.
Xiao: I have my reasons to not want to be tainted by the mortal realm, but... responsibilities are responsibilities.
Xiao: Our god is the God of Contracts after all.
Paimon: Wait! Paimon still has one last question.
Xiao: Hmm?
Paimon: That... Dusky Ming. She's...
Xiao: When conquering demons, on occasion, you can come across spirits who have never hurt anyone, yet are also not yet able to be moved on.
Xiao: So I asked the innkeeper and the boss if they could keep her here for a time.
Paimon: So really, Wangshu Inn was looking after her! Really keeping a wide range of business going, huh!
Traveler: Will the adepti interrogate the Qixing?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Verr Goldet: Opportunities to meet an adeptus are rare and fleeting. Make the most of it.

### Additional Talk 2

Verr Goldet: Ghosts are just another form of life on earth. It's certainly possible to deal with them on their own terms.

### Additional Talk 3

Verr Goldet: Opportunities to meet an adeptus are rare and fleeting. Make the most of it.

Smiley Yanxiao: I haven't enjoyed something so much in a long time. That dish was pure perfection.

### Additional Talk 5

Smiley Yanxiao: May the G—Geo Lord protect you... May all the deities protect you!

### Additional Talk 6

Smiley Yanxiao: If the bosses hadn't been so good to me, there's no way I'd be putting up with this...

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Goodbye.
Verr Goldet: Safe travels.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: Tell me about your husband.
Verr Goldet: Over there. He's the innkeeper.
Verr Goldet: Don't be led astray by the cheeky grin on his face. He is a rather formidable martial artist.
Verr Goldet: I also practice martial arts, as do the kitchen staff. It is a hiring requirement.
Verr Goldet: You have to have nimble use of your hands and feet when you're serving guests, don't you think?

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Who are you?
Verr Goldet: My name is Goldet and I come from Mondstadt. I am the boss here at the Wangshu Inn.
Verr Goldet: Lest you think I was the boss' wife.
Verr Goldet: I'm the boss, with a capital "B-O-S-S."
Traveler: I've heard the rumors...
Verr Goldet: Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
Verr Goldet: What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
Verr Goldet: All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
Verr Goldet: Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
Traveler: Whose is this kitty?
Verr Goldet: *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
Verr Goldet: Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
Verr Goldet: You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief — you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.

### Additional Talk 10

Verr Goldet: Hello! ...A distinctive but elusive dress sense, defined yet atypical facial features, and followed around everywhere by a floating elf companion. Hmm... nope. Can't place you.

### Additional Talk 11

Xiao: A Sigil of Permission? You came prepared.
Xiao: Though this only prevents me from hurting you myself. Doesn't stop you from getting hurt in other ways.
Paimon: Uhh... Paimon doesn't get it...
Xiao: Too much contact with our world is breaking the rules.
Xiao: Mortal souls are not as robust as those of adepti, nor can your blood carry this level of adeptal energy.
Xiao: It's for your own good. Leave. Now.
Paimon: Wait a sec, we came here to...
Paimon: Argh! Paimon's... peeved! All he does is think about himself!
Paimon: Paimon wants to give him an ugly nickname... but if you tick off an adeptus, the only thing you'll probably ever find in treasure chests is cabbages! Bleurgh!
Paimon: Ugh... Guess we should go ask the boss lady of the inn about just how she manages to talk to adepti.

### Additional Talk 12

Xiao: Oh. It's you two.
Paimon: We meet again! Hiya!
Xiao: Why do you insist on getting involved in the world of demons and adepti? You're breaking the rules too often.
Xiao: Mortal souls are not as robust as those of adepti, nor can your blood carry this level of adeptal energy.
Xiao: It's for your own good. Leave. Now.
Paimon: Wait a sec, we came here to...
Paimon: Argh! Paimon's... peeved! All he does is think about himself!
Paimon: Paimon wants to give him an ugly nickname... but if you tick off an adeptus, the only thing you'll probably ever find in treasure chests is cabbages! Bleurgh!
Paimon: Ugh... Guess we should go ask the boss lady of the inn about just how she manages to talk to adepti.
