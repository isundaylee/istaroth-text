# A Novel Idea


## Talk 1

Chang the Ninth: I just don't know where to start...
Traveler: What are you up to now?
Chang the Ninth: Oh, it's you again. I'm writing a new novel — well, trying to. I just can't seem to find a compelling idea for an intro.
Chang the Ninth: I've been racking my brains for ages, but I'm at a complete loss. At this rate, who knows when I'll be able to start writing in earnest...
Chang the Ninth: You're a traveler, yes? You know what the world is like. So tell me, what do you think the key ingredient is to a successful novel?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Heart and soul.
Chang the Ninth: Oh, come on. Don't give me that nonsense! I'm asking a serious question here!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Epic battles.
Chang the Ninth: Battles, eh... Battles... There's something to that idea. It's attention-grabbing, at least.
Chang the Ninth: Though I can hardly find inspiration on that topic in Qingce Village... No battles here, let alone the epic variety...
Chang the Ninth: I'd need to look further afield... In the wild! Yes, that'd do it! I hear there are many adventurers out in the wild.
Chang the Ninth: They go roaming all over the place looking for treasure, and always end up in battle with monsters.
Chang the Ninth: As it happens, I know a place where there are plenty of monsters. Not your average monsters either, these ones are quite something! Yes! We can go there and wait for an adventurer to show up, and then witness the ensuing battle firsthand.
Chang the Ninth: And then... Haha, then I'd have everything I need! Right then! Without further ado, I shall be off! There's quite some distance to cover, so don't be too long yourselves, either!

## Talk 4

Chang the Ninth: Hey, this is great... Now I can say I've experienced an epic battle firsthand!
Traveler: I thought you just wanted to watch from a distance?
Chang the Ninth: Well, yes, that was the original idea. But then the adventurers I was counting on didn't show up...
Chang the Ninth: I noticed the monsters were slowly starting to make a move. If they'd all left, this would have been a wasted trip.
Chang the Ninth: So... I threw a stone at them. That's how the stories always go, isn't it? Throw a stone, get their attention. Or something.
Chang the Ninth: How was I to know the stone would hit one of them square on the head? And then... Well, you know the rest.
Chang the Ninth: Anyway, all's well that ends well. Sure, I got some scrapes and bruises... but boy, did I get a story too. And that's what I came for.
Chang the Ninth: Finally, I can feel the creative juices starting to flow! Oh — by the way, take this for your trouble. Thanks.
Chang the Ninth: Methinks my writer's block has been dealt a fatal blow! I must away, my pen and paper eagerly await my return...

## Talk 5

Traveler: A gushy romance.

## Talk 6

Chang the Ninth: Ah yes, there's three children who are always playing down by the harbor. Meng, Lulu, Fei. Ring any bells?
Chang the Ninth: I know they're only children, but... between the three of them, they must have some tales to tell, surely.
Chang the Ninth: Go and look into it, anyway. Make a note of any good material, and bring it back here.

## Talk 7

Zhihua: Hello there, Qiming! Today, I—
Qiming: Today's not good for me.
Zhihua: ...But I hadn't even said what it was yet.
Qiming: No need. I have a fairly good idea of where you were headed. And today is just not good for me.
Zhihua: Well then... when is a good day for you? Or don't you—
Qiming: Oh, don't worry. The day will come. It will be a very good day for me when it does.
Zhihua: ...That tells me nothing! Qiming, please. Hear me out, now—
Qiming: Thank you, next!
Zhihua: But I haven't finished! And... what do you mean, "next"!? There isn't even a queue!

## Talk 8

Sisi: Chaoxi, you're back! I just found out how to cook this amazing new dish. Why not come back with me? I'll cook it for you!
Chaoxi: Sisi, I literally just got back and I'm completely drained, mentally and physically. I just need to lie down right now...
Sisi: Yes, of course — all that hard work, you must be exhausted. Definitely get some rest.
Sisi: So... Let's have a proper catch-up after you've fully recovered, shall we? We could always set a date now...
Chaoxi: Sure, sounds great. I'll let you know. I just can't commit to a specific date right now... I'm not trying to get out of it, I just don't want to make a promise I can't keep...
Chaoxi: *sigh* I'm a sailor, Sisi. And as a sailor, I'm married to the sea. You deserve much better...
Sisi: Don't talk like that, Chaoxi... You know I understand...

## Talk 9

Chang the Ninth: Well, how'd it go? Got a story for me?
Traveler: Here are our notes.
Chang the Ninth: Great! Let me see... Zhihua and Qiming! I knew it...
Chang the Ninth: Mm-hmm... Yes... This is great material! Excellent!
Traveler: ...Seriously?
Chang the Ninth: Can't you see? Maybe it isn't obvious at first, but if you look closely, there's a subtle but powerful tension here... There's clearly something going on between these two, they've just agreed to keep it to themselves...
Chang the Ninth: Mm, yes... I think I have the beginnings of a plot...
Chang the Ninth: Oh, and please take these. Thanks for your help! Now, to think... perchance, to write...

## Talk 10

Chang the Ninth: Last time I went into the city, I saw a man talking to a young lady who appeared to be a fortune-teller. He was prattling away... I didn't bother to listen in.
Chang the Ninth: I later found out the garrulous gent's name is Zhihua, and the fortune-telling lady's is Qiming. Seems there's some history there... Why don't you go ask them about their stories? If it's anything interesting, come back and fill me in.

## Talk 11

Little Meng: Lulu, it's definitely Fei's turn to be the captain this time.
Little Fei: Right! I keep saying, why do I have to be the first mate all the time?
Little Lulu: I just think it's more fun for everyone involved when Meng is the captain.
Little Meng: That's a bit unfair, Lulu. I think Fei plays it very well.
Little Lulu: Everyone plays their parts very well. You as the captain, me as the rich merchant, and Fei as first mate.
Little Lulu: And this time is gonna be the funnest of all! What do you think, Fei?
Little Meng: Lulu, come on...
Little Fei: Well... If that's what you think, Lulu... I—I guess it's okay by me.
Little Meng: Fei...! We've talked about this...
Little Fei: No, it's fine. I don't mind. Whatever makes Lulu happy. Come on, let's play.
Little Fei: Captain shmaptain. Not like I care.
Little Meng: ...Ugh, you guys are unbelievable...

## Talk 12

Traveler: Missing text (3971118213)

## Talk 13

Chang the Ninth: Now I think about it... do you know a Sisi, by any chance? She often hangs around the harbor, waiting for some sailor named Chaoxi.
Chang the Ninth: She seems to go out and look for him on quite a regular basis. There must be a backstory there, surely?
Chang the Ninth: Do a little investigating, anyway. If you come across any good stories, note them down and bring them back here.

## Talk 14

Chang the Ninth: Romance... I'd have my work cut out, that's for sure. My knowledge of romance is... let's say, broad strokes at the most...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Chang the Ninth: But you have a point — there are plenty of people like me in the world who are completely lacking in experience or understanding of romance. The market is ripe for the taking.
Chang the Ninth: But how would I research for a romantic story? Let me see...

### Additional Talk 2

Chang the Ninth: Well, how'd it go? Got a story for me?
Traveler: Here are our notes.
Chang the Ninth: Ah, wonderful! Let me see... Hmm, something's not right with this Chaoxi chap... Wait, no, I take it back. Something's wrong with both of them.
Chang the Ninth: Does this count as romance? Hmm... Well, romance or not, there's a plot here, at least. I can work with this.
Chang the Ninth: Oh, and please take these. Thanks for bringing me some material. Now, I need to think about where to go with this story...
Chang the Ninth: Hmm, I think it should work fine for a novel, although I shudder to think about how the real-life version of the story will end! Probably with the Millelith picking up the pieces...
Chang the Ninth: These two are headed for disaster...

### Additional Talk 3

Chang the Ninth: Well, how'd it go? Got a story for me?
Traveler: Here are our notes.
Chang the Ninth: Fabulous! ...But a little lacking in grit. They are only children, after all... Maybe if you went back in a few years, there'd be more of a blossoming romance there.
Chang the Ninth: I'll hold onto it, though. There's the beginnings of a story in there. It may not be bursting with romantic potential, but I can probably think of a way to flesh it out.
Chang the Ninth: Oh, and please take these. Thanks for bringing me some material. Now, I need to think about how to develop it...

Chang the Ninth: Romantic thoughts, Chang, romantic thoughts... Hmm, this is really not my forte...
