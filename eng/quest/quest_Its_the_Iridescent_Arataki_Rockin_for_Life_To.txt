# ...It's the Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness!


## Talk 1

Dvorak: Thank you both so much! At last, everything on the list is done.
Dvorak: I'm afraid I still have some final preparations to make, but I'll see you tomorrow. Then, the party can begin!

## Talk 2

Dvorak: I still have some final preparations to make for the big party.

## Talk 3

Arataki Itto: Compadres, you're here! Hey, serious props to you both. The place looks amazing, even better than I imagined! Hahahahaha!
Kuki Shinobu: #Everything looks perfect. We're ready for business. {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you have our thanks.
Paimon: Guys, guys... why so serious? That ain't rock 'n' roll, man.
Arataki Itto: Hey, look at that! My favorite melon's a fast learner! Also, I hear you're gonna be taking the stage tonight! Itching for a little competition, huh?
Paimon: Uhh... Paimon was just joking! ...Gah, seriously, Dvorak? Unbelievable...
Arataki Itto: Getting cold feet? Don't blame you. I am the reigning champion of The Great Singalong, after all.
Traveler: Oh, Paimon. Backing down from a challenge ain't very rock 'n' roll.
Paimon: What— Paimon is too rock 'n' roll! Paimon was just being humble!
Arataki Itto: Then bring it on.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon's bringin' it alright! Paimon's bringin' it all the way home! Hmph!
Traveler: Oh by the way — did you ever find that dog?
Arataki Itto: ...We hit a complete dead-end. Gorou said he didn't know anything, Mamoru and the guys asked around the city, but no luck there either.
Arataki Itto: What if it really IS in Tenshukaku? Is that why we can't find it?
Paimon: No, no, don't go poking around Tenshukaku again... You'll give Kujou Sara a migraine.
Arataki Itto: Couldn't agree more. If I bother her too much, I'll end up getting struck by lightning...
Arataki Itto: So that's why this time, I kept my distance and just threw some paper notes towards Tenshukaku. Hopefully, the Raiden Shogun sees them and hands the dog over.
Paimon: Wait, what? You're still taking a big risk there...
Kuki Shinobu: It looks like Doushin Shikanoin was right. It's probably just a local legend after all.
Arataki Itto: Let's hope not, 'cause that would really suck! Wish I had more time to look into it, but unfortunately — this guy's got a performance to practice for.
Arataki Itto: Now don't forget, there's lyrics and music scores in the Jam Zone. So no wussing out tonight!
Paimon: Don't get too cocky, Bull-Chucker! We'll see who's rock 'n' roll!
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Game on, Mini Melon!
Paimon: Paimon better get some practice in at the Jam Zone soon. No way is Paimon gonna lose to Itto!
Kuki Shinobu: By the way, we invited a ton of people this time, including some people you know. A few have already shown up, and they're asking about you — wanna go say hi?
Paimon: Cool! Yeah, let's go see them! Paimon's curious to find out who you invited.
Traveler: Come on, Paimon. You can beat Itto!
Paimon: Oh, ya think so? 'Cause Paimon totally thinks so too.

## Talk 4

Sangonomiya Kokomi: This Ms. Hina looks very familiar... Even the outfit...
Gorou: I was thinking the same thing, Your Excellency. But I just can't put my finger on it...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: She really is the spitting image...
Gorou: Of who?
Paimon: Gorou! Kokomi! Hey!
Gorou: Ah, hello, you two! It's been a while!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, I'm so happy to see you again. I was just asking Shinobu if she knew where you were.
Paimon: This is a nice surprise. Paimon didn't expect to run into you two at an Arataki Gang music festival!
Traveler: I hear that Gorou helped to secure the venue?
Gorou: Oh, I barely did anything.
Gorou: A reader from my That's Life column was asking for advice about it, so I figured I'd help out. Turned out the reader in question was Mr. Arataki Itto.
Gorou: Her Excellency was also very supportive of the whole thing.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... An international rock 'n' roll music festival sounded like a good way to attract tourists. And it's to bring attention to the plight of living things, right? Seems like a meaningful cause.
Paimon: Yeah. Apparently, it has something to do with a dog that was a war hero? Although sadly, probably not a true story. Have either of you... heard anything about that...?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, you know, bits and pieces... Nothing concrete.
Gorou: Mm... Yeah, no, me neither.
Paimon: Hmm, those sounded suspiciously like prepared answers!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, probably because we've answered that question before. Mr. Arataki Itto came to ask us about it a while back. We'd certainly love to help, if we can.
Gorou: Yes, of course... Um, ahem, actually, I was hoping to ask for your opinion on something.
Traveler: Sure, what is it?
Gorou: Does Ms. Hina look familiar to you at all? I have this strange feeling like I've seen her somewhere before...
Paimon: Oh... Umm...
Traveler: I feel like I've met her before... but...
Gorou: But you don't remember where?
Paimon: #Eh, she probably just looks similar to someone you know. Like how {NICKNAME} looks similar to {M#his}{F#her} {M#sister}{F#brother}! There's no mystery here. Don't overthink it.
Gorou: I see... That does make sense...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's get outta here...
Traveler: ...Nope, sorry. Doesn't ring any bells.
Gorou: Hmm. Maybe it's just me...

## Talk 5

Thoma: You're a real trooper, Yoimiya! This must be one of the furthest places you've ever delivered to.
Yoimiya: I promised Itto that I'd supply fireworks for his festival. I wasn't about to go back on my word.
Paimon: Hey! Thoma, Yoimiya!
Yoimiya: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! Cool, you're here too!
Traveler: It's been too long!
Thoma: Haha, looks I owe the Arataki Gang a huge thank-you. If they weren't putting on this event, who knows when I would've gotten to see you next.
Yoimiya: You hear that? In case it was too subtle for you — Thoma's complaining that you guys never make time to come and visit your old pals.
Thoma: That's true. Obviously, traveling's very important to you, but you gotta take a break every once in a while. Just remember that you've got friends out there who'd love nothing more than the chance to make you feel looked after.
Traveler: Thank you both. That means a lot.
Yoimiya: Of course! Ooh, I heard this really cool thing, I gotta share with you guys.
Yoimiya: So Itto says that the theme of this music festival comes from a story about a dog that saved animals in the warzone. How amazing is that!
Yoimiya: What do you know about this dog, Thoma? Everyone knows how well-connected you are.
Thoma: Heh, for once... not much, I'm afraid. I guess my connections are one key canine short.
Thoma: But assuming this really happened, I feel like Watatsumi Island would've had to be involved.
Thoma: This is a dog who managed to sneak in and out of a warzone, repeatedly, without leaving a trail for anyone to follow. Whatever the case, it would've needed someone to help cover its tracks.
Thoma: As far as I know, the Shogun's Army doesn't do that kind of thing.
Paimon: So you're saying it was the Sangonomiya troops? They had a specially trained dog for rescuing critters from the battlefield?
Yoimiya: Sounds kinda far-fetched if you ask me... Do we really think Sangonomiya's forces had enough manpower to fight a full-scale war and run a... what, a canine wildlife rescue operation on the side?
Paimon: Okay, well if wasn't Sangonomiya's side, it must have been the Shogunate!
Traveler: I doubt they had the manpower either...
Thoma: Right. So in my view, it's more likely that Mr. Dvorak simply made the story up as something to capture people's imaginations.
Thoma: I mean, he's an artist, right? Isn't rock music about expressing things we don't fully understand?
Yoimiya: Kinda like fireworks, in a way. Don't question it, just feel it...
Paimon: Hmm... Yeah, that sort of makes sense. That makes you an artist too, Yoimiya! Fireworks are your art.
Yoimiya: Heehee, I'll take it! And on that note — boy, do I have an art show for you tonight! Make sure you don't miss it!

## Talk 6

Shikanoin Heizou: Hey, there you are! I sent you some letters a few days ago, have they shown up yet?
Paimon: Ooooh! Does this mean you've figured it out?
Shikanoin Heizou: I've made some progress, but I'm still missing the final piece of the puzzle.
Traveler: So. What did you learn?
Shikanoin Heizou: I don't have anything conclusive yet, but I have a hunch that it involved both the Yashiro Commission and Sangonomiya.
Paimon: What!? You mean like... in cahoots? During the war!?
Shikanoin Heizou: Shhh... Like I said, it's just a hunch. Let's not get carried away.
Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, I've written to the station, and they shouldn't take too long to get back to me. Yoriki Owada should be able to help find what I need.
Shikanoin Heizou: In the meantime, you'll just have to be patient.
Shikanoin Heizou: I would have gone back to the station to look into it myself, but I knew Itto was performing tonight and I didn't wanna miss it.
Traveler: You know who else is performing tonight? Paimon!
Shikanoin Heizou: Oh, wow! Sounds like I'm in for a real treat. I definitely picked the right place to be tonight.
Shikanoin Heizou: Will the Traveler's long-serving "Voice" finally graduate from speech to song in a triumphant victory over the oni rocker of Hanamizaka?
Traveler: They don't call her "Flying Rock 'N' Roll Fuel" for nothing.
Shikanoin Heizou: Hahahaha! I'll be awaiting with bated breath!
Paimon: Cut it out, both of you! No more stupid nicknames!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, Mr. Dvorak! You're still here.
Dvorak: Sure am. I've been checking over the equipment, scores, and lyric sheets to make sure everything's ready for tonight.
Dvorak: Shinobu was telling me how popular light novels are here in Inazuma. So I've tweaked the melody and lyrics for a more Arataki Gang feel with a light novel twist.
Paimon: Light novels plus rock music, so... light rock!
Dvorak: Hahaha. I actually didn't change too much — just took out the dog and made it about Onikabuto instead. Should be more up Itto's alley.
Dvorak: This event couldn't have happened without him. It's my way of showing him some appreciation, I guess.
Paimon: Whaaat? You got rid of the dog? But... wasn't that the whole inspiration behind the festival?
Dvorak: Yes, but that's all it was. The initial inspiration. Doesn't matter if we change it to an Onikabuto, or you, or me, or anything else. It's the spirit of it that counts.
Paimon: Spirit? What do you mean?
Dvorak: Umm... The spirit of rock 'n' roll?
Paimon: ...Okay, shoulda seen that coming.
Traveler: Do you think people have been getting too hyper-focused on the dog story?
Dvorak: Hehe, it's all about the music, my friends. Just enjoy the music, that's all that matters.
Paimon: Fair enough... Alright, well speaking of enjoying music, is it alright if Paimon goes first?
Paimon: Paimon's gotta get practicing, or Bull-Chucker's gonna hog the spotlight tonight!
Dvorak: By all means, be my guest! I knew you'd come around to the idea of going on stage.
Dvorak: Here's the music score and lyrics. I can't wait to see this!
Paimon: Ooh, let's see now, what's this song called...
Paimon: "I Got Reincarnated as an Onikabuto... And Flipped the World Upside Down"...
Paimon: What sort of song title is that? Is this supposed to be rock 'n' roll?
Dvorak: Soft rock, actually.
Traveler: I gotta see these lyrics...
Paimon: #Nope, no peeking, {NICKNAME}! You can hear them tonight when Paimon sings the song!
Paimon: Paimon's gonna rock so hard, Bull-Chucker won't know what hit him!
Black Screen Text: The time flies by, and night soon falls...
Black Screen Text: Music lovers take turns showcasing their talent on the stage.
Black Screen Text: Whoops and cheers ring out as the crowd grows louder and the atmosphere gets wilder.
Black Screen Text: Before you know it, the moment has arrived.
Dvorak: Ladies and gentlemen!
Dvorak: Tonight is a night to celebrate, and I trust you're all having a wonderful time!
Dvorak: It's been a non-stop rock 'n' roll ride this evening, and we're almost at the end. But first, it is my huge honor to invite two very special guests to the stage...
Dvorak: The illustrious Mr. Arataki Itto!
Dvorak: And Ms. Paimon!
Dvorak: The two of them will be performing a brand-new song written specially for tonight's event. It's called:
Dvorak: "I Got Reincarnated as an Onikabuto... And Flipped the World Upside Down"!
Dvorak: Take it away!

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: The time flies by, and night soon falls...
Dvorak: Ladies and gentlemen!
Dvorak: Tonight is a night to celebrate, and I trust you're all having a wonderful time!
Dvorak: It's been a non-stop rock 'n' roll ride this evening, and we're almost at the end. But first, it is my huge honor to invite two very special guests to the stage...
Dvorak: The illustrious Mr. Arataki Itto!

Dvorak: Take it away!

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: After an exhilarating song to end the night, many people begin to leave...
Yoimiya: So that's rock music, huh? It's a little different than I imagined.
Thoma: Really? It's different from what I'd heard before... Could be a relatively new genre of rock, I suppose.
Arataki Itto: So, how'd you like my performance? Did I dominate this lil' melon here or what? Hahahahaha!
Paimon: Okay, Bull-Chucker! You got owned and you know it!
Yoimiya: Oh, stop it, you two. I think both of you were sensational!
Thoma: Hear, hear! Really mind-blowing stuff, guys.
Kuki Shinobu: I call it a draw. You're very evenly matched.
Arataki Itto: Oh, you think? Okay, well what about you, my compadre? Who do you think is the most rock 'n' roll?
Traveler: Itto.
Traveler: Paimon.
Traveler: You're both rockstars.
Traveler: Anyway, what nice weather we've been having lately!
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! That's right, compadre you tell 'em. Behold the majesty of the Rock 'N' Roll King of Hanamizaka!
Paimon: Argh! Traitor! That's it, Paimon's not talking to you for the next minute!
Paimon: #Hehehe, {NICKNAME}'s always got Paimon's back! Take that, Bull-Chucker! Hah!
Arataki Itto: #Huh? Oh, my gullible little melon. You don't really believe that do you? {M#He}{F#She} just didn't wanna hurt your feelings!
Paimon: Hmm... Really? Do you really think that?
Arataki Itto: Ah, fine... My compadre wouldn't lie to me. I can handle the truth...
Arataki Itto: *sigh*... Rock on, Mini Melon... Rock on.
Arataki Itto: Hey, don't try to change the subject!
Dvorak: Haha, let's not argue anymore, shall we? Itto and Paimon, you both gave incredibly moving performances...
Dvorak: I owe you all an enormous debt of gratitude. Without your help, this music festival never would've happened.
Arataki Itto: Don't mention it, Jack-Attack! Hey, if we hadn't met, I wouldn't even know what the spirit of rock 'n' roll means!
Yoimiya: The spirit of rock 'n' roll? So, what does it mean? What does it mean for rock music to have a "spirit"?
Arataki Itto: It means you rock up, rock out, roll the dice, and roll with the punches! Just like me and Paimon!
Paimon: Yeah, that's obviously not what it means... Mr. Dvorak, could you please give us the official definition? Someone needs to take this guy down a peg.
Dvorak: Hehe, an official definition? I don't know that one exists... It's an emotional experience. As though you're hearing your own story speak to you through the music.
Thoma: Funny you should say that... I was just thinking that the spirit of rock 'n' roll is... well, like the Onikabuto in the song: Having the courage to grab life by the horns and survive against all the odds.
Thoma: Guess I have a better sense rock 'n' roll than I thought! Haha.
Paimon: What about you, Yoimiya?
Yoimiya: Oh, well... I thought it was gonna be all about that dog, but then the song didn't even mention it, so...
Yoimiya: Was that supposed to be symbolic...? Like, if the dog didn't exist, maybe the injured animals didn't, either...
Yoimiya: If there were no injured animals, that means there was no war, which means... the world is at peace.
Paimon: Oh! So for Yoimiya, the rock 'n' roll spirit is all about world peace!
Traveler: Shinobu? What about you?
Kuki Shinobu: Me? Uh, I hadn't given it all that much thought. I was mostly worrying about whether those paper notes Boss threw into Tenshukaku are going to get him in trouble with the Tenryou Commission...
Thoma: Haha! That must mean that for Shinobu, the rock 'n' roll spirit is about keeping the Arataki Gang safe.
Arataki Itto: Shinobu, seriously, you've got nothing to worry about. If the Raiden Shogun had seen any of those notes, she'd have come to join the party!
Paimon: Paimon agrees that you don't need to worry. Otherwise, Heizou definitely would've arrested Itto by now!
Paimon: Wait... Where is that guy, anyway? And where did Kokomi and Gorou go?
Kuki Shinobu: Oh, Doushin Shikanoin had to run back to the station, so he didn't get the chance to say goodbye to you guys. But he did leave something for you. It's over there.
Kuki Shinobu: As for the other two, they couldn't stick around because they had a government meeting to get to. They did ask me to pass on their regards, though.
Dvorak: The fact that these busy people all made time to attend the party is telling. Clearly, Itto wasn't exaggerating about the stature of the Arataki Gang.
Dvorak: Itto, what can I say... It's truly been an honor to work with you.
Arataki Itto: #Hahahahaha! Well, Jack-Attack, I can't take all the credit — let's not forget {NICKNAME}'s part in all this!
Arataki Itto: #A lot of people only showed up because they knew {M#he'd}{F#she'd} be here. If we do this again, we gotta make sure we find a way to get {M#him}{F#her} on stage.
Arataki Itto: How's that sound, compadre? Get that rock 'n' roll spirit ready, 'cause next time, it'll be your turn to rock our collective socks off!

## Talk 10

Gorou: Your Excellency, I believe the Tenryou Commission detective has—
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry about it, Gorou. The Puppy Union was a joint venture between us and the Yashiro Commission. If we can maintain secrecy, then all the better for it. But that was never the main goal.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We saved some lives, and that's what matters.
Gorou: I was more worried about the potential impact on your reputation, Your Excellency... After all, some of the lives we saved belonged to the Shogunate...
Gorou: If someone with an agenda finds out, it could cause an uproar...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry. There might be a way to make it work out in our favor.
Gorou: Really? How?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Times have changed. We and Narukami Island are supposed to be working together now.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So it's not necessarily a bad thing if people discover that we were already cooperating with the Yashiro Commission even during the war.
Gorou: I see...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Gorou, if you want my opinion, you should be more concerned about Ms. Hina than you are about this.
Gorou: Ms. Hina? What makes you say that?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I hear she works for That's Life magazine as well. She's young, popular, pretty...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And she seems to be just as good at offering comfort to people in need as you are. So it looks like you have some competition.
Gorou: Ahem... Understood, Your Excellency! I will work hard to stay ahead of the competition!

## Talk 11

Yae Miko: I learned something new today... I never knew that the Hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
Raiden Shogun: Miko... A few days ago, some strange paper notes flew into Tenshukaku, demanding that I "hand over the dog"... So I am here to see what on earth it was all about.
Yae Miko: Haha, I just assumed you must've gotten yourself a pet puppy.
Raiden Shogun: As it happens, I also received an invitation letter via Sara.
Raiden Shogun: I've never heard the name "Arataki" before... But they must be one of my subjects, and so I thought, why not grant them their wish?
Yae Miko: Ah... so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
Yae Miko: So tell me, how do you plan to respond to the Fontainian musician? It sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war...
Raiden Shogun: The war...
Raiden Shogun: I'm not sure we can give him the answer he would hope for.
Raiden Shogun: But if nothing else, I know that we must avoid another war at all costs. The people cannot be made to suffer like that again.
Yae Miko: Hmm...
Yae Miko: But what if the bigger war comes to pass? What then?
Raiden Shogun: If it cannot be avoided, then...
Raiden Shogun: ...I will have no choice but to fight.
Yae Miko: Well, if that day comes...
Yae Miko: I'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.

Kuki Shinobu: #Hey {NICKNAME}. Some of your friends are here, wanna go say hi?

### Additional Talk 2

Gorou: Who could it be...?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe...

### Additional Talk 3

Yoimiya: Sounds like you know a few things about art yourself, Thoma.
Thoma: Art? Me? ...Does knitting sweaters count?
Yoimiya: Absolutely! Knitting is totally an art form!
Thoma: Just... not a very rock 'n' roll one, I guess. I don't think I'll be doing any knitting tonight.
Yoimiya: Not with that attitude! You could, uh... knit sweaters with "Rock 'N' Roll" in big letters! Then get everyone to wear them!
Thoma: Hmm, good idea! I'll look into it next time.

### Additional Talk 4

Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, what if Madam Kujou Sara's the one who got my letter... No, surely she wouldn't intentionally ignore it?
