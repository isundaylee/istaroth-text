# Vimana Agama: First Chapter


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, that must be the "Ararycan" who was mentioned earlier, right? Let's go ask him!

## Talk 2

Jazari: Ah! How did you get up here?
Ararycan: #Nara Traveler, that's the suspicious Nara. He's been sneaking around here with that suspicious machine.
Paimon: Mmm, you're right. Coming to a place like this is pretty suspicious, alright...
Jazari: Um, I'd say you're the suspicious ones here. After all, I am a certified researcher from the Akademiya, and you are outlanders of unknown origin.
Traveler: We've been commissioned to investigate this place.
Jazari: Oh, a commission? So you're adventurers. Or perhaps you're Eremites or something?
Jazari: Well, it doesn't matter. My name is Jazari, a Kshahrewar Researcher, as you can see. I don't care what you came here for, but don't get in the way of my research.
Paimon: What's there to be researched in this deep cave?
Jazari: There are always things to be researched everywhere. As the saying goes, "ignorance is a researcher's disgrace."
Jazari: You must have noticed the huge ruin machine out there, right? That is actually a Ruin Golem made in the ancient realm of Khaenri'ah.
Jazari: In the local lexicon of Khaenri'ah, the name might possibly have been something like "Mechanical Warden."
Jazari: See? We're right behind the Ruin Golem. The machine's operator, should there have been one, would have entered from here.
Paimon: Hmm... But a machine of this size would have required more than one operator, right?
Jazari: Aha, that's among my research topics! Unfortunately, I haven't made much progress so far.
Jazari: Exploring the Ruin Golem from the inside seems to be the only solution, and I am presently looking for a way in.
Traveler: You sound more suspicious by the minute...
Paimon: #That's right, we did meet an Abyss Order member disguised as a researcher that one time! Paimon reckons he was called Enjou... Traveler, do you remember what happened to him again?
Traveler: We beat the snot out of him.
Jazari: Hey, hey! Please don't! I'm a legitimate researcher...
Jazari: Ugh, you don't believe me, do you... See this? This is an Investigation Charter from the Akademiya, with the highest possible level of clearance.
Jazari: That's not something to be given away on the streets. Certainly not one concerning investigations into ancient ruins as important as this. The Akademiya would never issue something like this casually.
Jazari: I can't give you the original copy, but... Wait a second, where did I put my Kamera... I remember placing it inside my bag...
Ararycan: Be careful! He's taking that suspicious machine out again.
Black Screen Text: Jazari sets the device up carefully.
It is indeed a Kamera.
Paimon: Eh? Is this the suspicious machine you mentioned? It's just a Kamera...
Ararycan: A Kamera?
Paimon: That's right. It's a machine that takes pictures. It's pretty convenient!
Jazari: Yes. This is a priceless item as far as the Akademiya is concerned. I can't just let you touch it... Wait. Who were you talking to just now?
Paimon: Um... about that...
Traveler: An imaginary friend...
Jazari: Don't worry, I understand your condition. It's okay, we're friendly people here in Sumeru. You'll have no trouble making real friends. I guarantee it.
Paimon: ...
Jazari: Still, do not get in the way of my research. After all, "nothing under the sun is truly new," and it is our duty as researchers to collect information and investigate it.
Jazari: All the charters are recorded in the Akademiya. If you are still skeptical, just keep an image of this for validation in the House of Daena.
Paimon: #Aaanyway, we've got something to discuss! Traveler, let's talk over there...
Jazari: As you wish.
Traveler: She's been alone since she was little...
Jazari: Oh, so you often talk to yourself? Well, I've heard of similar cases before...
Traveler: #I'm Traveler, and I'm on the trail of a suspicious Nara.
Jazari: Huh...? What are you talking about?
Paimon: Ahem! We've been commissioned to investigate the situation here.

## Talk 3

Jazari: Ah! How did you get up here?
Ararycan: #Nara Traveler, that's the suspicious Nara. He's been sneaking around here with that suspicious machine.
Paimon: Mmm, you're right. Coming to a place like this is pretty suspicious, alright...

Paimon: #Aaanyway, we've got something to discuss! Traveler, let's talk over there...
Jazari: As you wish.

## Talk 4

Jazari: Some fate must have dictated that we would meet here. But that friend of yours... *sigh*
Jazari: She must have led a lonely life. Be nice to her.
Jazari: Anyway, I have to organize my findings. So, if you would excuse me...

## Talk 5

Jazari: Heh, finally believe me, do you?
Paimon: Yep, guess you're not suspicious after all, Jazari.
Traveler: We have some questions about the situation...
Jazari: Hehe, ask away. As a Kshahrewar researcher who specializes in studying ruin machines, I've been investigating this big guy over here for years.
Jazari: No one on this earth knows more about this Ruin Golem than I do.
Paimon: What about beneath the earth, then?
Jazari: Well...
Jazari: Legends hold that the ancient realm of Khaenri'ah lies beneath the earth. Since they built all the ruin machines, it would be arrogant of me to say that I understand these devices better than they do.
Traveler: Tell me about the "bad dirty stuff"...
Jazari: Haha, you're looking for bad and dirty things, are you? Then you should visit the city.
Ararycan: The city? Are bad things in the city?
Paimon: Um...
Traveler: This is just something adults say...
Traveler: Don't think too much about it...
Jazari: Anyway, this locale is somewhat polluted, which might be related to the "bad and dirty stuff" you mentioned.
Paimon: Well, here's the situation. We've heard that the forest here has...
Black Screen Text: You paraphrase Ararycan's words so that Jazari can understand them...
Jazari: Is that so? Let me think about this... I might indeed have some clues.
Jazari: According to my research, all ruin mechanisms work on the same principle no matter what they do, whether it be flying or launching missiles...
Jazari: And well, a Ruin Golem is theoretically the same as a Ruin Guard, except that it was to be operated by people. Have you noticed anything abnormal about this Ruin Golem?
Traveler: It looks incredibly big.
Traveler: Its eye seems to be missing.
Jazari: Um, this isn't an issue of size. Have you not noticed that its core is missing?
Paimon: Yeah, this big guy here's got no peeper.
Jazari: Exactly. According to the documents, ruin machines are powered by their cores. To be precise, by the dark power inside what you call an "eye."
Jazari: When Khaenri'ah was destroyed, many ruin machines like this one burst out from the desert.
Jazari: Although things are different now, even the Akademiya was unable to handle the cores back then.
Jazari: A single mistake could cause a core meltdown, leading to serious accidents. As a result, the Akademiya had no choice but to temporarily seal the cores and deal with them later.
Jazari: If the documents have it right, the core of this Ruin Golem should be sealed inside the ancient ruins known as "Dev's Cavern," which is right beneath our feet.
Traveler: Is there anything wrong with the core?
Traveler: Let's cut this conversation short, shall we?
Jazari: There shouldn't be, but we have detected some energy leakage. The seal seems to have been damaged at some point, though we have no idea when.
Jazari: Heh, the last time someone published a research report regarding such matters was more than ten years ago.
Jazari: Any progress on this matter should warrant a large amount of funding from the Akademiya.
Paimon: Funding? Are you saying that you get Mora from doing research?
Jazari: That's right. Speaking of which, we did talk about pollution a moment ago... For ecological topics, we might be able to file a subject application with Biol{RUBY#[S]Amurta}ogy.
Jazari: That would really be an archon-send for those who study fringe subjects like us.
Jazari: At first, I had planned on taking the route recorded in previous reports to look inside. Unexpectedly, all the entrances were blocked.
Ararycan: Ararycan knows. It's the place outside, where Ararycan sensed bad things.
Jazari: I thought it might have been the Forest Watchers or the Vimara villagers who did it. But given what you described, someone must have sneaked inside and blocked the entrances.
Jazari: Maybe it was the "Marana's Avatar" that you mentioned. Well, I wouldn't dare mess with something like that... Hilichurls are more than enough trouble for me, as you can see, or I wouldn't be stuck here right now.
Jazari: *cough*... Anyway, the abnormality you sensed may have been pollution caused by the energy leakage from this core.
Jazari: But as you can see, someone has blocked the entrance.
Jazari: First things first, though. If you want to travel underground, I do have an idea as to how. Interested?
Ararycan: This Nara, awesome! How do we travel beneath?
Traveler: Guess you're pretty good after all. So, how do we get down there?
Jazari: We just need to find a way to enter this Ruin Golem and smash the blocked entrance open with it.
Paimon: Oh... Paimon just had a sense of déjà vu...
Traveler: That's my kind of plan!
Traveler: Are you serious...?
Jazari: The data acquired from such an action would be priceless. Even if something goes wrong, the benefits still outweigh the risks.
Jazari: Mm? Well, it sounds like a good idea to me. It should be alright, and the data acquired from this would be priceless. Even if something does go wrong, the benefits still outweigh the risks.
Jazari: Also, if we can investigate the core buried underground, I could... submit a funding application on your behalf.
Jazari: What do you think? That's killing two birds with one stone... Well, three birds, actually.
Paimon: #If we can get some funding... Let's help Jazari out, Traveler. Academic research is important too, after all!
Jazari: Of course. But you'd best report to the Akademiya when you have the time, or this might be classified as malign research.
Jazari: Anyway, let's try to get inside first. The operator might still be there. That would make for some great data... I mean, a good research subject...
Traveler: It has been hundreds of years, you know...
Paimon: Never mind that. There might be treasure inside, right?
Jazari: I'm quite sure that some antiques are stored within. Research on those would...
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler? Since Mr. Jazari has put it like that, Paimon reckons we should do some... academic research!
Traveler: Great! So, how do we get in?
Traveler: So how do we get in?
Jazari: Aha! I almost forgot the most important thing. Opening the door to the Ruin Golem's cockpit requires an Amiti Device. To put it simply, a key.
Jazari: The bad news is that I don't have this key... But the good news is that I have discovered its whereabouts from studying the documents on hand.
Jazari: If you must know, I have scoured half the House of Daena for the few records available. The last report on the Amiti Device was published decades ago.
Jazari: And though I have now figured it all out, my findings cannot be published as things stand. Most irritating indeed...
Traveler: So where exactly is this key?
Traveler: Why can't you publish your results?
Jazari: It's because those big shots don't see the academic value in this.
Jazari: But isn't "academic value" just pompous human evaluation, where they reduce knowledge down to mere practical tools?
Jazari: Knowledge itself cannot be determined to be more or less valuable.
Paimon: So, uh... Where exactly is this key? You haven't mentioned it yet...
Jazari: Ah, to put it simply, the key may be found in Port Ormos to the south, in the hands of an antique dealer named Royinjan. Could you please accompany me there?
Paimon: You've been staying here doing research for so long, and you've never thought about visiting him?
Jazari: Um, the thing is, I'm not good at dealing with merchants... They just don't understand me, which makes communication almost impossible.
Jazari: I've been cheated out of a lot of Mora before on account of this.
Traveler: That's true, I do find it hard to follow your thoughts at times, too.
Jazari: ...Wait, so this is actually all my fault? Agh...
Paimon: Well, whatever the case, we're going to Port Ormos, right? Let's go check it out, then.
Paimon: Well, whatever the case, we're going to Port Ormos, right? Let's go check it out, then.

## Talk 6

Ararycan: Paimon needs friends? Ararycan could be your friend.
Traveler: Me too.
Paimon: Um... Thanks, you two, but that's not the problem!
Paimon: The issue is that he can't see you, Ararycan.
Ararycan: Mm-hmm. When Nara grow up, they can't really see Aranara anymore. Young Nara see us because they are innocent. But grown Nara can't.
Ararycan: #Nara Traveler is a dreamer, favored by trees and flowers, so you can still see us, even as a grown-up.
Paimon: Anyway, we should be more careful when talking to Aranara in front of others...
Paimon: Well, Paimon doesn't think Jazari was lying, anyway. You might have misunderstood him, Ararycan.
Ararycan: Ararycan saw that Nara taking out his... Kamera, and doing *ka-chick* to hilinara. Very suspicious.
Ararycan: If that Nara isn't bad... Ah, he runs away every time the hilinara come. So he can't really be friends with the hilinara.
Traveler: That sounds kinda sad.
Ararycan: Mm-hmm, the Nara holds his machine and runs so fast.
Paimon: So he shouldn't be a bad person. Nor should he be related to the children at Vimara Village...
Traveler: I'm not particularly interested in all this, but we'll finish what we started.
Paimon: Yup, Paimon totally agrees!
Paimon: Anyway, since he's doing research around here, he should be pretty familiar with the situation.
Paimon: Maybe he can help you, Ararycan!
Traveler: I'm curious about the giant machine, actually.
Traveler: He must be quite the runner, then.

## Talk 7

Jazari: Heh, finally believe me, do you?
Paimon: Yep, guess you're not suspicious after all, Jazari.

## Talk 8

Royinjan: Welcome. You must be travelers from abroad. What brings you here to my shop? Would you like to make any purchases or seek to appraise any items?
Paimon: So you're Royinjan, the antique dealer, right?
Royinjan: Royinjan, the Chief Antique Appraiser, to be precise. Did you come specifically to visit me? Well, I shan't let you down then.
Traveler: We're looking for a certain antique.
Royinjan: Oh? Then you've come to the right place. If you can name it, Royinjan here can tell you about it.
Royinjan: I've probably seen enough antiques to lay out across the entire marketplace. Even the Akademiya might not have seen quite as many.
Paimon: We're looking for the... Um, what's the thingy's name again? Paimon can't remember.
Jazari: Hi, we're looking for an Amiti Device.
Royinjan: Eh? I've never heard of something like that.
Paimon: Hey! You just said that we could name anything!
Royinjan: Haha, don't worry. I haven't heard of that name, but I might yet know of the thing you want. Antiques tend to have a variety of monikers, you see.
Royinjan: Can you describe the thing that you're looking for?
Jazari: Ugh, how should I put it? The documents didn't include a particularly detailed description...
Jazari: It's an item in the style of those ruin machines, and it should be an identification device of sorts.
Jazari: It should be marked with unique Khaenri'ah-style patterns, that can be recognized to be chronologically different from the common types seen on Ruin Guards, thus marking this as some sort of earlier version of the device...
Jazari: And considering what we know of ruin archaeology...
Royinjan: Ah, alright, you can stop now. I know what you're looking for.
Jazari: Ha, so you know? That's so very helpful, thank you. In that case, please give it to me.
Royinjan: Uh, that's not how this works. This item is very precious. If you really want it, you'll have to pay for it. And that's... 500,000 Mora, at the very least.
Jazari: 500,000 Mora!?
Royinjan: It's an antique, you know. What I'm offering is a pretty common price.
Jazari: Ugh... But what if the Mora we spend here can't guarantee a successful report...
Paimon: #Let's just help him out, shall we, Traveler?
Paimon: We've helped others bargain before, haven't we? You're probably a dab hand by now.
Traveler: Well, not really.
Jazari: Really? That's... a relief. I'm terrible at things like this.
Jazari: That's everything on me. Just take it. I'll have to find a gig with the Eremite over there if that's not sufficient, though.
Traveler: I'm good at dealing with merchants.

## Talk 9

Royinjan: *sigh* Fine, I'll just make do with that amount. But treat the item well, okay? Each antique has many stories and emotions behind it.
Paimon: #Pretty good, Traveler!

## Talk 10

Royinjan: Hmm, this price is a little too low... You know what I mean?

## Talk 11

Royinjan: This price... Did you come all the way here to make fun of me?
Royinjan: Hmm, this price is a little too low... You know what I mean?

## Talk 12

Royinjan: Well, you have a deal! I mean, Mora does come after friendship for us dealers, so I'll do you three a friendly favor today. There, I'll sell you the antique at the price you've named.
Jazari: *sob* My funding...

## Talk 13

Ararycan: Ahh! Nara...
Paimon: #Don't be afraid, we're not bad Nara! Paimon's Paimon, and he's Traveler. You're Ararycan, right?
Traveler: We are friends of Aranara.
Traveler: Araja sent us here.
Paimon: That's right! Araja sent us here, saying that you could help us.
Paimon: That's right! We've got some questions.
Ararycan: Wah... There's been strange Nara around. That's why I was a bit scared.
Paimon: We didn't mean to scare you! It's just that we didn't know you were so absorbed in...
Ararycan: Mmm... Since you can see Ararycan and are friends with Araja, the forest must recognize you. You can't be bad Nara.
Ararycan: Mm-hmm. You are good Nara. Ararycan is not afraid. Did you say that you have questions for Ararycan?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right...
Traveler: We would like to know more about the delicious fungus.
Traveler: We'd like to know about the suspicious Nara around Vimara Village.
Ararycan: About that, Arachatora might know better than me...
Paimon: No, that's not what we were trying to ask! Have you seen any suspicious Nara around Vimara Village, Ararycan?
Black Screen Text: You tell Ararycan what happened in brief.
...Though how much Ararycan understood is a different story.
Ararycan: Arana is good Aranara. Protecting Vana often, and helping little Nara always, are what Arana does.
Ararycan: Ararycan once helped little Nara. Arana said that Marana's Avatar is taking little Nara away. So Ararycan helped.
Ararycan: Recently, the local Vana... Ah, I meant the forest. The forest and stream are always crying. Maybe, it's because of Marana. Marana, bad.
Paimon: Marana refers to the Withering, and Vana... That's gotta mean the forest. Well, that's some new Aranara words learned. Wait, does the forest cry, too?
Traveler: Maybe it's a figure of speech.
Traveler: Maybe it's something only Aranara can hear.
Traveler: It cries very loudly...
Ararycan: #Can Nara Traveler hear it, too? Nara Traveler, friend of forest.
Ararycan: Sunshine brings happiness, but too much sunshine means less water. Water makes us grow, and no water means withering.
Ararycan: Songs bring happiness and power, getting sick makes us upset, and being sick for too long means withering. It's the same for Vana and Aranara.
Ararycan: Ah, but Mint is different. Mint, so strong.
Ararycan: The forest has been crying harder lately, Ararycan is worried.
Paimon: Is it because Marana is harming the forest?
Ararycan: Ararycan is not sure. It smells like Marana, but not really the same. But Ararycan knows that some bad dirty stuff are making the forest sick, in places Ararycan can't see.
Ararycan: If the forest keeps being sick like this, a super giant Marana will come around to suck all the living things away! All the flowers will wither, and all the leaves will fall.
Ararycan: The fruits will go bad, and mushrooms will stop growing.
Paimon: Eh? No more mushrooms!? That means no more Chicken-Mushroom Skewer!
Traveler: We'll help.
Traveler: We're here to look into the suspicious Nara...
Paimon: That's right! We're here to help!
Ararycan: And around the area of "sickness," there is a weird Nara. That might be the bad Nara you want. Good Nara help Ararycan, and Ararycan takes you to him.
Ararycan: Ararycan knows. Around the area of "sickness," there is a weird Nara. That might be the bad Nara you want.
Paimon: #Looks like we can help each other! What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: That's exactly what I'm thinking.
Ararycan: Thank you. But, Marana is scary. Nara will die.
Traveler: We've dealt with that before. It'll be alright.
Traveler: Ooh, I don't wanna die!
Paimon: Come on! We've dealt with that thing before, haven't we? With Rana and...
Ararycan: #Nara Traveler defeated Marana before? You're very strong.
Ararycan: And you are golden Nara, just like the legendary Nara Varuna. You look reliable, so I believe in you!
Paimon: Mmhmm. Just leave it to us! Now, we've got another question...
Traveler: About our reward...
Traveler: Tell me about the super bad, super dirty stuff...
Ararycan: #Re... war? Do you mean enemies, Nara Traveler?
Paimon: Oh, come on, don't say such things to Aranara!
Paimon: Ararycan, do you know anything about the bad dirty stuff?
Ararycan: I have seen many weird Hilinara with filthy stains on them. They've been acting suspiciously around the giant iron mountain.
Traveler: Hilinara...
Paimon: Giant iron mountain? You mean that super big Ruin Guard over there? Speaking of which, didn't we see a similar machine earlier?
Paimon: Paimon thinks it was called a Ruin Golem or something. But this big guy looks a little different...
Traveler: It has no "eye"...
Traveler: It has no core...
Paimon: Yeah, that's true! The other Ruin Golem we've seen have a core that looks like an eye, just like Ruin Guards!
Ararycan: Ararycan knows nothing about any Ruin Golem. As for the giant iron mountain, it has been here, since a long, long time ago.
Paimon: A long, long time... How long is that, exactly?
Ararycan: The time it takes for a tiny little seed to grow into a giant tree that can touch the sky!
Paimon: Huh, that sure is a long, long time. Well, it shouldn't be hurting the forest if it has been here for that long...
Traveler: Bad people might come here because of it, though.
Traveler: Who knows, it might revive itself at some point.
Paimon: Mmm, you have a point. Bad guys like the Fatui, Treasure Hoarders and the Abyss Order! Super bad guys!
Ararycan: Bad Nara, bad!
Paimon: ...Paimon hopes not.
Paimon: Either way, let's investigate it, shall we? Who knows, we might even find some treasure!
Ararycan: Thank you. Ararycan also saw that there are other strange things besides the suspicious Nara.
Paimon: Alright then, let's go! Don't fall behind now, Ararycan!
Paimon: Alright then, let's go! Don't fall behind now, Ararycan!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Well, here's the remaining funding...
Jazari: Now, let me see... Wait, this is by no means the Amiti Device I spoke of.
Jazari: What I'm looking for is a key that can open up the Ruin Golem on Devantaka Mountain.
Jazari: According to my research, it should be in the hands of your grandfather, Mr. Hasad, the Golden Adventurer.
Jazari: Well, at least that was the case several decades ago...
Black Screen Text: Jazari describes the story of Hasad the Golden Adventurer as stated by the documents.
Royinjan: Oh, come on. You should have just said this earlier.
Jazari: You didn't exactly let me...
Royinjan: Haha, but that really brings back memories. It's been so long since I last heard stories about my grandpa.
Royinjan: When I was little, grandpa would often tell me stories of his adventures. I thought then that he was just bragging, but what do you know, he actually was that awesome.
Royinjan: Speaking of which, it is mostly because of him that I became an appraiser of antiques. All the stories about treasures were just so intriguing.
Royinjan: Still, the thing you spoke of is not here with me.
Paimon: Eh? You haven't sold it off, have you?
Royinjan: I wish I did... But treasures don't stay where they don't belong, as they say. I mean, isn't that what happens in all treasure-hunting legends?
Royinjan: Well, Grandpa didn't care about any of that stuff, but according to him, that device engraved with ancient characters was lost during one of his adventures in some underground cave.
Royinjan: That was a long story, one which he told me so many times. But... I can't remember a single word of it now.
Royinjan: Actually, I even planned a treasure hunt for it with some others back then. And as to whether we really found it again... Well, if we did, it should still be hidden in a secret base at Vimara Village.
Traveler: A secret base at Vimara Village?
Traveler: Did you grow up in Vimara Village, too?
Royinjan: Haha, I always went there to play when I was just a kid. You know how kids love their secret bases.
Jazari: Could you please show us to the secret base? Perhaps we could find some clues there.
Royinjan: So this thing is that important to you, huh? Still, I haven't been back for many years...
Traveler: It's an important matter pertaining to scientific research.
Traveler: It's an important matter pertaining to Mora.
Royinjan: Alright. Since you bought something from me, I'll take you there. But do manage your expectations, okay? I really can't remember what happened that long ago.
Jazari: We're counting on you either way...
Paimon: Hooray! To the secret base we go!

## Talk 15

Paimon: Well, here's the remaining funding...
Jazari: Hmm, wait. What is this?
Jazari: Isn't this just a normal Chaos Core!?
Royinjan: Nonsense. That's no ordinary Chaos Core, but the core of a Ruin Guard prototype found in Stormterror's Lair.
Royinjan: See the marks left by the Great Wolf King of the North? This is a unique treasure alright, and no mistake!
Paimon: Eh? Then isn't this the one we saw at Stormterror's Lair? Didn't Dain take it?
Paimon: This one's got to be a fake!
Traveler: Antiques are sold for their stories.
Royinjan: Whoa, that's impressive understanding for someone your age.
Paimon: Wait, but that's not the point!
Royinjan: Well, I don't know about this Dain fellow, but I sure have heard of Stormterror's Lair. Anyway, if you have different insights about antiques, we could discuss them in private...
Jazari: Whatever this is, it's definitely not the Amiti Device.
Jazari: What I'm looking for is a key that can open up the Ruin Golem on Devantaka Mountain.
Jazari: According to my research, it should be in the hands of your grandfather, Mr. Hasad, the Golden Adventurer.
Jazari: Well, at least that was the case several decades ago...
Black Screen Text: Jazari describes the story of Mr. Hasad the Golden Adventurer as recorded in documents.
Royinjan: Oh, come on. You should have just said this earlier.
Jazari: You didn't exactly let me...

Jazari: Could you please show us to the secret base? Perhaps we could find some clues there.
Royinjan: So this thing is that important to you, huh? Still, I haven't been back for over ten years...
Traveler: It's an important matter pertaining to scientific research.
Royinjan: Alright. Since you bought something from me, I'll take you there. But try to manage your expectations, okay? I really can't remember what happened that long ago.
Jazari: We're counting on you either way...
Paimon: Hooray! To the secret base we go!
Traveler: It's an important matter pertaining to Mora.
Traveler: Did you grow up in Vimara Village, too?
Traveler: Maybe he was deceived, too.

## Talk 16

Royinjan: ...
Royinjan: I see how it is. You're not buying anything, are you? I didn't do decades of business here just to be messed with!
Paimon: No, no, that's not what we meant...
Royinjan: 500,000, that's the final deal!
Paimon: Hmm... What are we gonna do, Jazari?
Jazari: *sob* I'll have to accept that for the sake of my research...
