# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I'm fine.
Yoh: That's good, that's good. Every time I look at you, I'm reminded of our Atsuko.
Yoh: She's definitely settled down a lot, and she's far better at doing the household chores as well.
Yoh: She doesn't want to tell us much about it, but I can guess that she's had her fair share of hardships out there.
Yoh: You don't seem that old yourself, Traveler, and yet you're always out abroad...
Yoh: I know that you're no ordinary person... but still, do be careful.
Yoh: Make more friends while you're out there, sure, but be sure to keep your eyes watchful. You'll avoid coming to grief that way.
Yoh: Hah, look at me nagging at you. Just like our girl's mother!
