# Suspicious Mushroom Hodgepodge

An Aranara-style dish that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. But in fact, it only requires a few common mushrooms from Sumeru, along with some extra seasonings. As for its flavor, you'd believe you've tasted the wildness of nature â€” ahem, "the scent of the remaining heaps of dirt" is probably the more accurate description though. Such bounties of the mountains and forests are best left for the boars to savor.
