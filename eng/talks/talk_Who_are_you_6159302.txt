Traveler: Who are you?
Hardworking Silio: Me? Oh, I just help out doing bits and pieces at the Dawn Winery. Nothing particularly worth mentioning.
Hardworking Silio: I just finished a delivery, so I'm taking a short breather.
Hardworking Silio: They treat their staff really well at the winery, so I don't mind putting in a bit of extra effort.
