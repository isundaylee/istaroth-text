Traveler: About the Sabzeruz Festival...
Parisa: Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity â€” the Dendro Archon.
Parisa: After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata passed away, Sabzeruz Festival was moved to the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali. Unfortunately, the festival lost some of its former glory in the process...
Parisa: The Akademiya no longer hosts the festival, and we practically have little chance to see the Dance of Sabzeruz.
Parisa: What a pity...
