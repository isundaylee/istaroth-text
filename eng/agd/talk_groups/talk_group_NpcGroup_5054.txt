Chatelet: A life without change, paired with unchanging coffee...

## Talk

Traveler: That sounds a little boring.
Chatelet: From the perspective of work, such trivial matters won't even make for good conversation — that much is true.
Chatelet: I'm a Gestionnaire at the Palais Mermonia. I guess you could call me an old colleague of Arouet's.
Chatelet: Arouet's opinions could be considered quite extreme in the office, but by cafe standards, they're quite ordinary.
Chatelet: It must be said, though, that there can be no complaints about his coffee-making skills. Quitting his old job to run this place has been one of the best decisions of his life.

## Talk

Traveler: That sounds quite relaxing.
Chatelet: Indeed — the aroma of the coffee available here is wonderful. I can only hope that Arouet will keep making it this way.
Chatelet: But I do have my reservations about his statement that "coffee is the source of life."
Chatelet: You must know, I'm sure, that not everyone loves coffee for its taste, but for its ability to impart wakefulness.
Chatelet: Where I work, there is much that many cannot control in their lives already — at least leave them their opinion on coffee.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Chatelet: See you, and may you stay happy.
