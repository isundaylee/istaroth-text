# As Though Morning Dew


## Talk 1

Nahida: #Welcome back, Traveler, Paimon, Balladeer.
Paimon: Whew! It feels like we just went on a really long journey... Paimon's exhausted.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...
Nahida: You don't like being addressed by that name?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): It's fine. But I was just thinking, I should probably change it.
Traveler: You won't go by "The Balladeer" anymore?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): After learning about everything The Doctor did, there's no way I can carry on using a name connected to him.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): I'm not planning on returning to the Fatui, and they wouldn't take me back anyway. Recent events will have affected a lot of people, and they might not even remember who the sixth is.
Paimon: So you're quitting the Fatui for good?
Traveler: Let's call it a tactical retreat...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): It's like you said, Lesser Lord Kusanali. Everything may look futile, but it wasn't completely meaningless. At least I made a lot of people forget about me.
Nahida: But that doesn't mean your own past has disappeared.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Of course.
Nahida: And your main goal, for which you gave up everything you had... you weren't able to achieve it. I hope you can see and understand that.
Nahida: Changing the world, changing the past, changing the fates of other people... These are not simple things to accomplish.
Nahida: What you were looking for is complete annihilation... But this is just a fantasy. Even if The Balladeer is removed from existence, the world will not heed your will.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...Indeed. Haha, how ridiculous.
Paimon: Do you regret doing all that, when you've gotten so little in return?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Even if I'm completely worthless, there's nothing in the world worth regretting.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Lesser Lord Kusanali, you purposely left that information in Irminsul, didn't you?
Nahida: Yes, and I took pains to make sure that you'd acquire that information naturally.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Why would you go to such lengths? You trying to win me over too?
Nahida: In all honesty, your past experiences have made you a useful asset to Sumeru and to me. Winning you over was indeed a part of my plan.
Nahida: But before that, I wanted to tell you the truth about your past. If all I wanted to do was use you, then I'd be no different from The Doctor.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...Very clever.
Nahida: I guess you could say that's one of my virtues.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Utility to others is what gives me worth. So if embracing my sins is what it takes to make me useful again, so be it.
Traveler: Nahida doesn't see you in that way.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Oh right, I almost forgot... you're the good guys. You're into justice and all that.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Sorry if I have a slightly different perspective on things. But, I don't feel like I've been duped. The wisest leaders are fated to end up with the best helpers... I can live with that.
Nahida: I'm glad that you're able to think of it in that way.
Nahida: #Traveler, in the future, I'll continue to search Irminsul more deeply, and see what secrets can be uncovered.
Nahida: Including the beginning of your twin's journey recorded in Irminsul. What exactly happened before and after that point? I want to know as well.
Traveler: Thank you. Let's hope you can find some answers.
Nahida: I will try.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): #Traveler.
Traveler: Yes?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): After I dove into the information torrents in Irminsul, why did you go to Inazuma?
Traveler: Because I wanted to know what you'd changed.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...So that's how you found out whose fate had changed, and how.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Well, whatever your reasons, you did me a favor, and I'll do everything I can to pay it back.
Traveler: ...I didn't do all of this for a reward.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Borrowing and returning are the only real relationships between individuals. I'll balance the books one day, don't you worry.
Nahida: That's not true. A relationship between two people is not simply a ledger that can be reset to zero.
Nahida: I think, deep down, you realize this. People who show up in your life don't just evaporate like water drops and leave nothing behind. There is no such thing as "balancing the books."
Nahida: Some things in this world can never be brought back, and they can never be changed, which is why there is emotion in the human world.
Nahida: Everything that you feel is real and lasting, and whatever is missing in you will not be made whole.
Nahida: To be human is to live with imperfections. You can choose whether or not you want to be human.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): But humans can't live without a heart, can they? Anyway, I gave up trying to become a human a long time ago.
Nahida: You understand what pain is perfectly well, even without a heart. You're just burying your feelings.
Nahida: The past is set in stone, but you can keep moving on. And the longer your future lasts, the shorter your past will become, until one day it is but a tiny fraction of your life.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): It sounds like you've got a future planned out for me.
Traveler: I hope you can give Nahida a chance.
Paimon: Everything's ended up being pretty darn complicated, Paimon doesn't even know where to start... But the most important thing now is that you need to follow Nahida. Otherwise, all our efforts will have been for nothing!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...Then I guess I'll be helping you from behind the scenes from now on.
Nahida: I'm glad that you've accepted our proposal. Why don't you choose a new name to celebrate?
Paimon: Ooh, ooh, ooh! Paimon wants to pick an ugly nickname for you too!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Why?
Paimon: Because... because Paimon still doesn't like you that much!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): Hmph. Then I hope we don't see much of each other in the future.
Nahida: "A name is life's first gift." You didn't say it out loud, but I know that's what you're thinking.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]} (Wanderer): ...
Nahida: #Traveler and Paimon have helped you a lot. If you can't decide on a new name, maybe you can ask them for ideas.
Traveler: Huh? You want us to decide?
Paimon: Nope, Paimon only does nicknames! If it's a serious name you're after... it's all yours!
Traveler: Please don't make it sound like I'm extorting you.

## Talk 2

Nahida: There, now you have a name of your own.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: What about a nickname? Are you done yet?
Paimon: Uh, uhhh... still thinking... Stop rushing me...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Take your time. I don't need to see you again until you've thought of one.
Traveler: What do you plan to do next?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Everyone who manipulated me and made me suffer will have to pay the price.
Paimon: You mean, the Fatui?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: The Doctor, at least.
Nahida: Now that your stance has changed, I believe your future path will change accordingly, but it won't be immediate... You still need some time to compose yourself.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: One more thing.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: There are still some descendants of the Raiden Gokaden living in Inazuma. Some of them know... Well, they ought to know about the connection between the Raiden Gokaden and myself.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I don't plan to leave Sumeru for the time being. If you see them in Inazuma, please tell them that I was the one responsible for the Raiden Gokaden's downfall.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Even though the events have been erased from the world, they still deserve to know the truth.
Nahida: I see... That is up to you.
Paimon: Huh? But if we do that, then...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: It's fine. Let them stab their blades into my chest if they so desire. ...Maybe that's how it always should have been.
Traveler: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: What's that look for? Don't make that face, I know what I'm doing.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...That day will come.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Alright, we're done here.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Goodbye, wise deity, and you two.
Paimon: He's gone...
Nahida: What he went through today would have been like living an entire lifetime in an instant. He'll need some time to calm down.
Paimon: Yeah, true. But even so, after everything that's happened, he doesn't seem quite as fierce anymore.
Traveler: There were some bumps along the way, but it's all over now.
Paimon: So can we finally go eat? Paimon is starving!
Nahida: Thank you both. I hope you will find somewhere nice to go and relax for a while.
Traveler: Fine.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hehe, no nonsense. I like it.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Alright, let's call it a day.

## Talk 3

Sawada: I've got it! I can end my novel with some words from Mikoshi Nagamasa.
Aqaba: You mean because everyone else in the story is dead?
Sawada: Yeah. I heard that Mikoshi Nagamasa died at a ripe old age. He's the perfect fit to be the narrator of the epilogue.
Sawada: "The dark clouds had dissipated, but they continued to cast their shadow in Mikoshi Nagamasa's mind for decades to come."
Sawada: "Then one night as an old man, he had a dream. On the night when that prized blade, the Daitatara Nagamasa, was forged, the people rejoiced, and there was painting, dancing, and drinking."
Sawada: "...All these expressions of joy melted down in the furnace fire and turned into red clouds that rallied around the final sunrise that Mikoshi Nagamasa saw in his lifetime."
Sawada: "Life is a story too long to be told, a journey that you must walk to behold."
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Hmph.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Whew! It's about time we had a break!
Paimon: As soon as you stop, all the tiredness and hunger comes rushing back...
Traveler: Rest up, Paimon.
Paimon: Wow! Great!
Paimon: ...Huh? Look at that vase...
Traveler: ...What about it?
Paimon: Did someone break it while they were cleaning the room or something? But Paimon doesn't remember there being a cleaner...
Traveler: (That night we stayed here, Paimon bumped into the table after being startled by something to do with The Balladeer and broke the vase.)
Traveler: (But The Balladeer erased his existence. He changed the world... So why is this vase still broken?)
Amane (???): You sound lost and confused.
Traveler: ...Who's that?
Amane (???): I know why you are troubled. Any who knew of this would find their mind overwhelmed.
Paimon: Huh? Is there someone here talking to us?
Amane (???): Unfortunately, the fate of Teyvat cannot easily be changed. Perhaps a god may have a slim chance, but for anyone else... who can say.
Amane (???): When a small animal runs into a tree trunk, though the tree may sway, it is not displaced. The same is true of fate.
Amane (???): Like a vase that falls to the ground. Whether it is broken by a cat or by a bird, the result is still a broken vase, is it not?
Paimon: Wh—Who are you!? How do you know about all this?
Amane (???): History does not change easily, but human hearts can. Believe your own eyes. Only that which you see is true. What is unseen is but an illusion.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: The voice has disappeared...
Paimon: And who the heck was that!? And what were they doing, coming out of nowhere and saying all of that scary stuff...
Traveler: (Believe my eyes? Does she mean... I should trust my memories?)
Paimon: Ugh. Anyway, that vase is still lying there broken on the ground. Should Paimon go get someone to clean it up?
Paimon: ...Feels wrong just leaving it there. Just a moment, Paimon'll be right back!
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (I wonder what else awaits me in the future?)
Traveler: I'll buy some delicious treats as a reward.
