Traveler: You're a... Mondstadter?
Aurelius: Yes. I'm Aurelius, born and raised in Mondstadt. A few years back, I came here on my journey of tracing the footsteps of a lady poet.
Aurelius: I didn't want to come in the beginning, but once I got here, I realized that this place is awesome. No one will force me to be a poet here.
Aurelius: To be honest, even though my parents are both poets, I detest poetry...
Aurelius: Instead of heading back home and letting them use beautiful rhymes to mock my lousy poems, I feel much more free and at ease here.
