# Sounds From Afar


## Talk 1

Katheryne: #Let me just confirm... Yes, all tasks on the checklist are complete. {NICKNAME}, Paimon, we are grateful for your assistance.
Katheryne: Thank goodness you were able to come as soon as we contacted you. Who knows how we would have coped with all these commissions otherwise.
Paimon: Aww, it was nothin'! The last couple of days have been pretty busy, but it was all super easy stuff like delivering and escorting goods.
Paimon: When we heard that you were short on people, we thought we were gonna be in for another long and drawn-out adventure.
Katheryne: Being the seasoned adventurers that you are, it's true that you are suited to work of a much higher caliber than your recent assignments. However, this situation is unavoidable in Mondstadt at this time of year.
Paimon: Huh? Why's that?
Traveler: Probably because it's harvest season?
Katheryne: #{NICKNAME}, that's right. This is the ideal season for harvesting crops and fruits, and for the wine capital of Teyvat, it's also the all-important wine-making season.
Katheryne: Farmers are anxious to sell off their fresh produce, and all the major wine merchants are seeking to purchase top-quality ingredients to make new product.
Paimon: Ahh. Well, no wonder we keep hearing people talking about wine these days.
Fynn: Huh? What do you mean? Seriously?
Bernhard: Yes, I swear, I'm not making this up. The Acting Grand Master wants everyone to gather at headquarters, in the main hall. Hurry! We need to leave right now, or we'll be late!
Fynn: Hey, wait up!
Paimon: Why do those two Knights look so... flustered?
Kaeya: #Well hello there, if it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon. What a rare pleasure.
Paimon: Kaeya, just the person we need! Um, why is everyone running off to the Knights of Favonius headquarters all of a sudden?
Traveler: And is our help required, too?
Kaeya: Haha, don't worry, this isn't one of those occasions where you need to come to everyone's rescue.
Kaeya: All that's happened is that the Knights of Favonius have just received a letter from the Grand Master. Acting Grand Master Jean will be convening a meeting in the main hall shortly to go through it.
Paimon: Phew, well that's a relief. ...Wait, hold on a second. What did you say, again?
Traveler: The Knights of Favonius received...
Paimon: The Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? That's... Isn't that Varka? The leader of that legendary expedition!?
Paimon: So, what did Varka say in the letter? How's the expedition going? When are they getting back?
Kaeya: Oho, so interested in our Grand Master all of a sudden? Never knew you were such a gossip.
Paimon: It's only normal, isn't it? Bet you'd be curious too if there was someone you'd heard loads about but never met! Even Master Jean says he's a living legend... Pretty hard not to get hyped up after hearing that.
Paimon: Besides, the expedition has been going on for aaaages, and we've still never heard a single thing about what they're up to.
Kaeya: Hahaha, the Acting Grand Master is very gracious in her appraisal.
Kaeya: Varka brought quite a bit of trouble to those around him on the road to becoming a legend. I'll have to tell you about it sometime.
Kaeya: Anyway, since this has piqued your interest, why don't you join me at headquarters, and we'll see what the letter says?
Kaeya: We do miss our Honorary Knight, after all. It's been quite a long time since your last visit.
Paimon: Sure, let's go and see what it's all about. Bye, Katheryne, see ya soon.
Katheryne: Alright, take care now.
Traveler: "A letter from the Grand Master"!?

## Talk 2

Kaeya: Hmm, it looks like just about everyone's here.
Lisa: Hey there, cutie, Paimon, I didn't know you two would be coming. So you heard about the letter?
Paimon: Yup, we ran into Kaeya near the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Wow... Paimon's never seen so many people in the main hall at once before.
Paimon: Paimon's getting kinda nervous now...
Kaeya: Haha, don't get too carried away, alright? If I know the Grand Master, the fact that he has the time to be writing letters means it's probably nothing serious. It certainly won't be bad news.
Lisa: Kaeya's exaggerating a little, but otherwise I agree.
Lisa: After all, Mika's not the kind of person who'd be able to keep it hidden if something were the matter. The truth would be written all over his face.
Traveler: Mika? Who's that?
Lisa: Over there, look. The kid standing next to Jean in front of the staircase.
Lisa: He used to be a land surveyor in Eula's team. He's very talented in what he does and a very reliable person. When the expedition team set out, the Grand Master appointed him to be the core member of the front-line team.
Lisa: He's the one that brought back the letter.
Jean: Please may I have your attention, everyone. Now that we're all here, let's begin reading out the letter from the Grand Master.
Jean: Mika, please go ahead.
Mika: Y—Yes, Master Jean!
Mika: Right... *clears throat* Hello, everybody, I am Mika, surveyor of the Reconnaissance Company. Uh, recently, I have been taking part in an assignment with the expedition team. I will now be reading Grand Master Varka's letter aloud for you all.
Mika: Ahem. "To the Knights of Favonius: Greetings, everyone. This is Varka."
Mika: "The first thing I want to say to you all is: Please put your minds at ease, the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
Bernhard: That's fantastic news!
Fynn: Phew, my palms are sweating...
Jean: ...
Mika: Umm... May I continue?
Jean: Go ahead, Mika.
Mika: "Alright, now that your fears are allayed, I trust you'll be ready to listen to the rest of my letter. I'm writing to you from the northernmost reaches of Teyvat by the light of a stove. The expedition forces are stationed here while we restock."
Mika: "I once told you that the purpose of this expedition was related to a dangerous secret from days long past. I am still unable to disclose more than this, but suffice to say that you needn't worry about how our mission is progressing."
Mika: "In the past couple of months, we received an unexpected visitor: the Fatui Harbinger known as 'The Captain.'"
Paimon: Huh? "The Captain"?
Traveler: ...
Mika: "I am fully aware of the Fatui's outrageous actions in Mondstadt in recent history. Nevertheless, The Captain was not hostile towards us on this occasion."
Mika: "Open parenthesis: I rather suspect that's because this time, Snezhnaya and we are in the same boat. Close parenthesis."
Mika: "The man hides everything under the mask he wears, so no one can know his past or his origins. However, one thing is for sure: He is as hard as iron for having the courage to challenge gods as an ordinary mortal."
Mika: "I don't doubt that he could even take out a Ruin Guard by stabbing it in its big, glowing eye with one of Klee's crayons. Open parenthesis: Don't get any ideas. Close parenthesis."
Mika: "Our scouts have confirmed that The Captain received orders to head for Natlan three days ago. We'll be able to sleep much better now that we don't need to worry about him anymore."
Mika: "I will admit that some of his actions have helped us. But even then, he owed us at least that much."
Mika: "This year's Weinlesefest must be kicking off in Mondstadt any day now? What a great pity that this year, once again, we will be unable to spend the festival together."
Mika: "Everyone here is always thinking back fondly upon the fine wines of Mondstadt, as well as all the happy times we have spent with each and every one of you."
Mika: "I hope that you and all the citizens of Mondstadt enjoy the festival to the fullest. Have a few drinks on our behalf — the Dawn Winery's limited-edition Weinlesefest seasonal special will do nicely."
Mika: "May Lord Barbatos bless Mondstadt, and may the wind carry our sentiments back to your side. Varka."
Mika: "P.S.: If you're wondering who's tougher between me and The Captain, well, I'm the Grand Master! There are ten captains in the Knights of Favonius but only one Grand Master, ahahahaha." His laugh, not mine.
Mika: The letter ends here. Thank you, everyone, for your attention.
Jean: Thank you, Mika.
Mika: Master Jean, um... I just noticed that there's something else written on the back of the last page...
Mika: "P.P.S.: I ran out of paper, so I'll add this here. Lisa, the following is a message for you." ...Oh, this part seems to be from the Grand Master to Miss Lisa.
Lisa: Oh? For me?
Jean: Ah, seeing that it's a special message... Lisa, we'll discuss this in private.
Jean: Everyone, as the Grand Master mentioned in his letter, the Weinlesefest is in just a few days. And how fortunate we are at this time to receive word that all is well with the expedition.
Jean: Though they are unable to return to Mondstadt and spend the festival with us, the Weinlesefest will nonetheless be a major event that all of Mondstadt is looking forward to.
Jean: I hope that everyone will guard your stations and perform your duties, both for our far-flung colleagues involved in the expedition, and also for the hardworking people of Mondstadt.
Jean: And of course, during your time off, I hope you will be able to rest, relax, and enjoy this long-awaited festival.
Jean: That brings our meeting to a close. Dismissed.
Paimon: Did Paimon hear that right? They ran into the Fatui's "Captain"...? Hmm... who knows what that was about, but it must have been important...
Paimon: But ehh, Fatui Schmatooey, the real big deal here is the Weinlesefest — sounds like there'll be loads of free food and drink! Paimon wants to hear more!
Traveler: Typical Paimon...
Lisa: Hey, cuties. How about we go and chat with Jean? You didn't get a chance to say a proper hello with so many people here.
Paimon: Sounds good! Alright, let's go.
Traveler: Vintage Paimon.

## Talk 3

Jean: Ah, Lisa. The Grand Master's letter is just on the table.
Jean: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, it's been a long time. Apologies, I didn't get the chance to talk with you during the meeting just now.
Jean: If you don't have any plans in the immediate future, why not stay in Mondstadt for a while? We'll be celebrating the Weinlesefest very soon.
Lisa: Don't be deceived — Jean may appear very composed, but she's been missing you both terribly recently.
Jean: *sigh* Lisa...
Lisa: Hehe... I'll leave you to catch up. I'm going to read my letter.
Traveler: I've missed Mondstadt, too.
Paimon: Yeah! Mondstadt's where our journey began, after all. We have a lot of fond memories here.
Paimon: Um, Master Jean — neither of us really knows anything about this Weinlesefest... Could you tell us more about it?
Jean: Yes, of course.
Jean: The Weinlesefest is an ancient Mondstadt festival, just like Ludi Harpastum and Windblume. In addition, it's the most important part of the fall.
Jean: Each fall, the west wind blows in Mondstadt. Legend has it that the wonderful scent of Mondstadt's wine-making during the harvest season entices even the Anemo Archon into attendance, being the great wine-lover that he is.
Jean: No matter where he is, he will transform into a soft breeze and return to his homeland.
Paimon: Ugh... Yeah, that sounds like the Anemo Archon, alright...
Jean: For this reason, Mondstadters call the western wind the "returning wind." The Weinlesefest originally began as a celebration to welcome Lord Barbatos on his return.
Jean: In the past, every household would brew fresh wine around this time of year, and keep it sealed at least until Windcoming Day during the following year's Weinlesefest.
Jean: Uncasking the sealed wine is a symbolic way of inviting the Anemo Archon to share a drink. Legend holds that if the Anemo Archon is satisfied with the taste of the wine, he will summon a gentle breeze to richly bless the people.
Traveler: "Richly bless"? How?
Paimon: Knowing him, it was probably blessing them with more good wine the next year.
Jean: That's a good question... But there's really no way of knowing.
Jean: These are very old stories. Many of the details have been lost to time.
Paimon: Yup, that'll happen! Some stories change completely as they get passed down... Hence why these days, Mondstadters will get into endless arguments over what kind of flower a Windblume is...
Lisa: All part of how cultural heritage is created.
Jean: Indeed. But for the time being, at least, the tradition of paying tribute to the Anemo Archon on Windcoming Day is still alive and well, and the Weinlesefest remains a time for Mondstadters to share the joy of the harvest with one another as they partake of fine wines.
Jean: This is a time of the year when many Mondstadters living away from Mondstadt return to their hometown. For those unable to return, Weinlesefest is the period when they miss their family and friends most keenly.
Paimon: Oh! So that's why the Grand Master wrote: "May the wind carry our sentiments back to your side."
Jean: For this year, we've joined forces with the Church of Favonius and the Adventurers' Guild to host a celebration on the banks of Cider Lake, just outside of Springvale. There will also be a traditional Wine Market during the festival period.
Paimon: "Wine Market"?
Jean: Well, originally it was simply a place where winemakers and farmers would come to trade in raw ingredients for wine-making.
Jean: These days, it is a much grander affair. Not only will you find a range of choice wines, but seasonal fruit beverages and food items for everyone to enjoy, too. A lot of people also sell second-hand goods and handicrafts at the market.
Jean: The Knights of Favonius plan to use this as an opportunity to do some fundraising for needy children and elderly people in the city.
Paimon: Wow. Sounds pretty cool.
Jean: If you have the time, I encourage you to take a look around. I hope you'll find it a worthwhile experience. Now, Lisa — what was the Grand Master's message to you about?
Lisa: I was just about to bring that up. The Grand Master says he wants me to handle something for him — something to do with Razor's past.
Traveler: Razor's past?
Paimon: Razor told us that he was raised by a pack of wolves in Wolvendom.
Paimon: He never knew his parents. In his own words, the wolf pack is his "lupical," which means family.
Lisa: Yes, that was as much as I knew as well.
Lisa: But in his letter, the Grand Master says that in the cabinet above the third bookshelf to the right of the grandfather clock in Jean's office, there's a wooden box containing some items that Razor's parents left for him. He says... "It's time to give the box to Razor."
Paimon: Does this mean the Grand Master knew Razor's parents?
Lisa: It would seem so. The Grand Master didn't simply run into Razor one day in Wolvendom and teach him how to use a sword. No, the connection between them goes back much further.
Paimon: Wow! Well c'mon, let's go find Razor! He'll be pretty excited to find out something about his true parents!
Lisa: Hmm...
Traveler: Paimon, wait.
Lisa: Oh, cutie. Nothing escapes your eyes, does it?
Lisa: For the child who never met their biological parents, this kind of conversation is always a difficult one. Even for the most well-adjusted.
Lisa: By contrast, Razor grew up in Wolvendom and has had very limited contact with human society... Who knows whether he's ready for this or not.
Jean: I'm sure the Grand Master will have given due consideration to Razor's circumstances. Perhaps he felt that now would be the most appropriate time.
Lisa: Hmm, that's a good point. Okay, cuties, can I leave you to break the news to Razor?
Lisa: He thinks of me as his teacher, so he might not open up to me if he gets upset. But you are his trusted friends. I think it makes more sense for him to hear about this from you.
Traveler: Don't worry, leave this to us.
Lisa: Thank you, sweetie.
Lisa: Try to be as encouraging as you can. Someone his age needs all the love and support they can get.
Traveler: We'll talk it out with Razor.
Traveler: Lisa. Something's worrying you.
Traveler: I've missed everyone as well.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey, look, it's a hunting trap. It looks like the ones that the hunters from Springvale use...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Hmm? What is it?
Traveler: There are traces of Electro energy near the trap.
Paimon: Electro energy? Hmm, Paimon wonders if it could be Razor. But, Paimon thought he was pretty good at avoiding the hunters...
Paimon: Well anyway, let's follow the traces of Electro and see where they lead.

## Talk 5

Draff: Alright! The last trap has been set. Razor, thanks for coming with me all this way.
Razor: It's okay. My legs are strong. ...Hmm?
Draff: What is it, Razor?
Razor: *sniff* It smells... familiar. Friend, from far away.
Paimon: Razor!
Paimon: Oh, and it's Draff, too! Are you two hunting together?
Draff: Yes, it's almost harvest season, and the boars are venturing into the towns and wineries looking for food.
Draff: They're trampling crops and destroying the vineyards. Someone could get seriously hurt.
Draff: The Knights of Favonius came to us asking for help keeping the boars a safe distance away from the population.
Razor: I and Uncle Brown Cat, catch boars, protect everyone.
Paimon: Wow, Razor, this is a big step for you! Paimon remembers you used to hide away from the hunters.
Draff: Hehe, you can say that again! Razor was the star of the show this time. He let the wolves know we'd be coming, so we were able to get through Wolvendom without anyone getting hurt.
Razor: Helping everyone, helping lupical, makes me happy. But... much talking. Very tired now.
Traveler: Still, it's a sign of progress.
Paimon: Yeah! But, um... Actually, we came here today because we have some really important news...
Black Screen Text: You tell Razor about Varka's letter...
Razor: Oh...
Razor: I... don't know.
Paimon: Razor... Do you mean, you don't want to know about your real parents?
Razor: I want to know, but... don't want to know.
Paimon: Uhh... So you do wanna know, but at the same time, you don't wanna know? Sounds complicated...
Draff: Traveler, come and take a look at the trap I just placed. Let's give Razor some space to process things.
Traveler: What is it?
Draff: Yes, I have some thoughts about all this after seeing how Razor reacted.
Draff: We've been hunting together a lot recently. The kid might not talk much, but still, I feel like I've come to understand him a little over the time we've spent together.
Draff: Here's what I think... He definitely wants to find out about his parents. It's just that his fear of the unknown is overwhelming everything else he's feeling.
Draff: I'm a father myself, so I know a thing or two about kids.
Draff: You know, when Diona was little, if I got back late from a hunt one night, she'd be watching me like a hawk for days afterwards, as if she was worried that I might abandon her.
Paimon: Do you mean Razor's worried that he was abandoned by his own parents...?
Draff: Exactly. I think that's the heart of it. And if it turns out they did, well, I don't think there's anything we could say to console him. That's not my only concern, though...
Draff: Razor is developing at his own pace. There are lots of issues that can't be solved all in one go, but he's making progress, one step at a time.
Draff: But now this thing with his parents is added into the mix... It might push him to want to figure out once and for all where he comes from and where he's going.
Paimon: Seems like a similar take to Lisa's. Maybe all mature adults think like this, huh?
Paimon: Wait, but then again... Master Jean had a different view. She said it's more about trusting other people and in your own instincts!
Paimon: #Uhh... {NICKNAME}, what do you think?
Traveler: He'll have to face this sooner or later...
Draff: Gotcha. Well, knowing that he's got a friend like you to rely on makes me feel much better about this whole thing.
Traveler: Paimon, how about this:
Black Screen Text: You tell Paimon about how you plan to approach the situation...
Paimon: Okay, got it! Right, let's head back. We don't wanna keep him waiting.
Paimon: Hey, Razor... So, what are your thoughts?
Razor: Still thinking... My heart, it feels strange... like being stabbed by Wolfhook.
Traveler: What do you think of Varka?
Razor: Varka? Hmm... Tall, very strong, likes to laugh.
Traveler: Then... do you trust Varka?
Razor: Yes. Trust.
Razor: ...He's very good to me. Give me a name, teach me to fight. But now... busy with important work... I miss him.
Paimon: You know, Razor, Varka used up all the paper writing this letter, but he still made sure he found room on the back to add a note for Lisa. He specifically told her to give you the things that your parents left for you...
Paimon: That means that he thinks the items have a special meaning for you.
Paimon: #But more importantly than that... Whatever happens, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, Lisa, and all your other friends will always be here for you.
Traveler: Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Draff: That's right! And old Uncle Brown Cat's here to support you as well.
Razor: ...Okay. Thank you. I decide... I want to go with you, to see teacher.
Draff: Haha, that's the spirit, kiddo!
Draff: Well, you folks had better be heading off, then. I'm just about finished here, so I'll be heading home very shortly myself. I'd better try and get plenty of father-daughter time in before the Weinlesefest starts, hahaha...
Paimon: Bye, Draff, see you again next time.
Traveler: I will be there for him as a friend through this...
Traveler: Seems like you have something to say.
Traveler: I'm happy for you.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Lisa, we've brought Razor.
Razor: Hello, Teacher. I'm here, to see the box.
Lisa: Ah, my little wolf cub's in a good mood. I'm assuming they've discussed the whole story with you already?
Lisa: Here, this is it, the wooden box. I haven't touched it, except for taking it out of the cabinet. When you're sure you're ready, you can open it yourself.
Razor: Yes, I am sure.
Razor: *click*
Paimon: Oh... This is just a pile of junk. Paimon thought there'd at least be a letter, or something.
Paimon: Uh oh, you don't think that... after all this time, Varka might be getting mixed up between different boxes?
Razor: *sniff* There is a scent.
Paimon: A scent? What kind?
Razor: A scent I remember from a long, long time ago. It's... their scent.
Razor: Human scent... Father and mother's scent.
Traveler: ...
Lisa: Incredible... You still remember scents from all the way back in your childhood.
Paimon: Wow, you really have a good sense of smell, Razor. Guess being wild by nature has its advantages... Let's see what other leads we can find!
Paimon: Hmm, this woolen hand puppet looks kinda wonky. Guess it must be handmade, huh... Is this a part from a Ruin Guard?
Paimon: Wait... Hey, look, this wine bottle is still half full!
Paimon: And there's a note stuck on it: "Thousand," uh... "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Lisa: Oh? So it's a bottle of Thousand-Wind Wine?
Razor: Teacher, you know?
Lisa: Of course. Thousand-Wind Wine was the first kind of wine that Mondstadters ever learned to make, or so they say.
Lisa: As to how it got its name, some say it's a reference to the numerous ingredients used to make it, while others say it's because every bottle tastes slightly different.
Lisa: I remember reading somewhere that there are all sorts of weird and wonderful ways of brewing it, and that it's very difficult to ensure it comes out tasting the same each time.
Lisa: This all makes it impractical to commercialize. Wine merchants are much more comfortable working with reliable, consistent-tasting products.
Lisa: That's why you'll almost never see Thousand-Wind Wine in the markets or taverns.
Lisa: In fact, it looks like your parents brewed this bottle themselves.
Paimon: That must mean there's something pretty important about it... Ooh, Paimon has an idea! Razor, you've got a good nose. Why don't you open it up and take a whiff? Maybe it'll tell you something!
Razor: Okay.
Razor: ...
Paimon: Huh, he seems really in the zone... and is that a smile?
Lisa: Find anything?
Razor: Sweet, cold, a little bitter... I like. Many things, all mixed together.
Razor: But, things in wine, smell different...
Paimon: Even you can't tell what it is, Razor?
Razor: I will try again.
Razor: ...
Razor: Hmm...
Lisa: It's okay, Razor, don't push yourself too hard. What do we do when we try something and it doesn't work?
Razor: Try... another way.
Lisa: That's right. You still remember what I taught you.
Lisa: It's almost the Weinlesefest. Everyone who knows anything worth knowing about wine will be gathering in Mondstadt. Surely someone will know a thing or two about Thousand-Wind Wine.
Paimon: Ohh, great idea!
Traveler: (Will Venti be coming...?)
Lisa: Make sure you don't miss the opening ceremony, cutie. Everyone will be there. Razor, you should go too — it'll be a good opportunity to ask around.
Razor: Okay. Ask many people... I will try.
Paimon: Don't worry, we'll be right there with you. We can be your go-betweens. You know, like you were with the wolves, for Draff!
Traveler: Interesting comparison...
Razor: Okay. Then, I will go back now. I need to tell lupical about human mother and human father.
Paimon: Great! See you at the opening ceremony!
Traveler: We'll be there with you. Just like we promised.

## Talk 7

Jean: Thank you, everyone, for your patience. I am pleased to announce that this year's Weinlesefest has officially begun.
Jean: We hope the residents of Mondstadt and visitors from all over will enjoy the magnificent wines and experience the joy of the harvest.
Jean: When Windcoming Day arrives, we will hold a grand toasting ceremony to welcome the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, back home.
Jean: Let the Wind lead!
Bernhard: Let the Wind lead!
Paimon: Razor! You're here already.
Razor: Mmm... So many... people...
Paimon: Come on, let's sneak outta here. There's someone we gotta find!
Razor: Find? Who?
Paimon: Just some tone-deaf bard. But he's also a know-it-all and loves nothing more than drinking, so he might actually be able to help.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Traveler: It's been a while.
Venti: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, how do you do? Haha, I had a feeling I'd run into you soon, during this most enchanting of festivals.
Paimon: Spoken like a true poet... Hmm, but reading between the lines here — if one bottle is tipsy, and two is merry, just how many is "enchanting," exactly?
Venti: Hahaha, oh, don't say that. This festival has so much more to offer than just drinking.
Venti: Anyway, hey, Razor! How have you been?
Razor: Alright. I have... a question.
Paimon: Yeah, Razor has something he wants to ask you about. Know anything about Thousand-Wind Wine?
Venti: Ooh, now there's a name that takes me back. Let me think... how long has it been since I last heard someone mention Thousand-Wind Wine?
Paimon: Razor's parents left him a box with a half-bottle of wine inside, and there's a label on it that says "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Paimon: We heard there's a lotta history behind this type of wine, and the brewing methods go way, way back, so we figured you'd be a good person to ask.
Razor: It smells good, but... don't know, what's inside.
Venti: I see, I see, so you want to know how Thousand-Wind Wine is made? Well, you came to the right person. I happen to know a little rhyme called... well, as it happens, "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Venti: I was going to save it for Windcoming Day, but far be it from me to deny an early serenade to a friend in need. How about it? Shall I recite it for you?
Razor: A song... Not easy to understand, but still want to hear.
Venti: Excellent answer. Then, ahem, hear it you shall:
Venti: "Fill up the barrels and store them away,
Then wait, wait for a windier day.
Wax the bottles, seal them tight,
For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Venti: "How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?
As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.
And what are the fruits that went into the brew?
An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Venti: "A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,
Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,
Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,
As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Venti: Hehehe, thank you so much for the applause. Was the rhyme of help to you?
Razor: Like wine. A little sweet, but now, head spinning. Don't understand.
Paimon: Don't worry, it's not just you! That was supposed to be about wine-making, but it didn't give a single detail about the process!
Venti: Haha, well, maybe it's a little abstract and romanticized, but that's one of the defining features of Mondstadt poetry.
Paimon: Okay, so let's try to pin this down. What did the poem say the ingredients are? Hmmm... Ummm...
Paimon: An explorer's courage, a love tender and true, a defender's will, and... the thousand winds'... "song of good cheer"...
Paimon: Nope, Paimon has absolutely no idea what any of these refer to!
Paimon: Look, Tone-Deaf Bard, you clearly know what the whole thing means, so could you do us a favor and at least give us a hint?
Venti: You misunderstand me. I'm not trying to make you work for it or anything, but the lyrics are what they are. If there's anything they left out, even I can't fill in the blanks.
Venti: If you want to know the secret behind this sweet scent, you might have to start by rolling up your sleeves...
Paimon: Rolling up our sleeves...? You mean, we need to go and make this wine for ourselves, and somehow that'll teach us everything we wanna know? ...This better not be a prank!
Venti: We've known each other for so long, and you still don't trust my intentions? Oh, the pain...
Razor: ...I trust. I... want to try.
Razor: I want to... make wine, and find answers.
Razor: If I know how to make wine, then I know what is in father and mother's wine.
Traveler: By reliving their actions, maybe we will understand...
Razor: Right.
Razor: I want to... know about them.
Paimon: Well, if you say so, Razor. Guess we'll have to take Tone-Deaf Bard's word on this one. We'll give it a try, and as first-time wine-makers, there's no shame if it turns out bad!
Venti: Don't worry, really. Freedom is the key here. It's not as hard as you might think.
Venti: As long as you add ingredients to the mix in a spirit of joy and sincerity, I promise you will reap the rewards you wish for.
Razor: ...
Razor: I will tell poem to teacher.
Razor: Then... I need to think alone.
Paimon: That's the spirit. So, how about we meet again in two days? Let's say same place, right here?
Razor: Okay. I will remember. See you, then.
Traveler: ...what kind of people they were.
Traveler: So nice to see you again.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lisa: As his teacher, I have a duty to give him the best education and guidance that I can. I'll make sure I'm prepared by the time you get back.
Lisa: Go on now, cuties. I'll leave Razor in your hands.

### Additional Talk 2

Jean: #{NICKNAME}, is there something else you would like to discuss?
Traveler: About the expedition...
Jean: It was good of Mika to bring the letter back all this way. Knowing that everyone is safe and sound is the best encouragement I could ask for.
Jean: Still... I hadn't counted on The Captain making an appearance.
Jean: The Grand Master has a rather... unconventional way of describing things, but even then... I've never heard him give such high recognition to anyone before.
Jean: #{NICKNAME}, if you ever encounter The Captain on your own journey, be on your guard. He is not someone to be underestimated.
Traveler: About Mika...
Jean: Mika tells me that rather than rejoining the expedition party, Grand Master told him to return to his post in Eula's Reconnaissance Company after delivering the letter.
Jean: Land surveyors are usually situated in the vanguard of an army on the move, and are tasked with exploring previously uncharted territory. It looks like the expedition must have entered into a much less intense phase...
Jean: Have you had the chance to speak with Mika yet? When he's with people he hasn't met before, he tenses up and stands bolt upright...
Jean: I really wish he had a little more self-confidence.
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Jean: There is still some preparation to do, but don't worry. Everything's on track.
Jean: Actually, while we're on the topic, I have an assignment I'd like to give you, namely:
Jean: Enjoy the festival to the fullest. Any objections?
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: Goodbye. I wish you a very pleasant Weinlesefest.

### Additional Talk 3

Mika: Ah! Uh, h—hi there, umm... You must be looking for Captain Kaeya...? Please, don't mind me!
Traveler: Actually, I was looking for you.
Mika: Huh? Wait, but... wha—!? Oh geez, Captain Kaeya... Wh—What should I say?
Kaeya: Haha, oh, Mika... How have you not changed one bit after being out on the front line this long?
Kaeya: You were just asking me about the Stormterror incident, weren't you? Well, allow me to introduce you to the legendary Honorary Knight.
Paimon: That's right! And also the legendary Paimon!
Mika: H—Hi there, you guys are so strong, I'm... I'm in awe. Um... I have to go and report in with Captain Eula now, please excuse me!
Black Screen Text: Mika leaves the Knights of Favonius in a hurry...
Paimon: Aw, he just left... Well, that's too bad. Paimon was gonna ask him all about the expedition.
Kaeya: That is a pity, it really is. But don't take it the wrong way. The way he sees it, every pair of eyes in Mondstadt is focused squarely on you.
Kaeya: Give it some time and this'll all sort itself out. Next time you see him, I'm sure you'll get along just fine.
Kaeya: In fact, let me share a little secret with you: Try talking to him about exploring the wild. You'll win his trust in no time.
Traveler: I just wanted to say hi.

### Additional Talk 4

Kaeya: Well, what do you think? Glad you tagged along this time?
Kaeya: A little birdie told me that you'll be staying in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest? Hope you enjoy yourselves.

### Additional Talk 5

Bernhard: Can you believe the expedition party ran into The Captain of the Fatui? Whew... what a relief that nothing came of it.
Fynn: What's there to be afraid of? The Grand Master is there. One Grand Master should be able to take on at least, like... 10 Captains.
Fynn: Wait, forget that — you shouldn't be worrying about the expedition when you've got the Knights of Favonius charity fundraising booth that you're supposed to be organizing. So? How's it coming along?
Bernhard: *sigh* Actually... I still haven't really decided what to sell...

### Additional Talk 6

Allan: Oh, hi, Traveler. Back in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest, huh? Well, watch out for boars if you're out exploring the open country.
Paimon: Hey, it's Allan, Draff's apprentice! Um, have you seen Razor? You know — the young guy who lives in Wolvendom?
Allan: Razor? Wait, who's that again... Oh! You mean the guy who goes hunting with Draff? I haven't actually seen him today.
Paimon: Okay... Well, there aren't any traces of Electro around here anyway. Let's try somewhere else.

### Additional Talk 7

Lisa: As Razor's teacher, I'm so happy to see him taking this first step.
Lisa: And you must be tired from running around trying to find Razor. Why don't you rest here a while? I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

### Additional Talk 8

Venti: Ah, good. I was hoping we might get to chat some more.
Traveler: Can I hear the poem again?
Venti: You need a refresher? Okay, I'll perform the first half again.
Venti: "Fill up the barrels and store them away,
Then wait, wait for a windier day.
Wax the bottles, seal them tight,
For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Venti: "How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?
As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.
And what are the fruits that went into the brew?
An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Venti: "A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,
Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,
Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,
As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Traveler: What are your thoughts on the Weinlesefest?
Venti: I am fond of each and every one of Mondstadt's festivals, but if I'm honest, Weinlesefest has an extra-special place in my heart.
Venti: You know, the Anemo Archon goes into a slumber after the west wind dies down, leaving the north wind to blow during the winter.
Venti: Which means, this festival is the big feast before the winter slumber!
Traveler: About Razor...
Venti: I wouldn't worry yourself too much about him.
Venti: Staying true to their journey and discovering joy and freedom for themselves is what Mondstadters do best.
Venti: The same goes for you. You have to find the thing that makes you happy. Haha, mostly because your happiness is very important to me.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Venti: See you around. Remember, there's no rush. Take your time, and you'll find all the answers that you're looking for.
