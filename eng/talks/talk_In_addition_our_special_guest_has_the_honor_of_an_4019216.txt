Yae Miko: In addition, our special guest has the honor of announcing a "special award." Shogun, if you could...
Ei: ...This "special award" recognizes the team with the "most immersive game"...
Ei: And that goes to the creators of the horror game, "The Doppelganger Incident" — Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke.
Kinkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Ginkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Asari: Oh, so it was a horror game all along! I really thought I'd seen a ghost!
Komura: Wow, that takes "immersive" to a whole new level... Bake-danuki are something else!
Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, smart idea... Now, people have no reason to fear the youkai.
Kujou Sara: I don't think the Shogun and Lady Guuji want the youkai to fear humans, either.
Ei: I present you this award in the name of the Narukami Ogosho, and I promise you this — no human shall infringe on your peace without cause.
Ginkaku: Shogun... is the best!
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku & Tetsunosuke): Shogun is the best!
Kinkaku (Kinkaku & Tetsunosuke): Shogun is the best!
Traveler: What about the Shogunate's development plan...?
Yae Miko: Heh, the whole purpose of the investigation was to avoid disturbing youkai territory.
Yae Miko: Besides, the world is a big place. Humans, youkai... There's more than enough room for all of us.
