Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Rosaria: Heading out? I think I'll stick around for a while. Pretty sure there's nothing but errands waiting for me back at the Cathedral...

Rosaria: I'll let you off the hook this time, but if you lose again, you owe me a glass of Dandelion Wine.

Rosaria: Only took my eye off the prize for a second, and now it's game over... Hmph, impressive. Guess that means I owe you a drink. What'll it be?

Rosaria: Oh, you want to play cards? Fine by me. We're not in the Cathedral, and I'm off the clock, anyway.

Rosaria: How did I get so good? Just a little hobby of mine. Being a Sister can be pretty dull, so I've got to keep myself busy somehow.

Rosaria: Mm, not bad at all. Didn't realize you were so good at this... We should play together more often.

## Talk

Rosaria: Fancy another match? Who lost last time again? Usually, the loser has to shuffle... Eh, I'll just go ahead. C'mon, take a seat.
