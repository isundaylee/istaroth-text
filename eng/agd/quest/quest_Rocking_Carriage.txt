# Rocking Carriage

Masud: Why, my greetings to you, dear traveler from afar, and to your little friend. Have you been enjoying the Sabzeruz Festival?
Masud: If you're both interested, I, the Phantom Toy Master, shall be pleased to invite you to play a new game — the "Rocking Carriage," a flower that blooms only during the Festival.
Paimon: And what's that?
Paimon: Just hearing the name, Paimon's kinda imagining Nahida happily swaying from side to side in her carriage!
Traveler: Even I'm getting all gladsome over here!
Masud: Wonderful! All in Sumeru wish that the "Dendro Archon shall be happy every day," after all.
Masud: That association you made... Ah, what an excellent scene! One that deserves to be rendered upon a magnificent scroll, if I do say so myself!
Masud: Still, the atmosphere of this game is a livelier thing. Rather than a celebration, it's best thought of as an adventure—
Masud: "Smart or not, nice or naughty, every child with a good heart will receive their own Flower Carriage during the Sabzeruz Festival celebrations..."
Masud: "Riding in their carriage, the children shall embark on unique adventures, encountering and overcoming danger, and finding the greatest treasure, a thousand blooming flowers..."
Traveler: Paimon's both smart and nice.
Paimon: Hehe, that's right! And as for that treasure, it may as well be ours already!
Masud: Haha, good, good. In that case, play on, play to your hearts' content!
Traveler: Trust me, we're danger-overcoming pros.
Traveler: Just hearing you say that makes me wanna watch Nahida do that too...
