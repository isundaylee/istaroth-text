Traveler: About your sister...
Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure. I really don't want her to find out about the ugly side of this world.
Takahashi: Didn't someone once say that there is no winner in a war? As long as there is conflict, people will get hurt.
Takahashi: Therefore, I have to stay here and fight for the sake of my sister's safety even though I hate fighting. I shall not let the Shogunate's army set foot upon my homeland.
