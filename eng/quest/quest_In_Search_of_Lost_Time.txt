# In Search of Lost Time


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, Broglie, we have the data from the two monitoring stations you mentioned.
Broglie: Really? That's great! Please, let me take a look at them...
Traveler: Here.
Black Screen Text: You give the paper tapes you collected to Broglie...
Broglie: Ahhhh! Yes, this is it, this is it! You two are angels, angels sent from the heavens to save me from my misery and return me to my happy life of ease—
Paimon: Did you really have to say it like that?
Broglie: #Well! There's no time to lose, kind {M#sir}{F#lady}! I'll go find my supervisor and request the key to the central processing station! Please wait for me!
Paimon: *sigh* Just... hurry up, would you?
Black Screen Text: An excited Broglie returns after a short while.
Broglie: #{M#Sir}{F#Lady}, I have the key! Now we just have to go to the central processing station to organize the data, and then we can resume hydrological monitoring again!
Traveler: Oh...
Broglie: Considering the situation of Pate de Fruit and Crepes Suzette Stations, it is possible that those fellows from Snezhnaya are also at the central processing station...
Broglie: So please, come with me!
Paimon: Don't forget to compensate us!
Traveler: And we have to go with you?
Traveler: What about our compensation?
Broglie: About that... Please don't worry. If my supervisor approves restarting our original hydrological research, you'll definitely get paid!
Paimon: Hehe, that's a relief!

## Talk 2

Broglie: #{M#Sir}{F#Lady}, you're finally here!
Broglie: I have the key! Now we just have to go to the central processing station to organize the data, and then we can start the hydrological monitoring again!
Traveler: Oh...
Broglie: Considering the situation of Pate de Fruit and Crepes Suzette Stations, it is possible that those fellows from Snezhnaya are also at the central processing station...
Broglie: So please, come with me!
Paimon: Don't forget to compensate us!
Traveler: And we have to go with you?

## Talk 4

Broglie: #Here we are, {M#sir}{F#lady}! This is the central processing station, where our hydrology research data is analyzed!
Traveler: It doesn't look like anyone's here.
Paimon: Without any Fatui, we're not needed, right?
Broglie: We can't be sure yet. What if there are soldiers from Snezhnaya inside? I might not be able to see Conch Madeleine again...
Broglie: Ahem, I mean, I shan't ever conduct hydrological research again! Please, go inside with me!
Paimon: Fine. Just open the door...
Traveler: Can I go now?

## Talk 5

Paimon: #Paimon sees them, {NICKNAME}. Over there! Hey! Stop!

## Talk 6

Broglie: Let me see...
Broglie: If we can put together the collected data, I reckon we'll get some significant results, and hydrological monitoring should resume very soon! I can't wait!
Paimon: That sounds great!
Broglie: Why do I get this feeling that we're missing a part of the data? Am I just paranoid?
Paimon: Why are you so unsure? Aren't you in charge of the data?
Malinovskyi: ...
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...?
Malinovskyi: ...Um, sorry. I got the wrong room.
Black Screen Text: The Fatui commander leaves the scene at a speed that does not match his physique.
Paimon: Wait, did something just pass us by?
Traveler: He was faster than a vishap...
Paimon: Wait, that's not the point! He's a Fatuus! Why is he here?
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, we need to go after him and get to the bottom of this!
Traveler: So agile...

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: Out of options, the Fatui commander jumps into the water, creating a huge splash.

## Talk 8

Malinovskyi: Stop! I surrender! Stop!
Malinovskyi: You... You're here for the paper tapes, right? You can have them all! Just... stop attacking me!
Black Screen Text: The Fatui commander hands over all the research data...
Paimon: Is that all, Broglie?
Broglie: Um... Well... Maybe? Yeah. This should be all of it. Sure!
Paimon: Just forget that Paimon asked.
Traveler: What's your objective here?
Paimon: Yes, tell us everything! Why are you occupying these stations?
Malinovskyi: ...
Malinovskyi: To... slack off...
Paimon: ...?
Malinovskyi: I'm Malinovskyi, commanding officer of the 34th Independent Investigative Squad.
Malinovskyi: At first, when we had just been dispatched to Fontaine, everyone was quite happy, and the mission wasn't that difficult...
Paimon: So what does that have to do with you occupying the stations?
Malinovskyi: A few months ago, due to some organizational changes, headquarters assigned someone named Shumilov as my new deputy.
Paimon: Shumilov? Right, the platoon leader we saw at Crepes Suzette Station...
Malinovskyi: Yes, that's the one! I can't stand that fellow, but I can't get rid of him... so I look for excuses and go on missions to get away from him.
Paimon: Wait, Paimon's confused. You said that he's your deputy, right?
Malinovskyi: That's right.
Paimon: So, aren't you his superior? Why do you have to listen to him?
Malinovskyi: Well, he is, blast him — but he always acts seriously and makes others do the work!
Malinovskyi: His words are hard to refute, and I can't very well tell him that no one here wants to work in front of everyone, can I?
Malinovskyi: It just so happened that I saw some strange towers nearby, so I told him that we were going to investigate, and forged the letters from the Maison Gestion...
Paimon: So you forged the documents! Paimon knew it! There was no way that the Maison Gestion would let you manage the hydrological monitoring stations!
Paimon: Any other questions, Broglie?
Broglie: I see. So you're just trying to slack off... No, I mean, you're just trying to get a little peace in this noisy world by occupying our monitoring stations.
Broglie: Well? How would you rate our accommodations?
Paimon: ?
Malinovskyi: Um, very comfortable? The scenery nearby is beautiful, too. I usually feel a lot better after taking a short nap.
Broglie: Right? Especially when you wake up and realize that there are no urgent tasks, and that you're not being watched by someone you don't like. You can just enjoy the afternoon sun and the breeze...
Malinovskyi: It's like waking up from a dream and entering another where you don't have to worry about anything.
Broglie: That's how you're supposed to live! It's a shame that you haven't tried the limited-edition black tea in the Vasari Passage. If you get a chance...
Paimon: Wait, where is this conversation going?
Paimon: Anyway, please come with us! It's time to let the Fontaine Research Institute know what you've done!
Malinovskyi: Ugh...
Broglie: W—Wait!
Broglie: Um, he actually didn't cause any damage to our research, did he?
Broglie: Objectively speaking, he even collected some data for us.
Broglie: He's just someone who wants to be rid of work and live a comfortable life!
Malinovskyi: Th—That's right!
Paimon: Wait, that's not something to be proud of, even when you put it like that.
Broglie: #Kind {M#sir}{F#lady}, please let him go in the name of science.
Traveler: Is this really related to science?
Malinovskyi: Thank you, sir, and the two of you! I swear I will never do such a thing again. I will do my best to slack off on my own!
Broglie: I love how determined you are!
Paimon: Can you not get hyped up over something like this?
Black Screen Text: The Fatui commander leaves, feeling grateful...
Broglie: With that resolved, I'll be going back to go through the data.
Broglie: Thank you for your work! Please take these!
Paimon: Is it... really resolved?
Paimon: Whatever, at least the stations are operational again, and the Fatui platoons have left. Paimon supposes it's over.
Traveler: Well, if our requester says so...
