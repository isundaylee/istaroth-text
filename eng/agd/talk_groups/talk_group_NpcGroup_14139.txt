Vichama: I heard you made it back from the Night Kingdom!
Vichama: Very impressive. Considering your courage, conviction, and strength... I'd say you're the most outstanding warriors I've ever met. If only I could be more like you...
Traveler: We saw Mallko in the Night Kingdom.
Vichama: What!?
Black Screen Text: You recount what you saw in the Night Kingdom to Vichama.
Vichama: So that's what happened... Mallko, he chose to...
Vichama: I'm sorry. It's hard to express what I'm feeling right now. Even though we're separated by death, we still managed to accomplish something together... It's like we had the chance to fight side by side again.
Vichama: I'll finally be able to get a good night's sleep, now. Mallko, my friend... just keep waiting. We'll be together again one day.
