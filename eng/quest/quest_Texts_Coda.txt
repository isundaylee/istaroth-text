## Talk 1

Cappet: #Well, if it isn't the Marquis of Carabas, along with {M#his}{F#her} cat and little fairy?
Kirara: #Umm, I think we should probably stop this now. Surely it's time that {NICKNAME} and I dropped these roles?
Boborano: In theory, it should all be over now. But I remember hearing that the point of the ceremony was to help people transition from one mental state to another.
Boborano: To bid farewell to the title of Marquis of Carabas once and for all, you can bring things to a close with a touch of formality.
Albizzi: "As the Nekomata bids farewell to her boots, through the reflection are we wiser to the nature of the truth."

## Talk 2

Gentle Guard: The city beneath the starry sky is supremely splendid... The suspended stars sway, and the seas are still...
Gentle Guard: Here, we have the sounds of clockwork winding up in the morning, and at night, the blended scent of vegetable oil and woodchips wafts over in waves...
Gentle Guard: Each time I experience these, I feel like our world is so beautiful, so perfect, it's almost like it was lifted right from the pages of a story...
Gentle Guard: ...Traveler, will you remember what stories transpired beneath this starry sky?
Traveler: ...Who knows?
Gentle Guard: It's okay. At least the starry sky will remember. And I will remember too.
Traveler: I will.
Gentle Guard: Haha... I hope that when you think of this starry sky, you too will feel that sense of serene bliss.
