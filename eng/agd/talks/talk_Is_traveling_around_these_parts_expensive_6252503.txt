Traveler: Is traveling around these parts expensive?
Wanjing: No, no, no, Qiaoying Village and Yilong Wharf are both pretty cheap! Food and lodging aren't too costly, and most of the stuff on sale is great quality for the price.
Wanjing: It's just that my travel budget is really limited, and I spent most of it on a Kamera some Fontainian merchant recommended.
Wanjing: It's a good thing the Kamera takes such beautiful pictures! I can even use it to capture how I felt looking at such amazing sights. It's totally worth the Mora!
Wanjing: Who knows? In ten to twenty years, maybe I'll only need to take a glance at these pictures to remember everything I experienced over these few days!
Wanjing: I still need to take some photos from Yilong Dais at the summit...
