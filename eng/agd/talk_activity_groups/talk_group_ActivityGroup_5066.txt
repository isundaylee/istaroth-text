Traveler: You know, your manner of speech is kinda...
Nazafarin: Ah, "dear Lesser Lord Kusanali"! You mean how I tend to say things like that? Well, you see, I have a friend from Fontaine who enjoys talking like that.

Traveler: So, how do I use this pot of yours?
Nazafarin: Ah, yes, sorry. I would've forgotten if you hadn't reminded me, I'll wager.

Traveler: See you.
Nazafarin: See you! Thank you once again, Nazafarin's saviors!
