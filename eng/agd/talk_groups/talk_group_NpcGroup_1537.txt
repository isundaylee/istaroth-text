Draff: We can't afford to lose any more people... Ever since the meteorites struck, it's become increasingly difficult to provide enough meat to fulfill the Good Hunter's orders...
Draff: I do wish that some of the younger hunters could learn to not let their curiosity get the better of them... *sigh*

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: They'd be more use to me roasted with a few wild mushrooms...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Draff: I raised them as carrier pigeons, to deliver messages.
Draff: But for some reason they are getting less and less reliable.
Draff: Either they lose the message or they glide around for hours but never actually deliver it. Or, they sit around the whole time just waiting for someone to chase them off.
Draff: If you have time, maybe you could hurry along the pigeons I just released.
Traveler: Got it.
Draff: Great. So if you see any of them slacking off, chase them away for me.
Traveler: I seek not the enmity of pigeons.
Draff: Don't worry, it's not like pigeons to hold a grudge. Their memory is much too short for that.
Draff: I never had you down as such a pigeon lover...

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: Maybe now they'll deliver their messages without a fuss in future...
Draff: But I can't exactly follow them and check... Anyway, that'll do for now.
Draff: For your trouble, please take this. And if you ever need to send a message, just come and find me.

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: You did WHAT? How could you!? They were my carrier pigeons!
Draff: You churlish imbecile... hilichurlish, even! What am I going to do about all these letters!?
Traveler: Sowwie...
Draff: Is that the best you can do? A Knight of Flaming Favonius and the best you can offer is a half-hearted apology!?
Draff: You've really fluffed up here, and now you have to make it right. Since you're so bird-brained anyway, I trust you will have no problem being my new carrier pigeon!
Traveler: Sometimes I don't know my own strength...
Draff: It helps if you don't chase them off with a flaming meat cleaver!

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: The hilichurls have an insatiable appetite for avian messengers? Are you serious...
Draff: Well, I suppose they are getting plump, and would probably make a great pairing with a glass of jagerschnapps...
Draff: ...I mean, uh... Oh drats, now I have to raise a whole new flock of pigeons.

Traveler: Is this letter yours?
Draff: A letter? Ah yes, I sent this! It was supposed to go to Sister Grace, in the city.
Draff: You didn't read it, did you? Not that it matters anyway, it's all stuff that happened years ago.
Draff: With some things, you can't leave them in the dark forever...
Draff: Thank you for bringing it all this way, I'll run it down to the city myself some time. Here's a small reward for finding it...
Draff: Timmie, hey Timmie...

Traveler: Who are you?
Draff: I am Draff, you can think of me as the head of the hunters. The best hunter in the town.
Draff: Most of meat from our hunts goes straight to the Good Hunter, a restaurant in the city.
Draff: If you're here to make a bulk order of meat, I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to take it on.

### Talk 0 related talk 9

Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Draff: Stay away from my daughter, Diona.
Draff: She will learn the hunting trade from me and take over as leader of this town.
Draff: But right now she's at that rebellious age, and she's gone off to work in the city as a bartender or something...
Draff: *sigh* Never mind, I just need to be patient. She's my daughter after all, and if she's got her heart set on doing something she'll not go back on it easily.

Traveler: How long is the hunt over for?
Draff: Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?
Draff: With such fine wine before me, what would I care about what's nearby or anything...
Draff: Oh, don't look so uptight. How about joining me for a mug or two?

Traveler: Could you sell me some game you hunted?
Draff: Depends on how much you want... I can sell some of it to you. Anything you get from us directly is going to be fresher than anything you find in the shops.

Traveler: You seem to be very happy.
Draff: Of course! Let me put it this way — every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
Draff: And I am the head of those hunters!
Draff: You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
Draff: Huh, now where's that great ancestor of mine gone to? Things get a bit fuzzy after drinking so much...

Traveler: You seem like you've drunk a lot...
Draff: No good hunting session is complete without a good drinking session afterwards!
Draff: What's more, my daughter Diona is one of the top bartenders in Mondstadt...
Draff: That hasn't changed how much she nags me about my drinking, mind you...
Traveler: How long is the hunt over for?
Draff: Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?

Draff: Goodbye! Come early enough next time and there might still be a few drinks left for you! Hahaha!

Draff: I remember that while we were out hunting, Allan reported that he'd seen ores nearby that looked like Crystal Ore.
Draff: While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
Draff: Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.

Draff: During our hunt, Allan reported to me that he'd sighted ores nearby that resembled Crystal Ores...
Draff: Just that they had a different color, and were rarer. You'll have to ask Wagner for the specifics, he probably knows far more than me...
