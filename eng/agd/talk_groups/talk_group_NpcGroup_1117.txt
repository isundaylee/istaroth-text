Slime Breeder: I've been raising 3 Slimes. They like to be lifted up in the air and especially enjoy jumping through hoops.
Slime Breeder: They go faster when you use Acting Grand Master Jean's *Gale Blade* though.
How about making the Slimes jump through 10 hoops before time runs out! It'll make them happy! Wanna try?

Traveler: Sure.
Slime Breeder: Thank you! Now, please welcome *Acting Grand Master Jean*.

Slime Breeder: Use the *Gale Blade* to make the Slimes jump faster! Time is running out!
