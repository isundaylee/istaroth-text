Traveler: What do you plan to do from here on out?
Tejima: That's a good question, and it's time I made some detailed plans. If I cannot keep waiting for her, then perhaps I shall leave the village in search of her after all.
Tejima: Before, I wanted to leave because I felt lost. But this time, I'm making a move because I'm sure of what my goals must be.
Tejima: Well, I've spent most of my life waiting to no avail, so I might as well be pro-active from here on out! It's not too late for an old man like me to learn from the determination of the young, is it?
Tejima: As long as I hold my wish dearly in my heart, I will not lose my way. That's what you've taught me, you know?
