Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Diluc: Yes... Take a sip of this.
Diluc: It's an alcohol-free beverage based on a long-standing family recipe. But I put my own spin on it.
Traveler: So crisp and refreshing!
Diluc: The look on your face suggests that was rather to your liking.
Diluc: Well, I'm glad. I tried to adjust the recipe to match your taste, and from the looks of it, I succeeded in doing just that.
Diluc: Now. I have a favor to ask of you.
Diluc: This drink hasn't been named yet. It wouldn't be appropriate to use its original name, since the recipe has been modified.
Traveler: You want me to name it?
Diluc: Well, it was made to suit your tastes. It's only fitting that you name it.
Diluc: Or perhaps... I should name it after you?
Traveler: That'd be weird.
Diluc: ...I suppose you're right.
Diluc: Well, there's no rush, so take your time. I can always make another glass for you if you forget how it tastes.
Diluc: Anywhere. Anytime.
Traveler: Let me give this some more thought...
Traveler: What a mellow aftertaste!
