Traveler: I thought you were talking about combat...
Utsil: Ah, if it's combat we're talking about, then the cool factor doesn't really apply, right? That's a whole different kettle of fish from tabletop card games.
Utsil: I may have gotten a little heated just now when talking about Genius Invokation TCG, but please don't paint me as some sort of battle-freak.
Utsil: Even if a warrior staggers off the battlefield, if they defeat their enemy and make it back home alive, then they're the final winners nonetheless.
