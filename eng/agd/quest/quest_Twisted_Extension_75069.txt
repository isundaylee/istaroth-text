# Twisted Extension


## Talk 1

Quenin: Ah, this place... Few visit it... After all, it's dangerous here.
Quenin: Are you with the adventure team too...? Hmph, they say the shadow of a black serpent has descended from the Tonatiuh... You should be careful.
Quenin: Or better, leave while you can. There are inhuman things, ha, hiding within the team... Those voices, those curses... so noisy...
Quenin: It's pretty quiet around here thanks to the waterfall. Haha... The roar of the falls drowns out everything else, so you can't hear a thing.

## Talk 2

Cold Body: (The cold, statue-like body of one resembling Quenin, somehow preserved without decay, seems frozen in time....)
Cold Body: (And judging by the surroundings, it has remained in this state for a long time...)

## Talk 3

Quenin's Diary: (A torn page, with neatly written words at the beginning...)
Quenin's Diary: "...Abyss monsters are growing in number, as expected... The adventure team has failed in the end, and a planned retreat is in progress."
Quenin's Diary: "We must ensure the remaining members can evacuate safely. Be wary of those who vanish at night, or return from places devoid of light."
Quenin's Diary: "...The Abyss monsters are appearing more frequently. The stronghold may be discovered soon, but before that..."
Quenin's Diary: (The handwriting becomes shaky and distorted...)
Quenin's Diary: "Ah, it's cold... So cold... There, over there, blood is draining..."
Quenin's Diary: "The sound of the waterfall, so loud... yes, this is good. As long as... under the waterfall, it'll be quiet there... pale faces, opened mouths, drained blood..."
Quenin's Diary: "Just there... just... there... something... something is there..."
Quenin's Diary: "Under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall..."

Quenin: The waterfall, haha... The roar of the falls drowns out everything else, so you can't hear a thing.

Quenin: The waterfall, haha... The roar of the falls drowns out everything else, so you can't hear a thing.
Quenin: Oh, it's you. Need anything?
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Quenin: I'm... a warrior of the adventure team. Not one as mighty as our leader, Lord Taika, but I do have my strengths.
Quenin: I guard our camp... Sometimes, when I can't sleep at night, I patrol to keep the camp safe.
Quenin: Now, I don't know when it started, but there have been fewer and fewer people in camp every day... Huh, wait. Strange... Why am I here now?
Traveler: Nope, don't need anything.
Quenin: Is that so... Ah, then take my advice, brave warrior. Leave here quickly.

Traveler: You hear other things?
Quenin: Yes, and only here at the waterfall can the sound of water drown them out...
Quenin: Can't you hear it? Someone whimpers by your ear, like one who is dying but cannot scream, making only the sound of their lungs struggling for air.
Quenin: And then, you will see a pale face, staring at you with anger. A face... like your own.
Quenin: Ah, only at the waterfall, only there can I escape those haunting sounds. Hehe, can't you hear them...
Quenin: Stay here for too long, brave warrior, and you might end up like me. So, leave while you can.
Traveler: Nope, don't need anything.
Quenin: Is that so... Ah, then take my advice, brave warrior. Leave here quickly.
