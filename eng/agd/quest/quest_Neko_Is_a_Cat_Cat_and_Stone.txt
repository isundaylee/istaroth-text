# Neko Is a Cat: Cat and Stone


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, look! That's the camp that Miss Etsuko told us about. There's someone in there, too!
Paimon: Let's go ask around. Maybe he knows a thing or two about carving stone...

## Talk 2

Taisuke: Ah, hello there. What are you busy with today?
Traveler: Helping Neko make a statue.
Taisuke: Uh... What? A statue, here? Really?
Taisuke: I—I'll pick up carving immediately!
Traveler: I doubt you'll make it in time...
Etsuko: Hmm, is this another one of Neko's requests?
Etsuko: You know what, I don't think it'll be that hard to find craftsmen looking for work, what with the issues we've been having in Tatarasuna.
Etsuko: The Guild's received quite a few commissions related to this, and I've heard that some people are still in Tatarasuna looking for work.
Etsuko: I encountered just such an encampment while on a commission.
Etsuko: So if you want, you can try your luck there.
Traveler: Thank you.
Etsuko: Heh, don't pay it any mind. It wasn't that hard.
Etsuko: And you know what? I'd like to see what might happen if that shrine really does thrive again...
Etsuko: Especially that "Hibiki" Neko keeps talking about. What sort of person could be so beloved by that cat?
Etsuko: Alright, don't worry, I'm just talking to myself. Go look for that artisan.
Etsuko: As for whether they know how to carve rock or not... Well, I guess that's up to luck, eh?
Taisuke: Come on, Miss Etsuko, you just want to help Lady Neko as well, don't you? Haha, you're such a—
Etsuko: Taisuke, is our survey plan ready yet?
Taisuke: Uh, I—I'm almost done. Sorry...
Traveler: You don't seem like your usual self, Etsuko.
Etsuko: What, not used to me giving you information first?

## Talk 3

???: *sigh* When will I be able to find some work...
???: Are you looking for me? What is this about?
Traveler: Do you know how to make stone carvings?
???: Eh? Well... Well then, that's great!
???: Wait, sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Ooshima Junpei, and I used to work at Tatarasuna.
??? (Ooshima Junpei): After that accident, we were all evacuated.
??? (Ooshima Junpei): But till now, I haven't received any notice that we might be returning to work, so I've been idle here this whole time.
??? (Ooshima Junpei): So you're looking for someone who can do some stone carving, right? Well, that's not my specialty per se, but I do have some skill in it...
??? (Ooshima Junpei): What sort of stone carving do you need made? Could you tell me?
Traveler: Well, here's the situation...
??? (Ooshima Junpei): Uh... So, let me get this straight. A talking cat wants you to find a craftsman to make a carved statue of it?
??? (Ooshima Junpei): It's not like I don't believe you or anything. It's just a bit... You know, outrageous...
??? (Ooshima Junpei): And even if I agreed, how is that... that provisional head priestess supposed to pay me? I'm not going to work for free, no matter what anyone says.
Traveler: Relax, it'll be fine.
Paimon: (...Will it really, though...)
??? (Ooshima Junpei): Will it? I... Hmm, it just feels like you're swindling me...
??? (Ooshima Junpei): Still... You know what? Never mind. I'm a pair of idle hands anyway. Might as well go with you to have a look.
??? (Ooshima Junpei): I really hope that I can get paid...
Traveler: We're looking for an artisan who can work with stone.

## Talk 4

Neko: Ah, you have returned. This human must be the stone human, yes?
Traveler: This is the artisan we hired.
Ooshima Junpei: ...What!? The cat... it really can talk!
Neko: Meow meow meow, such ado about nothing... Is it so strange that I speak?
Traveler: No need to make a fuss.
Ooshima Junpei: Wait. Are you saying that this is something super normal for you!?
Traveler: That certainly has been the case so far.
Ooshima Junpei: What in the world have you experienced...
Neko: Come now, we are not here to merely talk.
Neko: Back to our main point. Stone human, can you knock on stone and cause it to look like me?
Ooshima Junpei: Eh? Stone human? You mean me?
Ooshima Junpei: "Knock on stone," you say... Well, I can give stone-working a go...
Neko: Is that so? Wonderful, meow meow meow.
Ooshima Junpei: S—So this is how it is, huh... Well, having a job is better than nothing. I mean, I've never worked for a cat before, so... I guess we'll just discuss my salary later?
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm. Either way, I'll need to make some preparations. There are quite a few rocks here on this island. I'll need to pick a good one.
Ooshima Junpei: Ah, yes. How should I address you?
Neko: I am the Neko, the provisional head priestess of the Asase Shrine.
Neko: As to terms of address, you may call me whatever you please, tall, stone-knocking human.
Ooshima Junpei: Is that so? Well then, I suppose I shall call you Lady Priestess. You are my employer, after all.
Neko: ...What is an "envoyer"?
Ooshima Junpei: ...
Ooshima Junpei: W—Well, I'll go look around and pick a rock to use, then. You all just stay here for now.
Ooshima Junpei: Working for a cat. Well, that's a first...
Paimon: Mr. Ooshima seems to have forgotten all about that payment.
Traveler: It's just a talking cat.
Traveler: Yes, the stone human.

## Talk 5

Neko: I will leave the matter of stone to you.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Neko: Still, I am curious. How will a thing as hard as stone take on my countenance?
Neko: Is that stone human very powerful? Can he use some magic?
Traveler: Oh, he's super powerful.
Neko: Ah, I understand. Lovely!
Traveler: It's like that time with the meal we made...
Neko: Ah, I understand. The meals you and Hibiki made were all good things. The stone that the stone human will make must then also be a good thing.
Neko: Humans can be quite skilled sometimes, it seems. You have my thanks.
