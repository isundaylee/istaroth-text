# "That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"


## Talk 1

Dori: Have you decided to buy information from me?
Paimon: Hmmm... Paimon's a little curious about your exclusive information, but we need to hear the price first! If it's too expensive, then forget it.
Dori: I'll sell it to you for the fixed price of one million Mora!
Paimon: That's a lot! Never mind, one million Mora can buy lots and lots of tasty food!
Dori: Wait a sec... Let me see... Eh? Paimon is customer number 1,001 for today. The original cost of the information was one million Mora, but for you the price is now free!
Paimon: Eh!? Paimon didn't know such luck exists!
Paimon: Wait, you're not baiting us into spending, are you? Maybe the first sentence is free, but not the next sentence...
Dori: If you don't want it, fine! Next!
Paimon: Wait, wait, wait, forget what Paimon said. We'll listen!
Dori: Dori's exclusive scoop number one! Do you remember the Diadem of Knowledge?
Paimon: Paimon remembers that only the champion was entitled to wear the diadem. It seemed very valuable!
Dori: Exactly. The diadem that Sachin gave the Akademiya was a rather expensive antique.
Dori: Yet this very diadem, after it was donated to the Akademiya, was lost by them once before!
Paimon: Eh? Why didn't we hear about this?
Dori: Hehe... if everyone knew about this, would my information still be considered "exclusive"?
Dori: Of course, this information doesn't come from nowhere. I've got witnesses, too.
Dori: There's a young fellow named Kashmer from the suburbs. If you're interested in delving further, you could ask him.
Dori: The password is "that incident from twenty years ago"!

## Talk 2

Kashmer: Who are you guys? Is there something you need?

## Talk 3

Paimon: There's a hole in the tree. It seems completely empty, and there's nothing in it...
Paimon: Eh? Wait! There's a note there!
Paimon: "The good Nara taught Arakasyapa how to read. Arakasyapa must protect the good Nara..."
Paimon: What's this supposed to mean?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: "That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"
Kashmer: ... I guess I shouldn't have told anyone. Last time I had too much to drink and blabbered a little too much, and now people are seeking me out.
Kashmer: Since you're curious, I guess I'll tell you.
Kashmer: I was just six years old twenty years ago, so I can't remember clearly what happened at the time. But recently, I read the diary I kept when I was a child, and vaguely recalled the situation back then.
Kashmer: The Interdarshan Championship was also held that year. There were three rounds, the last of which was outside the city. I begged my mom to take me out of town to see it, and when she refused, I snuck out.
Paimon: And then?
Kashmer: I ended up getting lost outside the city. In the middle of nowhere, there was no one around. I grew more and more frightened and began to cry.
Kashmer: That's when I saw some strange creatures... I can't remember what they looked like. I only remember how, as a child, I stopped crying at the sight of them.
Paimon: Strange creatures... they must be...
Traveler: (The Aranara.)
Kashmer: They took me to the competition. Unfortunately, by the time we got there, it was too late. It was already over.
Kashmer: Just when I was disheartened, I suddenly saw one of those strange creatures slowly dragging a crown along.
Kashmer: It was a beautiful crown, shining in the moonlight, and I could not help but follow it. I saw the little fellow hide the crown in a hollow tree before disappearing.
Kashmer: I wanted to touch that crown. But at the moment, I could hear the distant cries of my mother. It turns out, she figured out I was lost, and got her neighbors to go looking for me.
Kashmer: I never got to touch it. It wasn't until I was older, when I saw the "Diadem of Knowledge" at the Interdarshan Championship that I realized it was the same thing.
Paimon: Alright... do you remember where that diadem ended up?
Kashmer: It's probably in the Avidya Forest, but I've been back a few times, and I haven't found anything.
Kashmer: No one would believe me, even if I told them. Alas, even I can't remember it clearly. Perhaps, it was a dream I had when I was a child.
Paimon: #Well... should we go look for it, {NICKNAME}?
