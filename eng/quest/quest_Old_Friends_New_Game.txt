# Old Friends, New Game


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Eh? Look, {NICKNAME}, there's a new stall over there!
Paimon: Let's go take a look at it, shall we?

## Talk 2

Balfour: Well then, let's not lose any time. Come, Golden Comet, the internal test build of Fungus Mechanicus is ready for you!

## Talk 3

Balfour: How was it, Golden Comet? How did your first taste of Fungus Mechanicus gameplay go?
Haniyyah: Judging by your expression, I suppose you haven't come to a conclusion yet.
Traveler: I only went for one round, after all.
Balfour: That is true. With this little test content, it is indeed rather difficult to judge the strengths and flaws of Fungus Mechanicus.
Balfour: Don't you worry. Ms. Haniyyah and I will be here for a while, and we'll have one new Mechanicus stage for you every day — seven in total.
Balfour: Come over whenever you have the time, and you'll get the opportunity to test those stages!
Balfour: Although you are the overall overseer in these matters, this game was something that Ms. Haniyyah and I came up with of our own accord — so this is an expenditure of time that lies outside your plans.
Balfour: As such, a fee will be provided to you for services rendered!
Traveler: Haha, well, I won't say no to that.
Balfour: Haha, very straightforward! I like it!
Haniyyah: I've applied for the two Fungi to be furnished with sufficient residence privileges, so they'll be here in Port Ormos throughout Fungus Mechanicus's testing phase.
Haniyyah: Your Silver Companion can spend more time with Bongo-Head, too.
Traveler: Good for Paimon!
Haniyyah: Hehe, yes, you should go see Bongo-Head as well. It misses you, you know?
Haniyyah: Bring this with you. You can feed Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy with it — it's their favorite.
Traveler: I can't wait either!
Traveler: You'll see that Mora back next time we run this tournament!
Traveler: I'll need to conduct further testing.

## Talk 4

Paimon: C'mon, Bongo-Head, let's play a clapping game!
Paimon: C'mon, Kindlejoy, let's dance with Bongo-Head!
Paimon: Hmm... We've gotten pretty familiar with Kindlejoy, but we still can't quite communicate as well with it as we can with Bongo-Head...
Traveler: You're a real happy bean, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: #You're here, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: How are things going with the Fungus Mechanicus trials?
Traveler: The test period will still be on for a while yet.
Paimon: Ooh, so Haniyyah and our shroom buddies will be here for a while, huh? That's great!
Paimon: Paimon was planning to ask you to stay here for a day more so that we could spend more quality time with the Fungi.
Paimon: But it looks like we can hit two birds with one stone — testing Fungus Mechanicus and playing with our shroom buddies at the same time!
Black Screen Text: You have a good, carefree time with Paimon, Bongo-Head, and Kindlejoy, and feed the Marvelous Jellies to them.
Paimon and your shroom buddies enjoy themselves very much.
Paimon: Hehe, that was great, like Paimon's worries have all flown away!
Paimon: Well, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy... See you tomorrow!
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ?
Traveler: We can play with them every day before it concludes.
Traveler: I'm enjoying this, too.
