# The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call


## Talk 1

Nahida: Prepare yourselves. I'm going to transport you into Irminsul.

## Talk 2

Paimon: You must have a whole bunch of questions after our last conversation with Nahida? Paimon was ready to ask her a million more questions, but... didn't wanna seem too pushy...
Paimon: Like, about these "Descenders." So... does that just mean people like you, who come traveling to Teyvat from someplace else?
Paimon: #And as for your sister... whew, so many questions. Let's go find Nahida and see what else we can find out.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow... It looks pretty different here compared to last time.
Paimon: The colors are gentler... Guess that must be because Sumeru's at peace now.

## Talk 4

Paimon: These sapling things have spread out...

## Talk 5

Paimon: It looks the same in every direction...
Traveler: (This space is indeed unusual... But it seems that The Balladeer is more used to it than I.)

## Talk 6

The Balladeer: ...Dottore, you brazen-faced...! Niwa didn't run from justice... you killed him!

## Talk 7

The Balladeer: We're here.
Paimon: What a huge tree...
Traveler: (This is the center of Irminsul. All the information in the world is flowing through it...)
The Balladeer: Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Nahida: Good, you made it. Are you ready?
The Balladeer: Ready when you are.
Nahida: Then please begin. Preparing to access cognitive currents. Establishing waypoint...
Paimon: The Balladeer's actually doing what Nahida tells him... Guess he must want to stay alive.
Traveler: (He hasn't put up any resistance, and he seems good at working on the frontline... Maybe he had a similar role in the Fatui?)
Traveler: (First Aqaba and Sawada's stories, now this... What a strange individual.)
Nahida: The rest is up to you. If you discover anything at all, make sure to share it with us.
The Balladeer: Will do.
Paimon: Huh... For once, we're the ones with nothing to do...
Nahida: #(Traveler, Paimon, would you like to talk?)
Traveler: (Nahida? ...Is this a telepathic conversation?)
Nahida: (Yes. I've also invited Paimon to join.)
Paimon: (Huh? ...What the... We can talk to each other inside our heads?)
Traveler: (I'm guessing that you don't want us to disturb The Balladeer.)
Nahida: (Hehe, that's part of it. Plus, we're all friends. There's nothing wrong with us talking like this once in a while.)
Paimon: (Paimon's never tried this before. This is great!)
Paimon: (So, Paimon's been wanting to ask you something. Don't you think The Balladeer's a bit of a walking contradiction? He's always talking back, but he seems to listen to what you say...)
Traveler: (Yes, and he seems to excel at doing odd jobs for others...)
Nahida: (As I've told you before, there are still some mysteries for him to resolve. Things that are clear as day to me, but that he has yet to understand.)
Nahida: (Perhaps today will be the day that he finds some answers.)
Traveler: (Is it about his past? The "betrayals"? And the other events in Inazuma?)
Nahida: (Well done. Smart and attentive as always.)
Traveler: (Actually, I caught a glimpse of a few things when I ran into Haypasia at Pardis Dhyai...)
Black Screen Text: You relate what you saw in The Balladeer's mind while in Pardis Dhyai...
Nahida: (So you made contact with that part of his mind... Well, it's true. Betrayal turned The Balladeer into the person he is today.)
Paimon: (Huh, Paimon thought nothing could get under that guy's skin. Turns out he can get hurt and angry just like anyone else.)
Nahida: (Everyone has a history, Paimon. Even if you're a puppet created by the Electro Archon.)
Paimon: (Speaking of puppets, we ran into two people at the Akademiya today talking about an essay. Turns out their topic was about the Tatarasuna incident... Nahida, do you know anything about that?)
Nahida: (If you mean the mysterious events, the kabukimono, and so on... Yes, I know about all of that.)
Paimon: (Really? Because from what they were saying, it sounded like lots of Tatarasuna's history is still unexplained, and most of the information we have now is just from people filling the gaps with their imagination. At least, that's what they thought...)
Black Screen Text: You tell Nahida about the story Aqaba and Sawada are writing...
Nahida: (...Oh? How interesting. Those two managed to deduce quite a lot through guesswork alone.)
Paimon: (So the guessay got it right!?)
Nahida: (Well, they guessed right about one thing: Tatarasuna was sabotaged.)
The Balladeer: Must be a riveting conversation you three are having. Funny how all the good ones happen when I'm not involved.
Paimon: Ah! Wh—What makes you think we're talking to each other?
The Balladeer: Don't insult me. You're having a private conversation without me. Obviously, I must be the topic of said conversation.
Traveler: We have every right to keep certain things confidential.
The Balladeer: Of course you do. You can't have your prisoner knowing too much.
Paimon: So, uh, have you found anything yet?
The Balladeer: Still looking. Don't get your hopes up, though. You and your twin come from outside this world. It wouldn't surprise me if there was nothing on either of you in Irminsul at all.
Paimon: ...Wait, how'd you know about that? Did Nahida tell you?
The Balladeer: It's not like we've never met before. And anyway, you're world-famous. It'd be more surprising if I didn't know a few things about you.
Traveler: Every conversation with you is hard work...
The Balladeer: Right now, we have to keep the peace. I'm not interested in creating more misery for myself, and making cordial conversation is something I can manage.
The Balladeer: ...Huh? Wait...
Paimon: This light... It looks similar to those saplings. What could it be?
The Balladeer: ...Anonymous data?
Paimon: Hey! Don't you forget the agreement. You have to share it with us!
The Balladeer: Shush. Just wait.
Escher (???): ...Mr. Niwa, are you certain this is worth the risk? We are talking about Tatarasuna's furnace, after all. It may not pay to act rashly...
Niwa (???): There's no one else who can enter the furnace. It has to be me.
Escher (???): Is that so...? *sigh* Well, since you insist...
The Balladeer: *gasp*... It's...
Traveler: (That name... Niwa was the man in charge at Tatarasuna. Plus, he belongs to the lineage of Isshin Art...)
Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: ...But your attitude is better than I thought.

## Talk 8

Escher (???): I have been in Tatarasuna for some time now. You have shown me great hospitality, as has Mikoshi Nagamasa... and indeed, everyone else.
Escher (???): Under your leadership, Tatarasuna is a warm, welcoming place, like a giant village. People are gainfully employed, their lives have purpose. They are motivated.
Escher (???): As I understand, the Raiden Shogun has, in recent years, eliminated much of the evil that plagued Inazuma. As for Tatarasuna, it was originally established as a means of safely disposing Crystal Marrow.
Escher (???): The forging industry with Crystal Marrow as a raw material has since flourished, giving rise to generations of swordsmiths — some world-renowned, others unknown... all passing on their legacy.
Escher (???): Skills, blood, dreams... Every smith brought into this trade looks to find their purpose between steel and blade. That is why you accepted the proposal brought to you by myself and Akame.
Niwa: Yes, well... Were it not for you coming to Inazuma and happening to make Akame's acquaintance, the two of you never would have joined forces. And he would be the first to admit that there's no way he could have revolutionized our forging process like this on his own — at least not on the same timescale.
Niwa: You allowed Akame to take all the credit for a method that you jointly developed, he sold it to me, and now, every piece of ore here is smelted using the new technique.
Niwa: Even now, you remain one of Tatarasuna's key consultants, working right here alongside us. I believe it is you, Sir, who are truly responsible for the changes in our manufacturing and forging methods.
Escher: You flatter me. From the outset, I saw much that was commendable in the forging industry of Inazuma, and it has been my great honor to befriend you all.
Niwa: So you say, Escher... But is this really the truth?
Escher: My good sir, what do you mean?
Niwa: ...I tried to resist thinking it was all connected because I didn't want to speculate, and I didn't want to believe that things could turn out this way.
Niwa: What have we gained from adopting your new technology? Ominous, black smoke, mounting production problems... Worker fatigue and casualties are up, and continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
Niwa: And recently, as you well know, someone died because of that strange filth inside the furnace. We've kept the truth from spreading outside, but still, I suspect you understand it better than I do.
Niwa: None of the people who went out to get help have come back. Now, our mutual friend, the kabukimono, is taking the golden feather to Narukami Island to seek an audience with the Shogun. This is our last hope.
Niwa: But that doesn't faze you, does it, Escher? Nothing does... Otherwise, why would you still be standing there with that smile on your face?
Escher: I'm just surprised that you finally chose to be so sincere. I'm sure you've been harboring these suspicions for quite some time.
Niwa: ...
Niwa: Mikoshi Nagamasa may have noticed that there was one common denominator among all these events... namely you, Escher. But Mr. Mikoshi is more cautious than I. He does things by the book.
Escher: After all, Nagamasa is the adopted son of Mikoshi Torachiyo, the youkai struck down by the Shogun's own hand. If he truly seeks to redeem his family's honor, an abundance of caution is well-advised.
Niwa: ...You're well-informed on the subtleties of his situation for a mechanic all the way from Fontaine. Are you sure you're not a little overqualified?
Escher: Why, Mr. Niwa, are you suggesting I find a job as a diplomat? Sadly, I am so very attached to my craft...
Niwa: Enough, Escher.
Niwa: I'm here because an evil force is raging inside the furnace, and someone needs to take your new device inside the high-risk zone so we can absorb it and put an end to the problem.
Niwa: ...I'm in charge here, and I'm about to take some responsibility and head inside, probably to my death. But what about you? What are you still doing here?
Escher: Judging from the look in your eyes, you don't seem to trust me.
Niwa: Drop the act. We're past that now. Whoever you are, it looks like your plan to destroy Tatarasuna has worked.
Niwa: I just want to know what you're still doing here. What's left? Don't you have all your answers by now?
Escher: Honestly, I'm just waiting for the right moment.
Escher: A moment like this where you finish talking and I stop you from entering the furnace.
Niwa: Argh! You, you...
Escher: ...Heh, you're a little smarter than I initially gave you credit for.
Escher: I thought I'd disguised myself exceptionally well, at least for the first few days. But to my surprise, you had your people look into my background right from the start.
Escher: It's a long journey from Inazuma to Fontaine, but that didn't stop them. Eventually, they managed to confirm that Escher was an alias, and that I was not from Fontaine at all.
Escher: And yet, despite all of that, you still fail to realize my true identity, and what I seek in Tatarasuna. Did you really think you would be able to see through my plan?
Niwa: ...Ugh... If you kill me, there's no one who can get inside the furnace... So you're really going to destroy this place... is that it?
The Doctor (Escher): Oh, but you're quite wrong — there is one other person. Hm, some may not see him as a person, but... you told him yourself: "You're not a puppet. You're a human... you're just missing a heart."
Niwa: ...!
Niwa: Whoever you're working for won't get away with this. They'll be found out. But... this makes no sense. What are you really trying to accomplish by all this? Why go to all this trouble?
The Doctor (Escher): It's no trouble at all... Patience is a virtue which I have in abundance. This is all part of a carefully controlled experiment.
The Doctor (Escher): If you must know, I am happy to divulge my true identity. I am a Fatui Harbinger. Call me "The Doctor."
Niwa: ...The... Fatui? Who... What do you want...?
The Doctor (Escher): Just to create a minor inconvenience for your nation.
Niwa: That's it? THAT's why you... gave us your cursed technology... just to let loose the evil energy from the Crystal Marrow...
The Doctor (Escher): Hehe, look how even the righteous soul is filled with venom when faced with its demise.
The Doctor (Escher): My device functions precisely as you say. It is the only chance you have of preventing a catastrophe and keeping the truth from the outside world. However... I did not make it with you in mind.
The Doctor (Escher): It is easier for a person to be possessed by evil spirits when they are filled with hate. So, give in to your fury... I want to see what happens when a malevolent heart is placed into an unsuspecting puppet.
The Doctor (Escher): Make no mistake: Even without you, that pure, innocent puppet would only end up being used by someone else instead. What other reason would a human have for befriending one who is not of our kind?
Niwa: ...*gasping for air*... *gasping for air*... *cough*
Niwa: If you give him... my heart... tell him that both Nagamasa... and I... see him as... one of us.
Niwa: He has nothing to prove to anyone... because not everyone... just wants to use other people. The only ones who think like that... are people like you...
The Doctor (Escher): What a beautiful way to see the world. It almost makes me feel a little guilty... Hm, then out of respect for you, I shall redefine myself.
The Doctor (Escher): Think of me as a monster or a demon, if you wish... At least this way, your death is not a consequence of your own folly turning you into an easy target. You simply lost to something more powerful than you could ever hope to defeat.
The Doctor (Escher): I say, Mr. Niwa, let's see what happens. Will your puppet friend become a human? No, that will prove quite impossible.
The Doctor (Escher): ...Mr. Niwa? ...Tsk, already dead. What a pity.
The Doctor (Escher): Phew...
The Doctor: Jester, I have completed the task you gave me. Creating a gap and infiltrating Inazuma's inner workings... Heh, what fun it was.
The Doctor: I'd like to introduce a puppet to you. If he proves useful, let's make him our newest comrade. And if not... let's turn him to dust.

## Talk 9

The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: Hey, are you all right?
The Balladeer: ...Dottore? Hahaha... Dottore!!!
The Balladeer: ...
The Balladeer: Good, good...
Paimon: Was that The Doctor? Did he... turn into a mechanic from Fontaine?
Traveler: I'm afraid so.
Paimon: But why did we see things from his perspective...?
Nahida: When I touched The Doctor to confirm whether he'd eliminated all his segments, I read this memory in his mind. You have to admit, it must be the truth.
The Balladeer: Maybe so... But it means nothing.
Nahida: Does it? But this memory shows that Niwa didn't betray you. He never meant for you to be the one to take the device into the furnace.
Nahida: You know very well what that means. Even more so than I.
The Balladeer: ...
Traveler: (This betrayal was a lie that he has believed for hundreds of years. Was this part of The Doctor's experiment?)
Traveler: (If the betrayal never happened... it existed only in his imagination. But where does this leave him?)
Paimon: Let's... give him some space. He looks really mad. Paimon doesn't want to be anywhere near him right now.
Traveler: Okay, let's go over there.
Nahida: (We need to give him some time to process his emotions.)
Paimon: (Paimon's still confused about the Tatarasuna incident. So The Doctor was behind it, but why has that gotten him so worked up?)
Nahida: (Nobody has ever deceived you like that, Paimon. It's natural that you find it difficult to understand. Perhaps he needed to learn this someday.)
Nahida: (So now you have the complete picture. Katsuragi took the kabukimono to live with the people of Tatarasuna. Later, The Doctor showed up, disguised as a mechanic from Fontaine... and that's when the trouble began.)
Nahida: (It was all a horrific experiment planned by The Doctor... Everything he did was just to plant seeds of disaster in Inazuma that would bear fruit in the future.)
Nahida: (Of all the unwitting participants in The Doctor's experiment, The Balladeer became the main test subject.)
Nahida: (After the events you just saw in that memory, The Doctor put Niwa's heart into the device and handed it to The Balladeer. Then, he instructed him to enter the furnace and absorb all the filth caused by the smelting process.)
Nahida: (The load was far beyond what he expected, but The Balladeer survived... He left the furnace in sheer exhaustion and said to the mechanic: "This device seems to have protected me. What's in it?")
Nahida: (The mechanic answered: "Niwa fled this place for fear of punishment, but he left you a gift. He said it's the one thing that you've been looking for... He took it straight from the chest of one of his innocent servants.")
Nahida: (The mechanic removed the withered heart from the device as he spoke.)
Nahida: (The Balladeer was stunned that such unthinkable cruelty had brought him the thing he'd been longing for his entire life. A heart acquired through cold-blooded murder is a cursed thing, but it had protected him from the filth...)
Nahida: (He thought Niwa had completely betrayed him, and yet this very betrayal had ensured his survival. Overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, The Balladeer threw the heart to the ground and left Tatarasuna without looking back.)
Paimon: (Holy moly... So The Doctor killed an innocent man and pinned everything on the victim? That's terrible...)
Traveler: (Being betrayed and abandoned by a close friend is sure to cause great resentment... Now we know what was behind his decision to take revenge on the Raiden Gokaden a hundred years ago.)
Traveler: (But it doesn't mean that vengeance was the right decision...)
Nahida: (Yes. Only if he understands this can he choose a new path forward.)
Traveler: He was the one behind the Tatarasuna incident.

## Talk 10

Sawada: Hmm, I've not given much thought to my target audience yet... Then again, this topic should appeal to readers of all ages, surely?
Aqaba: Yeah, whatever you write, it's sure to be a huge hit! Unlike my paper... Essays are a nightmare to write, and barely anyone reads them. Don't get me wrong — the topic's great, I just wish I could find more information on it...

## Talk 11

Black Screen Text: A while later...
Paimon: Sh—Shall we see how he's doing?
Paimon: Hey, you all right?
The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: That's a scary expression.
The Balladeer: ...Are you worried about me? If we didn't have such a history, I'd almost think that qualifies me to be your friend.
Traveler: We just want to make sure this doesn't affect the plan.
The Balladeer: It won't. I'll keep my end of the deal.
The Balladeer: ...
Paimon: Hey, are you investigating the stuff we wanna know about?
The Balladeer: That's why we're here.
The Balladeer: But unfortunately, there's no information about the Descenders in Irminsul.
Nahida: If even you can't find anything, that seems to confirm it: Irminsul does not keep records on the Descenders. Anyone who comes from beyond this world is not counted as part of Teyvat.
Paimon: Does that mean we have to leave empty-handed...?
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Not unexpected, but still... thank you.
The Balladeer: Don't thank me just yet.
The Balladeer: You look really upset... Heh, well, since Irminsul was a dead end, I guess I can share some other info that might interest you.
Paimon: Huh? About what?
The Balladeer: #The reason why there are records about your sister in Irminsul... It might have something to do with Khaenri'ah. Apparently, Khaenri'ah was her first destination when she arrived in this world.
The Balladeer: #Plus, she only came to this world because the heavens responded to the summoning.
Paimon: The heavens... responded?
The Balladeer: #The Jester told me this himself. You can take his word on this. He was a royal mage in Khaenri'ah, and lived with your sister for a time.
Traveler: The Jester, another Fatui Harbinger...
The Balladeer: I don't know the details. It's up to you whether you want to believe me. All I can say is, I wouldn't lie to you about this.
The Balladeer: Did you get all that, Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Nahida: Yes. Astonishing news.
The Balladeer: Does this info count towards my mission? It wasn't from Irminsul, but was it valuable?
Nahida: Very valuable.
The Balladeer: Good. In that case... I'll take some time for myself now.
Paimon: Huh? What have you done?
The Balladeer: Lesser Lord Kusanali was right: My power's all but completely spent. Even if I use all of the divine power left in me, I can't sustain this shield for very long.
The Balladeer: #Traveler, I shared a secret with you, and now you owe me. So, in return, I'd like you to answer a question for me.
Traveler: What do you want to know?
The Balladeer: Give me your hand.
Traveler: ...!
The Balladeer: (...Can you hear my voice inside your head?)
Traveler: (Are you trying to brainwash me?)
The Balladeer: (No, I can't do anything like that anymore. At most, all I can do is exchange a few words with you.)
The Balladeer: (So tell me: In this world, is it possible... to change the past?)
Traveler: (!!!)
Traveler: (Wait. Why would you ask that...?)
The Balladeer: Done.
Paimon: Huh? What the... What happened? Paimon only saw you hold hands for a second...
The Balladeer: #Nothing. I was just thanking him for helping me.
Traveler: (Wait, that look... Did he see me hesitate? But that was because I know about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...)
Traveler: (Uh-oh, I think... by not denying it immediately, I gave him the answer he needed...)
The Balladeer: So long. I suggest you get yourselves out of here quickly.
Paimon: Where are you going? Hey, wait up! Didn't you say not to go running off!?
Traveler: Balladeer! Stop!
The Balladeer: Fast reaction time. But I don't think we'll be seeing each other again.
The Balladeer: From this day forth, the names "Balladeer" and "kabukimono" will cease to exist.
The Balladeer: ...Those who died in Tatarasuna because of me deserve another chance at life.
Paimon: Hey, Balladeer! Don't do anything stupid!
The Balladeer: You know, I never did like insects. Hordes of the puny things swarming together can be a real nuisance... and I enjoy nothing more than to stamp them out like the pests they are.
The Balladeer: But if a colony of harmless ants isn't threatening anyone, I guess they deserve to be left alone... Luckily, everything can be set right. It's time to solve this once and for all.
Paimon: Balladeer! Balladeeeer!
Paimon: Uh-oh, he disappeared! C'mon, we gotta find him somehow!
Traveler: Paimon, we have to stop him!
Traveler: ...Why?

## Talk 12

Paimon: Oh no, he's really gone...
Nahida: ...Hello? Can you hear me?
Paimon: Nahida!
Nahida: #Traveler, Paimon, Balladeer, what happened just now? I was suddenly cut off by some kind of power...
Paimon: It was The Balladeer's fault! He... he shut you out.
Black Screen Text: You tell Nahida everything that happened...
Nahida: ...I didn't think he'd be capable of something like that with so little power left.
Nahida: Did he keep some of his power hidden when he was defeated? Or... did he achieve something beyond his abilities, and it took everything he had...?
Paimon: Where the heck did he go? It's all our fault, we were supposed to keep an eye on him... Sorry, Nahida...
Nahida: Don't be, it's not your fault. Please let me handle this from here, even though I'm not sure I can solve it.
Nahida: We're running out of time. Follow my lead and get out of Irminsul as soon as possible.

## Talk 13

Paimon: We're out! And we're at... uh, an inn or something?
Nahida: This is an emergency. I'll have to ask you to stay here for now. Everything's arranged, and nobody will disturb you.
Traveler: No, I want to help you!
Nahida: I'm sorry, but this isn't something I need your help with. Leave this one to me.
Paimon: An emergency? How bad is it? Nahida, will you be okay?
Nahida: Don't worry. If my assessment is correct, though there may be some minor disturbances, it won't lead to a disaster. Please rest and recover your strength here until I say it's safe.
Paimon: ...Her voice has gone.
Paimon: Paimon can't shake the feeling that something really big has happened. What do you think The Balladeer meant? And why did he suddenly grab onto you before?
Traveler: (Paimon doesn't remember Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... And The Balladeer's question was a strange one. It's hard to explain in full, and the truth might be very distressing for Paimon...)
Traveler: (I'll skip the part about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata for now, and focus on The Balladeer.)
Black Screen Text: You tell Paimon what The Balladeer asked you, and what he might have been planning...
Paimon: He wants to change the past? But... surely that's impossible.
Traveler: It's not easy, that's for sure.
Paimon: Right! You can't just rewrite history. All that stuff happened already in real life!
Paimon: It's like... Umm, imagine Paimon drank all the water in this inn. Even if no one was there to see it, Paimon would sure as heck remember drinking it.
Traveler: Yeah, great example.
Paimon: Hmm, so why does Paimon still have a bad feeling about this...? Paimon can't help but feel scared about what he might do...
Paimon: *whine* Paimon's so confused...
Traveler: Maybe he wants to erase himself from history.
Paimon: Huh!? ...Aaah!!!
Traveler: Paimon! Are you okay!?
Paimon: Sorry, Paimon accidentally, uh... Aw, it's The Balladeer's fault for causing Paimon all this mental stress!
Paimon: But erasing yourself from history...? It's unthinkable! Is that really possible in Irminsul?
Traveler: Not necessarily, but... maybe.
Paimon: ...Whew... Uh-oh, Paimon's head is overheating from trying to understand what he's up to... and it's still not working!
Paimon: Gaaah!!! Paimon's had it with that little brat! He's been nothing but trouble ever since we met him!
Paimon: There's no way he'll actually succeed, right? Otherwise... won't everyone who's connected to him be affected too?
Traveler: (Indeed. If The Balladeer does erase himself from Irminsul, many people in Inazuma will be affected... I can't imagine what that situation would look like.)
Traveler: (Worst case scenario, it will affect everyone with a connection to the Raiden Gokaden... Kazuha, Ayaka, Ayato... Will this mean that they'll disappear!?)
Paimon: There's nothing we can do about it at this point... Hey, have you got any ideas on what we should do next?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Seems like now there's nothing left for us to do but to go to sleep. But Paimon's still so worried! Paimon won't be able to sleep a wink tonight...
Traveler: Me neither.
Paimon: So how about, uh... w—we list all our favorite foods to take our mind off things? Heck, if that doesn't work, Paimon's probably gonna collapse of anxiety here.
Paimon: Alright, Paimon'll start. First dish, hmmm... Mondstadt Grilled Fish! Oh, and Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Tea Break Pancakes, Cream Stew, Sautéed Matsutake...
Paimon: ...And Jueyun Chili Chicken, Almond Tofu, Satisfying Salad...
Paimon: Ooh, ooh, also Adeptus' Temptation, Golden Shrimp Balls, Triple-Layered Consommé, Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup, and, and...
Paimon: Um... Umm...
Paimon: ...Mm? Huh...
Traveler: Paimon? What's wrong?
Paimon: Uh... What are we... Wh—What was Paimon supposed to be doing just now?
Paimon: Paimon was, um... talking...? Huh, Paimon suddenly can't remember what she was talking about. What was it, again?
Traveler: You were getting so worried about the situation with The Balladeer...
Paimon: Hmm? The Balladeer...?
Paimon: Is that a food, too? Huh... Weird name, though...
Traveler: (...!?)
Traveler: (Paimon doesn't remember The Balladeer!? That must mean... he actually pulled it off?)
Traveler: (But how did he have that ability? This doesn't make sense...)
Paimon: What's wrong? Your eyes are like saucers... Was it something Paimon said?
Traveler: No, it's nothing.
Paimon: So, The Balladeer... Is that someone's name? 'Cuz it sounds like a nickname or something.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (If this is really happening... I need to know what else has changed.)
Traveler: Paimon, come with me.
Paimon: Hmm? Okay, sure! Where are we going?
Traveler: I want to go back to Inazuma.
Paimon: Huh? Fine by Paimon, but... is everything okay? You're acting like this is an emergency.
Traveler: Now's not the time to explain...
Traveler: Let's get over there first.
Traveler: ...that you started listing foods.
Traveler: I'm just guessing here.
Traveler: Isn't there anything I can do?
