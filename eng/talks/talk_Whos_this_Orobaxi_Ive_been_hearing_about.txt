Traveler: Who's this Orobaxi I've been hearing about...
Miyazaki Saburou: The residents of Watatsumi Island worship Orobaxi, a dragon-like serpent god who guided them back in the day.
Miyazaki Saburou: Orobaxi taught them how to farm and how to smelt. Therefore, the people of Watatsumi Island are very grateful towards Orobaxi, worshipping it as their guardian deity.
Miyazaki Saburou: Later on, a great battle broke out between Orobaxi and the Electro Archon, and Orobaxi was slain in that conflict.
Miyazaki Saburou: Fort Mumei was left in the ruined state we see today because of that battle. And the Musoujin Gorge next to it was a scar left by the Electro Archon when she delivered a blow from her Musou no Hitotachi, slaying the serpent.
Miyazaki Saburou: Until now, Orobaxi's remains can still be seen on Yashiori Island. Those giant snake bones are the remnants of that god.
