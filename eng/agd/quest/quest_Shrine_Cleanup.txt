# Shrine Cleanup


## Talk 1

Neko: The shrine is getting messy again...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Neko: Meow, it is you again. Well met.
Neko: After a little neglect, the shrine's surroundings have started to collect dirt.
Neko: This is no way to greet those humans coming to pay their respects.
Neko: Could you aid me in cleaning up the shrine, as you did before?
Traveler: Don't you have Taisuke and Etsuko around?
Neko: I... will not speak to those two green humans of my own accord.
Neko: The tall human always looks upon me with a strange gaze...
Neko: And the other green human never seems particularly... motivated?
Neko: Meow meow, regardless, they are not reliable humans.
Neko: Whatever the case, I can only rely on you for this task. Just use the long stick and the water to clean up.
Traveler: I've got it.
Neko: Whatever the case, I shall leave this to you. I...
Neko: I will wait for you here, meow meow.
Traveler: I got you, more or less.
Traveler: Well, you could ask Mr. Ooshima...
Neko: The stone human is always busy with his knock-knock-knocking. Who knows what he is doing.
Neko: The stone was knocked, after all. What is he knocking this time, I wonder... How annoying...

## Talk 2

Neko: In any case, the cleanup shall be left to you. I will wait for you here, meow meow.

## Talk 3

Neko: Mm, have you finished this "cleanup" business?
Traveler: We sure have.
Neko: Meow meow, that is good. You are indeed very reliable.
Neko: The shrine certainly looks the part now. Ah, Hibiki will be pleased when she returns.
Neko: I must continue taking good care of this shrine... Meow meow...
