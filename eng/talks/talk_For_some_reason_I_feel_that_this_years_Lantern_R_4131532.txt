Changshun: For some reason, I feel that this year's Lantern Rite will be particularly magnificent.
Changshun: I was originally planning to stock up on extra materials for making Xiao Lanterns and resell them for a profit during Lantern Rite.
Changshun: But just as I was about to purchase the materials, I found out that Ningguang had instated laws against price gouging on Xiao Lantern materials.
Changshun: If it weren't for Ningguang, I might have never realized what a shameful business scheme that was.
Changshun: So given that I couldn't make any money on the materials anyway, I decided to just give my remaining Xiao Lantern materials to Yi Zhu and Yi Xian.
Changshun: I hope that they will enjoy a lovely Lantern Rite this year.
