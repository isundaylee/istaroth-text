# The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout


## Talk 1

Arama: #I will become a smart Aranara, just like Nara Traveler!

## Talk 2

Paimon: We now have the second Vasoma Fruit!
Arama: #Impressive! Nara Traveler is not afraid of Marana and even drove all the monsters away. No wonder you could defeat Vanagni!
Paimon: Hehe, the many adventures we've been through aren't just for show, y'know?
Arama: #That's great! Then Nara Traveler and Paimon must have many memories and stories, right?
Traveler: We do have a great many, yes.
Arama: #I see. If you don't mind, we'd love to hear Nara Traveler and Paimon's stories sometime.
Paimon: Sure! We've shared our stories with others before, though it feels like so long ago...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon saw a giant purple tree in the distance while we were in the Vasara Tree's dream. Paimon's pretty sure we saw it in Vanarana, too. What was that?
Arama: That's the very first Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams. Hmm, how should I put this...
Arama: Dreams are like leaves in a stream. They soon float away with the water. If you want to keep a dream in place, you have to let it grow roots. That way, the dream won't drift away.
Arama: Hmm... it's so hard to explain...
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams is like their "roots"?
Arama: #Nara Traveler is smart. This tree keeps Aranara's dreams stable. Aranara can enter or exit dreams and are able to connect with the Vasara Tree.
Paimon: So that's how it is. Do you mean, then, that the Vanarana in dreams can be maintained because of that tree?
Arama: It is because of the Tree of Dreams. But I'm very concerned about Marana right now. We'll have to come up with a plan later.
Arama: ...
Arama: #But let's get the Bija first! We need to help the friend of Nara Traveler, Paimon, and Arana!
Paimon: Yeah! Will you be looking for other Ashvattha's Concourses after this, Arama?
Arama: Yes! So we'll see each other again for sure!
Paimon: Stay safe, Arama!
Arama: #You too, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams keeps dreams from drifting away?
Traveler: Eh, we do have some.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Arama! Here we are again!
Arama: #Yes! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Hello! This is Arasudraka.
Arasudraka: #Ooh! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Nice to meet you! The Golden Nara is tall and strong, just like the song says!
Paimon: Paimon's really happy to meet you, too! Is Arasudraka a friend of yours, Arama?
Arama: Yes! Arasudraka is a "song gatherer" and often goes to collect all sorts of songs.
Arama: Before seeds became saplings, we hid in the leaves together and went to the Dendro Archon's big tree. We watched the Nara sing as they drank water that made them turn silly!
Arasudraka: #Nara Traveler and Paimon, do you know any songs?
Paimon: Songs... If it were that green fellow, he should know plenty of them!
Arasudraka: The green fellow? What's that? A Dusk Bird? A Shroomboar?
Paimon: No, no! He is the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt, and also a bard.
Arasudraka: Wow! Then he must know a lot of songs!
Arama: Amazing! The Anemo Archon must be able to blow the songs to faraway places with the wind!
Paimon: Yep! Speaking of which, is this one of Ashvattha's Concourses?
Arama: No, it is not. But it is a great discovery nonetheless. Here lies a song that we Aranara have been unable to find for many, many years.
Arama: Aranara song gatherers always pursue the beauty of songs. At the end of time, they will leave behind a song that belongs only to themselves.
Traveler: Does this have anything to do with Ashvattha's Concourses?
Arasudraka: Seems like here is a song left by Aramaha. If it's true, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby!
Paimon: Paimon remembers Araja saying something about the Vasara Trees... Let Paimon check the Aranyaka real quick...
Paimon: #Vasara Trees bear Vasoma Fruits! We should help them, Traveler!
Arama: Yay! I get to study songs of the past with Nara!
Arasudraka: Aramaha loves this type of rose, but it was Arayama who discovered the way to hide songs in roses! Arayama was proud, so Arayama's roses are proud, too.
Arasudraka: So the roses won't tell us. Only a smart Aranara, or maybe a smart Nara, can find the hidden song. But Arasudraka is not smart enough...
Paimon: #Don't worry! Hehe, Traveler is very smart!
Traveler: Since it's for Rana...
Paimon: Yup! And anyway, finding stuff is what we do best!
Traveler: Right.
Traveler: Best of luck to you.
Arama: #Thank you, Nara Traveler! This seems to be the song left by Aramaha. If it's true, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby. We lucked out!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Arama! Here we are again!
Arama: #Yes! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Hello! This is Arasudraka.
Arasudraka: #Ooh! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Nice to meet you! The Golden Nara is tall and strong, just like the song says!
Paimon: Paimon's really happy to meet you, too! Is Arasudraka a friend of yours, Arama?
Arama: Yes! Arasudraka is also a song gatherer.
Arama: Before the seeds became saplings, we hid in the leaves together and went to the big tree of Lesser Lord Kusanali to watch Nara sing as they drank water that made them become silly!
Arasudraka: #Nara Traveler and Paimon, do you know any songs?
Paimon: Songs... If it were that green fellow, he should know plenty of them!
Arasudraka: The green fellow? What's that? A Dusk Bird? A Shroomboar?
Paimon: No, no! He is the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt, and also a bard.
Arasudraka: Wow! Then he must know a lot of songs!
Arama: Amazing! The Anemo Archon must be able to blow the songs to faraway places with the wind!
Paimon: Yep! Speaking of which, is there any song hidden here, too?
Arasudraka: This seems to be the song left by Aramaha. So there should be a Vasara Tree nearby!
Paimon: #Which means we'll be able to collect a Vasoma Fruit... Let's offer some help, too, Traveler!
Arama: Yay! I get to study songs of the past with Nara!
Arasudraka: Aramaha loves this type of rose, but it was Arayama who discovered the way to hide songs in roses! Arayama was proud, so Arayama's roses are proud, too.
Arasudraka: So the roses won't tell us. Only a smart Aranara, or maybe a smart Nara, can find the hidden song. But Arasudraka is not smart enough...
Paimon: #Don't worry! Hehe, Traveler is very smart!
Traveler: Since it's for Rana...
Paimon: Yep! Leave it to us!
Traveler: I really am very smart.

## Talk 5

Arasudraka: "Come, come, dreams of the sprouts, memories of the leaves..."
Arama: "Look, shining pomegranates, glowing Sunsettias..."
Arama: I see. Aranaga's song and Aramaha's song have the same source...
Paimon: What do you mean, the same source...?
Arasudraka: Songs are like rivers. They derive from the same origin, the "Sourcesong." She is the home to all songs and the source of all great rivers.
Arasudraka: Then, it changes when it is sung for different memories and different stories, just like how a great river diverges into creeks.
Arasudraka: Just like all the creeks eventually flow into the sea, all the songs eventually converge into one, into the Sourcesong.
Arasudraka: #So Aranara song gatherers have to find all the songs. That way, we can find the Sourcesong. Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon, for finding Aramaha's song.
Traveler: What an impressive aspiration.
Arasudraka: #Thank you, Nara Traveler!
Paimon: Hmm... Songs will keep growing in numbers and changing along the way, so how can all the songs be found?
Arasudraka: And so will Aranara. So, if we keep doing our best, there will be no problem!
Arama: Aramaha's song can attract Healthy Dendrograna. His Ashvattha's Concourse should be sealed in the same way.
Arama: #Nara Traveler found his song, which means we can get to Ashvattha's Concourse right away!
Arasudraka: #Yes! Good luck, Nara Traveler, Paimon, and Arama! I'm going to get ready for Festival Utsava!
Paimon: Leave it to us! See you at Festival Utsava, Arasudraka!
Arasudraka: Bye!
Traveler: But songs will keep growing in numbers...

## Talk 6

Traveler: I still need a moment.
Arama: I'll wait for you.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Is this... the Vasara Tree? Doesn't seem as lively as Paimon imagined...
Arama: Yes, Aramaha resisted very hard, and kept Marana under control to the side. If not, the nearby forest would have become even more terrible.
Arama: All the leaves would fall and rot on the ground. The mushrooms would all become angry Fungi, and the birds and beasts would also lie down and return to the ground, leaving only hard white things behind.
Paimon: Sounds really scary...
Arama: #Yes, but thanks to Nara Traveler and Paimon, Marana has become a lot less troubling!
Arama: If it were just Arama alone, it wouldn't have worked at all. I am too young and don't have many memories, so I am not as powerful as other Aranara.
Arama: #But with memories of adventuring together with Nara Traveler and Paimon, my powers will grow!
Traveler: The same goes for us.
Paimon: Yeah! Friends go on adventures together! That's the spirit!
Arama: First, we must enter his dream to destroy Marana's lingering influence.
Paimon: Wait a second... When you say "his dream," you mean that of the Vasara Tree?
Arama: That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
Traveler: What's next?

## Talk 8

Traveler: (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)

## Talk 9

Paimon: So this is...
Arama: Yes. This is a Vasoma Fruit.
Arama: It is the accumulation of the dreams and memories gathered by the Vasara Tree. It's a precious fruit that can help us restore our strength.
Arama: A large amount of energy must be consumed for the Ashvattha Tree to produce a Bija. That is why we must offer Vasoma Fruits.
Arama: #Keep the Vasoma Fruit safe, Nara Traveler!
Paimon: Hmm. You know what? Let's teach Arama the meaning of "treasure"!
Paimon: Now then! "Treasure" refers to something very precious. This Vasoma Fruit contains lots of dreams and memories, and it can restore an Aranara's power. That makes it pretty rare and amazing, right?
Paimon: For things like Vasoma Fruits that are rare and precious, we call them "treasure"!
Arama: Ah, so this is what treasure means... I got it! Thank you, Paimon!
Traveler: So, what's next?
Paimon: Hmm... Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?
Arama: #That's right. I'll do my best to find them! So long, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: See you later, Arama!
Traveler: Thanks, Paimon!
Paimon: What are you thanking Paimon for...? Anyway, Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?

## Talk 10

Paimon: Paimon didn't expect Marana's corruption to be here too...
Arama: #Nara Traveler is amazing. You drove Marana away easily this time, too.
Arama: Aramaha resisted very hard to keep Marana to the side. Without his help, things would have been worse in the nearby forests.
Arama: All the leaves would fall and rot on the ground. The mushrooms would all become angry Fungi, and the birds and beasts would lie down and return to the ground, leaving only hard, white things behind.
Paimon: Sounds really scary...
Arama: #Yes, but thanks to Nara Traveler and Paimon, Marana has become a lot less troubling!
Arama: If it were just Arama alone, it wouldn't have worked at all. I am too young and don't have many memories, so I am not as powerful as other Aranara.
Arama: #But with memories of adventuring together with Nara Traveler and Paimon, my powers will grow!
Traveler: Do we need to enter the dream of the Vasara Tree this time too?
Arama: Yes. We must erase all traces of Marana's influence.
Arama: That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 11

Paimon: Next up, our third Vasoma Fruit!
Traveler: Let's do this for the Bija...
Arama: There's also Marana here, but Aramaha resisted very hard and kept Marana under control to the side. If not, the nearby forest would have become even more terrible.
Arama: All the leaves would fall and rot on the ground. The mushrooms would all become angry Fungi, and the birds and beasts would lie down and return to the ground, leaving only hard, white things behind.
Paimon: Sounds really scary...
Arama: #Yes, but thanks to Nara Traveler and Paimon, Marana has become a lot less troubling!
Arama: If it were just Arama alone, it wouldn't have worked at all. I am too young and don't have many memories, so I am not as powerful as other Aranara.
Arama: #But with memories of adventuring together with Nara Traveler and Paimon, my powers will grow!
Traveler: Let's go.
Arama: If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
Traveler: Let's do this for Rana...

## Talk 12

Arama: #Nara Traveler, if you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

### Additional Talk 1

Arasudraka: #Nara Traveler is very smart! That's great!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: We got the third Vasoma Fruit! According to Araja, three Vasoma Fruits should be enough, right?
Arama: #Yes, that will do. Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: You're welcome.
Paimon: Still, you were the one helping us throughout, Arama. So why are you thanking us?
Arama: Well... It's because you are helping Arana, and Arana is my friend. So, thank you.
Arama: #And Nara Traveler has helped Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka find the ancient songs. They're my friends too. Thank you for that, too.
Arama: #Finally, I'm so happy that I got to go on adventures with Nara Traveler and Paimon. So, thanks for that as well.
Paimon: Paimon had a good time too! Thank you, Arama!
Paimon: By the way, there are many signs of activity around Ashvattha's Concourses... Is there some story behind that?
Arama: That's a story from long, long ago. I wasn't even a seed then. It was a time when all Nara could see Aranara and not a single Aranara was afraid of Nara.
Arama: #Back then, Nara and Aranara helped each other. They played and sang together, just like Nara Traveler and I.
Arama: Song gatherers like Arayasa originally learned their craft from Nara.
Arama: Ashvattha's Concourses used to be where Nara and Aranara played together. But that was a long time ago.
Arama: After the horrible, horrible catastrophe occurred, Vanarana was devastated, and the concourses were left desolate...
Paimon: So that's what happened...
Arama: Yes, and it's a very scary tale indeed. I'm lucky that they are not memories to me — only stories.
Paimon: #Don't worry! Things will get better. Right, Traveler?
Traveler: That's right.
Arama: We've found Ashvattha's Concourses and obtained three Vasoma Fruits. Next, I've got to help prepare for Festival Utsava and call some of my friends back from the forest.
Paimon: Best of luck, Arama! Paimon's super looking forward to the festival!
Arama: Me too! I'll see you guys soon!
Paimon: Bye, Arama!
Traveler: I wouldn't be too sure...
Paimon: #...Are you tired, Traveler?
Traveler: You've been the one helping us...
