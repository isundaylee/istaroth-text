Traveler: Are you enjoying your stay?
Nacker: Of course. Here, I don't have to ponder over complex technical issues or constantly be forced to recall each and every step of painfully precise operations.
Nacker: More importantly, I don't have to deal with those short-sighted, arrogant fools.
Nacker: Based on those few facets alone, the Fortress of Meropide is vastly preferable to the Fontaine Research Institute.

Nacker: Oh, and I noticed that Jurieu fellow managed to build the Wingalet. He does seem to have some talent.
Nacker: Mr. Edwin's assistant has completed a significant undertaking, while Edwin himself remains where he started, empty-handed and frustrated.
Nacker: Hahahahaha! Serves you right, Edwin!

Traveler: You fooled everyone in the Central Laboratory.
Nacker: Yes, and I have to thank you once again. Without your cooperation, which you gave freely, I would have never figured out how to discreetly send that reporter lady packing.
Nacker: Still, I underestimated Raimondo's perspicacity. I never expected him to be able to uncover the truth, least of all in a situation like that.

Traveler: What did Concini promise you?
Nacker: I don't give a hoot about his promises. I just don't want the Institute to terminate the Arkhium research project.
Nacker: Countless people put their hearts and souls into it, myself included. It's just a step away from fruition!
Nacker: If they pull the plug now, all of our magnificent research will have been for nothing!
Nacker: Raimondo, that fool, he's far too conservative! All he cares about is securing his own career. He couldn't care less about the state of the Institute.

Traveler: And you're just looking out for your own interests.
Nacker: It's my research too! Do you have any idea how much effort I put into helping create the Arkhium Kinetic Core? Why can't I look out for my own interests, like the rest of you?
Nacker: Am I supposed to meekly submit to Choiseul's will and give up on Arkhium, just like that?
Nacker: All just to focus on mind-numbingly tedious contraptions like Mekafish, Fonta, and the like? I'd rather die!
Nacker: Talking about this now is an exercise in futility, anyway. I no longer have any ties to the Fontaine Research Institute.
Nacker: Arkhium, the Arkhium Kinetic Core, the future Fontaine Research Institute... Whatever. Let it all be.
Nacker: My research days are over.
