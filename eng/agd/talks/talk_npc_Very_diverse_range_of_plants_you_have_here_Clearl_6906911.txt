Tighnari: Very diverse range of plants you have here. Clearly, you have a keen interest in botany.
Tighnari: Excellent. If nurtured, a budding interest can become a fruitful source of knowledge. In fact â€” why don't you tell me about each of these species? Their growth habits, preferences, et cetera?
Tighnari: Don't worry, I'm here to fill in anything you leave out. I have a feeling it'll stick in your memory this time.
