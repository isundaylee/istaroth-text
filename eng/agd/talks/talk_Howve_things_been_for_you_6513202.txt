Traveler: How've things been for you?
Sonny: I hope you're right! While there's always something unpleasant to deal with, as we say in Fontaine, "that's life."
Sonny: Don't you think so, dear Luca?
Luca: Life? Hmph!
Sonny: You see? Luca's wit is as electrifying as ever. I'm overjoyed to hear him answer your question so concisely.
