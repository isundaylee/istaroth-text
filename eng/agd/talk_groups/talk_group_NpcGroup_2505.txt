Chan Baatjan: Really good food doesn't need to be ranked. There's no need to feel inferior, but no place for arrogance, either.

Traveler: True gourmet cuisine?
Chan Baatjan: It seems you are a fellow seeker and lover of the finest cuisine and daintiest of delicacies as well.
Chan Baatjan: I am Chan Baatjan. I won't claim to be the best chef in Yilong Wharf, but I have never disrespected the original flavors of my ingredients and always cooked every dish with great care.
Chan Baatjan: Unfortunately, I do not often cook anymore, but these days am more akin to a very picky wandering gourmand.
Chan Baatjan: Someone who's just busy in the kitchen all day has quite limited influence in the end.
Chan Baatjan: Thus, over the past few years, I've taken in a dozen or so students and taught them everything I know.
Chan Baatjan: Now, some of them have graduated. The owner of Lianfang Dim Sum and the head chef for Jiulue Teahouse were both my prized pupils.
Chan Baatjan: You should try out their creations. May you find the offerings to your taste!

Traveler: Did you run into some kind of trouble?
Chan Baatjan: Thank you for the kind words, my friend.
Chan Baatjan: I'm not in trouble or anything. This is just something that's been on my mind.
Chan Baatjan: Yilong Wharf faces Lumidouce Harbor, and so we receive a lot of merchants from Fontaine. In time, this place has become a melting pot of cultures and cuisines.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs had never had Fontainian food, and praised it to the high heavens upon first tasting its novelty.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs grew arrogant, on the other hand, when they saw that Fontainian diners loved Liyue's food, so they started claiming that Liyue has the best food anywhere.

Traveler: What do you think?
Chan Baatjan: From my perspective, neither is the right approach. You can substitute Fontainian cuisine for that which comes from other nations, and what I said would still stand.
Chan Baatjan: No two people have the same preferences, so there is no single dish that will earn the praise of every single person.
Chan Baatjan: It's the same as in literature. What's the point of fighting for the empty title of "the best"?
Chan Baatjan: As a chef, one should be humble when looking at new dishes, deconstructing them to learn the ingredients and the skills required to cook them.
Chan Baatjan: We should not blindly praise something that wasn't based on local ingredients, or be intentionally conservative, stalling progress thereby.
Chan Baatjan: Of course, these are just empty words. All I can do is point this out to my students, so they will always remember that they're chefs who strive to make better dishes.
Chan Baatjan: They should also communicate with their colleagues, learning new ideas and doing away with bad ones.
