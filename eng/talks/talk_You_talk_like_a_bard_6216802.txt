# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You talk like a bard.
You Jun: "Like" nothing! I shall soon be a bard, for sooth!
You Jun: Thanks to you, this place no longer requires the services of so many Millelith.
You Jun: I should have been transferred back to Liyue Harbor, but I've found what I want to do.
You Jun: And what is that, you ask? Why, it is to follow Master Taliesin and cause songs and ballads to resound on the winds throughout Liyue.
