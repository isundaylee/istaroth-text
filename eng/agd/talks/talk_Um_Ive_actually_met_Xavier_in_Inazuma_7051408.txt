Traveler: Um... I've actually met Xavier in Inazuma...
Black Screen Text: You tell Félix Yogue about your experiences with Xavier in Tatarasuna...
Félix Yogue: Ah, fabulous, fabulous! "Tatara Tales" shall make Xavier, bless his heart, famous overnight. Mark my words!
Félix Yogue: ...But honestly, I am just really relieved. I thought he might've, you know...
Félix Yogue: That said, since things have been dealt with, why hasn't he even sent one letter back...?
Félix Yogue: Whatever, I'll send a letter back to Petrichor later to tell Mécantre the news, so that he can stop worrying...
