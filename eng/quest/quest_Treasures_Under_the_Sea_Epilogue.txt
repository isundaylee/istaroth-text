# Treasures Under the Sea: Epilogue

Ulman: Ancient Iron Coins... Ancient Iron Coins... Nice, very nice!
Ulman: #With so many Ancient Iron Coins, I'm sure I can make a pretty pile of Mora! Thanks a ton, Traveler and Paimon.
Traveler: What do you plan on doing next?
Ulman: Of course, I'm going to... think of a way to exchange these Ancient Iron Coins for Mora, or other convenient and useful items.
Ulman: But seriously, I really don't want to get tangled up with that middleman from before. He takes a huge cut every time.
Ulman: Not only that, but it takes forever for him to get my money to me. I haven't got a clue what he's doing...
Ulman: But... Other than him, I simply can't find anyone reliable to work with... *sigh*
Ulman: Enough of that! These are for you, consider it a bonus for our fruitful long-term cooperation.
Ulman: Once my business here in Fontaine is over, I'll need to think carefully about my next steps. I can't just keep traveling, that's way too tiring...
