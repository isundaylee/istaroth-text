Traveler: About Shalmar...
Banu: You want to know about Shalmar? Well, Shalmar is Shalmar, can't cook meals, can't sweep floors, just another terrible adult.
Banu: He's either writing reports in his study at home, or working at the Akademiya.
Banu: I remember he's one of those Spantamad researchers. But his job is so vastly different from that of those amazing traveling scholars who are always on the road.
Banu: He told me that he just sorts out old stuff in a dark warehouse every day, which isn't cool at all. And no one would play with him and that's just sad.
Banu: So whenever he's bored, I hang out with him, and we come up with all kinds of settings. Someone's got to keep him company and play with him.
