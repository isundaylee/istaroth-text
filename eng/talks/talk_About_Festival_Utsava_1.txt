Traveler: About Festival Utsava...
Arakunti: #We meet again, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arakunti: #Nara {NICKNAME} is singing at Festival Utsava, right? That must sound like sunshine and moonlight mixed together, sky and water pool overlapping, and dewdrops and raindrops shaking hands.
Arakunti: #Sing with Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon. No slacking off.
