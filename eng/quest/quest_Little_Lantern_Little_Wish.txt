# Little Lantern, Little Wish


## Talk 1

Mengmeng: Xiao Lanterns are soooo hard to make...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Mengmeng: Do you know how to make Xiao Lanterns? I keep trying but I can't do it...
Mengmeng: Through the hole, then back around, and then... I drop it. Or it breaks.
Mengmeng: I really wanted to make a Xiao Lantern for Yu...
Mengmeng: Yu always has to look after the tea shop, so he never has any time to play or to make a lantern.
Mengmeng: But I bet he still has a wish. So I wanna make a lantern for him...
Traveler: I can make one for you.
Mengmeng: But, but... I wanted to be the one to make it for him...
Mengmeng: And, and... I wanna know the secrets to making them so I can tell Yu, too.
Mengmeng: Could you... teach me how to make them?
Traveler: Sure.
Mengmeng: Yay!
Mengmeng: So, so... Then the Xiao Lantern is ready, right?
Mengmeng: Thanks! I'm gonna go make one for Yu now!
Traveler: I'll make one for him.

## Talk 2

Yu: H—Hi... Sir or Madam, um, um... Please put your feet up, and please have some tea, and...
Traveler: We're here to give you a Xiao Lantern.
Yu: ...Really?
Mengmeng: Yu, the Xiao Lantern's for you.
Yu: Mengmeng? Oh, did you make this...? Wow... thank you...
Mengmeng: #This nice man taught me how to make them. Actually, it's one of my first, so I didn't do a great job... D—Do you like it...?
Yu: Are you kidding? It's great, I love it! I was just starting to worry when I'd have the time to make one for myself...
Yu: Thanks, Mengmeng. I'll find someone to hang it on my door in a bit.
Traveler: Hang it up? What for?
Yu: Well, the thing is... My dad's not in great health, so he can't hang it up for me. And I'm too short, so I wouldn't be able to reach...
Yu: So, if I wanna hang it on the door, I gotta ask someone around here if they can help...
Traveler: We can help.
Yu: Really? You sure you don't mind helping? ...That's great, thanks! Now I don't need to worry about who'd watch the shop if I went off looking for someone to help...
Traveler: Let us help.
Traveler: Can't someone in your family help?

## Talk 3

Yu: #This Xiao Lantern looks so pretty! Thanks so much, Sir!
Mengmeng: Come on, Yu... Let's go and play. I know a great place with the prettiest flowers.
Mengmeng: #This nice man taught me how to make Xiao Lanterns, and when we get there I can teach you, too. C'mon, wouldn't that be great?
Yu: I, uh... I can't. I need to watch the shop. Even though there's no customers, I've gotta keep the place spick and span, just like my dad always says.
Mengmeng: Okay, well... Scrap the Xiao Lanterns, how about we just go there, have a quick chat, then come back straight away? That way, it won't waste too much of your time.
Yu: But...
Traveler: I can clean the shop for you.
Yu: ...Oh? Y—You sure? That, uh... That's asking a lot of you...
Mengmeng: We'll be really quick, we'll just go straight there and come straight back. Promise it won't take too long!
Mengmeng: Thanks soooo much!
Traveler: Leave the cleaning to me.

## Talk 4

Paimon: It looks like the two of them are still playing. Guess we don't have to worry.
Paimon: But given the atmosphere... Maybe we shouldn't disturb them.
Traveler: I wanna eavesdrop on them...
Mengmeng: If we made a garland for your dad, do you think he'd get better quicker?
Yu: I... I don't know...
Mengmeng: I read in a book that if you stay happy, even if you get sick, you'll get better really quickly.
Mengmeng: I think that you're so grown-up, the way you help your dad watch the shop every day... And I'm sure that must make him very happy.
Yu: But sometimes he tells me off... "Stop lounging around in the shop, go off and play"...
Yu: "If you don't go and play with Mengmeng, she'll pick the whole neighborhood bare of flowers"...
Mengmeng: That would never happen, there's soooo many flowers around here... Wait a second, I'll make a garland for you.
Yu: Thanks, Mengmeng. I should be getting back.
Mengmeng: Huh, okay... Well, once your dad's recovered, you'll have more time, right? Then I can come play with you again...
Yu: Yep, I'm sure dad will make a quick recovery...
Yu: What the...!? Wh—When did you get here?
Traveler: Only just arrived.
Yu: Uhh... Uhhhh... I—I...
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite.
Mengmeng: Happy Lantern Rite to you, too!
Yu: Ha—Happy Lantern Rite...
Yu: Um, well, thanks for your help. Please take these as a thank-you. Dad says that you should always give people something in return for their help.
Yu: Let's head back to the shop... Come on, Mengmeng.
Mengmeng: Yep, let's head back. Thanks again!
Traveler: I heard nothing.
Traveler: I'm gonna eavesdrop on them.
