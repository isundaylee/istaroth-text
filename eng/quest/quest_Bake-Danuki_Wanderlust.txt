# Bake-Danuki Wanderlust


## Talk 1

Paimon: Eh? What's a bake-danuki doing on this island?
Mamesuke: Mm... Shibasuke...
Paimon: Eh? Did that bake-danuki speak?
Mamesuke: Eek! Yellow Fur and... Flying White Fur?
Paimon: Hey! You're just like Kichiboushi! Anyway, it's not Flying White Fur. The name's Paimon!
Mamesuke: Paimora? Paimora knows Kichiboushi? Paimora, amazing!
Paimon: Not Paimora, Paimon...! So, Kichiboushi is that famous now, huh? His training must be going well!
Mamesuke: Bye... mon...?
Paimon: Ugh, forget it... Wait! Why are we suddenly able to understand bake-danuki?
Paimon: Ioroi once mentioned that bake-danuki can understand humans, but we can't understand them.
Paimon: We could understand Kichiboushi before because we'd had a bake-danuki meal, but its effects didn't last that long...
Traveler: These islands have always been really unusual.
Paimon: Yeah... It's almost like nothing strange is strange here!
Mamesuke: Mm... Shibasuke can't find...
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon's getting confused. You mean you're Shibasuke, and you're searching for something?
Mamesuke: Mmm... Dumb White Fur...
Traveler: So you got separated from Shibasuke. Is that it?
Mamesuke: Mm! Smart Yellow Fur! Mamesuke grateful!
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon's got this one! It says its name is Mamesuke!
Traveler: Ooh, bravo. Bye-mon bravo.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! You too!?
Paimon: Anyway, how did you get here, Mamesuke?
Mamesuke: Playing with Shibasuke on unfamiliar boat.
Mamesuke: Sleepy... Woke up! Lots of people!
Mamesuke: Lots of wind on fists.
Mamesuke: Big cold person.
Traveler: That sounds mighty like the Fatui.
Mamesuke: ...The Fatty?
Mamesuke: Leave ship and wait in cave. Fatty leave.
Mamesuke: Shibasuke find way home, mountain kaboom!
Paimon: Mountain kaboom? Oh! Is he referring to the mountains switching...
Paimon: #What do we do, {NICKNAME}? Are we responsible for Shibasuke going missing?
Traveler: Well, guess we'll have to take responsibility and help Mamesuke search.
Paimon: Yeah, but how? ... Oh, Paimon knows what to do! Let's look for clues with your <color=#00E1FFFF>Elemental Sight</color>!
Traveler: What do you mean "we"? All I hear are bake-danuki noises.
Paimon: Huh? Has some strange ability awakened within Paimon? Is Paimon the Tanuki Whisperer now? ... Nah, that can't be it!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Eh? What's a bake-danuki doing on this island?
Mamesuke: Mm... Shibasuke...
Paimon: Eh? Did that bake-danuki speak?
Mamesuke: Eek! Yellow Fur and... Flying White Fur?
Paimon: That's "Paimon" to you, not "Flying White Fur" or anything!
Mamesuke: Paimora?
Paimon: Not Paimora! Pai... mon...!
Mamesuke: Bye... mon...?
Paimon: Ugh, forget it... Wait! Why are we suddenly able to understand bake-danuki?
Traveler: These islands have always been really unusual.
Paimon: Yeah... It's almost like nothing strange is strange here!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Eh? What's a bake-danuki doing on this island?
Traveler: A bake-danuki?
Paimon: #Oh, {NICKNAME}, you've never seen one before? They're called bake-danuki!
Paimon: It is said that they enjoy disguising themselves and pulling pranks on people in Inazuma's forests.
Mamesuke: Mm... Shibasuke...
Paimon: Eh? Did that bake-danuki speak?
Mamesuke: Eek! Yellow Fur and... Flying White Fur?
Paimon: That's "Paimon" to you, not "Flying White Fur" or anything!
Mamesuke: Paimora?

Paimon: Huh? Has some strange ability awakened within Paimon? Is Paimon the Tanuki Whisperer now? ... Nah, that can't be it!
Traveler: So bake-danuki can't speak?
Paimon: They usually can't! It must be these unusual islands...

## Talk 4

Mamesuke: Mm... Shibasuke...

## Talk 5

Paimon: It's a leaf that contains the power of Anemo. Huh, speaking of those...
Traveler: It's a leaf from the Mondstadt-styled mountain...
Paimon: Yeah, but now a leaf covered in Anemo has found its way to an Inazuma-styled mountain, and Shibasuke is missing. That means...
Traveler: Shibasuke might be on the Mondstadt-styled mountain.
Paimon: Well, since we've found a clue, let's head back to Mamesuke!

## Talk 6

Shibasuke: Yellow Fur kapow! Fly high, can't learn... Mm...
Paimon: You can't? Oh well, but this still counts as a way to enter a wind current...
Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Paimon: It's a Sunsettia. Actually, both of them grow on Cuihua Wood, but the fruit varies according to the location!
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with soil and climate.
Paimon: Yeah, it's thundering all day over there in Inazuma...
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with Archon preferences.
Paimon: Would Ei enjoy a Lavender Melon? It's pretty hard to imagine that happening...

## Talk 7

Paimon: We're back!
Mamesuke: Shibasuke?
Paimon: Well... We haven't found Shibasuke yet...
Mamesuke: Mmmm...
Paimon: #Hey! Cheer up! We may not have found Shibasuke, but we've found a clue! Right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Yeah, we just need another mountain kaboom.
Mamesuke: Mountain kaboom!
Paimon: Hmm... We can't leave you alone here, Mamesuke, so come with us!
Mamesuke: Mm!

## Talk 8

Mamesuke: Mountain kaboom! ...Shibasuke?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Eh? Isn't that Mamesuke? What's Mamesuke doing here?
Shibasuke: Eek! White Fur! Shoo!
Paimon: Eh? Is that Shibasuke? It looks just like Mamesuke...
Traveler: The bake-danuki of Inazuma are really difficult to tell apart...
Paimon: Except Kichiboushi. He sure stands out from the crowd!
Shibasuke: Kichiboushi? Lie!
Paimon: We took Kichiboushi to train all across the lands! We were there when Ioroi told Kichiboushi to never stray from the tanuki path, you know? Hehe.
Shibasuke: Ioroi? White Fur lie! Shoo!
Paimon: Hmm... You're Shibasuke, right? Stop trying to get rid of us, Mamesuke sent us to find you.
Shibasuke: ...Mamesuke? Really?
Paimon: Of course! Come with us. Mamesuke is waiting for you!
Shibasuke: Hmph! White Fur lie?
Paimon: Argh! He's so infuriating! He would be bake-danuki paste now if it wasn't for us!
Paimon: They both look the same, so why is Shibasuke so stubborn...
Paimon: Whew... that was difficult. We should have asked Mamesuke for proof.
Shibasuke: Steal?
Paimon: Gah, Shibasuke is so suspicious of everything.
Traveler: A little vigilance never hurts when you're out of doors.
Paimon: Eh? Come on, Paimon's super friendly-looking.
Paimon: But the bake-danuki of Inazuma should be skilled at transforming. Shibasuke could've transformed into a butterfly or something and flown away just now, right?
Shibasuke: Hmph! Dumb White Fur! Bake-danuki transformation not easy.
Paimon: Eh? But bake-danuki who can transform into things like barrels and lamps can be seen all over Inazuma.
Shibasuke: Mmm, not same.
Paimon: How is it different?
Shibasuke: Mm... White Fur talk too much! Won't understand...
Shibasuke: Where Mamesuke...
Paimon: Looks like Shibasuke isn't willing to talk anymore... Let's just take him back to Mamesuke!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Eh? Isn't that Mamesuke? What's Mamesuke doing here?
Shibasuke: Eek! White Fur! Shoo!
Paimon: Eh? Is that Shibasuke? It looks just like Mamesuke...
Paimon: Hmm... You're Shibasuke, right? Stop trying to get rid of us, Mamesuke sent us to find you.
Shibasuke: ...Mamesuke? Really?

Shibasuke: Hmph! Dumb White Fur! Bake-danuki transformation not easy.
Paimon: Eh? But Paimon's heard that bake-danuki who can transform into things like barrels and lamps can be seen all over Inazuma.
Shibasuke: Mmm, not same.
Paimon: How is it different?
Shibasuke: Mm... White Fur talk too much! Won't understand...
Shibasuke: Where Mamesuke...
Paimon: Looks like Shibasuke isn't willing to talk anymore... Let's just take him back to Mamesuke!

## Talk 11

Mamesuke: Yey!
Shibasuke: Mm... White Fur, understand.
Paimon: Hearing that from Shibasuke feels so strange... But are they gonna be alright?
Black Screen Text: Some time later, you return to see Mamesuke and Shibasuke again...
Paimon: Ooh! It's Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: You seem like you're having fun on this Mondstadt-styled mountain! The scenery here is quite different from Inazuma, right?
Mamesuke: So much green! Wind so soft! Yey!
Shibasuke: Furry grass so fun! *blows*
Paimon: Yeah, if Inazuma is purple like lightning, then Mondstadt...
Traveler: ...Is green like the wind.
Paimon: Eh-he.
Shibasuke: But there are not-purple Lavender Melons, out of reach.
Paimon: Eh? What are you talking about?
Shibasuke: White Fur can fly. White Fur can get it?
Mamesuke: Mamesuke lead way! Come!
Paimon: Gah, these two are so impatient. Let's follow them!

## Talk 12

Shibasuke: Body heavy... Mm!

## Talk 13

Mamesuke: Look! Not purple Lavender Melons! We want, but kapow!
Paimon: #Oh, it's just a wind barrier! Hehe! We've seen many of these in our adventures across Mondstadt, haven't we, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Speaking of wind barriers, why do they vanish once the thing inside them is taken, anyway?
Traveler: Well, the thing they're protecting is gone, so...
Paimon: ...That sounds kinda sad.
Shibasuke: White Fur can fly. White Fur get it?
Paimon: Oh yeah... Wait! You know, you should learn to stop relying on others and solve problems by yourself.
Mamesuke: Mmmm...
Traveler: It seems a little too difficult for a beginner.
Paimon: #Is that so? Hmph! Then experienced adventurers like {NICKNAME} and Paimon will have to teach you some lessons!
Paimon: #There's Anemo Amber here, which is perfect. It'll create a wind current once destroyed. C'mon, {NICKNAME}, show them how it's done!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Mamesuke is still in the mountains! If we switch the mountain styles now, finding Shibasuke will be the least of our problems! Even Mamesuke might get lost!

## Talk 15

Shibasuke: Yellow Fur kapow! Fly high, can't learn... Mm...
Paimon: You can't? Oh well, but this still counts as a way to enter a wind current...
Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Traveler: Lavender Melon?
Mamesuke: Lavender Melon, purple, tasty!
Paimon: It's probably a melon from Inazuma.
Paimon: This isn't a Lavender Melon, it's a Sunsettia!
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Are Lavender Melons a special type of Sunsettia?
Mamesuke: What is... Sunsettia?
Paimon: Lavender Melons are Lavender Melons! They're not the same!

## Talk 16

Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Paimon: It's a Sunsettia. Actually, both of them grow on Cuihua Wood, but the fruit varies according to the location!
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with soil and climate.
Paimon: Yeah, it's thundering all day over there in Inazuma...
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with Archon preferences.
Paimon: Would Ei enjoy a Lavender Melon? It's pretty hard to imagine that happening...

## Talk 17

Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Paimon: It's a Sunsettia. Actually, both of them grow on Cuihua Wood, but the fruit varies according to the location!
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with soil and climate.
Paimon: Paimon's heard that storms are ever-present in Inazuma!
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with Archon preferences.
Paimon: Oh... Is the Electro Archon a god who likes Lavender Melons? It's hard to imagine that...

## Talk 18

Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Traveler: Lavender Melon?
Mamesuke: Lavender Melon, purple, tasty!
Paimon: It's probably a melon from Inazuma.
Paimon: This isn't a Lavender Melon, it's a Sunsettia!
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Are Lavender Melons a special type of Sunsettia?
Mamesuke: What is... Sunsettia?
Paimon: Lavender Melons are Lavender Melons! They're not the same!

## Talk 19

Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knew it was a Flaming Flower.
Paimon: Paimon remembers that Kichiboushi called it a fire flower. It seems bake-danuki have different names for it.
Shibasuke: Flame grass~ fire flower~
Mamesuke: Flame grass so hot.
Paimon: There's a trick to picking Flaming Flowers! You have to extinguish them first to pick them safely.
Paimon: You'll need water or ice on a sunny day, and it's even easier if there's a Hydro Amber nearby. If it's raining, just use Anemo to swirl the rain and wet it.
Shibasuke: White Fur knows much, very amazing.
Paimon: #Of course! Paimon and {NICKNAME} have learned a lot in our adventures.
Shibasuke: Anemo Amber, Hydro Amber, same?
Paimon: Hmm... How should we explain this... They look almost the same, but one creates a wind current, and the other creates rain.
Mamesuke: Mm!
Paimon: Wow! Shibasuke transformed into a Hydro Amber!
Traveler: I kinda wish you could transform too, Paimon...
Paimon: Paimon can't do that!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's help Mamesuke and Shibasuke pick the Flaming Flower...
Paimon: Eh? We've got Slimes dropping from the skies!

## Talk 20

Paimon: Paimon can't do that!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's help Mamesuke and Shibasuke pick the Flaming Flower...
Paimon: Eh? We've got Slimes dropping from the skies!

## Talk 21

Paimon: Pyro Slimes are much more dangerous than Flaming Flowers because they explode. But just like Flaming Flowers, extinguishing them solves all your problems!
Shibasuke: Mm!
Paimon: It should be safe now. Give the Flaming Flower Stamen to Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Shibasuke: Thanks! White Fur strong, Yellow Fur strong too.
Paimon: Hehe, Shibasuke's amazing too.
Mamesuke: Mondstadt fun, but...
Shibasuke: Not enough.
Paimon: #Do you mean that you want to play somewhere else? Uh... {NICKNAME}, what should we do?
Traveler: Maybe we can switch to the mountain style of Liyue.
Paimon: Right! Mamesuke, Shibasuke! Would you like to see the scenery in Liyue?
Mamesuke: Liyue fun?
Traveler: There are Geovishaps there that inflict excruciating pain when they hit you.
Paimon: Hey! Stop that! Who would want to go there after hearing that!?
Mamesuke: Wow! Very fun!
Shibasuke: We go!
Paimon: Eh!?
Paimon: Oh... Then let's do another mountain kaboom!
Traveler: There are Jueyun Chilis there that make you spew flames.

## Talk 22

Mamesuke: Anemo Amber, Shibasuke transform... Shibasuke Amber! Hehe!

## Talk 23

Mamesuke: Kaboooom~

## Talk 24

Shibasuke: Mountain kaboooom~

## Talk 25

Mamesuke: Yey! Wait moment!
Shibasuke: Mm, wait moment?
Paimon: Is it just like last time?
Black Screen Text: Some time later, you return to see Mamesuke and Shibasuke again...
Paimon: They look like they're having a lot of fun here in the Liyue-styled mountains!
Mamesuke: Fun! Very red, very yellow!
Shibasuke: Stone plate very round, very flat, very weird!
Paimon: Eh? What's that?
Shibasuke: Take White Fur see!

## Talk 26

Paimon: Whew... They're so fast...
Shibasuke: Mmhaha! White Fur weak!
Paimon: ...Shibasuke is pushing its luck...
Mamesuke: White Fur, look! Strange plate!
Paimon: Oh, that! It's a mechanism activated by weight! Actually, there are some in Inazuma, too.
Shibasuke: Weight?
Paimon: Uh... Something heavy! Like...
Traveler: Like Paimon.
Paimon: Paimon isn't that heavy!
Mamesuke: Mm... Lavender Melon?
Paimon: Lavender Melons are too light!
Mamesuke: Mmm... Hydro Amber?
Paimon: Uh... Paimon's never tried it, but it probably won't work...
Shibasuke: Mmm! Stones heavy enough!
Paimon: #Shibasuke is really quick on his feet! {NICKNAME}, since Shibasuke is here to help, why don't we unlock this mechanism?
Traveler: Like a Meteorite.
Paimon: Meteorites are really handy!

## Talk 27

Mamesuke: Shibarock, Shibarock! Mm-hehe!

## Talk 28

Shibasuke: Yellow Fur so strong! Kaboom!
Mamesuke: So strong!
Paimon: #Of course! {F#She's}{M#He's} the famous {NICKNAME}!
Shibasuke: Mm! Famous! Amazing!
Paimon: So the Anemo Amber and Hydro Amber that appeared earlier... Were they Mamesuke and Shibasuke trying to help us out?
Shibasuke: Mm!
Paimon: Eh? But I remember Mamesuke mentioning that Shibasuke can't transform when afraid...
Shibasuke: Afraid, but White Fur and Yellow Fur in danger.
Mamesuke: Mm, Shibasuke help!
Paimon: Aw, Shibasuke, so you did all this to help us out...
Shibasuke: Mmhaha! White Fur dirty!
Traveler: Dirty~
Paimon: Uh! Paimon's just touched!
Shibasuke: Mmhaha!
Paimon: Alright, alright. Have you two had enough fun now? Want to return to Inazuma yet?
Shibasuke: No.
Paimon: Eh!?
Shibasuke: Go Mondstadt! Liyue!
Mamesuke: Mm! Not Mondstadt and Liyue with island and mountain.
Paimon: Ah? You want to go to the real Mondstadt and Liyue instead of returning to Inazuma?
Mamesuke: White Fur smart!
Paimon: #Uh... What do we do... What do you think, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: We can take them with us when we leave.
Paimon: Mondstadt seems like the better choice for our first destination... Let's go to Windrise! The terrain is more even, and it's close to the city.
Shibasuke: Woohoo! Mondstadt!
Paimon: But the situation here on the islands isn't very clear! Let's head back once we've resolved everything!

## Talk 29

Mamesuke: Lavender Melon, White Fur like?

## Talk 30

Shibasuke: Mmhaha! Mondstadt! Lavender Melon kapow!

## Talk 31

Paimon: Mamesuke! Shibasuke! We can go to Mondstadt now!
Mamesuke: Woohoo! Mondstadt!
Shibasuke: Mm! White Fur, Yellow Fur, so slow!
Paimon: Alright! Let's go now!

## Talk 32

Paimon: Well, this is Mondstadt. What do you think? The scenery is pretty nice, right?
Mamesuke: Mm!
Shibasuke: Mmmm!!!
Paimon: #Hehe, {NICKNAME} and Paimon started our adventure in Mondstadt, and we've made so many unforgettable memories along the way...
Shibasuke: Mm!
Paimon: #Paimon hopes Mamesuke and Shibasuke will be able to create many happy memories in Mondstadt, just like {NICKNAME} and Paimon did...
Mamesuke: Mmmm...
Paimon: Eh? Does this mean...
Paimon: It's just like what happened with Kichiboushi when Ioroi's bake-danuki meal wore off...
Traveler: They can't speak anymore...
Paimon: It feels like waking up from a dream...
Traveler: It's because we've left the islands...
Paimon: But they look like they'll be fine...
Shibasuke: Mmhaha!
Paimon: Yeah, Shibasuke can take care of itself now, so they should be fine! Happy adventuring!
Traveler: We can't understand them anymore...

## Talk 33

Mamesuke: Mm?

## Talk 34

Shibasuke: Mmhaha!

## Talk 35

Mamesuke: Mm?

## Talk 36

Shibasuke: Mmhaha!

## Talk 37

Katheryne: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, have you met two bake-danuki recently, by any chance? One of them carries a purple cloth bag, while the other has a yellow one...
Paimon: Ooh! You must be talking about Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Katheryne: Ah, great, so you do know them.
Paimon: Um, did something happen to them?
Katheryne: Not really, they just made a bunch of gestures before giving me this...
Katheryne: From their gesticulations, I had a feeling that they might be friends of yours. I think they wanted me to give this to you.
Paimon: Ooh! So this is a gift from Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like their journey's off to a good start! Paimon wonders if we'll ever meet again...

Katheryne: Ah, great, so you do know them.
Paimon: Um, did something happen to them?
Katheryne: Not really, they just made a bunch of gestures before giving me this...
Katheryne: I've heard that you once visited the Good Hunter with a bake-danuki from Inazuma, so I thought you might be friends. I think they wanted me to give this to you.
Paimon: Ooh! So this is a gift from Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like their journey's off to a good start! Paimon wonders if we'll ever meet again...

## Talk 39

Paimon: Hey! Mamesuke! We brought Shibasuke back!
Mamesuke: Mm! Shibasuke!
Shibasuke: White Fur no lie! Mamesuke! Yey!
Paimon: So Shibasuke didn't really trust us until now...
Shibasuke: Mountain so fun! So many new things! But no Lavender Melon...
Shibasuke: Almost became bake-danuki paste too, so close.
Paimon: #Hehe! You're lucky we arrived in time, eh, {NICKNAME}?
Shibasuke: Hmph.
Mamesuke: Mm! Thanks Yellow Fur, White Fur!
Shibasuke: Mamesuke go too! Furry grass! *blow* Bald!
Mamesuke: Wow! Let's go!
Paimon: Furry grass? You mean the Dandelions?
Paimon: Eh? But how will you get back to Inazuma? The Fatui ship? Paimon doesn't reckon you can go back the same way you came.
Mamesuke: ...Huh?
Paimon: #Oh brother, Paimon doesn't think they've even considered that. {NICKNAME}, we can take them back to Inazuma, right?
Traveler: We can take them with us when we leave.
Shibasuke: Go later?
Paimon: Later?
Shibasuke: Want to see furry grass with Mamesuke.
Paimon: Hmm... So we'll come back a little later, then?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know how much of Mondstadt's charm they'll be able to experience on these islands, but making them Mondstadt-styled islands is probably the best we can do.

## Talk 40

Mamesuke: Anemo Amber... Mm?

## Talk 41

Shibasuke: White Fur fly, White Fur kapow?

## Talk 42

Paimon: Let's not switch the mountains for now. We'll have a headache if those bake-danuki get separated again.

## Talk 43

Paimon: Ah! The current vanished so quickly... Well, not that there's no other way to do this...
Shibasuke: White Fur no fear!
Paimon: Wow! Shibasuke said that transformation isn't easy, so Paimon thought he wouldn't be good at it.
Mamesuke: Shibasuke amazing! Transform into many things! But not when afraid!
Paimon: #Ooh, so that's how it is! Alright then, {NICKNAME}, let's get those Sunsettias for Mamesuke and Shibasuke!

## Talk 44

Mamesuke: Yey! Box!
Paimon: Woohoo! A chest!
Traveler: Luckily, it didn't activate a challenge.
Paimon: Even if it did, it would be really fun with Mamesuke and Shibasuke here to help!
Mamesuke: Mm! Mamesuke help!
Shibasuke: White Fur no fear, Shibasuke strong.
Paimon: Hehe, Mamesuke and Shibasuke are so reliable now!
Traveler: Guess you've gotta work harder too, Paimon.
Paimon: C'mon, Paimon has always been really reliable!
Black Screen Text: Something is happening in the distance...
Shibasuke: Strange sound there! Shibasuke check!
Mamesuke: Mm! Mamesuke go too!
Paimon: Eh? What strange sound? Paimon didn't hear anything... Ah!
Paimon: #You two are too impatient! {NICKNAME}, let's catch up with them!

## Talk 45

Shibasuke: Yellow Fur so strong! Kaboom!
Mamesuke: So strong!
Paimon: #Of course! {F#She's}{M#He's} the famous {NICKNAME}!
Shibasuke: Mm! Famous! Amazing!
Paimon: So the Anemo Amber and Hydro Amber that appeared earlier... Were they Mamesuke and Shibasuke trying to help us out?
Shibasuke: Mm!
Paimon: Eh? But I remember Mamesuke mentioning that Shibasuke can't transform when afraid...
Shibasuke: Afraid, but White Fur and Yellow Fur in danger.
Mamesuke: Mm, Shibasuke help!
Paimon: Aw, Shibasuke, so you did all this to help us out...
Shibasuke: Mmhaha! White Fur dirty!
Traveler: Dirty~
Paimon: Uh! Paimon's just touched!
Shibasuke: Mmhaha!
Paimon: Alright, alright. Have you two had enough fun now? Want to return to Inazuma yet?
Shibasuke: No.
Paimon: Eh!?
Shibasuke: Go Mondstadt! Liyue!
Mamesuke: Mm! Not Mondstadt and Liyue with island and mountain.
Paimon: Ah? You want to go to the real Mondstadt and Liyue instead of returning to Inazuma?
Mamesuke: White Fur smart!
Paimon: #Uh... What do we do... What do you think, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: We can take them with us when we leave.
Paimon: Mondstadt seems like the better choice for our first destination... Let's go to Windrise! The terrain is more even, and it's close to the city.
Shibasuke: Woohoo! Mondstadt!
Paimon: Alright! Let's go now!

## Talk 46

Paimon: Well, this is Mondstadt. What do you think? The scenery is pretty nice, right?
Mamesuke: Mm!
Shibasuke: Mmmm!!!
Paimon: #Hehe, {NICKNAME} and Paimon started our adventure in Mondstadt, and we've made so many unforgettable memories along the way...
Shibasuke: Mm!
Paimon: #Paimon hopes Mamesuke and Shibasuke will be able to create many happy memories in Mondstadt, just like {NICKNAME} and Paimon did...
Mamesuke: Mmmm...
Paimon: Eh? Does this mean...
Traveler: They can't speak anymore...
Paimon: It feels like waking up from a dream...
Traveler: It's because we've left the islands...
Paimon: But they look like they'll be fine...
Shibasuke: Mmhaha!
Paimon: Yeah, Shibasuke can take care of itself now, so they should be fine! Happy adventuring!
Traveler: We can't understand them anymore...

## Talk 47

Shibasuke: Yellow Fur kapow! Fly high, can't learn... Mm...
Paimon: You can't? Oh well, but this still counts as a way to enter a wind current...
Mamesuke: Wow! Not purple Lavender Melon!
Paimon: It's a Sunsettia. Actually, both of them grow on Cuihua Wood, but the fruit varies according to the location!
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with soil and climate.
Paimon: Paimon's heard that storms are ever-present in Inazuma!
Shibasuke: Flaming grass there! White Fur! Hurry!
Paimon: Flaming grass... Oh, you mean Flaming Flowers!
Traveler: Maybe it's a Dendro Slime on fire.
Paimon: Hmm, that is possible... Let's go take a look!
Traveler: It might be a Pyro Whopperflower.
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with Archon preferences.
Paimon: Oh... Is the Electro Archon a god who likes Lavender Melons? It's hard to imagine that...
