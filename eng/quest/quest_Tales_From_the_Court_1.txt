# Tales From the Court


## Talk 1

Staelle: Please, help me out! I was just thinking about the novel's story, and before I knew it, Barea was just gone!
Blathine: Are you sure you didn't leave it at your seat in the opera house, or left it tied to the restroom door, or something?
Staelle: I've already searched all those areas. I've even looked under that seat, but Barea wasn't there.
Staelle: Oh, the mere thought of it, that my little Barea would be kidnapped by someone, or perhaps follow someone blindly as if stricken by puppy love...
Blathine: Ms. Staelle, I'm quite sure that Barea wouldn't make the same mistake twice like that.
Staelle: Ah, but my Barry-boo is still so little... and little children make the same errors many times, and even revel in it, right?
Blathine: I'm... quite certain that Barea is not as young as you say.
Traveler: And who's this Barea, if I might ask?
Blathine: Ms. Staelle's dog...
Staelle: My family.
Blathine: Yep. Her family has gone missing, and she's asking for my help.
Blathine: Ms. Staelle, we have already searched this area once. I would wager that Barea has headed off into the wilds.
Staelle: Then let us go there too!
Blathine: Please, Miss, I ask you to stay in the city. With the dress you wear, you would not be able to catch Barea even if you found it.
Staelle: Nonsense! Why, Barea would jump into my arms if it so much as saw me!
Blathine: Then I suppose it heard us not when we were calling up and down the theater, yes?
Blathine: Well, there you have it. I'm afraid I cannot bring Barea back to Ms. Staelle alone.
Blathine: I cannot simply leave my post for long, much less ask another colleague to leave theirs with me.
Blathine: But if you're willing, Traveler, could you help us both out?
Traveler: Well, it wouldn't be a problem, per se...
Blathine: Well, that's settled, then. Please come with me to the wilds — we shall look for Barea together.
Blathine: Considering its weight and stamina, it cannot have run too far.
Staelle: What!? My Barea is most healthy, thank you!
Blathine: I would agree — if we were talking about its mental health.
Blathine: Let us be off — lest Barea gain a taste for the outdoors and run still further away.
Staelle: Hey!
Traveler: You police need to deal with this stuff too?
Blathine: If the citizens of the Court of Fontaine ask me for help, I have no reason to refuse them.
Traveler: How may I assist thee?

## Talk 2

Blathine: Well, there it is — and looking quite good, too.
Blathine: I wonder when Ms. Staelle will realize that dogs have no love for the opera, or for her novels?
Blathine: Let us return — she's probably worried sick.

## Talk 3

Staelle: Barea! Oh, my baby! Where have you been?
Blathine: It simply found a quiet spot to rest for a while. A bit of a vacation, you see.
Staelle: Ah, I was so worried! Thank you, Officer Blathine, thank you! You will be in my next novel for sure!
Blathine: Thank you for your consideration, but it might be best if you save the ink — I doubt anyone would be all that interested in the daily life of a police officer.
Staelle: Then I'll simply have to dramatize your tale... It will be interesting, I swear!
Blathine: That promise of yours is already too much drama for me, I think.
Staelle: Ah, the conclusion's got to be inspiring! Let me think — who shall I assign to be your partner...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Staelle: Is it that Barea doesn't like my new novel? *sigh* But everyone else thinks it's pretty good...
Staelle: Perhaps I should read it a nicer passage...
