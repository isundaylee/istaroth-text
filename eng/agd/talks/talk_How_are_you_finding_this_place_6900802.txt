Traveler: How are you finding this place?
Yelan: Not bad. The courtyard furnishings are very nice, and the scenery in the distance is really one of a kind.
Yelan: So yeah, I think I'm gonna enjoy my time off here.
Traveler: Where do you normally live?
Yelan: In my own home, of course.
Yelan: My home's located some way outside of the city, in a very quiet and peaceful area.
Yelan: Hehe... judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing you've fallen for the rumors about me being very wealthy and having high demands for my standards of living?
Yelan: Seeing isn't always believing, and if you can't trust your eyes, you certainly can't trust rumors.
Traveler: Being away from the hustle and bustle has its benefits...
Yelan: Bingo. I think you got it. Seems like you're learning.
Yelan: If you live far enough out in the sticks, you have plenty of legitimate reasons to ditch work. The mountain path was blocked, or you ran into some Treasure Hoarders en route...
Yelan: Not to mention that if you live in a packed and bustling city, it's much easier for people to trace your steps. This creates all kinds of issues, and gets in the way of my ability to track my targets.
Traveler: Interesting, I hadn't considered that.
Yelan: That said, since I'm free to come and go as I please here, it would be a terrible waste for me to not use it as a backup base.
Yelan: You wouldn't mind that, would you?
Traveler: Perhaps it helps with your work...
Traveler: Where do you usually spend your down time?
