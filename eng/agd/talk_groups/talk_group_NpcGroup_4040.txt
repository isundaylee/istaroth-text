Traveler: About White Iron Chunks...
Dwarkanath: Ah, I remember. Iradj's always losing my knives so I posted the commission.
Dwarkanath: I guess you've got those five White Iron Chunks?
Traveler: Here are the White Iron Chunks you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.

Traveler: You want to buy a weapon?
Dwarkanath: I'm fine myself, I already have a handy one. It's just that my brother Iradj is always going on about how he wants a Claymore and he asked me to keep an eye out for one.
Dwarkanath: Strange, just where can I buy a sword that's not only fit for purpose, but also looks nice? I asked him why he wants it, but he just hemmed and hawed without giving me a clear answer...
Dwarkanath: Ah! Maybe he wants to buy it as a gift for a girl somewhere? But... which girl would want a greatsword as a gift?
