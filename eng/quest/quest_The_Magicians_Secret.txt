# The Magician's Secret


## Talk 1

Lyney: Over here.
Paimon: Lynette's not joining us today?
Lyney: I've had her follow Jemma and see if we can make any inroads with her. They should be at a cafe right now.
Lyney: Still... I don't think that Jemma's likely to open up to us. *sigh* So we need a contingency plan.
Traveler: What should we do?
Lyney: Today, we'll be looking into a guy named Lorenzo, Cesar's former pupil and assistant.
Lyney: When Cesar passed away, all the stolen goods discovered in his home were confiscated and returned to their rightful owners. But Lorenzo was the only one privy to all his magic secrets, and he inherited his craft.
Lyney: Before long, Lorenzo was the next big magician in town, his fame surpassing even that of his master, and it made him very wealthy. He's since left the magic scene though, and these days, he's a wealthy businessman with his fingers in a lot of different pies.
Lyney: I had to pull a lot of strings, but I managed to get him to agree to a couple of drinks with me. Be warned, though — I hear he's got a hair-trigger temper. We'd best be careful.
Traveler: Where should we start?

## Talk 2

Lorenzo: You neglected to mention that you were bringing two other people with you.
Lyney: My apologies, these two are my assistants. When they heard that I was meeting with the former magic maestro himself, they begged and pleaded with me to bring them along... Um, and if it's no trouble, a couple of autographs would really make their day...
Lorenzo: Hmph. Forget the pleasantries. Just sit.
Paimon: Get a load of this guy... "Forget the pleasantries," he says, but he looks pretty happy about Lyney stroking his ego...
Lorenzo: I only agreed to meet since we're both magicians. Do me a favor and cut to the chase — I have more important things to do than drinking.
Lyney: Much obliged, Sir. As it happens, the matter I want to address is also related to magic.
Lyney: Yesterday morning, a warning letter from The Phantom Weasel appeared on the entrance to the opera house. He claims to be planning something for the same evening that I'm scheduled to do a magic show there. As such, I believe that I may well be his target.
Lyney: I have to get to the bottom of this to ensure that my show can go ahead as planned. Naturally, any investigation into The Weasel starts with a few questions about Cesar, who—
Lorenzo: What is there to investigate?
Lorenzo: Cesar was The Weasel, and he's been dead for ten years. So what if some sick creep thought it'd be funny to write a warning letter? It changes nothing! Are you trying to tell me you actually bought it?
Lyney: Please, Sir, no need to get so worked up. I do concede that a copycat is but one possibility...
Lorenzo: Possibility? It's a fact, Lyney. Look, my patience is limited, so listen carefully while I'm still willing to put up with you.
Lorenzo: The Weasel is dead, period. Everyone knows that. So do yourself a favor, and quit this investigation — it'll lead you nowhere. Look, if this affects your magic show in any way, I will personally compensate you for any losses.
Lyney: Oh... Sir, I'm... honored, really, but this isn't about finances for me.
Lyney: My pride as a magician is what's at stake here, Lorenzo. Copycat or not, this person has thrown me the gauntlet — and I must meet their challenge head-on.
Lorenzo: Your pride? Hah! Don't mince words with me, boy. Just tell me, what exactly are you seeking to do?
Lyney: I want to find out The Phantom Weasel's true identity. I have to know for myself what really happened ten years ago.
Lorenzo: What would that accomplish? And what do the events of ten years ago have to do with you, anyway? Look, you of all people should know that a magician never reveals their secrets — and in any case, dead men don't talk. So if you really care about your magician's pride, then you'll forget about Cesar and move on.
Lyney: ...
Paimon: Uh-oh, this is getting awkward...
Edmondo: Lorenzo? Is that— It is you! I know that big... booming voice anywhere. What's up, my man? Wanna grab a drink with me?
Lorenzo: Another day. I'm busy.
Edmondo: Ah, come on, you can't be all business all the... time. You know what they say, live fast, die... young. You gotta learn how to kick back and relax once in a while.
Lorenzo: If I wanted your life advice, I'd ask for it. Now, get out of my face and go be drunk somewhere else.
Lyney: Sorry, my good sir, I don't believe I've had the pleasure...
Edmondo: Oh, hey. I'm Edmondo. He and I are business pals, we've worked together a bunch of times.
Edmondo: This your first time meeting him? He's always like this — foul-mouthed and hard-nosed. Never heard a kind word outta this guy the whole time I've known him.
Edmondo: And he wonders why he can't get a girlfriend, despite being... what, pushing forty? Thirty-something, anyway — the point is, a lot older than when he first got rejected by the girl he was into... and is still into, from what I hear...
Lorenzo: Shut up, and get out of my face. Another word out of you, and you can forget about doing business with me ever again. Do I make myself clear?
Edmondo: ...
Edmondo: Haha... Sorry, I may have had a liiiiittle too much to drink... Alright, I'm gonna leave. Don't work too hard.
Lorenzo: I think it's high time I made a move as well. If you really want to investigate this, Lyney, be my guest.
Lorenzo: But if nothing good comes of it, don't say I didn't warn you.
Lyney: Well, that fell to pieces in a rather spectacular fashion... Any thoughts?
Traveler: There's something strange about him.
Paimon: Totally. And what was all that about compensating you for your losses? Why would someone you've just met make an offer like that?
Paimon: He's gotta be hiding something... And not like Jemma. She was little suspicious, but this guy's definitely covering something up.
Lyney: I think so too. We need to look into Lorenzo more closely.
Lyney: That guy Edmondo seems to know a thing or two about him. He only just left — let's see if we can catch up with him.

## Talk 3

Gracia: ...I've spoken many choice words about Cesar over the years.
Gracia: I'm so ashamed of myself now. He was such a good man...

## Talk 4

Lyney: You've followed us a long way. Why don't you come out and introduce yourselves?
"Smoothface" Paccino: So you're Lyney? And where's your sister, ain't she with you today?
"Smoothface" Paccino: Save us the trouble and go fetch her for us. Let's not drag this out.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't like the tone of your voice, mister! Who sent you, huh?
"Painter" De Niro: Save your questions, missy. You ain't gonna need answers where you're goin', capiche?
Lyney: *sigh* Looks like we can't avoid this fight.
Lyney: Now, I'm not the strongest fighter, so I hope you're ready to back me up.
Paimon: Don't worry, we got this!

## Talk 5

"Smoothface" Paccino: Curses! They're tougher than we thought...
"Painter" De Niro: Vision-wielders are always trouble! Intimidation ain't gonna work like it did on the lady...
"Smoothface" Paccino: C'mon! Let's scram!
Paimon: Hey, wise guys! We ain't through with you yet...
Paimon: Grr, they got away! Did you catch what they said just before they left? Something about intimidating someone else?
Paimon: Sounds like they just wanted to rough us up as a scare-tactic... and they've already done it to someone else. But who?
Traveler: Could it be Jemma?
Paimon: You're right! She was injured when we saw her yesterday, and she acted like she had something to hide...
Paimon: Maybe she was too scared to tell us the truth because those guys had threatened her.
Lyney: Hmm... Well if that's the case, she should be more willing to open up to us once she learns that those thugs won't be bothering her anymore.
Lyney: Let's head back to the cafe and see if we can get any information from her.

## Talk 6

Jemma: ...
Lynette: ...
Paimon: Jemma?
Jemma: You again... What is it this time?
Paimon: We just ran into the men who've been threatening you... And we gave 'em a taste of their own medicine.
Paimon: So you can relax now. We're here to protect you!
Jemma: What? Why? ...I didn't tell you anything. Why would they come after you?
Lyney: Hmm. Sounds like they're no strangers to you.
Jemma: ...
Jemma: That's putting it mildly. I know them all too well... and I hate them with every fiber of my being.
Jemma: It's been ten long years... And still, every time I try to look into Cesar's death, they show up and warn me not to "do anything stupid"...
Jemma: ...How do I know I can trust you? Do you really think you can get to the bottom of it all? And... Why are you doing this?
Lyney: I'm afraid I can't reveal all the details just yet, but I can promise you this — I will expose The Phantom Weasel's true identity.
Lyney: Because you see, this is a personal matter of the utmost importance. I give you my word. Trust me.
Jemma: ...Okay. How can I help you?
Lyney: I've heard that Cesar used to have a magic workshop where he kept a lot of his personal effects. If possible, I'd like to take a look at them.
Lyney: Do you know where it is?
Jemma: The Fleuve Cendre. But the place was sealed up by the police after his death, and no one's been there since.
Jemma: I also know that The Fleuve Cendre is dangerous territory — lots of hostile groups lurking around. If you're serious about going there... please be careful.
Lyney: Understood. Lynette, you stay here and take care of Jemma. Don't let her come to harm.
Lynette: Got it. But if I'm staying here, I'm ordering dessert...
Lyney: I mean... bon appetit, but stay sharp too. They're likely to come for you while I'm away.
Lynette: Kay... Alright, power-saving mode off. I'll start taking this more seriously now.

## Talk 7

Lyney: If Jemma gave us the right location, then the workshop should be right nearby... Huh, looks like these boxes are blocking the entrance. Let's shift them away first.
Black Screen Text: You help Lyney move the boxes aside. It looks like no one's been here in a long time...
Lyney: There we go! It should be just down here.

## Talk 8

Jemma: ...Lynette? Fancy meeting you here.
Jemma: Can I get you something to drink?
Lynette: No need.

## Talk 9

Lynette: With me here, nothing will happen.

## Talk 10

Paimon: That's weird. Have we reached the end already?
Paimon: There's nothing here. Maybe this was a wasted trip...
Traveler: Lyney, what're you looking at?
Lyney: This place seems a little too ordinary for a magician's workshop. There's a distinct lack of mystery.
Lyney: We've triggered quite a few devices on the way here. I'm starting to wonder whether Cesar built this whole place as one big, elaborate magic contraption.
Lyney: If so, then there must be more to this place than meets the eye. Maybe a hidden room somewhere.
Lyney: Aha. If I just move this book, then hopefully... and, presto!
Paimon: A secret passageway! How did you know?
Lyney: I'm a magician too. And apparently, great minds really do think alike.
Lyney: Looks pretty big inside. Let's head in and take a look around.

## Talk 11

Jemma: Whatever you do... Please be careful.
Jemma: If anything happens to you because you're investigating Cesar, I'll never be able to forgive myself...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Why've you stopped, Lyney? Is there some device in that box?
Lyney: Huh... It just looks familiar, somehow. Lemme check this out for a second while you guys go on ahead.
Lyney: If anyone makes a major discovery, let's rendezvous here.
Paimon: Alright. See ya in a bit!

## Talk 13

Dolora: I can't believe Lorenzo was intimidating Jemma all this time...
Traveler: Have you met Lorenzo before?
Dolora: He comes around here sometimes. Not to clean Cesar's grave, though. He just stands off to the side and watches Jemma from a distance.
Dolora: She must've known, but she never asked him to leave. I wonder why that is.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Missing text (2040805498)

## Talk 15

Traveler: Stop Reading
Paimon: Two magic geniuses with a "Father" and a mission, huh...
Paimon: Sounds a lot like he was writing about Lyney and Lynette, don't you think?
Paimon: So did they meet Cesar when they were kids? Let's go ask Lyney.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Lyney—
Lyney: Shh, hold that thought... As I expected, there's a lot of fishy things going on in this place.
Paimon: Fishy? Uh-oh, what have you found?
Lyney: All in good time. Before we go over our new leads, I wanna tell you how a "high-altitude escape" is performed.
Lyney: First, the magician slots themselves into a magic box in full view of the audience. The box is then suspended high in the air, and a short while later, the base automatically opens.
Lyney: At this point, a dummy will fall out of the box, but it looks real enough to grab the audience's attention, and they start wailing and screaming...
Lyney: Meanwhile, the real magician — who has by now blended into the crowd — waits for a good moment to make their appearance and put on a hysterical performance:
Lyney: "Oh no! Is that me!? Did I just fall to my death!?"
Paimon: Very vivid description, Paimon can really picture it... and then what?
Lyney: The audience's gaze then turns to the magician, and by the time they realize what's happened, the dummy has vanished — as if everything that just happened was some sort of shared illusion.
Lyney: Of course, that's just how I think the process should work, theoretically speaking.
Traveler: Theoretically speaking? What do you mean?
Lyney: The inventor of this trick never performed it successfully. When the box opened... Cesar was the one who fell out, and not the dummy.
Lyney: He fell right to the ground from the highest point of the opera house... No one could hope to survive that fall — not without a Vision, at least.
Lyney: And no one else has ever attempted this trick since. My understanding of how it works is just based on what I could gather from his notes and the relevant gadgets here in his workshop.
Paimon: So Cesar's famous high-altitude escape has never been done, huh?
Paimon: Paimon was about to say how cool it would be to see it in person. But if it's that dangerous, it's probably for the best that no one else tries to do it.
Paimon: Wait a second, so if a dummy's supposed to drop out of the box, then where does the real magician go? How does he get out?
Lyney: Glad you asked — that brings us to the secret of said box.
Lyney: This box right here is the one that Cesar constructed himself to use in the performance, and it's not as simple as it looks. Inside, there's a device that only the magician himself would know about.
Lyney: Once the magician's inside, and the box is lifted up into the air, the audience's view of the box is fixed at a certain angle.
Lyney: From where they're standing, they have a clear view of the front, sides, and bottom, but the back and the top are now no longer visible.
Lyney: At this point, the magician presses a button inside the box, opening a secret door out of view.
Lyney: He then escapes through this trap door onto the opera house roof, waits for the dummy to fall and distract the audience, and quietly returns to ground level.
Paimon: That's way simpler than Paimon imagined. Even Paimon could probably do it!
Lyney: Haha, well, there's a little more to it than that, of course. The hardest part of this trick is controlling the audience's mood and reactions. That takes an exceptional degree of showmanship.
Lyney: There's the falling dummy, the miraculous reappearance, the pompous performing... Maybe the magician would even have themselves tied up before it begins to strengthen the impression that there's no escape.
Lyney: Many days and nights of careful research and painstaking practice would have gone into this, all culminating in a performance just a few minutes long — but one that still manages to transform the shock and grief of a tragic accident to the joy and laughter of a mesmerizing magic trick.
Lyney: Cesar was a highly accomplished magician... But unfortunately, even he didn't manage to pull it off.
Paimon: So... How did it go so wrong? You said you found some fishy stuff here — have you figured out what really happened?
Lyney: ...I can make a pretty good guess.
Lyney: I looked into the case files. The magic box Cesar was using at the time of his death had the secret button I mentioned positioned on the right-hand side. And sure enough, he always used his right hand as his dominant hand in public.
Paimon: Okay... Nothing suspicious there...
Lyney: But here's the strange thing: Most of the devices in this workshop have the mechanism on the left-hand side, including this box right here. Which leads me to believe that Cesar was, in fact, left-handed.
Traveler: I'm not sure where you're going with this.
Lyney: Because a magician can't afford to have their most basic habits stand out too much. People naturally focus their attention on the most important details of the task or situation at hand.
Lyney: But a magician needs to be able to redirect an audience's attention at will, so as to avoid arousing their suspicion.
Lyney: The essence of magic is getting people to believe a lie. If even the truth raises eyebrows, the falsehoods become all the more difficult to mask.
Lyney: And so, Cesar trained himself to use his right hand to align with his audience's expectations... Great magic always requires sacrifices.
Lyney: But in his most stressful and nerve-wracking moments, and when no one was watching, reflex would kick in and he'd use his left hand. That's why he set his gadgets with the mechanism on his left.
Traveler: Maybe someone exploited that fact against him?
Lyney: Exactly. I think that's likely what happened.
Lyney: Cesar would have been under a lot of time pressure during the escape. He'd have had mere seconds to open the hidden compartment, retrieve the dummy, then open the secret door and make a swift escape.
Lyney: But I'm sure he was confident. He would have rehearsed countless times, to the point where it was second nature. He'd barely need to think about what he was doing, because muscle memory would guide him through.
Lyney: So he opened the compartment, took out the dummy, checked everything was in order, and then went to leave. With his left hand, he reached for the button, and suddenly his heart skipped a beat — it wasn't there.
Lyney: Much like when you reach for your keys but find your pocket empty, his mind needed a moment to process what was going on.
Lyney: Instinctively, his left hand would keep feeling around for the missing button, maybe for another second or two... until the bottom of the box gave way.
Lyney: With the stakes being as high as they were, just a two-second delay cost him everything. The authorities would find nothing suspicious, and conclude that his death was due to his own error.
Paimon: When in reality, someone switched the boxes... and they did it to murder him.
Paimon: But how would they be able to make the switch without being noticed? That would be difficult to pull off, no?
Lyney: It would have to have been someone who knew that he was left-handed, and who could move his props around without arousing suspicion. Someone who was always by his side.
Lyney: Isn't that right... Lorenzo?
Lorenzo: You just couldn't let sleeping dogs lie, could you?
Lorenzo: There's not a lot of people who'd go to all this trouble for some magician who died ten years ago. I didn't want to have to do this, you know... Silencing you the hard way just creates more problems for me to deal with.
Lorenzo: But I gave you your chance. I hoped you'd do what's good for you and back off, like the lady, but... you disappoint me.
Paimon: You mean Jemma? So YOU are the one who's been threatening her!
Lorenzo: Yes, although however stubborn she might be, she was never much of a liability. But you people... You never even knew him, but for some reason you just wouldn't drop it...
Lorenzo: Which is why you can't leave this place alive. Take them out. And make it quick.
Paimon: Hmph, do your worst!!!
Traveler: Why would Cesar pretend to be right-handed?

## Talk 17

Lyney: The placement of this device inside... Hmm, if I remember correctly...

## Talk 18

Lorenzo: *cough* ...Ugh, you kids are tougher than you look...
Lyney: Had enough yet, Lorenzo? Your cronies can't help you now.
Lyney: I think it's high time you started talking, and what I'd really like to know is... Why did you murder Cesar?
Lorenzo: Ugh, if I had a Mora for every time you've said that man's name... Of course you idolize Cesar, everyone else did. But I was the real genius magician! Me!
Lorenzo: He was just an amateur who did cheap tricks for gullible children. I was the one who made magic into the fine art it is today! The aristocrats doffed their hats to ME!
Lyney: So it was jealousy...
Lorenzo: ...
Lorenzo: Jealousy? Hatred, more like. I hated Cesar. All he cared about was his magic — he lived and breathed it.
Lorenzo: He poured everything into his street performances and his stupid tours like it was just a hobby to him, never bothering to think about Mora. What sort of fool devotes their life to the art of deception and never has a Mora to show for it?
Lorenzo: But the people loved him, didn't they? Oh, how they looked up to him! No one gave me a second look. All I ever heard was "Oh, your master's amazing, isn't he!"
Lorenzo: Amazing? Yeah, so amazing that he was completely broke. Every other apprentice was living it up at their master's expense, but no, not me! I put in all the work, mastered all the skills, and it brought me nothing more than the life I already had.
Traveler: So you killed him?
Lorenzo: He forbade me from using magic to trick people out of their Mora. There was nothing he hated more than that.
Lorenzo: And with his reputation in Fontaine, it was too risky for me to go it alone. As long as he was alive, if I dabbled in my own brand of money-making magic, he would expose me, and it would destroy me.
Lorenzo: I had to kill him... There was no other way. He had to go.
Lyney: ...
Lyney: And this was your only motive?
Lorenzo: It was reason enough. What other motive would I need?
Lyney: Well, I was under the impression that there might have been other factors at play. For instance... Maybe you were in love with Jemma, but she was engaged to Cesar.
Lorenzo: In love with Jemma? D—Don't be ridiculous...
Lyney: Guess I was wrong about that, then. Next question: Are you The Phantom Weasel?
Lorenzo: ...I am.
Lorenzo: Cesar was so strict with me. He insisted that his way was the right way. That the sole purpose of magic was to bring joy to the world.
Lorenzo: I never bought into any of that. I was more interested in the practical value of magic... Sure enough, it helped me fill my pockets with all kinds of valuable treasures.
Traveler: But I heard that The Phantom Weasel stole from the rich and poor alike.
Paimon: Oh, yeah. Charlotte told us that The Weasel would steal whatever people valued, no matter how much it was worth.
Lorenzo: That's just how it looked from the outside. What would any thief want with second-rate loot? I've only ever targeted high-value items.
Lorenzo: I stole cheap things as a way of practicing my craft. It was other people's overactive imaginations that conjured up the preposterous image they then dubbed the "Phantom Weasel."
Lyney: So that's the story, huh? Well, I hope you're ready to tell it all over again during your trial?
Lorenzo: What choice do I have? You're a pack of wolves and you've got me between your jaws. You've seen what's here, and my last-ditch effort to stop it getting out has failed. What else can I do?
Lorenzo: So be it. I've enjoyed power and wealth for the last ten years, the likes of which Cesar could never give me. I wouldn't choose for things to end this way, but I regret nothing.
Lyney: Very well. In that case, I'll contact the Gardes.
Lyney: #Traveler, Paimon, keep an eye on Lorenzo for me. I'll meet you just outside the workshop when I'm back.
Traveler: Why didn't you just leave?

## Talk 19

Wishlist: "I'd like a little dove."
Wishlist: "I want a robot with cool powers!"
Wishlist: Note: You need your parents' permission to own a pet, and you also need to take good care of it.
Wishlist: I've brought a fluffy toy dove for you this time. If you're ready to own a pet, I'll make a real dove appear for you next time. — Cesar

## Talk 20

Wishlist: "I want a bucket of fried chicken that never runs out."
Wishlist: "I'd like a new bag."
Wishlist: Note: There is no such thing as fried chicken that never runs out, just as there's no such thing as children who never grow up.
Wishlist: Also, eating too much fried food is bad for you. Make sure to pair it with something healthy, like a salad, alright? — Cesar

## Talk 21

Wishlist: "I wish my parents would get back together."
Wishlist: "I wish for good grades in my next exam."
Wishlist: "I wish for my little sister to have a normal life free of danger."
Wishlist: Note: I want you to know that you can always share your troubles with me, children. But some wishes need more than magic to make them come true — they need the power of your hard work.
Wishlist: I wish you the best of luck, and hope that all of your wishes will come true. — Cesar

## Talk 22

Lynette: ...Ah. You're back.
Lynette: You were so quick. I've only just finished my third dessert.
Lyney: Your third!? Lynette, come on, we've talked about this, everything in moderation... You're not gonna have any room left for dinner now.
Lynette: That's fine. I'll shift to Exercise Mode and jog off the excess sugar.
Lyney: That's besides the point... *sigh* Well, it's done now. But try to eat a more balanced diet in the future.
Lynette: Point taken.
Jemma: Did... everything go okay?
Paimon: Of course. Lorenzo was no match for us! The Gardes are taking him into custody as we speak.
Jemma: Gosh. That's amazing... I'm sorry, I still didn't know if I could trust you, but now it seems I can.
Jemma: I had my suspicions about Lorenzo, but I... *sob*
Paimon: It's okay, we understand. He did threaten you. Paimon would find it hard to trust strangers in your position too.
Paimon: But you don't need to be scared anymore. Everything's gonna be okay!
Jemma: Sorry... Sorry, my emotions are all over the place right now. I've been waiting for this day to come for so long.
Jemma: I always wanted to report Lorenzo. He took all of Cesar's property, which I found suspicious, but I had people watching me all the time, so I couldn't risk looking into it...
Jemma: I was so afraid... I was scared he'd do something terrible to me, and then no one would be left to visit Cesar's grave... so I never had the courage to speak out.
Jemma: Thank you all, truly. Thank you so much...

## Talk 23

Bruno: Lyney has told me the whole story.
Bruno: Lorenzo, do you confess to the murder of Cesar, and to framing him for the Phantom Weasel's crimes?
Lorenzo: ...
Lori: Hmph. Look who's finally developed a conscience.
Lori: What kind of disciple murders their own master? I hope it was worth it, because there'll be hell to pay!
Paimon: Phew. Looks like it's all over. What should we do next, Lyney? Should we start preparing for your show?
Lyney: Let me think...
Lyney: Let's rendezvous with Lynette and Jemma first. With Lorenzo in custody, Jemma will no longer have to fear for her safety.
Paimon: Good point! We should go tell Jemma the good news right away. It'll give her some peace of mind for sure!

## Talk 24

Baltasar: It may take some time, but Cesar's reputation will be restored now that the real culprit has been captured.
Baltasar: Looks like Jemma chose a good man after all...

## Talk 25

Baltasar: Thank you all for clearing Cesar's name.
Baltasar: I never would have guessed that Lorenzo was the real Phantom Weasel... He never showed any signs that there were problems between him and Cesar in public. From the outside, it looked like they got along great.
Baltasar: Ugh, to think that lowlife's been living life to the fullest all this time while Cesar's name was getting dragged through the mud. It's a travesty...
Baltasar: At least his soul can finally rest in peace now, thanks to your efforts.
Jemma: ...
Jemma: If... If only I'd realized before it was too late...
Gracia: Don't blame yourself, Jemma. This isn't your fault.
Dolora: Yeah. You still have the rest of your life to live. Cesar wouldn't want to see you spend it feeling guilty.
Lyney: ...
Lynette: Cheer up, Jemma.
Lynette: My brother's doing a magic show at the opera house tomorrow evening. Would you like to come along? It might raise your spirits.
Lynette: This show will be a special one. We're holding it in Cesar's honor.
Jemma: In Cesar's honor? Really?
Jemma: Thank you. I'll be there.
Lyney: #Great! We'll see you tomorrow evening. Traveler, Paimon, don't be late~
Paimon: Don't worry, we'll be there. No way are we gonna miss out on a free magic show!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Juliano: Jemma's hurt, you say?
Juliano: Now that you mention it, I did see her getting into a heated argument a while back...
Juliano: Maybe someone who hates Cesar was taking it out on her... People can be unbelievable sometimes.

### Additional Talk 2

Baltasar: A lot of people find cemeteries bleak and oppressive, but not me.
Baltasar: I find the silence gives me a sense of peace. And something about being in the presence of the dead and buried... It sorta puts all of life's woes in perspective.

### Additional Talk 3

Gracia: Oh, Cesar... Were you or weren't you The Phantom Weasel?

### Additional Talk 4

Lorenzo: ...At least I can finally stop looking over my shoulder now.

### Additional Talk 5

Edmondo: Ugh... *cough*...
Lyney: You okay there?
Edmondo: Uhh... Who are you?
Edmondo: Oh... You guys. Don't worry about me, I must've had one too many... Just need to ride it out.
Edmondo: I said waaay too much back there, didn't I? Nearly talked myself into complete financial ruin... Note to self: No more drunken chats when Lorenzo's around.
Paimon: So he was serious about threatening to cut you off? Ugh, Paimon knew he was a bad egg!
Edmondo: Hey, hey, hey! Keep your voice down!
Edmondo: Don't go prying into Lorenzo's personal affairs... Bad things happen to people who ask too many questions or make an enemy out of him.
Lyney: What kind of bad things?
Edmondo: Don't even ask. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this conversation short. I'm not crossing that line again.
Edmondo: And take it from me: Trouble with Lorenzo is one thing you don't need in your life. You saw him flare up back there — I don't know what you said to him, but clearly it touched a nerve.
Edmondo: That's not a good sign. You're too young for this — don't get in over your head. I'm leaving.
Paimon: And there he goes... What do we do now, Lyney?
Lyney: Shhh. I think we're being watched. Someone was listening in to our whole conversation.
Lyney: Don't say anything, and don't look back. Any altercation in the city will attract the Gardes... We'd better take this elsewhere.

Wishlist: "When do we get to go to your wedding, Uncle Cesar?"
Wishlist: "I wanna watch your shows even when I'm grown up, Uncle Cesar!"
Wishlist: "Do you have to go on tour? Can't you stay here with us, Uncle Cesar?"
Wishlist: Note: Oh my... This round of wishes has rather exceeded my expectations. The wedding will be held very soon, and don't worry, you're all invited!
Wishlist: The tour has already been scheduled, but I will definitely be back. And you'll always be welcome at my shows if you like magic. — Cesar

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: About the Wishlists...
Cesar's Diary: At one of my shows a few days ago, a child asked me how I pulled candy out of my hat.
Cesar's Diary: As a joke, I told the kid that the hat has a built-in wish-granting machine... Next thing I know, today a whole bunch of kids were pestering me to pull all sorts of things out of the hat...
Cesar's Diary: So I told them another white lie: "The machine needs time to power up, but in the meantime, you can write your wishes down." Well, they took me up on that offer enthusiastically... As I write this, I've only just got back from running around all over town, buying the things they wanted. Boy, are my legs sore...
Cesar's Diary: I wound up saving very little this month, but that's not a major issue. I now have a bigger problem: How am I going to hide all these things inside my hat...?

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: About the Children Studying Magic...
Cesar's Diary: Two children came to talk to me after today's show. I don't know why they were out on their own — they looked much too young to be unsupervised. I do hope they got home safely.
Cesar's Diary: Anyway, they said that they wanted me to teach them how to do magic. It's not uncommon for children to ask this, of course, but I've never seen any of them as serious about it as these two.
Cesar's Diary: I told them that learning magic is very hard work, but that didn't faze them at all — it's like they already knew. They seemed so committed... I couldn't turn them down.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: About Lorenzo's Issues...
Cesar's Diary: It seems like something's bothering Lorenzo lately, but he won't open up to me about it.
Cesar's Diary: Surely, he's not upset that I agreed to teach those two children? I'll have to talk him around...
Cesar's Diary: I have a good feeling about those kids. They're naturally talented, and it seems like they're not new to the world of magic.
Cesar's Diary: They have all sorts of fantastic ideas. All I'm really doing is helping them develop a more professional-standard training plan.
Cesar's Diary: They wanted to call me "Master," but I told them they absolutely mustn't. Any magician worth their salt could've taught them what I have... They're the geniuses here. Compared to them, I don't deserve to be called any sort of "master."
Cesar's Diary: With time, I have no doubt that they could become far greater magicians than I. My only concern is why they're so mature for their age... I fear they've had to grow up too fast. I don't dare to imagine what they must have been through.
Cesar's Diary: Jemma thinks so too. She doesn't like being around them — says that their eyes are "too piercing." They don't bother me, but then again, I've never been the sharpest tool in the shed.

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: About the Farewell...
Cesar's Diary: It's nearly time for me to go on tour. I asked the two kids if they'd like to come with me, but they shook their heads.
Cesar's Diary: I once overheard them talking about their "Father" and their "mission"... Sounds like their parents have other plans for them. I guess we'll be parting ways soon.
Cesar's Diary: It's only been ten days since I first met them, but I think that I've gotten a feel for their personalities now.
Cesar's Diary: They're very tough, but also very cautious — and they trust no one but each other. This, I fear, is not a good habit to have.
Cesar's Diary: They hide things from me, too. For example, when I asked them where they live and why they wanted to learn magic, they lied.
Cesar's Diary: That's the thing about children — whenever they're trying to cover something up, it always shows somehow...
Cesar's Diary: I can sense that their lives have been hard — possibly even dangerous, too. They're not like other children... It's a shame that I can't do more to help them.
Cesar's Diary: After thinking things over, I decided to tell them a bit about how I see the world: It's full of lies and falsehoods, and that is why we must find our own truth.
Cesar's Diary: P.S. I hope they won't find my nagging annoying. Children are so opinionated nowadays. Will it do them more harm than good for someone they've only known ten days to lecture them like that?
Cesar's Diary: P.P.S. Maybe I'm overthinking this. Children aren't interested in grand philosophies — it probably just went in one ear and out the other. I bet they've already forgotten every word I said.
Cesar's Diary: Oh, Cesar, Cesar... Just mind your own business next time.
