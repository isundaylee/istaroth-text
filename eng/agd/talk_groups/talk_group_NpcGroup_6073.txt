Wakea Nui: Mom... For all these years, have you really never felt the need to bring everyone together to expand the family business?
Kupo Nui: Hmm? Why would you ask something like that, my child? Everyone in the family is gainfully employed. Won't you say that they're all hard at work in their own individual spheres?
Wakea Nui: That's exactly what I mean! Instead of each focusing on our own thing, why can't we bring everyone together, so we can all work towards the same goal, and help each other grow?
Kupo Nui: Ahh, I see. Well, if that's how you feel, why not bring it up with the group?
Wakea Nui: *sigh*... But none of them are willing to give me the time of day. It feels like they're all happy to just stick to the status quo...
Kupo Nui: Ah, is that so? Then you should also be happy for them.
Wakea Nui: I can be happy for them, I guess, but I'm a little sad for myself. At this rate, I'll never get a second employee for my international travel agency...

Traveler: Tell me about this place...
Kupo Nui: We've got a pretty great location, wouldn't you agree?
Kupo Nui: It used to be just an old house owned by my family, but Miss Amina took note of the wonderful scenery here, and suggested that I turn the place into a restaurant.
Kupo Nui: It was a fantastic idea. We've had steady business ever since we opened. It seems like both locals and tourists really enjoy having some drinks by the beach.
Kupo Nui: The only problem is that I've always had problems securing staff. I have a big family, but only a few of them are interested in helping out.
Kupo Nui: So I always tell everyone to help themselves. You can even bring your own ingredients and cook by yourself, we won't charge you anything extra.
