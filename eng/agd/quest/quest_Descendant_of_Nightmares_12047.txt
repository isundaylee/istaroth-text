# Descendant of Nightmares


## Talk 1

Paimon: This should be the place Miko mentioned, right?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: Mizuki! That was quick...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: All thanks to you two. With what I learned from those two guys, I managed to give Murasaki and Shion effective treatment as soon as I got back. That meant I was free to head out again as soon as I received your message.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So. This is where Emura Ichigensai lives?
Paimon: Sure hope so, 'cause this is our only lead... *sniff* Wait, do you guys smell that too? Some kind of fragrance. Seems like it's coming from inside!
Traveler: I smelled the same scent yesterday, too.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Then that confirms it: We've come to the right place. Now, we may face great danger once we're inside...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So from here on out, stay close to me, and stay focused. I don't want either of you getting hurt.
Traveler: Don't worry about us.
Paimon: Mm-hmm! We'll be fine — you just focus on what you need to do.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Alright, fine... I suppose you're used to leading the charge.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa... This is not what Paimon was expecting...
Traveler: It looks familiar.
Paimon: Ah, this is creepy... Feels like there are loads of eyes staring at us...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Calm, yet repressed... The signs are all there...
Paimon: What is it, Mizuki? Figured something out?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Nothing new — just further confirmation of my suspicions. Emura Ichigensai should be hiding deep inside this place... Stay close to me.

## Talk 3

Emura Chuuya (Emura Ichigensai): Miss Yumemizuki... You found me at last. Ah, I see you've brought some friends with you. Please forgive my lack of hospitality.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Emura Chuuya... So it is you.
Paimon: Mizuki was right after all... Paimon wasn't expecting him to be so polite, though.
Emura Chuuya: Please, do not call me by that name anymore. The old me was plagued by negative emotions. But I have parted ways with them now. That period of my life is consigned to the past, and the name along with it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You have to listen to me — there is no way to get rid of all of your negative emotions. This life you're living now is a lie.
Emura Chuuya: Haha... Your perspective is most amusing.
Paimon: What's so funny? Don't you know you're harming people?
Emura Chuuya: Harming people? That's what you believe? Very well, I understand and accept your perspective — even if you cannot afford me the same courtesy in return.
Paimon: Ugh, what's up with him? He's being so calm and polite, so why does everything he says make Paimon wanna punch him?
Emura Chuuya: As you can see, Miss Yumemizuki, all my psychological problems have been completely resolved.
Emura Chuuya: I must thank you for your attempts to diagnosis my condition. But I see now that the truth is far simpler than you were proposing.
Emura Chuuya: All my misery was merely a consequence of human frailty. I could not hope to remove my emotional impurities on my own strength.
Emura Chuuya: I lived in fear and anger. Fear that I was not worthy of other people's attention. Anger at how they invalidated me.
Emura Chuuya: I became a slave to my emotions. They turned me into a wretched and loathsome creature, hostile to everyone... But things are different now — I have acquired the ability to eradicate those emotions for good.
Emura Chuuya: No longer will I be afraid. Never again will I be stirred to anger... No, I am filled now with only one emotion, and that is happiness. I have become humanity perfected!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: What I'm hearing is that you've developed your own unique understanding of psychological issues. So how about you play therapist this time? I have a couple of cases I'd love to hear your thoughts on.
Emura Chuuya: I would be delighted.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The first is a soldier with poor control of his temper. He flies off the handle too easily, and it gets him into all sorts of trouble. This is having a significant impact on his daily life, and he's developed symptoms of depression as a result.
Emura Chuuya: He simply needs to let go of his anger. Then, he will surely find peace and happiness.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The second is a fisherman who's developed thalassophobia. Now he is unable to provide for his family, which is causing him immense anxiety.
Emura Chuuya: Oh of course, he must cast his fear far away, and forget it ever existed. Then, he can return to the sea at once!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm sorry, but you're wrong on both counts.
Emura Chuuya: Oh?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The soldier's anger is rooted in his strongly held principles. Yes, his rage can make him reckless, but it also fuels his deep desire to stand against injustice.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Losing his anger made him passive and apathetic. He now stands by and does nothing as bandits attack innocent people.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The fisherman's fear made him one of the most reliable sailors around. Thanks to his cautiousness and diligence, accidents were a rare occurrence among his crew despite the dangers of their profession.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But after forgetting his fear, he destroyed the fruits of the entire crew's labor on his first return to the sea.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Fascinating, isn't it? Anger gives people the courage to stand up for what they believe in, and fear nurtures care and attention.
Emura Chuuya: Uh...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Emotions are integral to human dreams, and after many years of dealing with their dreams, the yumekui-baku have learned an important secret about human emotions:
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Negative emotions do not just go away — they will always be there. This is true for everyone.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Not only that, but their presence is essential. You can't have a healthy human psyche without negative emotion.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, do you have any idea what you've done to those poor men?
Emura Chuuya: ...What an amusing theory. In fact, I do remember those two, but I'm afraid that the only emotion I sense in them now is happiness.
Emura Chuuya: How can you believe that negative emotions are required for a healthy psyche? It's a laughable theory. Don't you remember how I was when we first met? You call that "healthy"?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Acknowledging that negative emotions exist doesn't mean giving them free reign over our minds and lives. Humans have a whole gamut of emotions. They're supposed to keep each other in balance.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But if that balance gets disrupted, emotions start working against each other. Untethered rage cripples the capacity to be careful and considerate. Uncontained fear drives people to abandon beliefs they once held dear.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The person you were when you first came to my practice only proves this further.
Emura Chuuya: Uh... I... I...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You were dominated by your emotions. Under their influence, you deliberately inflicted pain on other people. Meanwhile, the person you are now is so lost that you aren't even aware of the pain you're bringing to others.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This diagnosis is going to sound harsh, but I'm afraid it's accurate:
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You've simply gone from one extreme to another. You say you've reached perfection, but you're just as dysfunctional now as where you started.
Emura Chuuya: You... Hahaha... How entertaining. Still... There's no need for me to argue back. You have failed to provoke me...
Emura Chuuya: I will forgive you for this offense, because I know my present perfection to be a fact. I have direct and incontrovertible evidence.
Emura Chuuya: You once told me that nightmares are the result of a build-up of negative emotions. But ever since I acquired my present abilities, I never had another nightmare again.
Emura Chuuya: Clearly, that proves that all of my negative emotions have been definitively eradicated.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm afraid not. Look where we are right now... We're inside your nightmare.
Emura Chuuya: What...?
Paimon: No wonder! Paimon knew something was up the moment we arrived...
Traveler: I knew it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The enemies that we encountered were manifestations of his negative emotions. That can only happen in a nightmare.
Emura Chuuya: No... That can't be...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That entity claimed it could remove your negative emotions. But all it did was separate them and store them deep in your subconscious beyond your reach. There, they were left to fester.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Your situation is far worse than that of the other victims... It has deceived you at a much deeper level. You can't even perceive that at this very moment, you're in the middle of a nightmare.
Emura Chuuya: Haha... How laughable... Fear? No, there is no fear left in me... This is all just a terrible joke... This is no dream! No... Argh...
Paimon: Something's appeared behind him...
Kuroyume (???): Hahaha... So, my arch-nemesis has seen through my trickery.
Kuroyume (???): Clearly, you came prepared... The emotional cocoon I had wrapped him in was all but impenetrable, yet still you managed to tear it down.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, it IS you... Just as I thought.
Paimon: What is that?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: A nightmare monster... A fearsome youkai that was once the bane of Inazuma.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We yumekui-baku eat the nightmares of humans, while they called those nightmares their home. So, we were natural enemies.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #When I heard Traveler recount that strange dream, I knew that this was a possibility...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But it's still a shock to see one of our long-lost arch-enemies in the flesh. They were supposed to have gone extinct long ago...
Kuroyume: Then allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is Kuroyume, and I am the last of my kind.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Kuroyume... That's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time. How have you survived all these years?
Kuroyume: Likewise, Yumemizuki is a name that takes me back to a different age... Although I must say — we may be born enemies, but I have never felt any great animosity towards you personally.
Kuroyume: Ultimately, the fall of the nightmare-monsters was the fault of our hosts. Humans are such fragile creatures...
Kuroyume: But now, I have found a way to revive my kind, and you are too late to stop me!
Emura Chuuya: Ugh!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh no... We've got to catch up to him!

## Talk 4

Emura Chuuya: What...?
Paimon: No wonder! Paimon knew something was up the moment we arrived...
Traveler: I knew it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The enemies that we encountered were manifestations of his negative emotions. That can only happen in a nightmare.
Emura Chuuya: No... That can't be...

Kuroyume: But now, I have found a way to revive my kind, and you are too late to stop me!
Emura Chuuya: Ugh!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh no... We've got to catch up to him!

## Talk 5

Yumemizuki Mizuki: I used my powers to cushion our fall... Is everyone alright?
Paimon: Don't worry, we've fallen from bigger heights before... The bigger issue here is that he got away, and we were so close! Gah...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We've been completely cut off. That creature has taken complete control of his consciousness... We'll never catch him.
Paimon: Hmm... Would it be easier if we wake up now and go catch him in the real world? If this is his nightmare, he must be asleep somewhere, right?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Remember the fragrance we smelled on our way in? That's how the monster lures people into the dream state. Now we're inside, we can't get out unless we manage to defeat him in his true form.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: He's turned Emura Chuuya's nightmare into his lair. There's only one way to force him into the open, and that's by finding a way to eat this nightmare.
Paimon: Eat this nightmare? But is that even possible?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Not only is it possible, Paimon, it's quite literally my job.
Paimon: Paimon knows that! It's just... we all saw what happened to Murasaki and Shion, and this nightmare is super intense... Paimon's worried this won't turn out well.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...This monster has harmed too many people. We have to stop it.
Traveler: But, Mizuki...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's okay, I knew what I was getting into. Let's get moving.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Hmm... We may not have caught him, but our chase wasn't in vain. He led us deep inside his dream... We should now be at the subconscious layer that makes up its core.
Paimon: It's so dark...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That's what happens if you leave your negative emotions to fester...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: There must be a lot of emotional fragments in this place. We need to follow them one by one, until we reach our destination.
Paimon: Wait, but what is our destination?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Where the light is.

## Talk 6

"Father": If I say it's your fault, it's your fault! Do you understand me!?
"Father": You shouldn't go running around with that stupid thing in your hand! Do you want to go hungry tonight?
Paimon: Uhh... The atmosphere here is so oppressive. Is it anger? Or fear?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Be careful. Every time we draw near to one of these fragments, we'll experience the underlying emotion on a visceral level.

## Talk 7

"Father": You? A writer? Didn't they reject you already?
"Father": Get rid of this trash. Go find a real job!
Paimon: Aw... Poor guy, Paimon feels so bad for him...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...We shouldn't stay here. Let's keep moving.

## Talk 8

Classmate: Haha... I won. Another round?
Classmate: ...That guy? He never joins in with anything. Why should we go out of our way to invite him?
Classmate: Let's keep playing. Ignore him.
Paimon: Wow, that's so sad...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Nope, not here, either...
Paimon: Hmm... *gasp* Look! There's the light!

## Talk 9

Emura Chuuya (Young) (Emura Chuuya): *sob*...
Paimon: What is this place...?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's his sorrow... Yes, sheer overwhelming sorrow...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Human emotions exist in a delicate balance. When that balance is lost, negative emotions spiral out of control, and go on to fuel nightmares.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: By isolating these negative emotions and allowing them to fester, that monster has completely destroyed his emotional balance. That's why he was able to create such a powerful nightmare.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If we want to restore balance, we have to dispose of the excess negative emotion.
Paimon: Ah, so that's what you mean when you talk about "eating nightmares"?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Well done, Paimon. Very clever.
Paimon: Alright... what's the next step?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I need to find a way to separate the negative emotions out. For that, I need a special medium...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Sorrow might just do the job. As long as it's kept in check, it can calm the waves of emotions and help him regain some measure of control.
"Mother": Let it out, Chuuya, let the tears flow. You'll feel better after a good cry.
Emura Chuuya (Young) (Emura Chuuya): *sob*...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This process will untangle his unbridled fear and anger, his unresolved resentment, and his unshakeable despair...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: These excess emotions will be separated out from the rest. They are the source of this nightmare.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...Argh!
Paimon: Mizuki!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's alright... It's an unpleasant flavor, but I've tasted it thousands of times.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: A good cry can work wonders, even though he seems beyond helping... I think he should be able to take another step out from the swamp of despair now.
"Mother": Are you ready to come out now, Chuuya?
"Mother": I'll be waiting for you right here, son. I'd love to listen to more of your stories, whenever you're ready.
Emura Chuuya (Young) (Emura Chuuya): ...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Phew... Alright, there goes that nightmare. Hopefully, this marks the beginning of a sweeter dream...
Paimon: Amazing... Suddenly, Paimon feels so relaxed, and maybe even... happy?
Kuroyume: ...I thought I had found the perfect host. But you found the one weakness in his emotional armor...
Paimon: Aah! He's back again!
Kuroyume: Freeing a single host from my clutches changes nothing. You cannot stop me! I told you, you are too late!

## Talk 10

Paimon: What is this place?
Traveler: A new dream?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I can't believe it... He's brought us to the borderland...
Paimon: "Borderland"?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: To put it simply, it's a dream within a dream... A space hidden deep within the collective Inazuman subconscious. A dream that can exist even without a host.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This must be how that monster managed to survive the extinction of his kind... he hid here.
Paimon: Mizuki, that eye...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: He's trying to turn this place into a nightmare so he'll be more at home... And he's creating copies of himself...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: This place is connected to the dreams of every human in the nation. From here, he can place a copy of himself in every dream.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If he succeeds, then he'll have effectively revived his kind already...
Paimon: Then we know what we need to do: We gotta take this guy down! ...Do we think a sword will do the job?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Maybe — if we can get close enough to reach his core... But he's brought the nightmares of all of his victims here, and that gives him an immense amount of power.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Dealing with this many in one go is going to take a different approach. We need a power to rival his nightmares... the power of sweet dreams.
Paimon: Sweet dreams? Where are we gonna find those?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Lost minds — there should be some around here, and some of them will have come from sweet dreams originally... Come on, follow me!

## Talk 11

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Chasing tanuki through the woods, and climbing trees to hunt for onikabuto...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Thank you for lending us your happiness.

## Talk 12

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Watching fireworks fly up into the sky, and writing wishes on a prayer plaque...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Thank you for sharing your passion.

## Talk 13

Yumemizuki Mizuki: The core should be just up ahead. This will be a tough fight...
Paimon: Why? Are these sweet dreams not... sweet enough?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I just wish we could've gathered some more... But these are all we could find in the immediate vicinity.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Which means, we're running out of time. Our chances of success are shrinking by the minute — we have to act now.
Paimon: No problem! We're ready to go!

## Talk 14

Kuroyume: Gah... I must confess, I am somewhat confused. Both of us bring happiness to humans now. Why must you still treat me as your enemy?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Because the happiness you provide is a lie. All you do is make them forget that their negative emotions exist, and now they're living under the illusion that they're gone for good.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: All the while, these repressed feelings continue to fester in their subconscious, eventually becoming nightmares intense enough to become your home.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Your kind has always thrived by magnifying your hosts' negative emotions for your own gain. What you're doing now is no different from what you've always done.
Kuroyume: Incorrect... This time, I shall change the fate of my entire kind!
Kuroyume: When a human becomes dominated by their negative emotions, they lose their ability to survive. That is how my kin died out.
Kuroyume: But I can give them a fantasy instead, turning them into the perfect hosts, capable of surviving no matter how dire the situation in their subconscious gets.
Kuroyume: This is the path to our revival! My kin shall rise again!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...You do realize what that means, don't you? You've just gone from one extreme to the other.
Kuroyume: Oh, I am perfectly aware. There is nothing you can say that I do not already know... For over all the years that your kind has been learning about the human mind, I have been hiding here, watching, and learning from the fruits of your labor.
Kuroyume: But I'm afraid I could not care less for the moral burdens that you impose upon yourselves. The health of the human psyche is of precisely zero interest to me.
Kuroyume: Now, here is a question well worth thinking about... If we allowed the humans themselves to decide, which of us would they really choose? You? Or me?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...
Kuroyume: Do you see now? I won this battle long before you ever set foot inside this dream!
Paimon: Aaah, what's going on!?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: He's growing stronger... But we've exhausted the power of the sweet dreams already...
Traveler: So we need more sweet dreams then?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Even if we could find more sweet dreams now, it still wouldn't be enough... Ugh!
Kuroyume: If you accept that negative emotions are an immutable presence in the human mind, then you must also know that such emotions include apathy and sloth.
Kuroyume: Without the yumekui-baku there to hold their hand and walk them through dream regulation therapy, do you honestly think that anyone would ever be inclined to embrace their negative emotions?
Kuroyume: No, they would sooner run from reality, to forget all about their troubles, and live inside an illusion!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But, the whole reason I wanted to become a psychologist...
Traveler: Mizuki!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: These feelings... So that's how they should taste?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Longing, caused by separation... So bitter, and yet the experience led to a whole new journey for you. If you keep pressing on, maybe even more precious memories await...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Despair, caused by failure... Icy-cold, and yet in conquering this despair you gained the courage to face the lightning.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Regret, caused by missed opportunity... A harsh aftertaste, and yet it's only through that loss that we can learn to appreciate everything we have.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: And after all these flavors comes... sweetness, passion, and refreshed hope. So, that's why I was able to taste a sweet dream at our first meeting...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Long before you ever met me, you'd already gained the courage to never avoid or run away from your feelings... And all your nightmares had become the fuel for sweeter dreams.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The power that you have gained by processing everything from your long journey is surely far stronger than any power wielded by that creature.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The whole reason I wanted to become a psychologist... was to try and help people become someone like you.

## Talk 15

Kuroyume: Impossible... With just one person's dream, you... But how? ...I have been planning this for so long...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Once the false dream he created has been destroyed, I can make sure all his victims make a full recovery.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I don't think I ever would have been able to do this without your help...
Paimon: Hehe, don't mention it!
Kuroyume: Hmph... You shall join my ancestors in death... You, and my failure of a host...
Paimon: What? He's still not dead!? ...Wait, does anyone else hear water? Where is that coming from?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Maybe he made his host build some kind of device in the underwater cave? Once he realized we were onto him, he decided to sacrifice his host...
Paimon: So you mean... we're in danger in the real world too!?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We've got to wake up!
Paimon: But how? Like... pinch ourselves?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #This should be high enough... Traveler, Paimon, jump!
Paimon: Huh!?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If you're afraid, then just take my hand, and close your eyes.
Traveler: I assume I'm not allowed to open them again until you say so?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Yes — just like the last time!

## Talk 16

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Phew... It's finally over. It's a good thing I had the foresight to ask them for help, or I'd be the one dying from indigestion tonight...
Traveler: My good dreams helped, right?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Mhm. They were very delicious.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler, could I pick your brain with another question? What do you think humans tend to have more of, happy dreams, or bad ones?
Traveler: Happy ones?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If only that were true...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Most people struggle to deal with their negative emotions. They bottle them up inside, until they've festered and turned into nightmares.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: As a result, humans have far more bad dreams than good ones. And most happy dreams are short and fleeting. They are so rare that it's basically impossible for them to be shared with others.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Heck, there are even people out there who only have the mind space to have happy dreams after they've given us their bad ones...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Which is all to say that the dreams we get to taste are usually bad ones. No matter how hard we try, we can't seem to change this state of affairs.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I once believed that the only reason we yumekui-baku existed was to serve as a disposal method for nightmares. It's a fate that we cannot escape, no matter how many dreams we eat, or how many years pass by...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Even though I call myself a clinical psychologist, I also have dark thoughts sometimes. I suppose that's the only problem I have.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Still, after learning the principles of psychology, I came up with a new way to look at all of this.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If we can use psychotherapy to help people to come to terms with their emotions, they'll gain the ability to deal with their nightmares on their own, so they'll no longer need to call upon us for assistance.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That way, more and more people can free up their minds for truly happy dreams, until there'll be enough to share around.
Traveler: That's a beautiful wish.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Haha, a naive one, more like. Even though I've run this business for quite a long time now, it still hasn't come true — not even once.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, I must thank you. Because after meeting you, I finally became sure that my wish is achievable.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: And knowing that is all the treatment I need against the dark thoughts I sometimes have.
Paimon: There you are! Paimon's been looking everywhere for you two!
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: Paimon was just watching the baku eat the nightmares. They got really full, and started rolling around on their tummies. It was sooo cute... Anyway, that's why Paimon fell behind. Got a little distracted watching them, heh.
Paimon: Oh, and speaking of baku, we were gonna book another appointment with you, weren't we? Remember, before we got caught up in all those nightmare shenanigans...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's a little late for that now. Ask me again tomorrow.
Paimon: Oh...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Still, the night is young. Want to stay here and watch the moon with me for a little longer?
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: Bad dreams?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You've noticed it too, then?

## Talk 17

Yumemizuki Mizuki: The moon sure is beautiful tonight.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Yae Miko: Don't tell Mizuki about our conversation, by the way. If she asks, just say that you figured it out all by yourself.
