Traveler: What are you calculating?
Farghani: Before I answer your question, let me ask you one: What do you think Teyvat is like?
Farghani: You don't have to respond, just think.
Farghani: I have a revolutionary idea... If Teyvat was round, that would explain a lot of things.
Farghani: Why are there currents in oceans? Why would the sun and moon alternate rising? Why would there be changes in temperature?
Farghani: All that could be explained with the round-earth theory!
