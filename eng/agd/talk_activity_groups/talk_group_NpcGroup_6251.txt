## Talk

Caholom: Good day, I'm the high priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind. Can I help you with something?

## Talk

Traveler: Ooh, a "high priest"...
Caholom: Ah, please don't expect too much from this title. Here, a high priest is just a priest with more experience.
Caholom: There's more than one high priest, and "high" does not refer to any kind of status or ability.
Caholom: ...Sorry, I don't mean to shirk any responsibility by saying this. I'm just doing this in hopes that visitors will get a general understanding of our tribe.
Caholom: Well, let's get back on track. Come see me if you need any help from us.

## Talk

Traveler: We meet again!
Caholom: So you're the one the prophecies spoke of. Welcome back once again to the Obsidian Altar.
Caholom: Please relax and stretch your legs, just as you would when you travel the world.
Caholom: Our tribesfolk don't often engage proactively with foreigners, so you might earn yourself quite a few curious looks.
Caholom: But please don't worry â€” we might know a few "tricks" that are difficult for foreigners to get, but trust me, we do not have any line-of-sight hexes or things like that.

Traveler: Not at the moment.
Caholom: That's good, that's good.
