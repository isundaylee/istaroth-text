# Farewell to the Past


## Talk 1

Raiden Shogun: Once again, please leave them to me.
Paimon: Hey, hey! A—Are you sure you're alright? You're scaring us!
Raiden Shogun: Fear not. Fighting is what I do best.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ei, maybe you should leave this one to us.
Traveler: You don't look too good.
Raiden Shogun: I...
Raiden Shogun: My apologies.
Paimon: Don't worry about it! Just take a breather and get your strength back.
Paimon: We'll deal with the monsters!
Paimon: Look... that's the same light again.
Traveler: Time for another trip down memory lane.
Fujiki: Wh—Where am I?
Fujiki: Who are you... *gasp* Almighty Shogun, you're here too!
Fujiki: Are you injured, Your Excellency?
Raiden Shogun: Ahem... I'm quite alright. Just feeling a little stiff.
Fujiki: We, the Shogunate samurai, will defend the Shogun until the very end!
Fukami: Come on, men! They're coming back for more, let's get them!
Raiden Shogun: Don't. It's too dangerous.
Fujiki: Danger is our duty, Ma'am! If we were the kind to shy away from danger, we never would've taken up arms to begin with.
Fukami: No need to worry, Almighty Shogun. When the situation looks bleak, we will draw on the power granted to us by the gods.
Paimon: Is that a Vision?
Fujiki: It certainly is. I know the gods are omnipotent, and their willingness to grant their power to humans means that they have high expectations for us.
Fujiki: If the Almighty Shogun is in trouble, now of all times is the moment for us to honor that.
Paimon: So that's how samurai of that era understood Visions, huh...
Traveler: So full of hope.
Fukami: Nobody knew where Your Excellency had gone, and we were starting to despair. But now we've found you. You are right here with us.
Fukami: Just the sight of you appearing before us once more has reignited the hope in our hearts.
Fukami: This hope is the light that will guide us out from the darkness.
Fujiki: Everyone, on me!
Paimon: We'll help too!
Fujiki: Huh...?
Fujiki: Affirmative. But watch your backs!
Traveler: An unwavering commitment to resistance.
Traveler: Who have we got this time...
Traveler: Don't force it.

## Talk 3

Fujiki: It seems like their attacks are finally over.
Fukami: Huh, I've never fought so fiercely before!
Raiden Shogun: Thank you all...
Paimon: Umm... Are you okay? Maybe you should keep resting...
Raiden Shogun: I'm fine. I feel much better already.
Fujiki: You fought phenomenally. It was truly awe-inspiring.
Fujiki: The monsters will definitely come back. And when they do, it'll be more than a few rifthounds this time.
Fujiki: Quickly, escort Her Excellency back to Inazuma City, and regroup with the general's forces as soon as possible.
Fukami: When everyone sees the Almighty Shogun safely returning, their spirits will be lifted.
Paimon: Well... what're you guys gonna do?
Fujiki: We will stay here and guard against the monsters' advance. We cannot afford to let them get any further.
Fujiki: We are brothers in arms. As long as we stick together, we can face any number of monsters that come our way.
Paimon: *gulp*...
Traveler: (We have no business disrupting the reality they are experiencing.)
Fukami: Just leave it to us! Fighting is what we do best!
Fukami: But the Almighty Shogun is the only one of us with the power to change the present state of affairs. Only Her Excellency can turn back the tide of despair and lead us onward into the future.
Fukami: No matter what kind of threat faces Inazuma, we will always place our faith in the Almighty Shogun!
Raiden Shogun: ...
Raiden Shogun: Thank you all very much. I promise you that I will create a bright future for Inazuma.
Raiden Shogun: I should not have left it this late to make this promise. But from this moment forth, know that I shall be true to my word.
Fukami: Don't worry, Your Excellency. We will never doubt your word as long as we live!
Fukami: With you leading us, we will claim back everything that Inazuma has lost!
Fujiki: Glory to the Shogun!
Fujiki: Glory to the Shogun!
Paimon: ...They're gone.
Traveler: Was that a promise to them...?
Raiden Shogun: It was both.
Raiden Shogun: The people's sacrifice has always caused me immense pain, but in dwelling on the tragedy, I overlooked their splendor... The grief blinded me to how brightly they shone in their final moments.
Raiden Shogun: The result being that in the centuries since their sacrifice, I have dishonored their will.
Raiden Shogun: You could take the view that whatever I say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the Ley Lines.
Raiden Shogun: But even so, they are due a resolution... I owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
Paimon: Well... Paimon thinks that even if it's a few hundred years later, you're doing right by them now. And that's what counts.
Raiden Shogun: Thank you for your comforting words. But this is my basic duty as Inazuma's archon, and I have neglected it for far too long.
Raiden Shogun: I used to think just like that samurai... that I was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
Raiden Shogun: But what Inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like Makoto.
Raiden Shogun: Even though I am utterly unlike Makoto, and can never become the person she was, I still need to do the things that she would have done.
Traveler: Humans are worthy of your trust.
Raiden Shogun: Yes, they are. They are strong and resilient, and have much to be proud of.
Raiden Shogun: As the Raiden Shogun they revere, I should not be the one to hold them back.
Paimon: Well said! Sounds to Paimon like you've figured things out.
Raiden Shogun: Change will come to Inazuma, and with it, new possibilities. This will take time, but eventually, the future will bring healing to the scars of the past.
Raiden Shogun: No matter how long it takes, I am committed to bringing this to fruition. This is my promise.
Raiden Shogun: Now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. It does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
Raiden Shogun: I will leave the Tenryou and Yashiro Commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
Paimon: Alrighty then! Let's move on.
Paimon: Ei looks calm on the outside, but Paimon bets her emotions must be all over the place right now, huh?
Paimon: She seems to have changed a lot since we last met her.
Paimon: ...Hmm?
Paimon: What's wrong, Ei? C'mon, keep up.
Raiden Shogun: Ugh...
Traveler: Ei!
Paimon: What's going on? Are you feeling unwell again?
Raiden Shogun: My body... I can't move it.
Raiden Shogun: It looks like the situation is more serious than I thought.
Traveler: Do you need to take a rest?
Raiden Shogun: No need. "She" is calling me. The time has come.
Raiden Shogun: #Can you help me walk, {NICKNAME}?
Raiden Shogun: I need to go to the cave below the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Paimon: Why? What's in there?
Raiden Shogun: A battleground... One where I shall sever ties with the past and take the first steps into the future.
Traveler: We should get you back to the city.
Traveler: Or a promise to yourself?
Traveler: Great, thanks. I appreciate it.

## Talk 4

Raiden Shogun: We're finally here. The entrance should be nearby...
Paimon: Whoa, where'd that torii gate come from?
Traveler: Are you alright?
Raiden Shogun: It's getting worse again... But it's fine, I'm about to put an end to it all.
Raiden Shogun: This is a place I once sealed off with my own hands... The entrance to Raiden Makoto's realm of consciousness.
Raiden Shogun: It looks like "she" will no longer allow me to do with this body as I please.
Paimon: Huh? What are you talking about? And who is "she" — Makoto?
Raiden Shogun: Follow me.
Paimon: Where are we g— aah, aaah aaaah!!!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Ugh... Paimon's dizzy, where did we get sucked into this time...
Paimon: Whoa! This place...
Traveler: It does look a lot like the Plane of Euthymia.
Paimon: Look! Look, over there!
Paimon: It's another Ei!
Raiden Shogun: We meet again, Traveler.
Raiden Shogun: This body is an assistant to the one within. But it is also the guardian of the rules.
Raiden Shogun: Should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
Paimon: Wait, Paimon knows that voice... is that... the puppet!?
Raiden Shogun: You have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
Raiden Shogun: You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?
Raiden Shogun: But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
Raiden Shogun: I'm here to show you my answer.
Raiden Shogun: We are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
Paimon: Uhhh, wait, wait, wait, the atmosphere in here just took a turn for the worse!
Paimon: A—Are you, uh, are you alright now?
Raiden Shogun: The discomfort I was experiencing earlier was caused by the Shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
Raiden Shogun: As she indicates, once I started entertaining the idea of change, I became hostile in her eyes.
Raiden Shogun: But inside a realm of consciousness, I exist independently of her. She cannot affect me in this way.
Raiden Shogun: Though she is a puppet, the Shogun has her own consciousness, too. When necessary, she appears here to confront me.
Traveler: I think you've mentioned this before...
Paimon: Uh... Paimon gets that everyone has their internal battles and stuff, but... not like this! It's a bit extreme!
Paimon: Ei's showdown with the Shogun... Never thought we'd see that day.
Raiden Shogun: The rules I set for the Shogun are... no, the Shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. It shall not be easily swayed.
Raiden Shogun: I would not try to change her if it wasn't necessary.
Paimon: Isn't there any other way? Can't you... talk it through? ...Or something?
Traveler: Ei isn't someone who leaves herself an escape route.
Paimon: But they both just want the best for Inazuma...
Raiden Shogun: My form is a symbol of supreme majesty, in which has been vested power over all the realm. It is the cohesive embodiment of all that constitutes the "Raiden Shogun."
Raiden Shogun: It inherits Ei's pain — the pain of inevitable loss that comes as she moves forward. So too does it inherit her determination to reach eternity.
Raiden Shogun: Every action undertaken is for the sake of resisting erosion.
Raiden Shogun: Determination, courage, love, hatred... All of these will be degraded and distorted by the incessant flow of time.
Raiden Shogun: Only rules shall remain constant for eternity.
Raiden Shogun: Those were my thoughts when I created you.
Raiden Shogun: Now they are towering obstacles that I have no choice but to overcome.
Raiden Shogun: You wish to make yourself my enemy?
Raiden Shogun: I am your past, the everlasting law, the guardian of eternity.
Raiden Shogun: And I am she who promised a dream to her subjects... Raiden Ei.
Traveler: This is her system to safeguard against modifications to eternity?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Have you finally defeated her?
Raiden Shogun: It appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
Raiden Shogun: But how long can your will remain strong?
Paimon: How the heck...
Traveler: Surely the Shogun puppet isn't invincible...?
Raiden Shogun: In this realm of consciousness, her existence is tenacious indeed.
Raiden Shogun: She was built to resist erosion. Her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
Paimon: Then... does that mean this is gonna be a never-ending battle?
Raiden Shogun: Maybe. But I have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. The future I shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
Raiden Shogun: If I don't do this, the Shogun's rules can never change, and Inazuma can never move forward.
Raiden Shogun: This is my duty. No matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... And no matter how many times we must fight, I will defeat her.
Traveler: What will happen to Inazuma in the meantime?
Raiden Shogun: Five hundred years ago, humanity proved their strength in battle.
Raiden Shogun: Here in the present, they rely on their ambition to challenge wayward practices, tear them out like the diseased wood of an old sakura tree, so that new, healthy branches might spring to life in their place.
Raiden Shogun: It is about time that I learned to trust them.
Traveler: But can you bear to leave humanity to go alone?
Raiden Shogun: I understand that. But if the dreams of which Makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the Shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
Raiden Shogun: I fight for the everlasting future of Inazuma. However long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
Raiden Shogun: I vow to the subjects of Inazuma that I shall one day return. This is my oath. Please be my witness.
Raiden Shogun: During my absence, I place everything in Miko's hands.
Paimon: But, but this means that—
Raiden Shogun: Pass on my words.
Traveler: Ei!
Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: Everyone looks to the Shogun for hope.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Looks like we got kicked out...
Paimon: What do we do? Are we really just gonna leave Ei and the Shogun to keep on duking it out in there forever!?
Paimon: She was making sense, and maybe this is the only way to change the Shogun's rules, but still...
Traveler: Ei has no physical body anymore, and has to rely on the Shogun.
Paimon: Right? Also, Ei can be pretty stubborn at times, and has a history of rushing into difficult situations...
Paimon: What if she gets too obsessed with winning, and she forgets why she's there in the first place? It could happen... And then she might never leave again!
Traveler: We're not about to leave her just yet.
Paimon: Yeah! We should help her out, like we did last time. The quicker she gets through this, the better.
Paimon: Is there any way we can cut down how long she needs to spend in there? Or, y'know, help her win the fight?
Traveler: Umm...
Paimon: Well, whatever, we can't let anything bad happen to Ei while she's in there!
Paimon: ...Oh, but we also can't get in there anymore.
Paimon: Okay, well first things first, we gotta find a way back in! C'mon brain juice, don't fail Paimon now! Um, okay, maybe if we both ram into it at the same time, really really hard—
Traveler: We need to talk to Yae Miko.
Paimon: Oh, you're right! Paimon nearly forgot about her!
Paimon: Who knows if she really understands these consciousness realm-plane thingies more than we do... But there's no one else we can turn to. Alright, up the mountain we go!
Traveler: Our work here isn't done.
Traveler: But this cannot be the only way...

## Talk 8

Observe Teacup: (A cup of tea has been left for Furuyama.)
Observe Teacup: (How much did he actually perceive, and how much did he let on?)
