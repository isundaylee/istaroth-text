# Scroll of the Fiery Firmament

This Natlan woven scroll, depicting unique landscapes and containing hidden powers, is a souvenir brought back from Natlan by the Teapot Traveling Salesman, Chubby.
The patterns on the scroll bring certain images to mind, which you can manipulate via the power of Sub-Space Creation to recreate the wondrous sights of Natlan in your Realm Within...
