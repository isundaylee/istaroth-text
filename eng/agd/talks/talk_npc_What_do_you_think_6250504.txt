# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What do you think?
Chan Baatjan: From my perspective, neither is the right approach. You can substitute Fontainian cuisine for that which comes from other nations, and what I said would still stand.
Chan Baatjan: No two people have the same preferences, so there is no single dish that will earn the praise of every single person.
Chan Baatjan: It's the same as in literature. What's the point of fighting for the empty title of "the best"?
Chan Baatjan: As a chef, one should be humble when looking at new dishes, deconstructing them to learn the ingredients and the skills required to cook them.
Chan Baatjan: We should not blindly praise something that wasn't based on local ingredients, or be intentionally conservative, stalling progress thereby.
Chan Baatjan: Of course, these are just empty words. All I can do is point this out to my students, so they will always remember that they're chefs who strive to make better dishes.
Chan Baatjan: They should also communicate with their colleagues, learning new ideas and doing away with bad ones.
