# Every Day a New Adventure


## Talk 1

Katheryne: We meet again, avid adventurer.
Katheryne: Are your adventures going smoothly?
Traveler: I'm like a well-oiled adventuring machine.
Katheryne: That is the spirit. Keep it up!
Katheryne: It seems that you have a wealth of experience under your belt now. Time to introduce you to the formal work of the Guild.
Katheryne: The Guild receives requests from far and wide each day, and assigns <color=#00E1FFFF>commissions</color> to adventurers accordingly.
Katheryne: These commissioned adventures are the main source of compensation for our guild members.
Paimon: What kind of commissions are they?
Katheryne: It is a mixed bag! Anything from running an errand for fellow citizens to dealing with monsters. Some are textbook, others are extremely dangerous.
Katheryne: But you do not have to take my word for it. You should find out for yourself.
Katheryne: Here you can find the details of today's commissions.
Katheryne: Please report back to me upon completion. There will be a generous reward waiting for you.
Traveler: Just leave it to me.
Katheryne: #Excellent. I knew I could count on you, {NICKNAME}.
Katheryne: #I await your return with great anticipation, {NICKNAME}. Ad astra abyssosque!
Traveler: How generous are we talking?
Katheryne: Patience is a virtue! You will find out soon enough. I am sure you will not be disappointed.
Traveler: Actually, adventuring is quite taxing work.
Katheryne: It is always that way when you are starting out. Preparing properly before an adventure can help things go more smoothly.

## Talk 2

Katheryne: #You did a fine job, {NICKNAME}! Outstanding performance, considering it was your first time.
Katheryne: The requester even asked me to thank you on their behalf.
Katheryne: And, as promised, you are due your reward.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Oh, you shouldn't have! Except, you totally should.
Katheryne: This is a token of the Guild's gratitude.
Katheryne: We receive many new commissions every day, and without the efforts of each and every adventurer there is no way we could respond to them all.
Katheryne: If you complete enough commissions each day, you will be eligible to claim a special reward from me.
Katheryne: Your Adventurer Handbook keeps a record of how many adventures you complete each day.
Katheryne: Make sure you claim your daily rewards on the days that you complete sufficient adventures. There is a limited quantity of rewards, so it will become forfeit should you not claim it.
Traveler: Okay. Thanks for the explanation.
Katheryne: You're more than welcome. After all, you are the one helping me.
Katheryne: And please note that helping a fellow adventurer to complete a commission also counts towards your eligibility for a daily reward.
Katheryne: We encourage you to work actively with your fellow adventurers. Ad astra abyssosque!
Traveler: Only one reward per day?
Katheryne: As things currently stand, yes... My apologies.
Katheryne: But please be assured that we are constantly pushing Headquarters to make sure all our adventurers receive fair and adequate compensation.

## Talk 4

Katheryne: #I heard something through the grape vine, {NICKNAME}.
Katheryne: Word has it that you completed a <color=#00E1FFFF>commission</color>. The requester sends their thanks.
Katheryne: What commission? Refresh my memory.
Katheryne: You helped someone in need while you were out on the road.
Katheryne: In fact many of those you will meet have commissioned the Guild to assist.
Katheryne: Let me explain the Guild's system to you in a little more detail.
Katheryne: The Guild receives requests from far and wide each day, and assigns commissions to adventurers accordingly.
Katheryne: These commissioned adventures are the main source of compensation for our guild members.
Katheryne: On the subject of compensation, I should mention that the Guild has prepared a little something for you.
Katheryne: I was just being a Good Samaritan.
Katheryne: And that is exactly what makes you our avid new adventurer.
