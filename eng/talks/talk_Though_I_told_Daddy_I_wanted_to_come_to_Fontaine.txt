Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Though I told Daddy I wanted to come to Fontaine to see the Oceanids, my teacher said they all left Fontaine a long time ago..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I just didn't want Daddy to be working all the time, and to use his vacation to spend some time with me. Though I feel a little bit guilty seeing him take looking for the Oceanids so seriously, hehe..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "People of Fontaine of all ages, please tell me, should I tell him the truth, or keep hiding it from him?"
