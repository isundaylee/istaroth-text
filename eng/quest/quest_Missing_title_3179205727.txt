# Missing title (3179205727)

Traveler: Could you tell me about Hanachirusato...
Inagi Hotomi: Hanachirusato? I don't believe that any such person works at the Grand Narukami Shrine...
Inagi Hotomi: Speaking of which, we found an antique kitsune mask while cleaning up the shrine hall. It seems to have once belonged to Lady Kitsune Saiguu.
Inagi Hotomi: If you don't mind, would you like to have it? Since you were the one who completed the Cleansing Ritual, I believe there must be some fate that ties you, Lady Saiguu, and the shrine together.
Inagi Hotomi: It's become a little fragile with its great age, so you can't really wear it, but I believe it must at least bear some sentiments and blessings from bygone years.
