# Compiling the Clues


## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Layla: Okay, everyone's given us a lot of useful information. Let's go through it and try to organize everything.
Layla: Some things we heard were pretty straightforward, but others were just ridiculous...
Traveler: We should be able to figure out more about its identity and whereabouts.
Layla: Yeah, let me think and see what I can make of it.
Layla: (Okay, calm down Layla. I know the info's all over the place, but you can definitely do it.)
Layla: (First, let's try to figure out the Seelie's identity based on the clues we currently have.)
Layla: (Then, we'll analyze where it's been sighted and its motives... Finally, we'll piece everything together...)
Layla: (From there, we should be able to predict its movement. Alright, let's give it a try.)

### Additional Talk 2

Layla: Okay, I think I've got it now...
Traveler: So, what've you come up with?
Layla: First, based on the information Katayoun provided, we can assume that the Seelie is a student from the Rtawahist Darshan.
Layla: The possibility of it being someone outside the Darshan can be ruled out because it'd be impossible to gain access to those two books without going through the librarian.
Layla: Next, leaving its crazy abilities aside, all the sightings took place in locations that are officially recommended for astrology observation by the Akademiya.
Layla: In other words, it's probably just conducting research, and the nature of its research is very similar to mine.
Layla: The question that I submitted was no simple query, but it was able to give me a reply in just a day. This implies that it's familiar with a similar field of knowledge.
Layla: So, based on this reasoning, all we have to do is wait for it at the next astrological observation site.
Traveler: Your reasoning is solid.
Layla: Ah, uh... It's nothing, really. There are actually some other factors that I've been speculating about...
Layla: But that's not important right now, let's get going. Even though we have a lead, it's still hard to say whether we'll be able to make any discoveries.
Layla: I'll tell you what I mean by that if the Seelie doesn't show up...
Traveler: Look at you, finishing your thesis should be no problem at all.
