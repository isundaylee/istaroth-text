Traveler: Are you sure of your conclusions?
Kaushik: Of course. A researcher must always persist in their views. For instance, it doesn't matter how much everyone thinks that Mondstadt only has The Four Winds. Well, I reckon that there are five!
Kaushik: My hypothesis is flawless!
Kaushik: That shrine maiden at the Sangonomiya Shrine may shake her head at my conclusions, but it is she who has been blinded by her faith.
Kaushik: I mean, it's not like she has any evidence to show me herself, does she?
