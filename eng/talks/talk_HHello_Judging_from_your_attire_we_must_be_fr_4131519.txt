# Talk Dialog

Vlad: Hâ€”Hello... Judging from your attire, we must be from the same place, no?
Nadia: Hmm? Ah yes, hello. Sorry, I seldom meet other Snezhnayans around here.
Vlad: The Lantern Rite sure is beautiful, isn't it?
Nadia: Yes, but it seems that there's still much to come yet. The Mingxiao Lantern is the height of the festivities. At least, that's what I've heard.
Vlad: Ah yes, so it seems. I've only just arrived here recently... I've come here alone, so there are still many things I don't quite understand yet.
Nadia: Oh? I've also arrived recently myself, so I often come here alone to watch the ships sail in from Snezhnaya.
Vlad: ...Though I know that these boats rolling in and out of the port are not the ones to take me back home. Huh, what a coincidence... I also often come and watch the boats here.
Nadia: Are you sure we've never met before?
Vlad: Could we have met before? Perhaps my memory is failing me... I apologize, it would be impolite if I've forgotten.
Nadia: No, no, I'm sure we've never met. Though I feel that something is... awfully familiar when I'm speaking with you.
Vlad: Ah, is that so... Well, that's perfectly alright...
Nadia: The Lantern Rite... It sure is beautiful, isn't it?
