# Our Animal Friends: Epilogue

Zhenchen: #Traveler, I've heard from the staff that you've found all the transmitter-equipped animals.
Zhenchen: To be honest, that was quite a surprise to hear! Some of them are naturally sensitive and will flee the moment an unknown creature approaches.
Zhenchen: But they didn't seem to mind you getting close. Quite curious.
Traveler: Well, I am a friend to all animals.
Zhenchen: Haha! Enviable indeed.
Zhenchen: I was growled at or bitten the last few times the staff accompanied me to go feed the animals.
Zhenchen: I've even got scars on my arm to show for it... they hurt quite a bit, too.
Zhenchen: But even though these lovely creatures don't seem to like me much, I'm just glad that they're all well and happy.
Zhenchen: It's the same for all our adopters. Everyone just wants to protect the animals' habitat and leave them undisturbed.
Zhenchen: I know that for many adventurers, wild animals are an important source of food, and we're not asking Claw Convoy members to not hunt at all.
Zhenchen: But we do advocate against wanton capture and slaughter. If everyone could do that, there's no doubt that our environment would be even more diverse and beautiful.
Zhenchen: As one of our members, if would be great if you'd acknowledge and accept this principle as well.
Traveler: I shall.
Zhenchen: I knew a reasonable person like you would see eye to eye with us on this!
Zhenchen: Just putting that thought into peoples' minds is success enough for us.
Zhenchen: If we get the chance, I'd love to see you at our next Claw Convoy event.
Zhenchen: With any luck, though, I won't be sporting any fresh scars on my arm when that time comes.
Traveler: I'll reserve judgment for now.
Zhenchen: That's fine, we're not forcing everyone to accept this. Personally, I just think it would be great if everyone thought things through before taking an animal's life.
Traveler: It's one of my gifts as an adventurer.

Lamiya: There are still ways we could improve the Inscribed Mirror... We'll try adding some more features next time.
