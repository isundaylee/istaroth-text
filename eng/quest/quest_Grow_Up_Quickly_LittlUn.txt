# Grow Up Quickly, Littl'Un...?


## Talk 1

Tahmures: This is bad... This is really bad...
Traveler: Something gone wrong with Alem's training?
Tahmures: #{NICKNAME}! Thank goodness you're here...
Tahmures: There's no time to explain. Please help me save her!
Traveler: Is she a friend?
Tahmures: I—I guess you could say that. We've both broken down several times over our theses, even cried our hearts out in the library together...
Tahmures: Aaaah, but now's not the time for all this! She just wouldn't listen to me!
Tahmures: She said she'd do anything for her thesis, then set off with that guard of hers, rambling about the wilderness together for who knows how long!
Tahmures: But she still hasn't come back! And the tribe can't spare anyone to go rescue her...
Tahmures: #Please, {NICKNAME}, you have to go save her!
Traveler: Leave it to me, I can handle it.
Tahmures: #Anyway, please help me out, {NICKNAME}! I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Seriously, you people from the Akademiya...
Tahmures: That girl... *sigh* All I'll say is that her luck is truly shocking. She was even going on about making one last-ditch effort for her thesis in Natlan...
Traveler: Is she an acquaintance?

## Talk 2

Tahmures: Worst comes to worst, can't you just... not finish writing the thesis? Aaaah—

## Talk 3

Alrani: Thank you, thanks for your help...
Narzam: If I could have gotten rid of that damn bag earlier, I would have taken care of them all by myself.
Alrani: No way! Then we'd have come to Natlan for nothing!
Traveler: Hold up, are you... Alrani?
Alrani: #Huh? Y—You're {NICKNAME}, aren't you? It's really you!
Traveler: This lady next to you, surely it's not...
Narzam: Narzam, Treasure Hoarder. We've met before. You haven't forgotten, have you?
Alrani: Phew... You really are my savior! How many times have you saved me now? Once, twice...
Narzam: I hope you're not counting that time you were with me. That happened because you insisted on staying.
Alrani: Of course I'm not counting that time. And what do you mean I insisted on staying? I already paid you!
Narzam: Yeah, just about enough to cover food and drinks...
Traveler: Don't tell me you're here for your thesis again?
Alrani: Hehe, well... Given the countless hours of hard work I've put into it, I couldn't just let it all go to waste, could I...
Alrani: I applied for special funding from the Akademiya this time, and I even settled on a research topic as original as it gets.
Alrani: Besides, I have Narzam with me as my guard. She's chased all the bad guys away.
Narzam: Probably more just the fact that we're not carrying anything valuable enough to make it worth their while...
Traveler: But in the end...
Narzam: ...All this way, right from when we set out from the Children of Echoes, this girl's been clutching that bag with all her documents in as if it were a baby.
Narzam: To be honest, even to me, she looks like some fool clinging on to treasure.
Narzam: And someone carrying treasure, walking through an empty wilderness with only a single guard to protect her... Who wouldn't give that a try?
Alrani: Well, you're right about one thing... My bag is indeed full of treasure! Not only does it contain all my field interview records, but copies of various documents too.
Alrani: Armed with treasures like these, I'll have no problem writing my thesis!
Alrani: And my chosen topic — the "Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame." It's a subject of great importance, so I'll surely be able to graduate.
Alrani: Oh, and of course, I couldn't have done it without Tahmures. This was her idea in the first place! She really is a great friend, teehee...
Alrani: #Thank you once again, {NICKNAME}. If it wasn't for you, those bad guys would not only have ruined my books, they'd have stolen my money too!
Alrani: A while back, I finally managed to earn a bit of pocket money by helping organize some books and materials. If it had been stolen, I wouldn't be able to afford any new materials myself.
Narzam: True, but you'd end up spending all your money on books regardless. If I hadn't confiscated your wallet, we'd have gone hungry for sure...
Alrani: I—I don't buy that many books... do I...?
Alrani: Anyway, that's enough talk for now. We still need to head over to the People of the Springs to gather materials.
Alrani: Goodbye then! My thesis shall be finished next we meet — I guarantee it! And when that time comes, I'll treat you to a delicious meal!
Traveler: You still wound up running into trouble.

## Talk 4

Tahmures: So, how did it go?
Traveler: Alrani's safe and sound.
Tahmures: Phew... I was worried sick. If you'd have taken any longer, I'd have set off searching myself!
Tahmures: Couldn't that fool have picked a slightly simpler topic? With her ability, I'm sure she'd still get a high enough grade to graduate.
Tahmures: She always chooses such huge topics, does heaps of preparation, then ends up with nothing to show for it.
Tahmures: Apologies... I'm letting myself get carried away. Thank you for your help. Please, take these as payment.
Tahmures: *sigh* That halfwit... Why does she always make things so difficult for herself...
Traveler: She's still not done gathering materials.
