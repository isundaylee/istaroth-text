# Feast-O's

A golden brown fried snack. Mashed chicken is shaped into a hollow "O" shape by combining them with onion rings. Mashed fish and potatoes are similarly combined into a round form, making up the meat of the "feast." Put them both into a pot of hot oil and presto â€” your "Feast-O's" are born amidst the crackling oil.
