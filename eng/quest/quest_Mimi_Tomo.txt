## Talk 1

Paimon: ...Look! Someone's under attack!

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll say...
Traveler: Are you alright...?
Ella Musk: Phew... That was close. Good thing you came when you did...
Ella Musk: *sigh*...
Ella Musk: I don't understand, everything was going so well... What was it that I said?
Ella Musk: Well, anyway... Thank you for saving me...
Paimon: She looks really upset...
Ella Musk: Well... You saw what happened.
Ella Musk: My previous strategy of attempting to interact with hilichurls on my own is manifestly too risky...
Traveler: I see...
Traveler: Is there anything I can do?
Ella Musk: But still... It's a shame for a golden opportunity to converse with a hilichurl to just go to waste...
Ella Musk: It looks like my vocabulary compilation work for the dictionary is going to have to be postponed once again...
Traveler: I can help.
Ella Musk: If only I had someone who could verify the accuracy of the book's contents on my behalf...
Ella Musk: Râ€”Really? That's great! ...Right then, be sure to take this book with you!
Paimon: Wow... That was a fast transition from sulking to bossing us around...
Traveler: ...In principle?
Ella Musk: If you encounter any communication difficulties, you'll be able to resolve them simply by consulting this book! ...In principle, at least.
Paimon: You mean you don't even know what you wrote in your own book!?
Ella Musk: You only find out where the problems in your research lie through real-world application! Without putting them through their paces, how am I supposed to know for sure whether my theories hold water?
Ella Musk: Hmm... Nope, never mind, you probably wouldn't understand what I was about to say anyway. But that aside... thank you, once again, for saving me.
Traveler: Welcome to the crew!
Traveler: Since we've come this far already...
Ella Musk: Now, if you don't mind, I will join you. Let's go find a hilichurl to interact with.
