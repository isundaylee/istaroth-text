# Leroy: Hangman's Noose


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Traveler, look! Fresh Fish, and the floor looks clean too. Someone definitely just tidied up.
Paimon: There's someone in Benoit's house for sure. Let's go over and listen.
Athos: ...He's right, he can't just disappear altogether. At the very least, he needs to be seen once in a while... out on a walk or something like that.
Athos: If nothing else, it'll stop the neighbors from calling the Maison Gardiennage — I'd rather not have the Special Patrol's Musketeers breathing down our necks.
Morticia: Dad, you really want to go out for a walk, don't you?
Benoit Leroy: C—Can I?
Morticia: Of course you can! Not only that, but we'd be delighted to come with you.
Athos: Careful now — don't let him use it as an opportunity to call for help. Those two weirdos have been watching this place like hawks...
Morticia: Dad won't do that, I'm sure.
Morticia: Dad, you wouldn't want the Maison Gardiennage to know...
Paimon: ...To know what!? Why are they speaking so quietly? Paimon can't hear a thing.
Traveler: They're about to come out.
Paimon: Okay, we need to move a bit further away. This time, we have to think of a way to speak with Benoit, right?
Traveler: Yup.
Paimon: Alright, let's scoot.
Morticia: How is it, Dad? Are you feeling any better now?
Benoit Leroy: It's you!
Paimon: Benoit...
Benoit Leroy: ...Help me! Uh, I mean, don't help me...
Morticia: What are you saying, Dad? What's all this "help me, don't help me" business? Hehe.
Morticia: Oh, it's you two. No wonder Dad went out of his way to talk to you — you are acquainted, after all.
Benoit Leroy: ...N—No, I don't! We don't know each other at all!
Morticia: No? But why would they be waiting here just for you then, Dad?
Morticia: They were even nice enough to get the paper for us. Why, they even went to the Fleuve Cendre to talk to our old neighbor, Snodgrass.
Morticia: I think you must be very close! And no wonder. You've always loved kids, haven't you, Dad?
Morticia: I love kids too! But I'm afraid I'm not as selfless as my father. I love my own child the most, but... she's gone.
Traveler: Just what are you doing?
Morticia: Athos and I are our father's children. Dad loves us, and we love him too. Isn't it obvious?
Athos: Morticia, look at how lovely the weather is today. Perfect for a walk.
Morticia: So it is, Athos.
Athos: Have you seen today's Steambird? There are quite a few interesting stories.
Morticia: Oh dear, I fear I haven't.
Athos: There's one in particular about an old man who met an unfortunate end. Apparently, he encountered some thieves, and as there was no one by his side looking out for him, he ended up falling off a cliff and died.
Morticia: Oh, really? The horror! That's so terrible.
Athos: And another about a very unlucky merchant who drowned. It seems he drank too much, and walked into a lake in a stupor, and just like that... he drowned.
Morticia: Ah! My word! Truly unlucky!
Athos: #And this last one is very interesting! It's about a meddling busybody who just couldn't keep their nose out of other people's business. *sigh* He accidentally took the wrong medicine.
Athos: #He mistook poison for medicine for his illness, and just like that, swallowed the lot! And then ended up dying very, very painfully.
Morticia: Oh my! There really are so many ways to die. Please, go on.
Benoit Leroy: ...Sorry, sorry! I won't ever do that again.
Morticia: What ever are you talking about, Dad? We're not trying to say it's your fault or anything. But... you must be tired after running around so much.
Morticia: Athos, why don't we go back and read the newspaper to Dad? You subscribe to a lot of papers, don't you, Dad?
Athos: That's right! We've been chatting long enough. We ought to go back now.
Morticia: Let's go back together, Daddy dearest.
Traveler: Why did you do this?
Morticia: Do you mean accompanying our dad on a walk? It's our duty as his children to do so, is it not? Failing such a basic responsibility to him would be a poor way to repay the care he has given us.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Something's fishy, something's fishy... Even Paimon can tell that there's something off about all this!
Paimon: #Traveler, you're the brighter spark here. What should we do next?
Traveler: Benoit wants help but insists that he doesn't...
Paimon: Then how about we go take another look near Benoit's house? Wasn't there a strange box by his back window?
Paimon: There's definitely something hidden in there, and it might just be the proof you're looking for...
Traveler: That couple may have come from the Fleuve Cendre...
Traveler: From their reactions, I'd say that there are some hidden factors at work...
Traveler: I have some theories, but no evidence to back them up.

## Talk 6

Athos: Considering how persistent you two are, I didn't expect you to just leave it at that.
Athos: I thought you'd go running to the Maison Gardiennage, but you didn't. Looks like you have a few ideas of your own.
Traveler: Why are you keeping Benoit here?
Athos: To tell you the truth, you've impressed me quite a bit. If you'd only put your enthusiasm to better use, you'd have bright futures ahead of you.
Athos: It's just a shame that you won't be getting anywhere with this. *sigh* You really aren't afraid, are you?
Traveler: You picked the wrong person to intimidate.
Athos: Oh? So do you really not have a clue what's going on here, or is it because you think you're on the side of justice?
Athos: Incidentally, there was an article recently about a merchant who drowned — his name was Brandt. That fellow sure had a way with words alright...
Athos: Guess what? According to the paper, it turns out he didn't drown after all, but was in fact murdered and thrown into the lake.
Athos: After a very long investigation, all that the Marechaussee Phantom was able to conclude was that he was murdered, and that the murderer was guilty of a heinous crime.
Athos: So that's what the news report said. Who knows what actually happened, or even which one of them deserved to die more — the murderer, or the victim?
Athos: Hmm... A tough question, isn't it? I haven't decided what the answer is yet either.
Athos: Anyway, I digress! This has nothing to do with what we need to discuss.
Paimon: What are you trying to say?
Athos: I'm saying that acting recklessly before you've fully understood a situation is foolish, and might bring about some undesirable consequences.
Traveler: Witnessing injustice and doing nothing... That is true folly.
Athos: Haha... Well, perhaps if we'd met under different circumstances, we'd be friends.
Athos: Though I like the way you think, I have things to do.
Athos: This is as far as my patience can be stretched. Next time I see you two anywhere near my house, I'll do something about it — mark my words.
Black Screen Text: After muttering something inexplicable, Athos leaves.
Black Screen Text: His bizarre attitude surprises you, and you start to wonder what position you should take in the matter...
Black Screen Text: You suddenly hear a faint tapping sound coming from the back window, and then after a barely audible creak, a note drops down from the window...
Black Screen Text: There is brown writing on the note. It looks like someone wrote it in a real hurry, and it appears that they used coffee to do so...
Paimon: Quick, see what it says!
Paimon: It's Benoit!
Traveler: Shh!
Paimon: ...Sorry! Anyway, let's keep an eye out for the food bowl and wait for his signal.
Traveler: Whenever I witness injustice, I take action.
Traveler: How are you two actually related to Benoit?
