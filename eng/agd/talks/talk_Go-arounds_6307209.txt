Traveler: "Go-arounds"?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Why, of course! Not to boast or anything, but I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I traveled through Inazuma previously. Not a single fighter of note to be found, I tell you! Disappointing, is what it was!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": That's why I've returned to Liyue recently. I mean, who knows, maybe some new talent has arisen while I away that might be worth a bout or two.
