Cyno: By the way, something strange happened a few days ago.
Cyno: A merchant approached me and requested that I cover the cost of a "Desert Travel Kit." One million, two hundred and fifty thousand Mora.
Cyno: I didn't remember owing anyone Mora, especially not that kind of amount. So I arrested the merchant on charges of provocation and disturbing the peace.
Cyno: Do you know anything about this?
Paimon: Uh, noâ€”nope... Paimon has no idea what that could be!
