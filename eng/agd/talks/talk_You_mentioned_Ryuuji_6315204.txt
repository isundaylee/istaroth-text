Traveler: You mentioned Ryuuji?
Takeru: Ryuuji is a hero who once saved my life. He's helping to keep the peace in Inazuma as part of the, uh... the Manban Sanpou something-or-other!
Takeru: Once, when I got stuck on a cliff while running around outside, Ryuuji dropped down from the skies and saved me.
Takeru: I want to become a great hero just like Ryuuji. That way, I can help my dad who's in the army to fight off all the bad guys in the rebellion!
