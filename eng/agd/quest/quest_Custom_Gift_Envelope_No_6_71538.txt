# Custom Gift Envelope No. 6


## Talk 1

Chevreuse: #Hello, Traveler. Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Are you... here for a case?
Chevreuse: I'm being forced to take a vacation.
Traveler: Forced... to take a vacation?
Chevreuse: The Maison Gardiennage stipulates that all employees are required to use our vacation time by the end of the year.
Chevreuse: The end-of-year calculations came through, and the Patrol found out I hadn't taken a single day off, so...
Traveler: Sounds like a demanding job...
Chevreuse: No. Our officers operate on a rotating schedule, but as the captain of the squad, I'm always on duty.
Chevreuse: I also deal with a lot of emergency cases, so over time, I just... forgot to take vacation.
Chevreuse: I was fine going without any time off this year, but my officers wouldn't hear of it...
Chevreuse: They started shouting about how "rules are meant to be followed" and "a captain needs to lead by example." Basically, they wouldn't take no for an answer.
Chevreuse: One of the Gestionnaires who works with us mentioned how Liyue is a top vacation destination during the Lantern Rite festival. He pulled out a boat ticket right then and there, so... Here I am.
Chevreuse: And I have to hand it to him â€” Liyue is a sight to behold this time of year. I just came back from Qiaoying Village, actually. I really loved the dim sum made with tea.
Chevreuse: I bought some to share with the Special Patrol. I was planning to follow local customs and make a few gift envelopes, as well.
Chevreuse: It's just... I'm not very good at this kind of thing. No matter what I do, it always ends up looking weird.
Chevreuse: #Do you know how to make them, Traveler?
Traveler: I've got some suggestions...
Traveler: Is it like that for everyone?
Traveler: You... don't look like you're here for work?

## Talk 3

Chevreuse: Wow, this turned out great! Hmm... you deserve something in return.
Chevreuse: Here, take some of this dim sum as thanks for your help. Receiving this envelope from you really makes this trip worthwhile.
Chevreuse: ...Still, I've been away for some time, now. I wonder if my officers are keeping up with their training.
Chevreuse: Well, I guess it's time to start planning a fitness test.
