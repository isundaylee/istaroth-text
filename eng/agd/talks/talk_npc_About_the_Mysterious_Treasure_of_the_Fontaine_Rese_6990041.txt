Traveler: About the Mysterious Treasure of the Fontaine Research Institute...
Paimon: At the Fontaine Research Institute, they research clockwork and different energy sources, right? So how come there are rumors about a mystery treasure?
Paimon: It'd make more sense if the treasure was owned by a bandit or a pirate.
Paimon: But Paimon's not sure that the researchers' and technicians' definition of "treasure" is really mysterious enough to get excited about...
Traveler: Hmm... What about "researcher by day, bandit by night"?
Paimon: Umm... Well for starters, it sounds exhausting. Imagine finishing your day job, then working a whole other job all night... When would they get time to rest?
Traveler: Maybe they wouldn't need to rest...
Paimon: Ooh! A mystery treasure left by a clockwork meka who's a researcher by day and a bandit by night... Now that sounds more like it!
Traveler: If they were actually a clockwork meka in disguise!
Traveler: Does that sound mysterious enough?
