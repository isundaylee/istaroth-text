Timaeus: Am I... Am I dreaming? Miss Ying'er, you really came all the way to Mondstadt to see me...
Timaeus: Whâ€”Why were you willing to make the trip? I still can't believe it...
Ying'er: Hehe, why wouldn't I want to come see you, hmm? It's not like a quick trip from Liyue to Mondstadt is completely unheard-of or anything.
Ying'er: Also, isn't it time for you to drop the "Miss," and just call me Ying'er?
Timaeus: Ying'er...
Ying'er: Mm-hmm.
Timaeus: Ying'er... Heh, I... I think I still need some time to get used to calling you that...
Ying'er: Hehe, look at you, already so flustered. And we're just getting started!
Timaeus: No no, I, uh... I... *sigh*
Timaeus: I'm just overwhelmed with happiness. Thank you so, so much for coming to see me for Windblume...
