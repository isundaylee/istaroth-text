# Awaken the Residual Pari in the Fravashi Trees


## Talk 1

Paimon: That round tree's gotta be a Fravashi Tree!

## Talk 2

Sorush: Hmph, is this how they look like now? How pathetic.
Paimon: Sorush, what are you talking about?
Sorush: Never mind. I just happened to witness the undignified states of my kind. No matter, we shall keep going.
Paimon: You see, that makes Paimon even more curious!
Paimon: Let Paimon have a look... Oh wow, that really is one strange tree! The way it's shaped like a circle looks almost like a door, right?
Traveler: If we walk through it...
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon definitely would like to go first!
Sorush: ...The Fravashi Trees are no doors. You'll disturb the residual Pari residing within if you simply barge through them.
Paimon: So that's called a Fravashi Tree, huh? But where are the residual Pari... Paimon can't see them at all!
Sorush: Of course Pale Floater can't see them. They are still trapped by obsessions of the past, after all.
Sorush: It may not be what they wished for, but looking at the sight of them clinging desperately to this world... How absurd and pathetic.
Paimon: They may look a little strange, but calling them pathetic is just mean!
Paimon: And looking at you being surrounded by so many plants, Paimon actually thought you'd feel at home.
Sorush: Hmph, I only feel at home when I'm on a battlefield. Only the battle lasting until the end of time can be perceived as true eternity!
Sorush: Now that you're following me, you'd better grasp that as early as possible, Pale Floater.
Sorush: These Fravashi Trees are Pari that fought till the very end against the defilement that had been corrupting the land. Using the last remnants of their power, they transformed into this state that you see now.
Sorush: They exhausted their strength, to the point where they could no longer maintain their form, and were rejected by the Vourukasha Oasis for being tainted.
Sorush: Legend has it that in ancient times, the Order of Skeptics would hold a ritual of purification for them, so as to bring them all back to the Vourukasha Oasis.
Sorush: But nowadays, there remains no one in the Order of Skeptics who is able to perform such a ritual. The best they can do is but to keep these Fravashi Trees alive.
Sorush: But this only prolongs their suffering. Judging by their current appearance, they seem to have nothing left but the bitter memories they have to endure alone.
Sorush: In a way, they have also fulfilled their mission. But it was all a meaningless act compared to a true sacrifice.
Traveler: Looks like we should help them.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon can't just leave them here to suffer and endure alone like this!
Sorush: You can't? That makes you weak, Pale Floater. Being compassionate is indeed one of the great Simurgh's many noble qualities, but one cannot survive here with merely a kind heart.
Sorush: Besides, for us Pari, to exhaust our strength in the final stand against evil is already the best ending one can dream of. I see no necessity to change anything.
Paimon: Well, that's what you think. Perhaps they have different ideas, y'know!
Paimon: If Paimon was trapped here, Paimon would definitely want to go back home and be with everyone else...
Sorush: We Pari share no such weaknesses!
Sorush: Hmph, fine, since even my Yasnapati fancies so. I shall wake her up with my power and let you listen to her dimming voice.
Traveler: So there is a way to save them.
Traveler: It might lead somewhere.
