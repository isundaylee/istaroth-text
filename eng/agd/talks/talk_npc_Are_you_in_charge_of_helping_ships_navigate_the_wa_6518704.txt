Traveler: Are you in charge of helping ships navigate the waters here?
Mermet: Don't you know? The hydrological conditions near Lumidouce Harbor are extremely complex. There are shallows, rifts, and even reefs.
Mermet: That's why the port usually assigns a navigator to board the cargo ships whenever they're entering or leaving the harbor. They help plot a course to guide the ships safely.
Mermet: But due to the recent... complications at Lumidouce Harbor, many navigators have resigned. Those of us who remain are overworked.
Mermet: *sigh* I wonder when this will all finally come to an end...
