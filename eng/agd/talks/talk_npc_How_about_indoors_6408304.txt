Traveler: How about indoors?
Ziryab: Tried it, didn't work.
Ziryab: You got either couples flirting, or someone pushing fliers on choir, card games, cross country, and other events on you in the study.
Ziryab: I could have just stayed in the dorm room, but my dumb roommate tried to make hotpot with a prototype burner...
Ziryab: I won't go into details, except the room is still full of smoke.
Ziryab: I don't trust myself to write anything Hana will appreciate in that condition.
