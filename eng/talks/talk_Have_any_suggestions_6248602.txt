Traveler: Have any suggestions?
Hermanson: Hah, I have an idea!
Hermanson: We'll break the leaves up into smaller pieces, then put them in a cloth or paper bag.
Hermanson: And when you want tea, you can just put the bag in a cup and add water.
Hermanson: You can even separate the tea leaves and the tea immediately after making it. Not bad, right?
Hermanson: Once I return to Fontaine after this deal, I'm going to put my invention into production right away.
Hermanson: People in my line of work always have a lot of ideas, but I can't let them have this one.
