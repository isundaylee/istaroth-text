## Talk

Francis: Oh my! Why, this is delicious! Oh, the Li-Style food here in Liyue just smells so good!
Francis: I'm Francis, yours truly, and nothing has ever had such a grasp on my heart, or stomach, like the Liyue cuisine does...

## Talk

Francis: Did you book this whole place for yourself?
Francis: That's right. Yours truly trekked a long and arduous journey from Fontaine just to do business here in Liyue Harbor.
Francis: I've only just arrived in Liyue, so seeing as I've still no friends or companions, I can only book the place for myself, haha.
Francis: Although my original intention was to do business here, I've already decided otherwise...
Francis: Now I only wish but to devote each day to eating Liyue delicacies, I no longer aspire to earning any money...
Francis: Albeit I may only be able to afford eating like this for a few more days...

## Talk

Francis: What are you eating?
Francis: Only the best food that Liyue has to offer — Li cuisine!
Francis: Whether it's Mora Meat, with a glimmer that's even more dazzling than the Mora spent to purchase it...
Francis: Or the delectable Come and Get It, with its assortment of exotic Liyue delicacies all packed into a single cask...
Francis: And the rich aromas... Ahh, it's hard to imagine that anything, with just one whiff, could ever be so irresistible. Prepared with just the right amount of seasoning and spices, it's simply exquisite!

## Talk

Francis: I'll let you enjoy your meal.
Francis: Thank you. Now I should probably start thinking about losing some weight...
Francis: Huh, where's my Matsutake and Cured Pork Dry Hotpot that I ordered?

## Talk

Francis: Oh, heavens! The sheer beauty! Nothing makes me drool like Liyue's very own Yue cuisine!
Francis: Francis, yours truly, has already left his days of Fontaine cuisine long behind...

## Talk

Francis: Tell me about Fontaine.
Francis: My home is a country that reveres true beauty and elegance.
Francis: Some people from other countries may find our dress sense showy and impractical, but for us, there is nothing more commonplace.
Francis: *sigh* Still, I've had to buy new clothes yet again recently. I swear it's the food in Liyue. It's so good, I must have put on two hundred pounds after coming here!
Francis: All that said, a man must eat. This is really good!

## Talk

Francis: What are you eating?
Francis: Only the best food that Liyue has to offer — Yue cuisine!
Francis: The Fullmoon Egg, for example: fish, shrimp, green peppers and eggs all blended perfectly into one dish...
Francis: There's also the Crystal Shrimp: its outer skin glistening and transparent like a jewel, to the point where you can see the whole shrimp within...
Francis: That fresh, tender mouthfeel... Ah, it's almost as if the food was still alive in my mouth. It's just wonderful!

## Talk

Francis: Bon appétit.
Francis: Thank you. I'll leave soon, myself... after the next plate...
Francis: ...Waiter, another plate of Golden Crab, please!
