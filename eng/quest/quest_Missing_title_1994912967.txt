# Missing title (1994912967)

Traveler: Your uncle?
Moce: That's right. I don't know his name, and he's never written us any letters... Dad always calls him "that blockhead," or "that guy"...
Moce: But he's gotta be a pretty awesome guy to have bucked with tradition and left town by himself to Sumeru! Better than Dad, who only ever talks about family and duty and stuff like that...
Moce: Uh, hmm. Did I say too much? Keep that stuff a secret and don't tell Dad, alright? Thanks!
