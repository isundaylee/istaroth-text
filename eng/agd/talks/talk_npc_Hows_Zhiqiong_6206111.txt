Traveler: How's Zhiqiong...
Muning: Ah yes. About Zhiqiong, the Millelith should have received news about her. If nothing goes awry, the search-and-rescue team from the Ministry should also arrive soon.
Muning: We should have news of her shortly.
Muning: That said, she's so fond of adventure that she probably went gallivanting somewhere by herself. *cough* If you meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.
Muning: I'm sure you must be much busier than me, but you know, it would be nice if you could look out for her on my behalf...
