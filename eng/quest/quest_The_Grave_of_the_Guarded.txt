# The Grave of the Guarded


## Talk 1

Paimon: There are signs of hilichurl activity here. Could these be the hilichurls the requester was talking about?
Dainsleif: Requester? ...In fact, hold on. You still haven't told me what you're doing here. I doubt that most travelers would have any reason to venture down this way.
Paimon: We took a commission from the Adventurers' Guild to investigate The Chasm. Apparently, a whole load of hilichurls have been gathering here, and the requester wants to know why.
Paimon: And now, it looks like we've finally found our first clue...
Dainsleif: Do you want the answer?
Paimon: Huh? You mean, you know something about this?
Dainsleif: As it happens, I do.
Traveler: Huh? Did I miss something?
Dainsleif: It's understandable that you did not perceive anything unusual. What makes this place so strange is that...
Dainsleif: ...the environment here weakens the effect of the curse.
Paimon: The curse? Oh! Paimon remembers, last time you guys were saying that Khaenri'ah's people were cursed to immortality or something...
Dainsleif: For centuries, I have suffered daily from the curse that was laid upon me. But here... I suddenly feel a small amount of relief from this suffering.
Dainsleif: And right here, right now, I can feel my body sending a strong message to me... It is telling me, "stay."
Paimon: So this place weakens the curse? That's pretty incredible, but how?
Dainsleif: That I shall need to investigate. But to the best of my knowledge, the Abyss Order does not have the technology to achieve this.
Traveler: So you're saying...
Dainsleif: Indeed. Do you know why hilichurls wear masks?
Traveler: I think so?
Dainsleif: It's to hide their appearance, lest they catch sight of their reflection in a body of water...
Dainsleif: Compared to how they remember themselves, it is a terrible sight to behold, one that causes them great despair.
Traveler: So these hilichurls really are from...
Dainsleif: The curse of "immortality" denies death to those afflicted with it... and yet, it does not truly mean that they will never die.
Paimon: So you mean, there's a way to undo it?
Dainsleif: No. I mean that the body and soul will continue to be eroded until they are virtually nonexistent, even if "death" is not the form that this erosion takes.
Dainsleif: When the hilichurls realize that the end is nigh for them, it seems their instinct is to seek out a calm and dark corner of the world in which to finally say goodbye to the centuries of suffering they have endured.
Dainsleif: And of all the places they could lay down to rest, one that can ease the effects of their curse would surely be their first choice.
Paimon: Wow... That's so...
Dainsleif: Conversation's over, brace yourselves!
Paimon: Whâ€”What is it!?
Dainsleif: We're under attack.
Traveler: I'm not sure...
Traveler: The hilichurls that come here are also from...
Traveler: Does this have anything to do with the upside-down city?

## Talk 2

Paimon: What were those? And why did they attack us all of a sudden?
Dainsleif: Black Serpent Knights. They once belonged to the Royal Guard of Khaenri'ah.
Paimon: Wait a second! Royal Guard? So... they used to be your troops!?
Dainsleif: Yes, they were. But now, the curse engulfs them, and they fight with none of the honor they once had...
Paimon: Because they've become pawns of the Abyss now?
Dainsleif: ...Let's continue on.
Paimon: Wait, Dain...
Dainsleif: Hmm?
Halfdan: ...
Dainsleif: Seems we missed one...
Halfdan: ...
Dainsleif: Wait, stand down. There's something different about this one...
Dainsleif: ...It's disappeared.
Paimon: What the heck? What was going on with that one? Was it trying to say something?
Dainsleif: (How is this possible... How could he have retained self-awareness for 500 years without... it?)
Dainsleif: (But more importantly, why did he seem so familiar...)
Traveler: Maybe he recognized you.
Dainsleif: That would be a miraculous outcome indeed for a cataclysm that brought total doom and destruction... Or perhaps it was just a coincidence.
Dainsleif: We should press onward, to the city.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Looks like there's a strange energy surrounding the city. We can't go any further.
Paimon: Guess there should be a mechanism or something around here, right? Traveler, looks like it's time to get into ruin-exploring mode!
Traveler: Puzzle time, huh.
Dainsleif: Don't waste your time.
Paimon: Huh...!?
Dainsleif: Khaenri'ah's technology, Abyssal power... Two things I couldn't be more familiar with. They're just cheap tricks to me.
Paimon: Okay! So the Abyss Order really is trying to hide something here, right?
Paimon: Hmm... Dain seems like he really understands what's going on here. No wonder the Abyss Order doesn't want him around.
Traveler: Was this upside-down city built by Khaenri'ah?
Dainsleif: Not necessarily. The closer we draw, the more I am inclined to conclude that these ruins belong to a more ancient civilization still.
Dainsleif: The Abyss Order simply got to them before anyone else.
Paimon: Even older than Khaenri'ah? Whoa, Paimon can't even imagine back that far...
Dainsleif: That said, the architecture here does somewhat resemble that of Khaenri'ah... At least, it would if it were the other way up.
Dainsleif: Let's head toward the light over there. Mind your footing on the way ahead. It's a long way down.
Traveler: Was this upside-down city built by the Abyss Order?
Traveler: I'll take a look around and see what I can find.

## Talk 4

Paimon: So there's no Abyss Order secrets to be found here... Just a bunch of hilichurls nearing the end of their existence.
Paimon: We probably shouldn't disturb them.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Aah, Black Serpent Knights!
Paimon: Is this where they're based? Or wait, are they guarding something here?
Dainsleif: We are likely drawing near to whatever the Abyss Order is trying to hide. Let's take them out first.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Oh no, more Black Serpent Knights!
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Huh, they're not coming after us. Are they just trying to scare us off?
Paimon: These knights seem like they're hiding something behind them...
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Dainsleif: Hold on, I think they...
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Aah, they're coming! Quick, get them!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Huh!? What's this?
Dainsleif: ...So the Black Serpent Knights have nothing to do with the Abyss Order's secret. Huh, I should have guessed.
Paimon: So what exactly is going on with these hilichurls?
Dainsleif: As I said, for these hilichurls, the end is nigh.
Traveler: The hilichurls are preparing to meet their end...
Dainsleif: They have grown old and fearful of the light, even become one with the darkness. And yet the curse continues to corrode them.
Paimon: But why would the Black Serpent Knights wanna stay here and guard them?
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Aah! More of them are closing in!
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Traveler: Let's try to avoid fighting them.
Halfdan: !
Paimon: ...It's him! The guy that came out of nowhere and disappeared again!
Paimon: And now they're retreating... Did he just order them to do that?
Dainsleif: ...Halfdan?
Halfdan: ...
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, what? You recognize him?
Dainsleif: ...Could it be... If it's as I suspect, then this is a truly tragic state of affairs.
Paimon: Dain?
Dainsleif: You want to know why they were gathered here guarding the hilichurls, don't you?
Dainsleif: It's because as far as the Black Serpent Knights are concerned, they are simply doing their duty.
Dainsleif: The one who ordered them to retreat just now... I suddenly recognized him. I knew him as a young man, an elite in the Royal Guard of old... His name is "Halfdan."
Paimon: So he's from 500 years ago, too...
Dainsleif: To this day, I still remember the final orders I, the Twilight Sword, gave to Halfdan on the day of disaster in Khaenri'ah, before I made haste back to the palace...
Dainsleif: "Inform all Black Serpent Knights to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs."
Dainsleif: Because we, of course, were royal guards. But this would mean nothing in the events that followed... Royals, gentry, common folk, these identities made no difference.
Dainsleif: Against the might of the gods, the only identity that mattered was being from Khaenri'ah.
Traveler: ...
Dainsleif: These Black Serpent Knights have lost their intellect. But perhaps, in whatever remains of their minds, they are still protecting the people of Khaenri'ah.
Dainsleif: If you see these ruins as Khaenri'ah in the throes of disaster, and these hilichurls as the people crying for help...
Dainsleif: ...then suddenly, I can make sense of what I'm hearing. Their growls are less of a threat and more of a warning.
Paimon: Then... what are they saying?
Dainsleif: Though it is barely discernible, I can just about make it out. They keep repeating a word from the old language of Khaenri'ah... "Run."
Traveler: So they're not talking to us...
Dainsleif: Even I have to admit, the fact their will is strong enough to survive 500 years of erosion... It is nothing short of a miracle born from hopelessness.
Paimon: Oh... So Paimon had them all wrong...
Dainsleif: It doesn't matter. Even I took them for enemies for a moment.
Dainsleif: Let's keep heading toward the light at the top. I believe the Black Serpent Knights will no longer try to stop us.
Traveler: So they're telling the hilichurls behind them to escape...
Traveler: Fighting them is meaningless.
Traveler: "End"...

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey look, there's no door sealing this room off. Looks like we can finally head to the room in the center.
Paimon: C'mon, let's go!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Look, up there! A water pool!
Paimon: Even the water pool is upside-down. Wow! This is a pretty amazing place.
Paimon: Dain, do you have any idea at all how it works?
Dainsleif: The pool must be part of the entire city structure, a relic of this ancient civilization.
Dainsleif: And more importantly... it is the very thing that is weakening the curse.
Dainsleif: Here, my whole body feels more at peace than it has in a long time. The effect is stronger here than it was before, and I think it's because that water pool has something akin to a cleansing effect.
Paimon: Cleansing? So that means... the water in that pool can wash away the curse for good?
Dainsleif: No. That would be impossible.
Paimon: How are you so sure?
Dainsleif: I have lived with this curse for 500 years, and I have been fully conscious the entire time... Suffice to say, no one understands the curse like I do.
Dainsleif: It is a way of branding us at the level of the fate of the world itself. When a god applies a curse, it takes effect at a higher level of reality than the person themselves.
Dainsleif: Even now, I can feel the curse slowly permeating my entire being, becoming part of me, slowly but surely replacing me.
Dainsleif: Perhaps it may be possible to suppress the corrosive effect of the curse for a time, but cleansing it entirely...
Dainsleif: Consider it tantamount to burning away an integral part of your body. It is not a process that one could ever hope to survive.
Paimon: Huh!? Cleansing the curse costs you your life? Whoa... An irreversible curse, Paimon can't even imagine...
Dainsleif: In any case, I can feel that the water's cleansing effect is not nearly potent enough. At most, it might suppress the curse but a little.
Paimon: Hmm? So what's that contraption there? It looks kinda out of place...
Traveler: An Abyss Order device?
Dainsleif: Frankly, I have never seen a device of this design before either. It is not unreasonable to suspect that it could belong to the Abyss Order. But what could they be planning to do here...
Investigate: (*clunk* *clunk*...)
Paimon: Yikes! That gave Paimon a fright... So all the doors are open now?
Halfdan: ...
Paimon: Wah, Halfdan's back again...
Dainsleif: Halfdan. Do you have something to say to me?
Halfdan: ...
Paimon: He ran off... but he didn't disappear like last time!
Dainsleif: He's indicating that we should follow him. Are you coming?
Traveler: This could be a useful lead.
Paimon: True... So, uh... We going, then?
Traveler: He doesn't seem to hold any malice toward us.
Traveler: Perhaps it's the Abyss Order's secret.
