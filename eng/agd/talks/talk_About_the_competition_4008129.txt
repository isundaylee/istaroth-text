# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About the competition...
Balfour: You can go and take a look at the promotion board if there's anything else you're unsure about!
Balfour: The staff will update the progression of the competition on the promotion board. I hear that they're planning to include interactive events as well. The events will begin once the popularity of the competition reaches a certain point.
Balfour: They might even start to sell a competition highlight "film" after the competition progresses to a certain point.
Traveler: What determines if the competition is popular enough...?
Paimon: That sounds like a pretty harsh requirement, don't you think? The competition venue isn't exactly outstanding. You sure it's gonna work?
Balfour: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that at all. The center of Sumeru commerce, Wikala Funduq, is right next to the arena, and the bridge to the harbor is not too far off either. Any traffic that moves through the area will definitely be able to see the venue.
Balfour: Besides, we've also put up a promotional poster on the bulletin board in Sumeru City. Many of the competitors and audience are here because they saw it.
Paimon: Ohh, we saw it too! So you were the one that put up the advertisement on that bulletin board!
Balfour: Haha, it's pretty good, right? I must say, writing marketing material is one of my strong suits!
Balfour: I'm doing some of the reporting for the competition too. I'll do my best to describe your performance excitedly!
Paimon: It feels like you're in charge of a lot of the work that's being done here. From managing the Floral Jelly and organizing the events to writing promotional material and reporting...
Balfour: Oh, it's nothing compared to the salary that Mr. Elchingen is paying me. I'm being paid ten times what I was making before... Ahem!
Balfour: Anyways, Mr. Elchingen said it best! He said that those capable should take on more responsibility. I'm more than willing to give my all to a boss like him.
