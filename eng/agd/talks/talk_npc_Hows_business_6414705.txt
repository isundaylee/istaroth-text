Traveler: How's business?
Qiuwei: Very good. The Sumeru people have their own unique style of weaving, but they also seem to like Liyue specialties.
Qiuwei: The local Sumeru embroidery is very interesting, and the Feiyun Commerce Guild is trying to incorporate the characteristics of Sumeru textiles into their own products.
Qiuwei: Well... Fortunately, this kind of cultural handicraft doesn't seem to be considered an intellectual product forbidden for export by the Akademiya, or it would be difficult for us to ship back samples.
