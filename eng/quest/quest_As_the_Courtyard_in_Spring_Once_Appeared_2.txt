# As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared


## Talk 1

Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Well, I certainly didn't expect to see you here.
Xinyan: This is a bonsai pot, right? It's nice, but it looks like it's been a little neglected.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Paimon knew it wasn't gonna be that simple.
Traveler: Where's Kazuha?
Paimon: Huh? Oh yeah... everyone's here... except for Kazuha!
Xinyan: Kazuha! Where are you? Are you okay?
Paimon: No response. Well, let's keep an eye out for him.
Mona: Look at the decor here... it's like the inside of a grand mansion. I don't think this is a perilous maze — it's somebody's home.
Fischl: Most curious. What secrets lie within this place, I shall surely uncover.

## Talk 3

Paimon: It looks like this letter was written by Kazuha's father.
Paimon: So keeping bonsai plants really does run in the family.
Paimon: Hmm... But the fact that we're even here and could see his father's notes... It just seems so unbelievable.

## Talk 4

Xinyan: Oh there you are!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Huh? Where did you all go?
Paimon: This place is a maze! We all got trapped inside, except for you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I've been stuck in this room the whole time, and can't seem to find a way out. I have to say, this place looks a lot like my childhood bedroom.
Paimon: If this is your home, why would you be trapped here? Is the maze trying to keep you out?
Black Screen Text: You tell Kazuha about everything that just happened...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: It appears that this whole maze is modeled after my family home. And all the conversations you heard in there are in fact words once spoken by my father and grandfather.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You said that the maze is trying to keep me out... Indeed, I'm the only one unable to explore this place.
Mona: I think these unusual structures are some kind of mirage. According to what Kazuha said, all this seems to be constructed based on Kazuha's memory.
Fischl: But why should Lord Kazuha be the only one excluded?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Maybe that comes from me, too.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To me, what is past is gone. Everything in the world is guided by its own rules, and as for people... we can never relive the past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think that this belief is the reason why the mirage was keeping me out.
Xinyan: I can get behind that. It's a very sensible way of looking at things.
Kaedehara Kazuha: All our thoughts have consequences. I don't consider it strange, and I don't think it's anything you should be worried about.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... we got in here by touching the bonsai, didn't we? So perhaps if we touch it again...

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back!
Xinyan: Hey, look, that whole mountain's changed completely.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ... Wait.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, I might have an explanation. The changes in the mirage could be related to the bonsai.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My father once mentioned that this pot was originally part of a collection belonging to my great-grandfather. He adored his bonsai and always took great care of them.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When our family fell upon hard times, my grandfather traveled far and wide, looking for a way to save the clan. However, during that time, my great-grandfather became gravely ill.
Kaedehara Kazuha: He knew my grandfather had no interest in bonsai, so before his death, he gave most of his carefully crafted bonsai away. This is the only one he retained.

## Talk 6

Kaedehara Hisamichi: The flesh resides in society, while the heart yearns for the natural world... Such has been the way of the Kaedeharas for many generations.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Kazuha, the future of this clan will one day be in your hands.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: When that time comes, remember to always stay true to yourself.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kageharu: Father, what are you carving?
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Haha, it's a rock garden. I'm modeling it after the scenery I saw on my travels abroad. It'll go in my bonsai later.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Work has been so busy these years, I've barely had a moment to spend with my grandson. I hope he doesn't take after me... when he's older, he should get out there and see more of the world.

## Talk 8

Kaedehara Kazuha: An illusion? No... it felt too real to be an illusion.
Mona: Those things we saw flickering in and out, that's exactly what I saw earlier this morning!
Fischl: Does this mean... the Immernachtreich... is real?
Xinyan: Wait, what?
Fischl: Ahem!
Fischl: Hehe! Behold, the Immernachtreich has come, just as your Prinzessin had prophesied! Come, my people, a new chapter awaits us!
Oz: Indeed, mein Fräulein. We all have witnessed this miracle with our own eyes, and now is the time to celebrate the creation of a new world! Rejoice!
Fischl: Hahahaha, welcome to the Immernachtreich!
Paimon: She looks so happy, Paimon doesn't have the heart to interrupt her right now...
Mona: She doesn't seem surprised in the slightest. Does that just come with being an experienced adventurer, or...?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If this isn't an illusion, we ought to go and investigate.
Xinyan: I got an idea. If you hurt yourself in a dream, you wake up right away, don't ya?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm? Yes, you have a point.
Xinyan: Right? So c'mon, Kazuha, hit me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Uh... I'd rather not... How about you hit me instead?
Xinyan: But that'll hurt real bad.
Paimon: Hey! There'll be no need for any of that!
Paimon: #Just leave it to us! Hey {NICKNAME}, can Paimon hit you?
Traveler: ?
Fantastic Boat: Haha, I like yer senses o' humor, me hearties. An illusion? So, talking boats and squirrels are just an illusion to humans, huh.
Squirrel: Now, now, it's understandable, old chap. Haven't you heard? As humans grow older, they forget many important things and lose many of their abilities.
Fantastic Boat: Aye, so they do... A pity, to be sure. Thinking back, in all those years I spent sailing with the fleet, I would've never imagined that one day I'd be laughing over something like this.
Fantastic Boat: Well then, me lads and lasses, don't you want to take a wee gander at all the places you're so curious about?
Paimon: Of course! But how do we get there?
Fantastic Boat: Look! Here!
Mona: At what?
Fantastic Boat: Blimey, at me, of course! Oh, that's right, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm the smartest ship you'll find in all these parts! The name's... argh, just call me whatever takes yer fancy.
Paimon: Don't you have a name?
Fantastic Boat: That I do, I just can't remember it. All I know is that I came here from Inazuma.
Paimon: In that case, Paimon shall name you... "Miitoboru"! How's that? All the other ships in Inazuma seem to have names ending in "ru," too.
Fantastic Boat: Miitoboru? Haha, that'll do nicely.
Fantastic Boat: You're lucky to have met me. I can sail through the choppiest seas with ease, there isn't a wave out there that can capsize me! So...
Fantastic Boat: Come aboard, and I'll take you wherever you'd like to go!
Squirrel: Ah, how very kind of you, old chap. Unlike that Anemo Archon who abandoned us here.
Traveler: The Anemo Archon?
Squirrel: You know, the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt.
Squirrel: Don't you know? Some of these islands used to be Mondstadt's mountaintops. Once upon a time, the Anemo Archon sliced them off to neaten the place up, and chucked them into the ocean.
Squirrel: My great-great-great-great-great-great... great grandfather was on one of the mountaintops, and got sent flying here along with it. Wretched Anemo Archon!
Paimon: How could that happen!
Squirrel: And we've been living here for generations since then, haha. Fortunately, there were a few other squirrel families that got stranded on these islands as well, so we built ourselves a kingdom here.
Squirrel: The good thing is that there are no predators or competitors around. All the pinecones on this island are ours for the taking. The bad thing is... we're stuck here.
Paimon: Didn't see that coming... Sounds like the Immernachtreich is a kingdom of squirrels!
Fischl: Hold thy tongue!
Oz: Paimon, please do not make such slanderous statements. The Immernachtreich is, of course, a kingdom of night ravens.
Fantastic Boat: Hey, lad, yes, you! You're from Inazuma, aye? That makes us brothers, haha. Every young lad of Inazuma has to pluck up the courage to set sail on an adventure one day! So, are you coming?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: To set sail... is to leave one's homeland and travel far away.
Fantastic Boat: Aye, you need lots of courage and just a dash of heartlessness. 'Cause once you leave, you may never return. But if you stay, you're forever a prisoner in your own heart.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Huh. Inspiring words, Miitoboru. And you're right. The wanderer's spirit runs in my blood. I'll go with you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My friends, are you coming too? I want to take a look at the strange phenomena on that island.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Also, I smell ancient timber and waterproof varnish on this boat... The scent is indeed from Inazuma, so I believe he speaks the truth.
Mona: Hmm... what does everyone think?
Fischl: Oz, lay down the gangplank! Thy Prinzessin shall take to the seas!
Xinyan: Let's all go! It'll definitely be an experience.
Fantastic Boat: Haha, great! Aaand we're off!
Squirrel: Safe travels!
Traveler: What are you talking about?

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: This bonsai... was in my family for many generations. Sadly, it ended up in a Tenryou Commission warehouse in my generation.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, one thing you might not know about my past is that I spent some time as one of Inazuma's most wanted fugitives. I suspect this bonsai was confiscated during my long time on the run.
Fischl: Fugitive...
Mona: *sigh* ...Life throws all kinds of hardships at us. I doubt a single person in this world lives a truly carefree life.

## Talk 10

Kaedehara Kazuha: This bonsai... was in my family for many generations. I saw it once in a Tenryou Commission warehouse, but it looked quite different from how it does now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: At that time, there was a withered tree inside.
Mona: Why would someone keep the plant in there if it's dead?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's a way of sending a secret message. It indicated that there was something hidden inside the flowerpot.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was a letter buried down at the bottom, which told of an ancient secret in my clan. I did not take the bonsai with me after reading the letter, which means it should still be in the warehouse now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I wonder who removed the plant and placed the pot here...

## Talk 11

Paimon: To hide the letter with that secret in, right?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, and to give his son something to remember him by.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My grandfather returned as quickly as he could, but my great-grandfather had already passed away. They never got the chance to say goodbye to each other before the end. After that, my grandfather would spend long periods of time standing in front of this bonsai, lost in thought.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Eventually, he started to make his own bonsai. Unlike his father, he preferred arranging rock gardens instead of plants.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps influenced by my grandfather, my father also took a liking to crafting bonsai. Back then, our courtyard was filled with all kinds of them.

## Talk 12

Black Screen Text: Still half-asleep, you can make out the sound of people talking. Then, you are greeted by the voice of a panicked Paimon trying to stay calm...
Paimon: ...Up! Wake up!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, wake up!
Traveler: (I don't want to...)
Paimon: Oh, thank goodness you're awake! Uh, Paimon has good news and bad news. Which one do you wanna hear first?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Aaah! Okay, okay, Paimon's sorry! Wake up, something's happened!
Traveler: Go on, I'm listening.
Paimon: Okay, uh, bad news first. The bad news is... something weird's going on with this island.
Paimon: And the good news is, is... it seems like it has nothing to do with what we came across yesterday. Today, is a different issue entirely.
Traveler: And what might that be?
Fantastic Boat: #Ah, look, {M#he}{F#she}'s awake!
Squirrel: #Careful not to frighten {M#him}{F#her}. {M#He}{F#She}'s probably just like the others. Ah, humans... such delicate little things.
Fantastic Boat: How're ya doing, mate? Feeling a little fragile?
Paimon: So as you can see, the boat can talk, heh.
Traveler: I might just go back to sleep for a bit...
Paimon: No, avoidance isn't gonna solve anything!
Squirrel: Poor soul, imagine being scared of talking squirrels and boats!
Fantastic Boat: #Haha, well, we can't blame {M#him}{F#her}. After all, humans aren't quite accustomed to hearing things like us talk.
Paimon: Wait... have you guys always been able to talk?
Squirrel: Of course! Otherwise, how would we communicate with others of our kind?
Paimon: So in other words... we suddenly gained the ability to understand you? How strange...
Squirrel: Maybe you've gained some intelligence. Congratulations.
Mona: #So, you're finally awake, {NICKNAME}? Time to rise and shine!
Paimon: You're back!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, we went for a little walk. The enchanting scenery and pleasant weather here soothes the body and mind.
Oz: Everything is fine, except that some places are a little peculiar...
Fischl: Hohoho! The servants of darkness have descended. Rejoice, for the return of the Immernachtreich is nigh!
Oz: Mein Fräulein means that this is an unexpected development, and she has never seen anything like this before.
Paimon: No, that's not even close to what she said!
Oz: My apologies. Please take that as my own opinion.
Traveler: What happened?
Kaedehara Kazuha: After last night, there have been some... unusual spectacles on this island.
Mona: Yes. Swimming birds, flying squirrels, the sun and moon in the sky together... Some of these sights only lasted for a moment, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre.
Xinyan: I heard a strange flapping sound on the island, but didn't see a single flying creature around.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was also a peculiar floral scent on the wind. Though there are many flowers on this island, that scent did not resemble any of them.
Xinyan: Seems to me like whatever these things are, they aren't visible to the naked eye...
Mona: I tried to perform a divination, but my scryglass showed only a chaotic mess that was impossible to decipher.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon has a bad feeling about this... What have we gotten ourselves into...
Fischl: Hmm... I had resolved to summon the Immernachtreich in this land, but now we observe these puzzling phenomena... Could this be the spawn of the condemned, trying to thwart my sacred endeavor?
Paimon: #Wait, {NICKNAME}... you don't think Alice could be behind all this, do you?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: But if it really was her, it wouldn't make sense to do all this...
Squirrel: Hahaha, look at them, old chap, seems we scared the pants off them!
Fantastic Boat: Aye, well, they've never seen anything like this before.
Fantastic Boat: This old boat's sailed all over the briney seas in its time, and tried talking to many a sailor, too. But in all that time, not a single person has ever spoken back.
Squirrel: Exactly. If it weren't for this environment, who would've thought humans would be able to chat with us?
Paimon: This environment? What do you mean by that?
Mona: The environment... Could it be that... the environment is what's interfering with my divinations?
Traveler: Feels like...
Paimon: Uh... even if you were...
Paimon: Dreams aren't supposed to become reality, right? And a dream won't make you suddenly understand boats and squirrels... Aah!
Xinyan: What's wrong?
Paimon: Look! Over there!
Traveler: I might be still dreaming.
Traveler: It's not impossible.
Traveler: (But I can't leave Paimon unattended.)

## Talk 13

Kaedehara Hisamichi: Listen carefully, Kazuha. A Kaedehara blade is not forged for the purpose of harming people.

## Talk 14

Squirrel: Hey friend. Your eyes betray your thoughts — you still look very bemused.
Squirrel: Oh, come now, do you see me acting surprised at the sudden arrival of you and your party? Well then. I'm sure we can get along quite amicably.
Squirrel: If you want to know where the most scrumptious pinecones are, come find me anytime!
Squirrel: Ah... Mondstadt. I wonder what it's really like...

## Talk 15

Kaedehara Kazuha: And this flowerpot was passed down to me as a family treasure.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's certainly no coincidence that it appeared here and became the entrance to the mirage. It's almost as if... it's giving me a chance to make up for past regrets.
Traveler: Regrets about what?
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was once a time when the Kaedeharas were an illustrious clan in Inazuma.
Kaedehara Kazuha: After the Raiden Gokaden incident, our clan's fortunes took a turn for the worse. By the time of my generation, our downfall was complete.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Later, I fled Inazuma as I didn't want be arrested. With no one left in the Kaedehara Clan, the authorities confiscated everything in our home, including this bonsai.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Like my ancestors before me, I think I'd like to try it out for myself... recreate a favorite scene from my travels and place it into this pot.
Mona: ... *sigh*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since the contents of this bonsai affect the mirage, I'd at least like to try my hand at making something.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But what style? Should I use plants for the bonsai like my great-grandfather, or rocks like my father and grandfather...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Perhaps a rock garden would suit me better.
Paimon: So do you need any supplies to make this bonsai?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think I'll need a set of tools and some rocks that can be carved and made into decorations.
Paimon: Got it, we'll help you look!
Xinyan: We might just get lucky. If the pot's here, then surely other stuff related to crafting bonsai can't be far away.
Fischl: I concur! Lord Kazuha, take heart in your search, for my retinue and I shall help you retrieve your missing treasures.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you, everyone.

## Talk 16

Xinyan: So the bonsai pot belonged to your ancestors? Seems a shame to leave it empty like this.
Xinyan: Hmm, Kazuha, what do you think about maybe putting a little something inside it?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Though I still don't understand why it has appeared here, I can give that a try.
Paimon: Eek!
