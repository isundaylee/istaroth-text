Mikhail: Have you heard what our envoys to Inazuma have been saying? They sent a letter recently, saying that the Inazuma Shogunate has gone to war with the rebels!
Lyudmila: Rebels... A war... Our comrades in Inazuma won't be caught in the crossfire, will they?
Mikhail: Hah, I doubt it. We Fatui are official foreign envoys in Inazuma, and there's a Harbinger with us, too. We shan't be so easily swept up in their internal squabbles!
Mikhail: Ah, Inazuma. They call it the eternal nation, but they can't even settle their own disputes. Now that's a good joke if I ever heard one!
Lyudmila: Regardless, a war is always going to be a highly volatile factor.
Lyudmila: If Inazuma, one of the Seven Nations, is truly in trouble, it may yet affect the progress of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa's grand design...
Mikhail: Oh, there you go again. How could Inazuma not hacking it affect our mighty motherland Snezhnaya?
Mikhail: If anything, I'd say that the chaos there is a great opportunity for us to get things done.
