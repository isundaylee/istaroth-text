Traveler: It is indeed a fine place.
Imatani Saburou: Indeed. When she and I traveled here for the first time, we knew that we would settle down here.
Imatani Saburou: We plant fruits, grow flowers, and weave. It's a peaceful life, yet it is not boring at all. Once we had some children, it got even more bustling.
Imatani Saburou: It sounds a bit too carefree, right? But it's not a bad thing to be carefree. You don't have to live a busy life traveling around to have a fulfilling life.

Traveler: Have you heard of any weird happenings recently?
Imatani Saburou: I remember hearing some talk about some urban legends, but I've never been a fan of these topics, so I don't really know anything useful.
Imatani Saburou: Well, it's not always a good thing to know more. The more news you hear, the more bothered you will be. After a while, even a happy life will be beyond your reach...

Traveler: How is Keisuke doing?
Imatani Saburou: He came home once. He told us that he had finally resolved his differences with Sakujirou. As for how it got resolved and where Sakujirou went, he didn't tell me.
Imatani Saburou: But as long as the matter is settled, I'm fine with it. My wife and I are happy for him.
Imatani Saburou: Many lost things can be retrieved, but you can only have so many childhood friends. There's no getting them back once you've lost them.
