# Suspicious Masala Cheese Balls

An Aranara-style dish that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. The cheese balls are under-cooked, and as a result, you got a mouthful of half-melted cheese and coarse potato chunks. Fry it for a while longer next time, would you?
