# Hereafter: Return to the Mountains


## Talk 1

Wang Ping'an: The censer is right there. If you want to offer incense, go right ahead.

## Talk 2

Wang Ping'an: The temple's looking the part now...
Traveler: It is, yes.
Wang Ping'an: Eh? Oh, you've got impeccable timing, haven't you? The repairs have just been completed, and I've just finished paying the laborers.
Wang Ping'an: Ah... I didn't think that it would cost this much Mora. I've more or less sunk all my earnings into this place...
Wang Ping'an: But anyway. The important thing is that the temple has been rebuilt.
Wang Ping'an: Would you like to offer some incense? I made a point of getting a new Censer made.
Traveler: Sure.
Wang Ping'an: Take these incense sticks. The censer's right over there.
Traveler: Have you offered any incense yet?
Wang Ping'an: Of course I have. I was the first to do so once the refurbishment was complete, in fact.

## Talk 3

Wang Ping'an: All done? How do you feel?
Traveler: Pretty good.
Wang Ping'an: Wonderful. I hope that there will always be incense alight in this temple...
Wang Ping'an: I will remain here for a while. This is a quiet spot, perfect for my compilation work.
Wang Ping'an: I need to get those materials that I gathered sorted out and continue to compile my book about the Vigilant Yaksha.
Wang Ping'an: If you have the time, you can drop by this temple and check on things.
Wang Ping'an: If you ever want to offer incense, just get some from me.
Wang Ping'an: *sigh* I'd actually love to do some repairs to the surrounding area, as well...
Wang Ping'an: The path needs repaving, with fences on either side, and we should have a flowerbed nearby...

Wang Ping'an: Hey, hey! Be careful with that! Don't damage the statue!
Wang Ping'an: *sigh* Looks like the construction work won't be finished any time soon...
