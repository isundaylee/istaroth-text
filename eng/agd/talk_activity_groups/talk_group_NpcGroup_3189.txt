Neko: Oh, it is you again. Well met.
Neko: Do you know where there grows a big, pink, and very tall tree?
Traveler: Whâ€”What?
Neko: It looks like the tree with pink petals next to the shrine, but it's very tall.
Neko: There are a lot of tingling, hair-raising things around that tree.
Paimon: Tingly, hair-raising things... They should be Electro...
Traveler: The tree you're referring to should be the Sakura Tree then...
Paimon: Electro and Sakura Trees can be found everywhere in Inazuma...
Traveler: Is there anything else beside that tree?
Neko: Hibiki said that the tree is shaped like a fox. There is a very large "shrine" next to that tree.
Neko: Like the tree, it's very high up, and there are those tingly, hair-raising things beneath the shrine.
Paimon: A very tall Sakura Tree and shrine, and Electro...
Paimon: Uh, is Neko talking about...
Traveler: The Sacred Sakura at Grand Narukami Shrine.
Paimon: Well, it feels like there is only one place in all of Inazuma that meets these three points. But...
Traveler: Why are you looking for that tree?
Neko: Why, do you know where that tree is? Worthy of being my chosen one.
Neko: It is the place Hibiki mentioned. Hibiki said that she had stayed there for a while.
Neko: Also, she loved the petals floating down from that very, very big tree.
Neko: ...
Neko: I thought about the reason why Hibiki hasn't returned until now. Could it be because she is doing something somewhere?
Neko: Since Hibiki isn't coming back for the time being, I will go and look for her.
Neko: It seems that you know where the tree is. Please take me there.
Paimon: Eh!? What about the shrine?
Neko: The stone human will take care of the shrine for me. There is no need to worry.
Traveler: Thank you, Mr. Ooshima.
Paimon: #Paimon never thought that Traveler would say this one day...
Paimon: Thank you for your effort, Mr. Ooshima. Okay, time to head off.
Traveler: We'll leave it to him, then.
Traveler: Is there something special about that tree?

## Talk

Neko: Hmm... The scent of a human, and a familiar one, too...
Neko: Huh, so it wasn't Hibiki after all.

## Talk

Traveler: A talking cat?
Neko: Hmph. Such a fuss you make, human.
Neko: Of course cats can speak. It is simply that human ears cannot comprehend them.

## Talk

Traveler: Who's Hibiki?
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She came from this shrine.
Neko: A long, long... long, long time ago, after a huge thunderstorm, Hibiki never returned... and there was no one to help brush my fur thereafter.
Neko: Until Hibiki returns, I will care for the shrine, and will brush my own fur, meow meow.

## Talk

Traveler: See you, then...
Neko: Meow meow... It has been long since I spoke human language. It is such a tiring endeavor...

## Talk

Neko: The shrine looks better and better, and my fur has also grown supple, meow meow.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about the shrine...
Neko: Thanks to your help, the shrine is regaining its former self. Hibiki will surely be pleased when she returns.
Neko: Still, I have discovered something strange...
Neko: On a stroll, I discovered that the surrounding villages have not a soul within them...
Neko: Meow meow... How strange, where did all those humans go?

## Talk

Traveler: How have the people at the shrine been doing?
Neko: I can see that they are all good folk. They have put much Mora in the Offering Box.
Neko: The green human is always frowning, always muttering, always worried about... disappointing some guild or another...
Neko: The green, taller human is... Ohh, he is most terrifying. He knows too much about the weaknesses of cats, meow meow...
Neko: That knock-knocking human seems very concerned about his... salary, but he is a noble, loyal soul. He has even made wooden cats.
Neko: They are all good people. Hibiki will surely become friends with them when she returns. Meow, meow...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Neko: Goodbye, meow meow.

## Talk

Traveler: The Warding Stones have been sealed.
Neko: Have they indeed? Most swift of you.
Neko: This way, my hair shall never again stand on end or be warped into furballs.
Neko: Excellent, excellent. Meow, meow.
