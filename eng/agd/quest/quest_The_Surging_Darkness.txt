# The Surging Darkness


## Talk 1

Paimon: Look! They must be trapped! Let's go help!

## Talk 2

Dargo: Reinforcements! Thank goodness!

## Talk 3

Dargo: Thank you for coming. We were almost at the breaking point.
Ardra: There were just too many monsters. They just kept coming, wave after wave. I've never seen it this bad.
Paimon: At least we got here in time. You all should get going.
Ardra: I know, but it's not that easy. A lot of people were hurt in the battle just now.
Ardra: Our cart was also attacked. And now, our supplies are scattered everywhere...
Kokpon: That's not important right now. We need to focus on getting out of here alive.
Ardra: I know, but those were medical supplies. What if they need them back at the Stadium...
Pumpu: It's them! Over here!
Pumpu: We came to help, but looks like you don't need it. Nice job making it through.
Nusta: Now we can head straight to the next location.
Paimon: What other areas need help?
Pumpu: Here, take a look at the latest battle report.
Pumpu: Messengers from the Scions of the Canopy are traveling all around Natlan to pass along the latest intel.
Pumpu: If you see a messenger from the Scions of the Canopy, feel free to ask them about the latest battle situation.
Paimon: Thanks! Now, where should we go next?
Nusta: Seems like you can hold your own in a fight, so let's split up. Choose where you want to go, and we'll take the rest.
Pumpu: Still looks like they could use some help here, though. These supplies are really important. What should we do?
Ardra: It's alright. Don't delay your rescue efforts on our account.
Dargo: But, if we stay here too long, the monsters might come back...
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler? Should we stay and help?
Paimon: Paimon will do whatever you decide!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wow, there are so many people here! Looks like it really is getting too dangerous for people to stay out in the wild.
Paimon: Guess that means the situation isn't getting any better... Well, we'll just have to keep fighting.

## Talk 5

Kinich: The situation is still quite grim. Here, take a look.
Kinich: Looks like this place also isn't as safe as we thought. That, plus the bridge to the Stadium is also compromised.
Paimon: Aaah, what's going on!?
Traveler: It's an Abyssal Pylon!
Ajaw: The rabble-rousers return. They don't know when to give up.
Kinich: An Abyssal Pylon, here... That's not good news. We need to deal with it, now.

## Talk 6

Achiyaku: Phew, thank you so much! You came just in time.
Waqar: What's going on? Were other places hit?
Paimon: Yeah, it seems like it.
Waqar: The Pyro Archon told us to be ready to evacuate. She warned us something like this could happen, but I never thought there would be this many monsters.
Wayta: You got here just in time, but what should we do about the wounded...
Paimon: The wounded?
Achiyaku: This area was hit bad. We're housing the wounded in this house for now, but we're short on medicine. It's not easy for them to get around, either.
Achiyaku: We don't know what to do next. We're sitting ducks if we stay here, but we can't just leave them behind.
Waqar: Thank goodness you're here, though. You saved us all.
Traveler: You should move them to the Scions of the Canopy while you have the chance.
Achiyaku: You're right. The monsters are gone, so it should be safe for now. Some of my men can escort them.
Wayta: That will take time, though, and some of the wounded can't walk. They might have to stay here...
Achiyaku: Don't worry. Once we escort the first group, I'll call for reinforcements. That way, everyone can evacuate.
Paimon: Let's help them out here for now. Then, we can head to the next area.
Paimon: There's a messenger over there. Don't forget — we can get the latest intel from them.

## Talk 7

Paimon: There are a lot of people in here. Could they all be refugees?

## Talk 8

Paimon: It's alright! You're safe now! The bad guys are all gone.
Paimon: Go and find your friends, okay? It's dangerous out here. It's best to stick together.
Traveler: I don't think they understood that.
Paimon: Okay, then... Shoo! Shoo! C'mon... Shoo!
Paimon: Nope, still nothing... Wait! There's something on the ground over there.
Paimon: Let's see... Oh! It's one of the battle reports from the Scions of the Canopy. This must be what the saurians were trying to protect.
Paimon: Looks pretty recent, too. We can use it to figure out where to go next.
Traveler: If it's recent, that means...
Paimon: You're right! Maybe they just dropped it by accident, though...
Paimon: Anyway, um, we saw the battle report, so you guys don't need to worry anymore.
Paimon: Huh, still no response...
Paimon: Well, what do you want to do? Follow the battle report? Or continue to explore this area?
Traveler: The messenger might still be nearby.

## Talk 9

Paimon: This is it! Looks like a battle is in progress. Let's go help them!

## Talk 10

Paimon: The battle report said a lot of monsters appeared around here.
Paimon: Wait, see the people fighting those monsters? Is that the Fatui!?

## Talk 11

Paimon: And we're off! Hey, this thing is pretty convenient!
Paimon: It's not only fast, but also saves us a lot of energy!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Oh, Kinich! You're back!
Kinich: Yeah, thought I would check on the situation after finishing my delivery work. If you're here, though, I doubt I'm needed.
Traveler: Every person counts.
Paimon: Yeah! It really feels like we are running short on people everywhere. It's so dangerous out there. Just when we think everything's under control, another thing goes off the deep end...
Paimon: Not that Paimon's complaining. It's just.. what if things get even worse?
Ajaw: *scoff* What a stupid question. You know the answer, you're just too afraid to face it... like a puny bug clinging to a pipe dream.
Paimon: Okay, that's enough out of you!
Kinich: *sigh* This may be one of the few times Ajaw has a point.
Kinich: On the bright side, we can pat ourselves on the back for saving all these civilians, and bringing them here.
Kinich: My tribe is launching a second wave of patrols soon. We'll do a scan of the whole nation. As long as we don't scatter our forces, the Abyss is nothing to fear.
Ajaw: Fear is useless, anyway. Even if the endless surge of monsters scares you to death, you still have to fight. There's no other choice.
Traveler: Where is Mavuika?
Kinich: She took a small team of warriors to the mines. A group of people from the Children of Echoes were trapped there. I think she just got back.
Kinich: The lava alone makes that area dangerous, and now it's crawling with monsters. Without her power, she's just an ordinary Vision-bearer like the rest of us. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
Ajaw: Spewing nonsense, as always... Quit worrying and look at the outcome, genius! She's still obviously the strongest warrior you have.
Paimon: Yeah! She always seems so confident. Plus, she told us you can only become the Archon by proving your strength.
Kinich: It's true. She certainly helps us save manpower. She can handle the dangerous areas almost entirely on her own.
Ajaw: Alright, alright. I'm tired of this conversation. Either take a break or get moving already!
Kinich: A break sounds good. We won't be much help in the field if we're dead on our feet.
Paimon: Good idea. Maybe we can see if the people around here need anything in the meantime?
Traveler: Even on our break, we can still be helpful.
Paimon: Hehe, looks like we're on the same page.
Traveler: We wanted a breather anyway.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Wh—What was that?
Ajaw: The physical embodiment of pure dread and destruction! Hahaha, that black pit of despair will eat you all alive! Ah, at long last!
Paimon: "Ahahaha." Laugh all you want, it's gonna eat you too!
Kinich: So is that the source of the Abyss's power?
Traveler: It emitted a huge amount of Abyssal energy.
Kinich: I have to get a closer look at that thing. It may already be too late...
Kinich: Get to the place mentioned in the battle report — I have a feeling things are about to get very bad very quickly. There's no time to lose!
Traveler: You got it.
Paimon: The fact that deadpan Kinich is this nervous just goes to show how serious this really is...
Paimon: Let's go. The disaster's really happening...
Traveler: This is a full-scale invasion of Natlan.

Diligent Yumkasaur: ...

### Additional Talk 6

Wisa: No! I won't go!

### Additional Talk 7

Valiant Tepetlisaur: ...

### Additional Talk 8

Ajaw: The Almighty Dragonlord K'uhul Ajaw is trying to rest. Cease your racket at once, lowly creatures. We shall take no comments on the matter.

### Additional Talk 10

Yaretzi: Just stay calm... Time to be brave...
Yaretzi: You're a warrior. It's your job to protect people...

### Additional Talk 11

Acama: This uniform brings back a lot of memories. Been a while since I last wore it.
Acama: But, hey... Still fits like a glove!

### Additional Talk 12

Guselnikov: The Captain was right. The situation is not looking good. Just look at the amount of people we've had to rescue.
Guselnikov: We shouldn't linger. We'll get these people back on the road, then head to our next destination.

### Additional Talk 13

Kamaka: Saved by the Fatui... Now that's lucky...

### Additional Talk 14

Andinet: The protection of this location is critical. Our current forces won't be enough. We need reinforcements.
Tewodros: I'm sure other areas are thinking the exact same thing...

### Additional Talk 15

Maticui: *panting*... That's it. I need a break.

### Additional Talk 16

Icmotza: Ugh, I'm terrified... The monsters aren't gonna show up here... right?

### Additional Talk 17

Ardra: It's you two! I'm so glad you're alright!
Paimon: Hey! You made it back!

Ardra: Plus, we managed to deliver the medical supplies to the Stadium. I really can't thank you enough for your help!

### Additional Talk 18

Diligent Yumkasaur: No going outside. It's too dangerous. That goes for you too!

### Additional Talk 19

Valiant Tepetlisaur: Thanks for saving us, human. The next time those pesky monsters show up, I'll fight them off!

### Additional Talk 20

Ackon: The commissions just keep coming one after another. Normally I'd be happy, but given the circumstances...
Botwe: It's only a "commission" if you get paid. This is something else entirely.
Kweku: Still, everyone's doing their part. There's more to adventuring than commission fees. Anyone can be an adventurer...
Botwe: Except those who like to play it safe.

### Additional Talk 21

Acama: Nice work out there. This is for you.
Acama: Don't forget to refuel, or you won't have enough strength when it counts!
