# To My Old Friend, Wind Brings My Greetings


## Talk 1

Kaeya: #Well, well, long time no see, Traveler!
Paimon: Kaeya, we went to the Lantern Rite in Liyue!
Kaeya: Ah. Well, how was it? Fun?
Paimon: Delicious!
Kaeya: Well then, you ought to be looking forward to Mondstadt's Ludi Harpastum. I'm sure it will be to your liking.
Traveler: Get to the point, Paimon.
Paimon: Right, right! Kaeya, there's something we need to tell you about.
Kaeya: Hmm... Lantern supplies... Stockpile of wood, paper, and oil... At the very least, it sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
Kaeya: Haha, how very amusing. What makes you think I would recognize this symbol?
Traveler: You're amazing at everything and we trust you.
Paimon: Oh, that about sums it up!
Kaeya: Hah. I'm flattered, but don't you think you might be overestimating me?
Paimon: There it is! At last, Kaeya displays the knightly virtue of modesty, perfectly articulated and masterfully delivered.
Kaeya: My goodness, your stay in Liyue seems to have sharpened your wit and broadened your vocabulary.
Kaeya: Anyway, I digress. This is the symbol of the cross-border criminal organization you know as the Treasure Hoarders.
Kaeya: If you are curious to know more, I can put you in touch with an informant on the inside.
Paimon: Uhh, didn't you just say the Knights of Favonius don't have dealings with their enemies!?
Kaeya: ...This is my own personal informant. Nothing to do with the Knights of Favonius.
Kaeya: A little later, make your way over to Windrise. I'll arrange for the informant to meet you there.
Paimon: Thanks, Kaeya.
Kaeya: Oh, and remember: "wine begets wisdom."
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: You flirt with the dark side, so you would know.
Paimon: Exactly!
Kaeya: Uh-ah! You should watch what you say, Honorary Knight.
Kaeya: What do you mean, flirt with the dark side? The Knights of Favonius certainly does not have dealings with its enemies.
Kaeya: That has to do with a certain knightly virtue called "integrity."

## Talk 2

Bei'er: Sorry mate, wrong way. Wherever you think you're going, it's that way.
Paimon: But isn't that the way to Liyue Harbor?
Bei'er: Right. Here is nowhere. So the other way is Liyue Harbor.
Crafty: If you're looking for somewhere to stay, I suggest you go to the Wangshu Inn. Fair prices, great customer service, and a wonderful view.
Traveler: Show us the anonymous letter.
Bei'er: ...How do you know about the letter?
Paimon: ...Uh, one of Liyue's adepti told us about it!
Bei'er: Did they now? I somehow doubt that.
Xiao (???): You should not doubt it. It was I who sent them to investigate.
Xiao: Any further questioning, you may direct to me.
Bei'er: ...You're the Vigilant Yaksha!?
Paimon: Hey, watch your tone of voice! Or do you seriously wanna pick a fight with an adeptus?
Crafty: Uh, okay. It's not that we don't believe you're an adeptus, it's just... Everyone needs to look at the bigger picture here.
Bei'er: As you well know, we Treasure Hoarders are no serious threat to anyone. We're petty criminals, that's all.
Crafty: So if you are truly an adeptus, please... Show us some mercy, would you?
Bei'er: Of course, if it turns out you're not a real adeptus...
Crafty: Then please, don't blame our weapons for treating everyone equally...

## Talk 3

Bei'er: Please, oh great one! Heroic Yaksha of Liyue! Divine Adeptus and friend of the people! Have mercy!
Crafty: The letter is drivel anyway! It's not worth an armed conflict... Just take it!
Paimon: How about that — Paimon knew it all along!
Paimon: #Let's see what they wrote, Traveler.
Xiao: I see. Then let us send these two to the meeting.
Xiao: The sender may be plotting something truly diabolical for the Lantern Rite. It seems they want to burn down the entire city.
Bei'er: Great, everyone's happy. You're good, we're good. However...
Crafty: These two... They don't look anything like us.
Paimon: It'll be fine. When we're in disguise, no-one will be the wiser.
Bei'er: It still seems like a long shot to me, but... with the help of an adeptus, hopefully everything will turn out fine...
Crafty: Well, the safety of Liyue is in your hands now. Good luck — even the Treasure Hoarders don't want to see the city burned to the ground.
Xiao: Then it is settled.
Traveler: Wait!
Xiao: *sigh* What is it?
Traveler: Next time we meet...
Xiao: Huh?
Traveler: Let's make it somewhere with a view of the Mingxiao Lantern.
Xiao: ...I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
Xiao: Must we?
Traveler: Yes!
Xiao: ...Understood. I shall await your news there.
