Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Tieshan: My name is Tieshan. I'm a member of the Millelith, and I work to defend Liyue Harbor.
Tieshan: Well, actually, I'm not from the city. Qingxu Pool's where my home is, thereabouts.
Tieshan: Perhaps Rex Lapis has smiled upon my dutiful service, because after I heard the last round of divine predictions at the Rite of Descension...
Tieshan: ...I tried helping my family to do some business on the side, and what do you know â€” we actually had some small success.
Tieshan: Recently, I've moved my family property to Chihu Rock, so I suppose I do count as a citizen of Liyue Harbor now. *chuckles*
