Traveler: Could you tell me about the Melusines?
Liath: You'd like to know more about us?
Liath: Hmm... Well, we were born from the flesh and blood of the giant beast Elynas.
Liath: Don't be shocked by that. Elynas is a gentle mother who taught us children how to survive in this world.
Liath: Later, however, Elynas ceased speaking, and so we asked Monsieur Neuvillette to take us to the Court of Fontaine to live.
Liath: And that's how I came to be here, patrolling this place in my uniform. We've had lots of help â€” we're a very fortunate race, I think.
