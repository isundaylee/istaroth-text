# Ellin, the Wannabe Knight


## Talk 1

Ellin: Ugh, what a headache... What am I supposed to do about this?
Traveler: What are you up to?
Ellin: Practicing for the Knights of Favonius' tryouts!
Ellin: *sigh* But I'm nowhere near as powerful as Jean.
Ellin: I think it's better for me to focus on technique rather than power.
Ellin: For example, I was thinking about how to break all these wooden dummies in one fell swoop.
Ellin: They're a lot more robust than they look, this is no trivial task... I don't know where my father managed to get them from, but he must have gone to a lot of effort.

## Talk 2

Ellin: How are you getting along? Had a eureka moment yet?
Traveler: Still thinking it over...
Ellin: Huh. I've met a few other Adventurers before. They were the same way.
Ellin: They fight monsters like pros, but they're hopelessly lost when it comes to trying to break a few wooden sticks.
Ellin: And they reinforce the wood like it's for building a storm shelter or something... Way overestimating their own strength.
Ellin: If they want a challenge so desperately, why don't they just go off into the wilderness and pick a fight with the biggest monster they can find?

## Talk 3

Ellin: Nailed it!
Ellin: Huh, I never even thought of trying that...
Ellin: Thanks! I'm gonna try it myself now.
