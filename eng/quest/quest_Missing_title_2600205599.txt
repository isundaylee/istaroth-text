Traveler: Interesting.
Nayab: You think so, too? Then you should come to Puspa Caf√© more often. It has people fighting tooth and nail every day!
Nayab: I mean fighting in Genius Invokation TCG, of course. If someone started an actual fight, the acting manager would flip out before I did.
Nayab: Say, are you free now? I want to show you the new deck I built, and maybe you can help me figure out how I can win with it?
