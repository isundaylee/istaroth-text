# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Chevreuse: It's rare that I get the chance to relax like this.
Chevreuse: Also... I've been meaning to ask whether you would be willing to assist me with some missions. With your help, I imagine the perpetrators will practically catch themselves!
Traveler: Where's the fight?
Chevreuse: There's certainly a chance we may need to resort to violence. But, the readiness of your answer seems to suggest that you're quite used to that sort of thing.
Chevreuse: Don't worry. That wasn't an accusation.
Chevreuse: Sometimes, it's the only "language" people will understand. If anybody, I know that best of all.
Chevreuse: So, do we have an agreement?
Traveler: Alright, so what's the plan?
Chevreuse: For missions that require infiltration and surveillance, I was thinking that this teapot might make good cover.
Chevreuse: But now I see that entering and exiting are rather complicated. So how about this... I bring the teapot on the mission with you inside as backup.
Traveler: ...I beg your pardon?
Chevreuse: When you hear me tap on the side of the teapot, you jump out, and we take down the perpetrators together.
Chevreuse: "Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance TEAPOT-rol" does have a certain ring to it. It's decided then!
Traveler: Sorry, I can't give the teapot to you...
Chevreuse: Ah... I see.
Chevreuse: I suppose I'll have to train you to be a proper Garde then. If you can handle it, that is.
Traveler: And the compensation?
Chevreuse: I think you'll find me to be quite generous, especially when it comes to my friends.
Chevreuse: Also, in case it sweetens the deal... if the food at the Victory Feast isn't to your taste, I'd be happy to share some of my more... criminally delicious snacks with you.
