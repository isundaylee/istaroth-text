Traveler: About the Scholars...
Paimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.
Paimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...
Paimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...
Paimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?
Traveler: Probably...
Paimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be "pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge" or something?
Paimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.
Traveler: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.
Paimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...
Traveler: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.
Traveler: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper
Paimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!
Paimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?
Traveler: To validate your original thesis...
Traveler: To get their research paper written as quickly as possible.
