Traveler: They're both adepti, so I'm sure everything will be fine.
Little Mao: Really? But... if they're fine, why couldn't I find Bluey anywhere when I went to play in the mountains after that, then?
Little Mao: I walked along the river for ages, eating several large fruits and getting hungry two or three times along the way, but I couldn't find her anywhere. In the end, I lay down next to a giant tree and fell asleep. It was in my dream that I saw her.
Little Mao: She told me to eat until I was full after waking up and then go home first because she was busy with something.
Little Mao: After I woke up, I ate the fruits Bluey left next to me and then went home like she told me to...
Little Mao: Bluey didn't tell me what she was busy with... but maybe I can help her!
