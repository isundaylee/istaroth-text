# End of the Line


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's getting darker...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Itto!
Kuki Shinobu: ...
Arataki Itto: Phew... hah... how 'bout that, huh? The path, did ya... see it...
Kuki Shinobu: ...*sigh* Why do you always have to do things like this...
Yanfei: Shinobu...?
Paimon: What happened to Itto? Did he pass out?
Ushi: Moo!
Kuki Shinobu: The boss used up all his strength in one punch. Maybe that's the reason he managed to tear open a passage.
Yelan: ...Let me see if there's any way I can stabilize it.
Yanfei: He did this because he heard us arguing, right?
Kuki Shinobu: The thing with Boss is, he just can't stand conflict between teammates.
Kuki Shinobu: Whenever we get into an argument in the Arataki Gang, he always goes and does something shocking to calm everyone down.
Kuki Shinobu: Today, he's done it again. He may not have known you for very long, but when he said he sees everyone as part of the same team, he truly means that.
Ushi: Moo.
Kuki Shinobu: Another thing with Boss is, he hates it when other people sacrifice themselves, but he always seems to end up doing it himself... That said, there's a slight distinction to be made with him.
Kuki Shinobu: When he does things like this, he doesn't really think he's sacrificing himself, because he genuinely believes that he's strong enough to defeat any obstacle he's facing.
Paimon: Giant ego alert... And wasn't he just doing the same thing Xiao suggested? So stupid!
Traveler: Why didn't you try to stop him?
Kuki Shinobu: The boss is hardly open to persuasion. Besides, he always acts without thinking. There's no doubt that he really thought he was about to solve everything in one hit.
Kuki Shinobu: It's not just him either. The other guys in the Arataki Gang are more or less the same. That's why they need someone like me to clean up after them.
Kuki Shinobu: I couldn't stop him if I tried, so I might as well just let him do his thing. Besides, often his hare-brained intuition is surprisingly on point. We might punch our way out of here yet.
Paimon: Uhh... Itto... Please tell Paimon you're okay...
Xiao: ...I'm sorry.
Kuki Shinobu: Don't be, you have nothing to apologize for. Both you and Yelan made some very good points.
Kuki Shinobu: Still, if this was an Arataki Gang issue and you were one of our members, I have to say I'd side with Yelan on this one.
Kuki Shinobu: The boss definitely wasn't sacrificing himself. He firmly believed that we'd be able to find a way out through the passage he opened up, and he's certainly not expecting to be left behind.
Kuki Shinobu: Everyone's important. We have to support each other if we're going to get out of here. Your survival is of huge importance to some people... no, to a whole lot of people.
Paimon: ...Shinobu...
Kuki Shinobu: Everyone, let's all do our best to try and find a way out. There's still a chance... I'm sure we can escape.
Kuki Shinobu: Leave the boss to me. Don't worry.
Xiao: ...
Yelan: Everyone, it seems this passage doesn't lead to the outside world, but deeper inside.
Paimon: What the... so Itto's efforts were in vain...
Yelan: No, it's still worth exploring. I'll go and take a look first.
Yanfei: ...Aha, I see! I'm with you.
Paimon: Uh, what?
Yanfei: So far, I still haven't found the thing I came looking for. That magical device. Remember?
Yanfei: If this domain has the power to project our imaginations or the things we're searching for into reality... Well, maybe I can use that to my advantage to track it down.
Paimon: Oh, right! No wonder she keeps telling us to keep going... If it's a magical device, it must be super powerful!
Yanfei: Well, I can't guarantee that, but it's worth a try.
Xiao: I will find a way.
Traveler: Wait...
Yanfei: #Let them go. But if you were planning on going into that domain too, Traveler, then come with me.
Yanfei: After all, I'm just a lawyer, hehe. We'll be safer if we team up.
Yanfei: By the way, um... You and Xiao seem pretty close, huh? Yelan got a bit worked up just now, so I just wanted to apologize on her behalf.
Yanfei: I have to say, though, if Yelan hadn't spoken out like she did, I'm not sure she would've gotten through to him. Also... self-sacrifice is something Yelan feels strongly about. She'd try to stop whoever it was.
Yanfei: From what I know, she's lost comrades in the line of duty before, and then was rescued herself. Maybe being a survivor is what makes her so against seeing other people sacrifice themselves.
Yanfei: How can things ever be the same again, knowing that your life was saved when others weren't? In a way, salvation can also be a burden.
Yanfei: ...If I were her, I'm not sure if I would have done anything different.
Traveler: ...
Yanfei: Oh! Wait, one second, I'll be right there.
Yanfei: ...Hya!
Yanfei: Right, that's much safer. Since Itto can't fight right now, I've cast a spell to protect you guys.
Kuki Shinobu: Thank you, Senpai. Please be careful.
Yanfei: We will, same to you.
Yanfei: Alright, Traveler, let's go.

## Talk 3

Yanfei: What's this?
Traveler: What a weird and wonderful scene...
Yanfei: Look at that huge disc in the distance... Hold on, is that the Fantastic Compass?
Traveler: It's even bigger than a cooking pot...
Paimon: What? That's the best description you can come up with? It's way, way bigger than that!
Yanfei: Huh, well, it seems our theory checked out. In my humble legal opinion, that's almost certainly the magical device I've been looking for. It really showed up...
Yanfei: But, if this really is the Fantastic Compass... It's so huge! How the heck am I gonna lug that back to my office!
Yanfei: #...Ahem, I mean, come on Yanfei, don't give up now. Let's investigate the area first, Traveler.
Yanfei: What the...! Are they... are they Treasure Hoarders?
Traveler: What are Treasure Hoarders doing here?
Yanfei: They look familiar... Oh, yeah, I bumped into these rapscallions a few days ago.
Traveler: It's even bigger than all our heads combined...
Traveler: Spacetime has become totally chaotic...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh? What's that shiny round thing on the ground?.
Traveler: (It looks like...)

## Talk 5

Yanfei: Phew, easy peasy. Just like last time.
Yanfei: You know, when I ran into them before, I was working on a big commercial case. The defendant hired them to attack me, just to get back at me.
Traveler: Being a legal adviser sounds tough...
Yanfei: Eh, happens all the time. Luckily, I'm well trained in martial arts, so taking them down was a piece of cake.
Yanfei: But these are the exact same guys as I met last time... Is this space recreating scenes from my memory?
Yanfei: Maybe this is one of the ways our adversary intends to devour us... unbelievable.

## Talk 6

Yanfei: I thought we might run into some other people here, but apparently not...
Traveler: Yanfei, what's that sound?
Yanfei: The Fatui? Whose memory is this?
Yanfei: Aaah, watch out!
Yelan: Hmph, just as I thought.
Yanfei: Yelan, you're here!
Yelan: I will take you down no matter how many times you show up.
Yanfei: Hey, relax, we're all together now.

## Talk 7

Yelan: Amateurs. And still they dare to come after me.
Yanfei: You've still got it.
Traveler: That voice just now...
Yelan: Remember how I said I'd seen some illusions myself?
Yelan: Those were the same words I heard last time. The space seems to be reproducing that memory...
Yelan: Now that you know, at least we're all on the same page.
Yanfei: He said the word "fantastic"... was he talking about the Fantastic Compass?
Yelan: Yanfei, see that thing on the ground?
Yanfei: Yeah, we tinkered with it, that's how we met up with you. I guess it's a miniature version of the Fantastic Compass in the distance... It has a close connection to the entire space.
Yelan: Hmm. It looks somewhat familiar, let me think...

## Talk 8

Yelan: ...Another new space.
Yanfei: If everywhere within this space follows the same rules, there must be another small Fantastic Compass somewhere around here.
Xiao: ...Bosacius, I can't believe someone like you would end up as a lost soul underground.
Traveler: Xiao!
Yelan: No enemies? Hold on...
Yanfei: Wait... is the enemy hiding itself? Oh no, we should go help himâ€”
Xiao: Stay back!
Xiao: This is my fight... do not come near me.

## Talk 9

Xiao: Ugh! ...*cough*
Xiao: Enough... phantom, be gone!
Bosacius (???): Argh!
Paimon: Xiao, are you okay?
Traveler: You haven't even recovered from your injuries yet...
Xiao: This is my purpose. Don't worry about me.
Yelan: So your invisible opponent was the legendary Bosacius, Marshal Vritras?
Xiao: Yes.
Xiao: So excuse my stubbornness. Bosacius has been missing for centuries... This may have been the last time I will ever see him.
Paimon: He was saying something about holding the line at all costs...
Xiao: He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.
Paimon: But didn't you say he'd always announce his name? How could his name be lost to time? ...What happened?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I don't know. Maybe he forgot who he was.
Yanfei: Because the karma you spoke of drove him to madness?
Xiao: Bosacius had already gone mad before he disappeared. There was no way of knowing if his memories were intact.
Yelan: He still took part in the battle of The Chasm, despite having gone mad?
Traveler: ...
Xiao: We yakshas are not a race that thrive in peacetime. It's likely that he was drawn by the scent of bloody war.
Xiao: Slaughter is what we do best... Maybe it's the only thing we know.
Traveler: ...
Xiao: This battle confirmed my suspicions. As we had speculated, this space reflects information from people's minds.
Xiao: In other words, despite going mad, Bosacius came here. The illusion we saw just now is the impression he left behind.
Xiao: This space recreated him as he was during the battle. The way he fought was so self-destructive... He couldn't possibly have survived.
Traveler: He fought the monsters...
Yelan: Bosacius's illusion said he'd discovered the monsters' weakness and lured them underground.
Yelan: What kind of place could this be? Defeating Khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure.
Yanfei: Guys, it could just be me, but... I think I'm suddenly feeling more tired than I was.
Yelan: This space is really starting to affect us.
Xiao: I believe Bosacius stayed here, underground. But now he is gone, and only his illusion remains.
Xiao: If we don't leave, we may meet the same fate.
Traveler: Let's go.
Xiao: Time to move on.
Xiao: You fought well, Bosacius. Goodbye.

## Talk 10

Yelan: Alright, here will be fine. Take a moment to catch your breath while I try to unlock the Fantastic Compass.

## Talk 11

Kuki Shinobu: Don't worry. Ushi and I know how to take care of the boss.
Kuki Shinobu: I think I can speak for both of us in saying, it's not our first rodeo.
Ushi: Moo, moo!
Kuki Shinobu: Go on, get outta here. And be careful.

## Talk 12

Paimon: There's nothing here at all!
Yanfei: What a creepy space.
Yelan: It has the feel of the Abyss.
Yelan: But... where are the opponents?
Xiao: ...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: I think this is my memory.
Paimon: Your memory? Of what?
Traveler: Of emptiness. That's the power of the Abyss.
Paimon: The Abyss? So... this place is created purely based on your memory?
Traveler: I'm afraid so. Because I will always remember...
Traveler: ...That the Abyss took my twin away.

## Talk 13

Paimon: *gasp* It's... it's...
Traveler: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}! Wait!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Huh? What's that shiny round thing on the ground?
Traveler: (It looks like...)
Yanfei: ...The Fantastic Compass?
Yelan: In the other spaces, the Fantastic Compass was always partially buried in the ground. But this one is lying flat, intact... as if somebody left it here.
Paimon: #Oh... {F#he}{M#she} was just a figment of your imagination, Traveler...?
Paimon: #So {F#he}{M#she} appeared as an illusion because you miss {F#him}{M#her} so much, huh?
Traveler: #I can sense that {F#he}{M#she} is not here.
Traveler: But at least we found this.
Paimon: Mmm...
Yelan: Yanfei, are you sure this is the Fantastic Compass you're looking for?
Yanfei: I think so. There were no pictures in the will, but based on the description, it seems to check out.
Yanfei: Yelan? What is it?
Yelan: From the design and build, this Fantastic Compass looks extremely similar to the catalysts used by my clan. I just need to do this, and...
Yelan: ...Hmph, someone's used this before. There may be a hidden message inside.
Yelan: Let's get out of here and find somewhere safer.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Xiao: Bosacius was the leader of the Five Yakshas under Rex Lapis's command. He could control Electro energy.
Xiao: Unlike me, he was both a formidable warrior and a talented commander.
Xiao: ...

### Additional Talk 2

Yanfei: Now that I've found the Fantastic Compass, my work here is done.
Yanfei: But if the Bosacius we saw was just an illusion, will we really be able to take anything we find here back to the outside world? Hmm...

### Additional Talk 3

Yelan: Within Yin and Yang, among the five regions, water, fire, wind, and thunder cycle like the seasons. Grasp the seven heavens from the ground, open wide the three gates, all the world within reach...

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Looks like there's some information here. Shall we take a look?
Yanfei: Okay, let's see.
Yelan: ...
Yelan: It looks like these were letters written by the Millelith soldiers who stayed here.
Paimon: So who's this "Boyang" they mentioned?
Yelan: Boyang was... one of my ancestors. The one who didn't make it back.
Yanfei: You mean, Boyang fought alongside Bosacius?
Yelan: I believe so.
Xiao: And the Millelith soldiers were their brothers-in-arms.
Yelan: ...I guess now we have a pretty good idea of where everyone that went missing ended up.
Xiao: Yes.
Paimon: Uhhh... So scary. What happened...
Yelan: Come on. Let's not stay here.
Yelan: I have a gut feeling that sooner or later we'll connect all the dots... and then, we'll finally know the truth.
Yelan: Still, who knows how this space is planning on revealing the answer to us.
