Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Ningguang: This is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
Ningguang: Much like the days in the Jade Chamber...
Traveler: Surely this place doesn't compare to the Jade Chamber...?
Ningguang: Oh, you misunderstand.
Ningguang: An environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
Ningguang: I sense the time and effort that you have put into this place, which reminds me of the time and effort I myself spent when constructing the Jade Chamber.
Ningguang: Or, to put it another way, I see this as the "Jade Chamber" that belongs to you.
Traveler: You're too kind.
Ningguang: Please. Kindness has nothing to do with it.
