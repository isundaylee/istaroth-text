# The Final Experiment: Withering Glory


## Talk 1

Albedo: I imagine you must have encountered more than a few conundrums during your travels.
Albedo: I'd like to observe your intelligence by means of a practical test of your capabilities — much as we did for the physical test.
Traveler: No problem.
Albedo: I'd like you to explore these ruins and return with your findings.
Albedo: There are two puzzles located at the far ends of the ruins. After completion, you should be able to activate the mechanism in the center.
Albedo: As with the physical test, there are no restrictions. Everything you do is an action I wish to observe.
Traveler: I'm getting good at these.
Albedo: A tried and tested adventurer I see.
Albedo: So, let's see you in action. Start wherever you like.
Traveler: Where there's a will, there's a way.
Albedo: Remember that this is a test of intellect. So should you get lucky in any way, that won't be factored in as part of the test.
Traveler: Wouldn't a written test suffice...?

## Talk 2

Examine Easel: (Albedo's artwork are laid out here. His creative process isn't easy to understand.)

## Talk 3

Albedo: Seelie like these are a common sight in the mountains.
Albedo: #Returning them to their rightful places is up to you, Traveler.

## Talk 4

Observe Record Board: (A board with experimental reports stuck onto it. The amount of incomprehensible content on it seems to have increased.)

## Talk 5

Observe Shelf: (The objects piled over here have yet to gather dust. Looks like this camp has been used recently.)

## Talk 6

Observe Record Board: (A board with experimental reports stuck onto it. The amount of incomprehensible content on it has increased once more.)
Observe Record Board: (...Well, whatever. You've helped him out, and that's what matters.)

## Talk 7

Observe Picture: (Like Albedo's various experiments, the symbols here make no sense.)
Observe Picture: (Hopefully, his research into these symbols will bear fruit all the same.)

## Talk 8

Albedo: Oh? Seems that the water level has suddenly decreased.
Albedo: We should be able to see what's in the water now, let's have a look.

## Talk 9

Albedo: You're back! Good timing, I've just about reached a conclusion.
Albedo: You took quite a while. Did you get held up on the way back?
Traveler: Not really.
Albedo: Time for the results. We got a myriad of data today, and it was very difficult to finish all the research in one go.
Albedo: But the integral preliminary conclusion that I can offer you is... You're very much like a human from this world.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: You couldn't tell that just by looking?
Paimon: We spent all day working our butts off for that!?
Albedo: Please, I understand that this may have seemed self-evident to you, but in fact nothing in this world should be taken for granted.
Albedo: Have you ever considered that the world of Teyvat may have a natural hostility to outlanders?
Traveler: Only the gods would know.
Albedo: I mentioned the natural laws of this world. You're able to converse with me here without consequence, and nothing seems amiss. But it's arguably a small miracle.
Albedo: The only other life form that, like you, has come here from afar, is the seed that I mentioned. Under the effects of Teyvat's natural laws, it isn't even able to sprout, let alone bloom.
Albedo: But after I observed you, I had another idea.
Albedo: Imitating you helped to inspire my alchemy, and so...
Paimon: Whoa! It looks like — something's appearing!
Albedo: The transition from nothing into something, from shoot to stem... And now to fruition.
Albedo: Is not nurturing otherworldly life also nurturing the world itself?
Paimon: Aww...
Traveler: It was beautiful.
Albedo: *sigh* It would seem that that's as far as we go. A transient bloom of incomparable beauty... Life's proudest achievement.
Paimon: Paimon thought, with all our efforts, it might have bloomed forever. And it didn't even have any fruit...
Albedo: Life is a manifold tapestry of free entities, its value shouldn't derive from how long it stays with us. Even a momentary burst is precious.
Albedo: A short life can be well-lived. A life lived efficiently, lived to perfection, is necessarily one unburdened by loneliness.
Albedo: So, do you understand what I meant about us conversing here arguably being a small miracle?
Traveler: Well, I haven't withered just yet.
Paimon: Eh? Things feel a little heavy right now...
Paimon: #Hehehe, don't be sad, Traveler, you've got Paimon to look after you.
Paimon: Albedo, Paimon really wants to be your friend.
Albedo: ...Thank you both. Even if dispelling loneliness is not essential for life, it certainly doesn't hurt.
Albedo: #Your help inspired me to discover the means to make a flower bloom, Traveler.
Traveler: So I'm a helpful specimen?
Albedo: I mean that the time that I've spent traveling with you in the mountains was a valuable journey for me.
Albedo: In the future... If the need arises... Can I solicit your help again?
Traveler: Sure, even if you just want some company, find me anytime.
Albedo: Well... Glad I can count on you.
Albedo: Missing text (2183099978)
Albedo: #I made a point throughout of telling him how ordinary the results were...
Albedo: But what was that sediment I saw forming at the bottom of the vial? It should not have been there... What could it mean?
Albedo: Those born of earth are bound by its imperfections, but those born of chalk are free of impurities... You and I are alike, both composed of a substance that has yet to be fully defined...
Albedo: If one day, I lose control... destroy Mondstadt... destroy everything...
Albedo: Can I rely on you to stop me?
Traveler: #(I wonder how my {F#brother}{M#sister} is...)
Traveler: It was so short-lived.
Traveler: Perhaps.
Traveler: That's it?
Traveler: Quite literally, by a sister no less.
Albedo: Aha, I wouldn't worry, she's just doing her job.

## Talk 10

Observe Table: (Looks like an alchemy work table. Some potions and other apparatus are laid out here.)
Observe Table: (This experiment seems to be in progress. Is it really okay to just leave it lying around here?)
