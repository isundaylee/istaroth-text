# Starcrystal Dance

When a character obtains an Elemental Shard created by a Geo Elemental Reaction, a small shockwave will be unleashed that will deal 500% of that character's ATK as DMG to nearby opponents. Additionally, all characters in the party gain a 40% Geo DMG Bonus for 10s after this effect is triggered. These effects can be triggered once every 5s and this CD is shared between all party members.
