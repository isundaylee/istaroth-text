# After the Storm


## Talk 1

Wagner: Traveler, do you have a moment?
Traveler: What is it?
Wagner: Have you heard of Stormterror's Lair? It's those ruins outside Mondstadt.
Wagner: While Stormterror made the place his home, it was shrouded in a whirling, impassable storm. No one could pass through, so the precious crystal ore in there hasn't been mined.
Wagner: I've heard people say that the storm around the area has disappeared. That should have been a prime moment to go for the ore veins...
Wagner: ...But with so many places in the city needing repairs, our smithy's services are in high demand. Schulz can't hold the fort down alone either, so I can't leave.
Wagner: What say you go have a look, Traveler? If you find any crystal ore, bring some back with you.

## Talk 2

Wagner: So, did you manage to mine any ore?
Traveler: I have it right here.
Wagner: Let me see. Huh. These crystal ores actually don't look half bad.
Wagner: Here's your payment. Take it for your trouble.
Wagner: So, this means that the storm around Stormterror's Lair has indeed dispersed. I should make time to go there myself soon...

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'm on the case.
Wagner: My thanks. These crystal ores should help in forging and in restoring the city as well...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I have other things to do...
Wagner: That's no issue. We aren't in a rush. When I have time, I'll check it out myself.

## Talk 5

Traveler: So, about the ores...
Wagner: There's still much work to be done. I need to put my back into it...
