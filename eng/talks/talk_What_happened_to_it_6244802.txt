Traveler: What happened to it?
Qiu'ge: *cough* I'm a recent debutante, but I hurt my throat while singing a short time ago.
Qiu'ge: Mm... Well, it's not much. My teacher used to say that this often happens to us opera singers.
Qiu'ge: Fortunately, the troupe seems to have stopped performing for certain reasons, which has given me time to rest my voice... *cough*
Qiu'ge: *sigh* How many more times must I hurt my throat before I can become a star like Yun Jin?
