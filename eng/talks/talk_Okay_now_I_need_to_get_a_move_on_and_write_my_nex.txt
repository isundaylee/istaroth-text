Xinyan: Okay, now I need to get a move on and write my next song!
Yun Jin: Listen to you, you only just fulfilled one lifetime dream. Are you really thinking about your next goal already?
Xinyan: Don't try to tell me you ain't the same way. I bet you've already thought up a name for your next opera, haven't ya?
Yun Jin: Hehe... You know me too well, Xinyan.
Yun Jin: "The Adeptus-Seeking Voyage"... How does that sound?
Xinyan: Aw, man! Yeah, I can already picture it!
Yun Jin: I've also got just the finishing line for it! I will close with: "And the celestial melody echoed through the clouds forevermore."
