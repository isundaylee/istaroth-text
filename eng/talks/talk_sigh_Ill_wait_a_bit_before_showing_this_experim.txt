# Talk Dialog

Jami: *sigh* I'll wait a bit before showing this experiment report to my mentor.
Traveler: Why's that?
Jami: Well, my mentor's... still kinda laid up at Bimarstan.
Jami: The doctors say that he'll only recover next month at the earliest. Recently, many of my senior students have said that his temper's improved... Well, getting angry is counterproductive to recovering from internal injuries, after all.
Jami: Only when he sees me does he get so angry that his beard stands on end and he will try to get out of bed, clutching his cane.
Jami: The doctors say that we shouldn't meet for the time being. I mean, "absence makes the heart grow fonder," yes?
