# There Will Come Soft Rains


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wait a second! Why would these things be here!?
Seymour: Hostile reactions detected. Threat assessment: intermediate. Seymour, entering sweeper mode. Please get behind me, Ms. Mamere.

## Talk 2

Puca: Um... P—Please, get away from me! I—I'm just a normal Melusine, and I'm not tasty at all! Even if you did eat me, it wouldn't fill your tummy!
Paimon: No, silly! We're here to save you! We got rid of the monsters already. You're Puca, right?
Puca: Um... Y—Yes?
Paimon: Huh. Who'd have thought that a Melusine could get caught in seagrass...
Paimon: She's trapped there... Let's find some way to get rid of this seagrass!

## Talk 3

Seymour: Mining module activated.
Paimon: Eh? You just smashed that to pieces...
Mamere: #You're... pretty strong, aren't you, Seymour? Actually, now's not the time to worry about that. C'mon, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, we need to get back quickly!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wait, what's wrong? Why can't we continue on?
Mamere: Strange... it seems like something's blocking the way...
Paimon: Ohh, what do we do...
Traveler: We could use Seymour to break the wall down...
Seymour: #I apologize, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.}{NICKNAME}, but that is impossible. The thickness of the rock wall exceeds my output limits. I would run out of energy before a tunnel could be successfully bored.
Mamere: S—Swim... from over there... Father's... blood... is already...
Paimon: Blood? Mamere, are you okay? What blood?
Mamere: #We cannot... delay any further. Please, {NICKNAME}... Seymour... Let's swim from over there...
Traveler: The currents over there...
Mamere: That's right. Swim... Over there... Because Father's blood... is already...
Paimon: Blood? Mamere, are you okay? What blood?
Mamere: We cannot... delay any further. Let's swim from over there...

## Talk 5

Glaisti: Thank you, tall person. Thank you, good-hearted Specter!
Paimon: #Hang on a sec, who're you calling a Specter? Paimon's Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}... Anyway, what was all that just now? Why are you two in a place like this?
Puca: I don't know what happened earlier either. The ground suddenly started to shake, and those scary, scary monsters started to show up... *sob*
Glaisti: Puca and I were here to pick up those beautiful stones. We've been here many times, and this never happened, nor have we ever seen those frightening creatures...
Glaisti: So... I've been wanting to ask this, but why is Mamere here?
Mamere: ...
Traveler: Mamere brought us here.
Glaisti: Huh? But how did you know we were here?
Mamere: #...Father told me. He told me that you were in danger, and that I should ask {NICKNAME} and Paimon to come and save you...
Puca: Father...?
Glaisti: Ah, I see, so it was Father who asked you to come and save us... Thank you, Mamere!
Paimon: (Eh? So you know who Father is, Glaisti?)
Glaisti: (Um, no?)
Paimon: (?)
Glaisti: (Still, Mamere always talks to herself about how she is able to speak to "Father." I've always supposed that that's her imaginary friend — she's largely alone otherwise...)
Puca: I don't know what's going on, but thank you all the same...
Mamere: Don't thank me, I didn't do anything... Father's the one who told me what to do...
Seymour: My apologies for interrupting, Ms. Mamere, Ms. Puca. Considering our surroundings, I suggest that we leave this place post-haste to avoid further attacks.
Puca: Agh! Another dog appeared...!
Glaisti: Calm down, Puca! This is the robotic dog Mamere picked up before, right?
Glaisti: Hmm... It couldn't move before, though, could it?
Seymour: A keen observation, Ms. Glaisti.
Seymour: Regardless, my logic circuits recommend that we not tarry. Please allow me to escort you to a safe location. The contamination index here has exceeded the threshold of human tolerance.
Paimon: Contamination index?
Traveler: (Could that be related to the hallucinations I saw earlier...?)
Puca: A... safe place? So do we just need to go back home?
Paimon: Yup! Paimon doesn't know what Seymour means by this "contamination index" stuff, but we might get attacked again if we stay here, so let's get you all home safe first!
Glaisti: Got it. Thank you, Ms. Paimon! You've got a good heart!
Paimon: Hehe, alright, let's go!

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: The prismatic resonance shatters the ore, and a Melusine unexpectedly falls out...
You rush over to help her up, and fortunately, she doesn't appear to be injured...
Virda: Huh? Mamere? What are you doing here? And you are...
Paimon: #Paimon's Paimon, and {M#he}{F#she}'s {NICKNAME}. Mamere brought us here.
Virda: Ah, is that so? Thank you all! My name is Virda, but just call me Vi. I'm an apprentice agent of the Marechaussee Phantom!
Virda: Still, um, I didn't think I would get into this mess. How embarrassing...
Paimon: An apprentice agent? Ooh, so you're with the authorities in Fontaine!
Virda: Uh, no, no, it's a self-proclaimed title at the moment. One day, though, I'll be a proper agent, just like Sedile!
Paimon: Wait, so you can give yourself that title?
Paimon: Anyway, what happened just now? Why did you end up hiding inside a rock?
Virda: Eh? Did I do something like that? I don't remember.
Virda: I just remember falling down while fleeing, but nothing else after that...
Mamere: That... was Father protecting you.
Virda: Father?
Paimon: #Ah, never mind that for now — even {NICKNAME} and Paimon don't know what that's about...
Paimon: More importantly, are there any other Melusines trapped here?
Virda: Hmm, I didn't see anyone else. I was doing special training alone here, after all...
Virda: But I did catch sight of some humans I've never seen before... Might've been four of them?
Mamere: Humans you've never seen before? What?
Paimon: Wait just a sec. Did you come across some purple guy and three people in red scarves?
Virda: That's right! Are they your friends?
Paimon: Uh, how should we explain this...
Black Screen Text: You tell Virda about what happened before...
Virda: Huh!? So that actually happened?
Virda: Now that I think about it, they *were* behaving very suspiciously! *sigh* I guess I still have a lot to learn. Were Sedile in my shoes...
Traveler: Did you see which way they went?
Virda: Yes! They were heading that way!
Paimon: #Alright then. Let's go after them, {NICKNAME}!
Kaykaus: S—Sis! Why are these things still chasing us!?
Irus: Do I look like I know, you numbskull? It's just bad luck— Agh, c'mon, are they seriously still coming!?
Virda: Ah! It's those suspicious people! Stop! Don't run!
Paimon: Be careful! Those things behind them are...
Irus: Ugh, you're—! P—Please help! We'll pay you, I swear!
Paimon: #Uh oh, all those monsters are coming this way! Careful, {NICKNAME}!
Seymour: Excess hostile reactions detected. Switching to purification mode. For your own safety, Ms. Mamere, please keep a certain distance.

## Talk 7

Irus: Saved at last... Whoa, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Virda: Arresting the masterminds behind the summoning of these creatures — what else?
Kaykaus: W—Wait, we didn't do anything! We were just being chased by those monsters, honest!
Paimon: What's going on? Tell us everything! Also, what about that purple guy... Where's Jakob?
Virda: That's right, confess!
Irus: *sigh* Whatever. Now that it's come to this, we might as well come clean. Just our luck, seriously... We should never have taken this job...
Irus: That madman got us to bring him those red stones... Y'know, those you gathered previously. He said they'd be important.
Paimon: Important for what?
Irus: For whatever the heck he was going to do with them! He didn't tell us anything else. Just "get me the ores" — by Al-Ahmar, we're mercs, not miners!
Irus: And we did it for him, alright — for half a day we worked! And at the end of it, he didn't even pay us when we gave him his damned ores. He even started saying some... weird stuff!
Irus: We hadn't even caught what he said before he took the fragments and left, dropping us like a sack of potatoes with a "useless," and a "I guess old ways are the best" — and no pay either!
Irus: I was going to get even with that scoundrel, but he did some hand-sign and blabbered out... something in a language I didn't know. That's when those monsters appeared, and they chased us all the way here. Why, that scumbag...
Traveler: Did he summon the monsters at the other locations?
Irus: What? What other locations are you talking about?
Mamere: The same monsters appeared in areas around the village, and they're attacking Melusines wherever they find them!
Irus: Wait... Did something like that happen? I didn't know, I swear! After leaving your place, that Jakob guy led us to the intersection up ahead. We didn't really delay...
Paimon: So basically, he never told you anything except that you should go steal the paintings?
Irus: Ugh, don't even bring it up... Never mind "telling" us anything — that charlatan didn't even "pay" us our deposit!
Paimon: Why'd you work so hard for someone who doesn't even pay a deposit!?
Mamere: Is it because... you thought he was handsome?
Kaykaus: Oh, so you like purple, do you, Boss?
Irus: What in the world are you talking about, you idiot? Of course not! How's that guy handsome, anyway — also, what kind of reason is "I like purple"!?
Irus: Hmph! Well, he sure looked like he was in the Mora! I hoped that a little extra enthusiasm might get him to part with more of it, so I decided to waive his deposit...
Paimon: And that's what you call a self-inflicted wound...
Paimon: Ugh. Looks like we won't be able to get anything useful from these guys. How should we deal with them now...
Virda: Hehe, don't worry, leave it to me. I'm not an official agent yet, but I can escort them back to the village and hand them over to Sedile, no problem!
Irus: W—W—Wait just a moment! Aren't we victims too?
Mamere: You...! You ransacked my house, hurt Seymour... and still, you claim to be victims...
Virda: Hmph, that's right, that's— wait, whose house did they ransack?
Paimon: Stop! That's not the main point!
Virda: Exactly! To think that you'd even do something like that! Hmph, you're incorrigible! Come with me, now, and don't you dare resist!
Irus: W—Wait! You're going after that guy, aren't you? We know where he's gone!
Irus: Listen, he's headed towards the place where the giant rock is hanging. Y'know, over that way... If you give chase now, you could still catch him!
Paimon: The place with a giant stone? Wait, you mean...
Mamere: It's a warm place that makes people at ease...
Traveler: Why would you tell us this?
Irus: Hey, even mercenaries know how to be picky about our employers! That self-serving, monster-summoning fraudster is no employer of mine, no matter how much he's offering!
Irus: Not that he even paid us the deposit in the first place, I mean!
Paimon: Aaaaah! Everything's shaking again!
Kaykubad: Hey, Sis, do you think this earthquake could be...
Irus: Crap. If more of those monsters show up... H—Hey, shorty, you wanted to arrest us, right? Quick, do it now! We surrender — unconditionally!
Virda: Huh, that's more like it! Go reform yourselves at the Fortress of Meropide and learn to be useful to society!
Paimon: Well... Guess we'll leave them to you. We'll get to the bottom of these quakes.
Virda: Hmph. Alright, mercs, don't get any funny ideas, or the Maison Gardiennage are gonna show you what for!
Black Screen Text: After disarming the mercenaries and tying their hands, Virda escorts them away.
Paimon: #So, uh, what are we supposed to do now, {NICKNAME}?
Mamere: ...Ugh!
Paimon: Mamere? What's wrong? You don't look good at all...
Mamere: No, it's not that... it's... Father...
Mamere: It hurts... No... Why are you doing that...
Traveler: ...I heard it too.
Paimon: #And you look just as horrible, {NICKNAME}! You heard something? What did you hear?
Traveler: I'm fine, but...
Traveler: We must hurry.
Mamere: That's right... There's no time...
Paimon: Even if you say that... Shouldn't you rest for a bit? You look like you're hurting all over...
Mamere: Yes... It hurts... I've never... experienced anything like this before.
Mamere: But I must go... Father must be suffering far more than I am...
Mamere: #Please... {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Please... take me there. To the place where we gathered high-purity ores earlier...
Paimon: Okay. Let's go! There should be a shortcut we can take!
Traveler: We're out of time.
Paimon: So we've gotta hurry... to the place where we collected the paints previously?
Mamere: #Yes... Please, {NICKNAME}, Paimon... We have to get over there...
Traveler: Even so, we won't let you off so easy!
