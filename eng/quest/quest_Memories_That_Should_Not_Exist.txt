# Memories That Should Not Exist


## Talk 1

Paimon: Uh, Dain? Hellooo... Dain! Why are you just zoning out over here?
Dainsleif: ...
Paimon: Did something happen?
Traveler: What's wrong, Dain?
Dainsleif: The missing person from your commission... Could you describe them to me?
Paimon: Oh, uh...
Paimon: Young guy, early twenties... Seriously, Dain... What's going on?
Dainsleif: There appear to be certain memories in my mind that weren't there before...
Dainsleif: Memories... of him.
Paimon: Huh? Maybe... Maybe we just talked too much about him yesterday, and you had a weird dream or something?
Dainsleif: No. It wasn't a dream. They're memories... memories that suddenly appeared in my mind after I woke up...
Dainsleif: And I'm certain I've never met this person before.
Traveler: Well, what exactly did you "remember"?
Dainsleif: I remember...
Dainsleif: ...Handing him the eye of the first Field Tiller.
Traveler: !?
Paimon: Whaaaat!?
Paimon: ...Okay, so this missing person definitely has something to do with the Abyss Order, then...
Dainsleif: Indeed. And it appears he possesses the ability to "implant" memories into the minds of others.
Traveler: How is that even possible...
Paimon: Wait, then... All the memories the villagers have of him... Could they be fake too? Maybe they never knew him at all...
Paimon: But why would he do something like that...
Dainsleif: Whatever the Abyss Order is planning, an important truth has been revealed to us this morning...
Paimon: What sort of truth?
Dainsleif: That their goal... is still to obtain the eye of the first Field Tiller. They haven't stopped searching for it.
Dainsleif: I am the only person who knows its location. Perhaps implanting that particular memory was an attempt to interfere with my mind in some way...
Traveler: Is the eye still safe?
Dainsleif: Your concerns are not entirely unfounded. I don't believe the Abyss Order is capable of altering reality like that just yet...
Dainsleif: However, considering their single-minded pursuit of the eye, I would say an equal level of caution is in order on our part.
Dainsleif: Come with me. We must check whether the eye is still in our possession.
Paimon: Oh, so you're going to take us to where you hid it?
Traveler: (...But, what if someone follows us? If we go straight there, and someone is on our tail, aren't we just exposing the eye's location?)
Traveler: (Maybe that's the reason the Abyss Order implanted that memory in the first place... To force Dain to confirm the eye's location...)
Dainsleif: ...
Traveler: (Given what I know of him, though, I'm sure Dain has already thought of that possibility... It seems like he might already have a plan...)
Traveler: Let's go.
Dainsleif: ...Of course.
Traveler: Lead the way, Dain.
Traveler: What if that "memory" is real?

## Talk 2

Paimon: So you hid it way out here! Not an easy place to discover, that's for sure.
Paimon: Well, let's go check to see if it's safe!
Dainsleif: #{NICKNAME}, wait...
Traveler: Hm?
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: ...We've no time to lose. Let's head inside.
Traveler: (What was Dain going to tell me just now...)
Paimon: Hey, wait up!

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: You return to Vimara Village to gather intel based on what you've learned. You question the villagers until, eventually, the sky grows dark...
Dainsleif: Ah, so that was the commission that brought you here to Vimara Village...
Dainsleif: "Someone who seems to only exist in people's memories"... That is indeed quite intriguing. I would agree that it's unlikely you have a simple missing person's case on your hands. However, any possible connection to the Abyss Order is still unclear.
Dainsleif: It appears all we have by way of clues is increased Hilichurl activity, and that is certainly not much to go off of.
Traveler: Well, then...
Paimon: #Right! That mysterious voice {F#she}{M#he} heard in {F#her brother's}{M#his sister's} memory... The one who called himself a Sinner... Who is he?
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: #{NICKNAME}, let me ask you this... Do you believe your sibling to have betrayed you?
Traveler: #I want to have faith in {M#her}{F#him}.
Dainsleif: Hmm... I sense hesitation in your words. After all, you still haven't figured out the whole truth of what happened.
Dainsleif: There's still hope for the two of you to reconcile. Irreparable damage has not yet been done.
Dainsleif: The Sinner you wish to know about... His situation is different. He and his fellow sinners have long betrayed me, and long betrayed their nation.
Dainsleif: His name is Vedrfolnir, "The Visionary."
Dainsleif: I'm loath to admit it, but... He is also my kin. My older brother.
Paimon: Your... brother?
Traveler: What happened between the two of you?
Dainsleif: There were five of them... The Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah.
Dainsleif: "The Wise" Hroptatyr, "The Visionary" Vedrfolnir, "Gold" Rhinedottir, "The Foul" Surtalogi, and "RÃ¤cher of Solnari" Rerir.
Dainsleif: No matter how eroded my memory may become, I will never forget their names... One day... I shall have my vengeance.
Paimon: Wait! Some of those names sound really familiar... Rhinedottir is the one who created Albedo, Surtalogi is Skirk's master...
Paimon: And the one we just learned about... Dain's brother, Vedrfolnir... If he was the voice of the Sinner, then the one who inspired Chlothar to create the Abyss Order... was him!
Traveler: Somehow, everything is connected...
Traveler: (If that's true, then the stone slates we found in that ruin in Fontaine... The ones that outlined Fontaine's prophecy... That was likely Vedrfolnir's doing as well.)
Dainsleif: They were once people of great esteem in Khaenri'ah, those who carried the hopes of the nation. They were the best of their peers, outstanding in their respective fields...
Dainsleif: The six of us, together... We should have been the ones to prevent the disaster, the ones to stop the Vinster King from continuing to rock the foundation of the world.
Dainsleif: Yet, deep within, the five of them craved something more. They could not resist the call of the Abyss, and divided among themselves a power that could destroy the world.
Dainsleif: So they became Sinners, but also transcendent beings, each in possession of world-shattering power.
Dainsleif: And when the cataclysm occurred, not one of them stood up in defense of their nation, not one came forward to prevent the tragedy... And for that, they shall never have my forgiveness.
Traveler: And then...
Dainsleif: ...Indeed. If they are not stopped, the day is sure to come when they will also betray the entire world.
Traveler: It must be hard to talk about all of this.
Dainsleif: Of course. As I said, I never intended to hide anything from you.
Paimon: So, Dain, what have you been looking into all this time?
Dainsleif: I've continued to investigate the questions surrounding the Loom of Fate. It's been quite some time since the initial operation was launched.
Dainsleif: By retrieving the eye of the first Field Tiller, we were able to stop part of their plan from coming to fruition...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers! Weren't they gonna use it to corrupt Osial and make a god or something...
Dainsleif: Indeed... However, it's obvious that was just some kind of technical experiment...
Dainsleif: The eye was integral to their plan, yet somehow, despite failing to obtain it, they've skipped the experimental phase and found some other way to keep moving forward.
Dainsleif: There are many signs pointing to that effect...
Paimon: Then, what should we do? It's not too late, is it?
Dainsleif: Our most pressing concern... is to determine the purpose of the Loom of Fate. From there, we'll be able to deduce the Abyss Order's true objective.
Dainsleif: Based on the intel I've gathered so far, I suspect the Loom of Fate is related to the Ley Lines in some way.
Paimon: The Ley Lines?
Dainsleif: #{NICKNAME}, you were able to observe your sibling's memories last time, yes? I believe that was due to the fact that the Ley Lines in that area were unstable.
Dainsleif: My recent investigation has shown that Abyss Order activity in a particular area is usually followed by a series of issues with the Ley Lines.
Traveler: And one of the things that flows through the Ley Lines... are memories.
Paimon: Wait, then our commission here in Vimara Village... The person who seems to exist only in people's memories... Could it be connected?
Traveler: (Memories... Ley Lines... The Loom of Fate... The missing person that doesn't seem to exist...)
Traveler: (What's the connection between all this?)
Dainsleif: It's certainly possible. I'll join your investigation tomorrow. This missing person's case could very well turn out to be the key to unraveling these mysteries.
Paimon: Well, if we're teaming up with Dain again, we're gonna need all the energy we can get! Let's try investigating somewhere a little further away tomorrow.
Paimon: *yawn*... So tired... Paimon used way too much brain juice yesterday. It's all Dain's fault, saying all that complicated stuff...
Traveler: I didn't sleep well, either...
Paimon: Well, let's go find Dain. We've got a lot to do today.
Traveler: My head's a mess.
Traveler: But thank you for telling me.
Traveler: My sibling came into contact with your brother.
Traveler: What really happened in Khaenri'ah back then?
Traveler: In a manner of speaking, yeah.
Traveler: How about the intel you promised me?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wait a second... That person, it's... Dainsleif!
Dainsleif: Ah, it's you two...
Atossa: Oh, a friend of yours?
Atossa: Well, I'll leave you all to it, then. I should head back to the village to check up on Chief Amadhiah and the others, anyway. See you later!
Paimon: Yep! See you later, Atossa!
Paimon: Why do you always have to pop up out of nowhere like that!? Is it your life's mission in life to jumpscare us or something?
Dainsleif: It's hardly personal... or intentional, for that matter. As long as you and I are both in pursuit of the Abyss Order, we're bound to cross paths.
Paimon: Ah, so you're here to investigate the Abyss Order, then! That would explain the monsters you were fighting just now...
Dainsleif: Naturally. Hold on... Are you not here for the same purpose?
Traveler: We're also on their tail...
Dainsleif: Hm, no matter. It may have taken you a while to catch on, but I'm sure you've also realized by now... That there's something strange about this place.
Dainsleif: The Abyss Order is most certainly planning something in this area... or worse, their plan could already be in motion.
Paimon: So you think the Abyss Order is behind the Hilichurl activity in the area?
Dainsleif: As things stand, I highly doubt that is their primary motive. I would imagine the increased Hilichurl activity is merely a byproduct of whatever it is they're really trying to accomplish.
Paimon: Still, the Hilichurl activity is causing a lot of problems for the people here. We should stick around for a while and protect the village, don't you think?
Dainsleif: The best way to protect them is by figuring out what the Abyss Order is truly planning. That is how we prevent further tragedy.
Traveler: Well, let's see what more we can learn from the villagers.
Dainsleif: And you shall have them. I never intended to hide anything from you.
Dainsleif: Don't worry... There should be ample time to talk.
Traveler: And after that... You also owe us many answers.
Traveler: But, I'll admit, we ran into them on accident.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Looks like we can't go any further...
Dainsleif: Be on your guard. I sense the presence of the Abyss!
Paimon: It's the Abyss Order! They're here!

## Talk 6

Dainsleif: Just as I suspected... The false memories were a trap. The Abyss Order just wanted to follow us here...
Dainsleif: Now that they're in the vicinity, we should have a chance to see...
Dainsleif: Argh...!
Paimon: Dain? What's wrong?
Dainsleif: Can you feel that? There's been a disturbance in the Ley Lines. It must be the work of the Abyss...
Paimon: Wow, you must be really sensitive to that sort of thing. Paimon doesn't feel it...
Dainsleif: You two, do as I say... Use that mechanism over there and leave this place.
Traveler: Leave you here on your own? Will you be alright?
Dainsleif: The Abyss Order is putting something in motion. If you return to Vimara Village, I suspect you might finally have the opportunity to locate the missing villager.
Dainsleif: ...Just think of it as a way to divide and conquer.
Traveler: Alright.
Traveler: (Dain does have a point...)
Traveler: (But, something still feels off... What am I missing...?)
Dainsleif: Hmph... I knew going along with your trap would be the only way to meet with you face to face.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): You risked your safety and that of the eye...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): That's quite the gamble, Dainsleif... But I believe that I am the one walking into a trap laid by the Twilight Sword.
Dainsleif: So you came here all on your own? What about those followers of yours?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): When the Twilight Sword is prepared for battle, any army I could send would only be marching to their doom... Better that I face you alone.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): I know you must have a lot to say...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): ...But, if it's a conversation you want, you'll have to defeat me first.
