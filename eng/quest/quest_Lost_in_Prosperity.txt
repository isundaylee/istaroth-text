# Lost in Prosperity


## Talk 1

Paimon: This is the place we heard those students talking about.
Paimon: Let's find a seat somewhere and see if we can spot the group they mentioned.

## Talk 2

Paimon: He went that way. After him!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Looking at what Alhaitham wrote, Dori's informant is a trader near Old Ormos.
Paimon: Let's follow these instructions and try to get in contact with him.

## Talk 4

Raunak: You two have a fascinating fashion sense. We haven't seen a customer wearing a Sumeru Rose for quite some time.
Paimon: Hold on, lemme think... "Sumeru Rose" means... common merch.
Paimon: No, look again. We're obviously wearing Mourning Flowers.
Raunak: Ah, my mistake. I do apologize.
Paimon: Phew... That pop quiz sure was scary!
Raunak: The warehouse is up ahead. Please follow me.

## Talk 5

Tariq: Huh, who are you? What do you want?
Traveler: I'm a traveler.
Tariq: A traveler?
Paimon: Uh, now's probably not the time to talk about that. Didn't the students say Eremites are wary of outsiders?
Traveler: I'm a student from the Akademiya.
Tariq: A student? Heh, what's a student from Sumeru City doing in Port Ormos?
Traveler: I'm looking for info about a certain... "something."
Tariq: Ahh, well if it's info you want, you've come to the right place. The question is: Can you afford it?
Traveler: Hand him 50 Mora.
Tariq: Huh? What is this, some kind of joke?
Paimon: #Oh, sorry! {M#He}{F#She} must have grabbed the wrong amount... Hey, what do you think you're doing!?
Traveler: Hand him 500,000 Mora.
Paimon: (Ooh, Paimon can't stand to see so much Mora go, but there's no other choice right now...)
Tariq: Heh heh. Here, this is the merchant's address — whatever you're looking for, you'll find it there. ...Hmm? Well, what are you waiting for?
Traveler: I just have... one more question.
Paimon: Oh, that's right. We heard you mention King Deshret just now. We're actually interested to know more, because... Uh, because we're... ah... archaeology students! Hehe.
Tariq: ...Heh, fine. Since you've already handed over the Mora, I guess I can throw in a little extra info.
Tariq: As you can see, members of Ayn Al-Ahmar are devout believers of King Deshret.
Tariq: Years ago, King Deshret founded the great desert nation that was our homeland. It was an advanced civilization, far beyond anything you'll see in present-day Sumeru.
Tariq: King Deshret was the rightful God of Wisdom, but he was betrayed by a companion he trusted... She even stripped him of his title, "God of Wisdom."
Paimon: So you mean the traitor was...
Tariq: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, yes! That shameless wretch destroyed King Deshret's civilization, and our ancestors were forced to flee to this land where we were made to suffer the tyranny of our enemies.
Tariq: Furthermore, she conspired with the Akademiya to cover up the truth of her actions and create the merciful and benevolent facade for which she is now known. Ugh, just thinking about it sickens me.
Tariq: But the story doesn't end there, oh no. King Deshret isn't truly dead. The voice of the Oracle has been heard in the desert, prophesying his resurrection!
Tariq: Mark my words, our god shall return. And when that day comes, all followers of the traitor and all the desert dwellers who have forgotten their true god will suffer retribution together.
Tariq: If what I'm saying makes you shiver with fear, it might not be too late for you to become a believer of King Deshret, hahaha.
Traveler: King Deshret is returning?
Tariq: Hmph, I don't have anything to say to you Akademiya people about that. I think this conversation has reached its end.
Alhaitham: Not just yet. This man is a fraud.
Paimon: Huh!?
Tariq: Ugh, you again! Tch... Deranged Akademiya lunatic!
Alhaitham: Yes, it's me again. I already warned you that if you weren't willing to sit and discuss things with me, I'd take measures to make things... uncomfortable for you.
Alhaitham: Listen to me. That address he gave you is fake — or at least, you won't find a merchant waiting for you there. This group has been boasting all around that they can provide information on a certain "item," as a means of luring people into their territory.
Alhaitham: Once you show up, they keep up the act until they have hard evidence that you want to purchase said item, then they use that to squeeze you for all the Mora you're worth.
Tariq: Hey! Shut it, Alhaitham! What are you playing at, trying to ruin our business like this, hmm?
Alhaitham: I told you the other day: I wish to discuss my terms with your boss.
Tariq: Hah! The boss made it perfectly clear that he won't negotiate with you!
Alhaitham: Yes, and in no uncertain terms. But that was then. It does not preclude him from changing his mind in the future.
Tariq: I'm warning you, don't push us, or this could get ugly! We don't usually get rough with people from the Akademiya because it just complicates things. For a lunatic like you, though, we might just have to make an exception.
Alhaitham: If you're suggesting that we escalate this from a verbal exchange to a physical one, I accept. After all, even the archons used war to negotiate the ownership of Teyvat.
Alhaitham: If, on the other hand, we can't agree on any means of negotiation at all, then I'm afraid my next course of action will sting a little more than the mere falling-through of a few business deals.
Alhaitham: I will jeopardize the Eremites' reputation, which I know you value above all else.
Alhaitham: I am quite confident that if I began to take such action, your boss would willingly approach me himself. However, I fear that by then, some things will have happened that cannot be undone.
Alhaitham: Also, a word of advice... I suggest you tell your boss exactly what happened here today. Otherwise, he might blame you for not telling him in the future.
Tariq: Wh—What did you say?
Alhaitham: Consider this: Have I ever failed to follow through on my word in the past?
Tumart: This guy is really out of his mind...
Tariq: Okay then, if you really have a death wish, let's meet a week from today... The pier in front of the Pharos Lighthouse, four o'clock in the afternoon, sharp. Don't expect us to hold back!
Alhaitham: Not so fast. First, you return the 500,000 Mora to them.
Tariq: Hmph.
Eymen: Please, I beg you, don't provoke them. We can't afford any trouble with this crowd... They haven't even paid for their food yet...
Alhaitham: Ah, Mr. Eymen. There appears to be fewer staff in the restaurant recently. This wouldn't happen to be because they're all busy spreading the word to the students, would it?
Eymen: I, uh... W—Well...
Alhaitham: Someone who chooses to do business with a group like that really can't afford to get so flustered the instant someone confronts them about it. Consider the meal compensation for our silence — I'd say you're getting an excellent deal.
Paimon: Whoa, did you see that? He not only got us our Mora back, but sent the Eremites running, too...
Paimon: Plus, he seems to know a lot about what's going on around here. Let's catch up with him and ask some questions!
Traveler: Can you tell us more about the Oracle?

## Talk 6

Paimon: We don't know this area, so let's follow that informant!

## Talk 7

Dori: Hey! If you're hiding from the Rishboland Tiger, come this way!
Paimon: Another password! Oh, that voice came from behind the building on the right!

## Talk 8

Latish: Hello, what are you two looking to buy?
Traveler: We want to buy some raw Harra Fruits.
Paimon: Wait, are you sure you're remembering that right? Paimon doesn't think it was that on the paper.
Traveler: We want to buy some unripe Harra Fruits.
Latish: Heh, what a unique palate. We have unripe Harra Fruits, but we usually keep them in the back. I'll have someone escort you.
Paimon: Following the paper got us past the first round!
Latish: Raunak, these two want to buy unripe Harra Fruits. Show them to the warehouse.
Raunak: Got it. You two, please follow me.

## Talk 9

Raunak: Before I retrieve your products, I need to confirm a few things.
Raunak: Please forgive me, but we may not have sufficient stock for you today. Earlier, many of our Harra Fruits were taken by mice.
Traveler: I'm sorry to hear that...
Paimon: Hold on, that's not right. "Taken by mice" means they sold out.
Traveler: Congratulations to you.
Raunak: Heh, thanks. If better goods come in, you'll be the first to know.
Raunak: You look like you have some skill. Why don't I pick out some fruits that'll make you dizzy?
Traveler: Dizziness with a side of tinnitus, please.
Paimon: Yep, that's the right answer! ...But eating Harra Fruit that makes your head and ears ring sounds like a bad life decision...
Raunak: Would you like your Harra Fruits to be packaged in the Sumeru City or Port Ormos style?
Traveler: Sumeru City style.
Raunak: I'm guessing that you're going for a more traditional packaging since this is your first time here.
Paimon: Wait a sec, "Sumeru City style" means we're only buying a few things. He won't take us to see Dori if we do that!
Traveler: Port Ormos style.
Raunak: Wow, you two sure are generous customers. We'll be sure to package your products beautifully.
Traveler: I'd prefer something that causes heatstroke.
Paimon: No, that's not it. The paper said that "heatstroke" is the answer to "erudition." Ugh... Eating something that causes heatstroke sounds horrifying...

## Talk 10

Raunak: I'm sorry, but as things currently stand, we won't be able to fulfill your order. Why don't you two think things over?
Paimon: He's cautious of us. Let's take a closer look at the paper that Alhaitham gave us.

## Talk 11

Raunak: Okay, everything has been confirmed. Miss Dori is waiting for you up a— Shoot, it's the matra! Run!
Paimon: What, the matra!? Where? Alhaitham said we're done for if they catch us — we gotta get outta here!

## Talk 12

Dori: Here, over here! You can stop running now.
Paimon: So you were the one who was calling out to us just now. But uh, are we definitely gonna be safe here?
Raunak: These two good customers wish to buy some Harra Fruit, Miss Dori, and if there's nothing else, I'll just excuse myself.
Dori: Oh, very good. Thank you!
Paimon: Huh, wait... You're Dori? Paimon sure thought you'd look a whole lot scarier...
Dori: Hey, whaddya trying to say, Princess Peabrain!? I can be scary enough when I need to be, believe you me! If you don't watch what you say, then you can forget about doing any business.
Dori: But it seems you two have actually done pretty well so far... Not only did you manage to find the informant, your reactions were also pretty sharp. You don't really look like criminals or anything, but I bet my Mora that you've been involved in some shady dealings, haven't you?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's not sure if that's supposed to be a compliment, but we'll take it.
Dori: I can't risk doing business with people who start huffing and puffing after just a few paces — no matter how much Mora they might have. Not only will they get caught by the matra, but they'll also get us into trouble. As decent folks trying to run an honest business, we don't need any of that. Wouldn't you agree?
Dori: So that's why I prefer to have customers like you.
Dori: It's your first time here, but don't worry, I won't ask too many questions. Even if you wish to buy enough Knowledge Capsules to decorate your house with, please — knock yourself out!
Dori: As long as you have lots of round, shiny Mora, then we're all good.
Traveler: Can you show us your products?
Dori: Ah yes, of course, of course! Go ahead, help yourselves — voila!
Paimon: (Wow, she has a trove of Canned Knowledge! Whew... she'd probably be in serious trouble if the matra caught her with all this.)
Dori: What kind of products do you seek, my dear customers? Don't worry, I'm not interested in your reasons for buying — I can, however, offer some suggestions.
Dori: Take this one, for example... "An Analysis of the Sociological Ideology and Dialectics of the Hilichurls." Only three people in all of Teyvat have ever studied it, making it extremely rare! It's on sale now for 350,000 Mora!
Paimon: (Yeesh... Who would wanna be an expert in that topic?)
Dori: Or how about "The Architectural Styles and Construction Methods of Teyvat in the Early Archon War Period"?
Dori: With this one, you can become an expert in historic architecture preservation and find an excellent, well-paying job in nearly any nation!
Paimon: (Now this sounds like it could be useful...)
Dori: Two million Mora and it's yours. No discounts.
Paimon: Whoa! That's a lot of Mora!
Dori: Of course, you are free to pick whatever your hearts desire. The contents and price of each Knowledge Capsule are indicated in small text on the body of each one, down at the bottom.
Paimon: (All right, let's try the method that Alhaitham mentioned.)
Traveler: I'll take this one.
Traveler: And this one.
Traveler: As well as this one.
Dori: Ahhh... You've really got a good head on your shoulders... and quite the eye for quality.
Black Screen Text: You pick and choose a variety of Canned Knowledge...
Paimon: We'll take these, please and thank you!
Dori: My, oh my, you are blessed with a taste for both the exquisite and the extravagant... Customers like you are a rare breed — one in a hundred... No, one in a thousand, even!
Dori: Listen, I have a special offer for you two. If you spend just 100,000 Mora more, you can pick any Knowledge Capsule of your choice up to a value of one million Mora!
Paimon: Say what now?
Paimon: Hey, did you hear that!? Spend another 100k and we get a capsule worth a whole million!
Traveler: Calm down, Paimon.
Paimon: But all the Canned Knowledge we just bought is easily worth half a million Mora. If we spend just a little more, we can get something worth one million Mora. Isn't that a fantastic deal?
Paimon: Think about it, we've gone to all this trouble to get this Canned Knowledge, and so far everything we've bought belongs to Alhaitham.
Paimon: Aren't you even the least bit curious about how this whole Canned Knowledge thing works? We're talking instant knowledge here! Don't you wanna try it yourself?
Traveler: I think you're the one who's curious.
Paimon: C'mon, c'mon! We still have around 100,000 of Alhaitham's Mora left, so let's put it to good use by finding something useful for you. You've got a deal, Dori! We'd like to spend an extra 100,000 Mora.
Dori: Excellent, then please select from this fine collection of Canned Knowledge over here.
Paimon: Uh, hold on a second. Paimon thought we could choose whatever we wanted? Why can't we choose the ones from over there?
Dori: Oh, but my dear customer, the Knowledge Capsules over here are worth one million Mora each. I'm sure discerning customers like yourselves will be able to find something to your liking. Please, take your time.
Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon has a bad feeling about this... Let's use Elemental Sight again to check these.
Traveler: Alright, I'll have a look.
Paimon: So, what did you see?
Traveler: They all seem to be equally bright.
Paimon: So they're all worth about the same amount?
Paimon: Well, anyway, the Mora's already been spent, so let's at least try to find something useful.
Paimon: Let Paimon take a look here... "An Introduction to Traditional Sumeru Brewing Techniques," "The Art of Growing Spices," "An Overview of Ancient Runes"... Oh! How about this one? "Swordfighting Techniques VIII"!
Paimon: Not sure where we'd ever find volumes one through seven, but at least this knowledge should be useful, right? Let's go with this one!
Traveler: Fine by me.
Paimon: Dori, we'll take this one!
Dori: Alright, very good! I'm expecting some new goods in the next couple of days, so be sure to check back again soon! Whether it's Canned Knowledge or anything else you need — bring your Mora to Dori, and doors will open!
Traveler: Whatever makes Paimon happy.
Traveler: Maybe we should just pass this time...
Paimon: Huh? Why?
Traveler: Let's just say for our mental health.
Paimon: Hey, we're getting a capsule worth a million Mora here. Don't be such a party pooper!
Traveler: You just want to see me try it.
Traveler: Don't let her trick you into spending more.

## Talk 13

Paimon: He ran that way!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Look, he's over there!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Eymen: Please, just leave. Forget the cost of the meal... Just uh, pretend nothing happened today.

### Additional Talk 2

Sidhu: Half a million... That's a lot of Mora.
Bandi: Do you really think that Ayn Al-Ahmar group can give us reliable info about what we're after?
Kudari: We should discuss things thoroughly before we make any moves.

### Additional Talk 3

Dehya: It's been a while since I've visited the Citadel of Regzar. I'll catch up with Chief for a bit before I head back myself. He really did a lot for me in the past.
Dehya: Remember, to get to Port Ormos, just follow the river south from Sumeru City's port.
Dehya: Just be sure to take care of yourselves out there. We'll meet again at the Sabzeruz Festival.

### Additional Talk 4

Asfand: Hah, you two must really be something if you've got Dehya the Flame-Mane speaking on your behalf.
Asfand: The Corps of Thirty isn't officially overseen by the Akademiya, but because we're hired mercs, there's still lots of sensitive intel that I can't reveal to ya. In the end, when it comes down to it, the city's safety is both the Corps' and Akademiya's top priority.
Asfand: I've told you all I can about what was stolen from the Akademiya... As for why you should pretend to be students in Port Ormos, I'll leave that for you to find out yourself.

### Additional Talk 5

Latish: (Latish smiled and winked at you to keep up with Raunak.)
