Colorful staple food. Maintains perfect balance between soft and fragrant rice and all kinds of carefully selected sweet ingredients. This dish is mainly known for its meaning as a symbol of prosperity and peace, and less so for its taste. However, with such noble ideals behind it, its flavor should not disappoint.
