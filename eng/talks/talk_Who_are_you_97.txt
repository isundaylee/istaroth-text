Traveler: Who are you?
Sumi: I used to work at Tatarasuna. Yuuzou rescued me from the ruins after the disaster â€” straight up saved my life.
Sumi: I have no obligations to Sangonomiya and can leave here at any time. But I've been through life-and-death situations with everyone here... I won't be separated from them again.
