Traveler: About Yoimiya
Paimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?
Paimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...
Paimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?
Paimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!
Traveler: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?
Paimon: Uh... Um...
Paimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...
Traveler: Then you'd need to leave me.
Paimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!
Paimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...
Traveler: Actually...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!
Traveler: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind.
Paimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?
Paimon: How could you! You bully!
Traveler: But I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.
Traveler: She can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.
