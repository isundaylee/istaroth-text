Traveler: What are you doing?
Yamada: I'm here to get a fortune slip to see what the future holds for my business...
Yamada: Originally, I thought that I'd now be able to leave the country and make a big profit doing business, but all the slips I've drawn have "Misfortune" on them...
Yamada: Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
Yamada: No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will obtain a positive sign before I leave!
