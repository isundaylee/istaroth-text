## Talk

Livre: Hello, welcome to Leschots's clockwork workshop. Are you here to make a purchase? We have all sorts of interesting toys here!

## Talk

Traveler: Clockwork goods?
Livre: Indeed. We specialize in machines that function via those principles.
Livre: Toy birds, puppets, we have it all.
Livre: Each of them is a high-quality, fresh design. Well... though the puppet's dialogue might get bothersome after a while.
Livre: If you're interested, we also have clockwork horses that run, clockwork Blubberbeasts that blow trumpets, and penguins that can waddle and shake in place.

## Talk

Traveler: You've got penguins here in Fontaine?
Livre: Uh... Sorry, I wasn't being very precise.
Livre: Usually, penguins live in the cold north, but I've also heard that some of them will appear in places with a warmer climate.
Livre: The penguins in our store weren't made by me — they're consignments made by a young lad named Freminet.
Livre: He's very good, if I do say so myself — reminds me of my younger brother, in fact.
Livre: I once thought of inviting him to develop clockwork toys, but he remained silent, and I didn't really want to force the issue.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Livre: Stop by for some fun if you've got the time.

## Talk

Traveler: Clockwork penguins?
Livre: A kid named Freminet left this on consignment with us. It's pretty good work — if he didn't look like he had his own pursuits, I'd have hired him to develop toys on the spot.
