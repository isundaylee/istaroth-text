# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Eula: Didn't think you were the type to get bored... Sure, speak.
Traveler: Anything happen recently that makes you want to seek vengeance?
Eula: Hmm... Let me think.
Eula: Not long ago, I took on an assignment to clear out some nearby Treasure Hoarders.
Eula: On my way back, I rescued a Springvale hunter who was being attacked by a monster.
Eula: ...I didn't expect him to send meat and wine the next day.
Eula: Daring to send things despite knowing that I'm the heir to the sinners of Mondstadt... I'll remember this insult.
Traveler: An insult worth remembering.
Eula: Not just that.
Eula: The meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
Traveler: This deserves some more vengeance.
Eula: Haha, we're of the same mind.
Eula: ...
Eula: Just this simple chat with you has made me feel a lot better...
Eula: Ahem... Thanks.
Traveler: You weren't injured, were you?
Eula: Ha, a small fry like that monster can't hurt me.
Eula: However, the meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
Traveler: It was that delicious? I want some too...
Eula: Hahaha, best not. If you really want... I'll make a Stormcrest Pie for you.
