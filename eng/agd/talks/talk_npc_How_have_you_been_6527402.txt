Traveler: How have you been?
Lemarcq: Hi. Recently... Well, I can't say that everything's going smoothly, just that things are calm.
Lemarcq: At least the Boss doesn't have sneaky people with their own agenda around him now. He can safely do whatever he wants.
Lemarcq: Of course, seeing that we don't have much Mora at the moment, all the things the Boss wants to do are stuck in the planning stages.
