# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's going on?
Hana: Oh, because of somebody, I don't get enough sleep.
Hana: He's forcing me to spend too much time with him every night. It would be fine if we just go to the bar, but he just makes me to listen to gibberish by the side of the road.
Hana: If I liked hearing other people read, I'd go to a lecture!
Hana: Could it be that he's insinuating I should read more!?
Hana: I didn't know that it's this tedious to date a bookworm!
