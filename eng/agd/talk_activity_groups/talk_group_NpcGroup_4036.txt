Qinglian: Maybe there could be a market for cosmetics made from gemstones back in Liyue...

Traveler: Cosmetics? Made from gemstones?
Qinglian: That's right, people in Sumeru will grind down gemstones into a powder to make cosmetics with. It's supposed to be good for skincare.
Qinglian: It seems there are researchers who specialize in studying the skincare effects of different gemstone powders on varied skin types.
Qinglian: But because the gemstones they use are so expensive and often need to be imported from Liyue, this is something quite luxurious that only the wealthy in Sumeru can enjoy.
Qinglian: It got me thinking, Liyue has an abundance of precious ores. If this practice could be brought back there, it's possible it could open up a whole new market...
