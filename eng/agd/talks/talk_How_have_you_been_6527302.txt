Traveler: How have you been?
Chaussivert: Fantastic. No one's secretly trying to get rid of me, or trying to blow up Lumidouce Harbor.
Chaussivert: And people have stopped engaging in shady practices like bribery, fraud, or backstabbing.
Chaussivert: Peace has been restored to Lumidouce Harbor. Not bad!
Chaussivert: And I played a big role in it all, too. Even better!
