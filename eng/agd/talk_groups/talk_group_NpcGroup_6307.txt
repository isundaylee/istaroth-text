"Mural Maniac": Our membership has expanded too fast. We have to think of a way to solve our expense problem as soon as we can...

## Talk

Traveler: How do you do...
"Mural Maniac": Oh, a new face.
"Mural Maniac": Welcome to the Graffiti Alliance HQ... It might just look like a normal house, but still!
"Mural Maniac": If you're looking for one or more of our members, I regret to inform you that a couple hundred of them are busy painting all over Natlan, while others are busy managing their lives.
"Mural Maniac": They only visit HQ to pay membership fees, or when seeking out technical assistance.
"Mural Maniac": Anyone from Natlan you see holding a spray can and paint bucket is probably one of ours.
"Mural Maniac": If you want to visit, feel free to do so any time.
"Mural Maniac": But you won't find any of our alliance members' exquisite masterpieces here — those are scattered all over Natlan.

## Talk

Traveler: Expenses?
"Mural Maniac": A thousand Mora to each person each year — that's what goes into training up new members of our Alliance.
"Mural Maniac": Outsiders have told us that art from other places attaches great importance to heritage.
"Mural Maniac": So my master's master's master's... master from Archon-only-knows how many generations ago, that person created this membership fee system.
"Mural Maniac": We put these dues toward buying lots of paints and spray paint tools so that we can give keen joiners free lessons...
"Mural Maniac": That spread the popularity of graffiti and got more people into it.
"Mural Maniac": However, the fees haven't changed for hundreds of years. Nowadays, it's not enough to cover our expenses.
"Mural Maniac": Perhaps I could take some orders for portraits, earn some royalties, and beef up our expenses fund...?

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then!
"Mural Maniac": You're too kind... If you need anything, come find me any time!

## Talk

Traveler: May I join the alliance, too?
"Mural Maniac": Sure. Henceforth, you're a member.
"Mural Maniac": I'll note your name down later.
"Mural Maniac": Don't look so surprised. There's no testing or ceremony for new entrants. So long as you're interested in graffiti, you can join up.
"Mural Maniac": If you need any help, you can always ask your fellow alliance members.
"Mural Maniac": Just remember to give us a shoutout to others once you're out there throwing up your mad masterpieces.
