Earnshaw: Phew, that was close...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Earnshaw: *sigh* I didn't think that there would be any hilichurls that dared to attack people so close to the Court of Fontaine. I don't know what I'd have done if Lanoire was hurt. But thanks to you...
Earnshaw: I was of a mind to not let her run around again. But if I did that, how different would life here be from life in the Fortress of Meropide?
Earnshaw: I suppose I'll just keep her company more often, so that if anything happens, she'll at least have some adult to rely on.
Traveler: See you.
Earnshaw: Bye, take care! Don't have your loved ones worrying about you, alright?
