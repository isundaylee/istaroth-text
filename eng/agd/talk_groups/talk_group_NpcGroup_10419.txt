Zhuhan: Qingce Village Armwrestling Champion, huh... *sigh* Alright, you're signed up...
Zhuhan: Next please... what's your name?
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Zhuhan: #Traveler... Wait! A—Aren't you...!?
Clash Competitor: #Did I hear that right? Traveler?
Clash Competitor: Is it really them?
Clash Competitor: ...Huh? Aren't they a Vision bearer, though? Why are they trying to enter The Clash?
Zhuhan: Uh... I—I have to ask... aren't you the traveler that helped Liyue fight off that ancient god...?
Traveler: Correct.
Clash Competitor: #It's really {F#her}{M#him}!
Clash Competitor: The one that spoke with Lady Keqing at the Rite of Parting!
Clash Competitor: #Oh! Oh! I wonder if I can get {F#her}{M#his} autograph later?
Zhuhan: I—I trust you are aware that... only those without Visions can enter the tournament?
Traveler: I don't have a Vision.
Zhuhan: Really? B—But from what I've heard, the things you're capable of in combat are... nothing short of extraordinary... You walk into the most dangerous situations imaginable, face off against all sorts of monsters — even the Fatui — and always come out on top!
Paimon: #Yup! {F#She}{M#He} still doesn't have a Vision though. See for yourself!
Zhuhan: My apologies, I didn't mean to be rude. I'm sure a great hero like yourself would have no reason to lie. Now, could I ask you to provide a few claims to fame?
Zhuhan: It's just a formality for you, of course, but I have to make a record of competitors' achievements as part of the sign-up process...
Zhuhan: So far I've got "Defeated the ancient god, Osial," so that's one. Do you... have any others?
Traveler: I defeated a Fatui Harbinger.
Paimon: Yeah, and also a dragon, too! Put down "Battle with Stormterror"!
Clash Competitor: Whoa...
Clash Competitor: #Might as well declare {F#her}{M#him} the champion already.
Clash Competitor: I wonder if it's too late to withdraw?
Zhuhan: Okay, um... that's plenty... Actually, this is the most dazzling track record I've ever seen, by a long shot...
Zhuhan: Right, your registration is complete. Now, a brief word about the prize.
Zhuhan: A great hero such as yourself can surely only be here for one thing — to win the tournament and claim the grand prize, namely, a Vision.
Paimon: Oh, we're not here for that. We're here because Captain Beidou promised to take us to Inazuma if we win the tournament.
Clash Competitor: There's another prize too? First I've heard of it!
Clash Competitor: Beidou must have upped the stakes this time to attract top talent!
Clash Competitor: But why would anyone want to go somewhere as dangerous as Inazuma?
Zhuhan: ...I see, so... I take it you discussed your terms with Beidou in advance, then.
Traveler: Everyone's misunderstanding the situation.
Zhuhan: Well, nobody expected you to sign up to a tournament like this... I can hardly believe it myself, to be honest...
Zhuhan: Anyway, the qualifying rounds are about to begin. I'll leave you to your preparation.
Paimon: Hey, so, Paimon's thinking about that whole "no Vision bearers" rule in this tournament.
Paimon: Even though you don't have a Vision, most people in Teyvat think that you can't manipulate the elements without one.
Paimon: So Paimon thinks you probably shouldn't use your elemental abilities during the tournament. Y'know, just to avoid any misunderstandings.
Traveler: I'm just not that interested in Visions, that's all.
Zhuhan: Well, I'm sure a great hero has an important reason for being here.
Traveler: I saved Dvalin.
Paimon: Yeah, put that down! And also, "Defeated the Fatui Harbinger, Childe."
Traveler: I'm the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius.
Paimon: Yeah! Also, don't forget to mention that previous battles include, but are not limited to "Stormterror" Dvalin and Fatui Harbinger, Childe.

Paimon: In any case, looking at the competition, it should still be pretty easy for you to win even without using any elements, right?
Traveler: Makes sense.
Paimon: Alright, it's showtime! You got this!
