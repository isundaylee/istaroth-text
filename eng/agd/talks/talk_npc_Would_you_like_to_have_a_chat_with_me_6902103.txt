# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Amber: Sure!
Amber: ...
Amber: Sorry, I'm no good at telling stories. Not like Lisa or my grandfather... They seem to be able to fit a thrilling tale into every conversation.
Traveler: Haven't you been keeping a journal—
Amber: Huh!? How long have you known about that!?
Amber: N—Not that I've been hiding it from anyone, it's just that... well, you'd be flattered to read some of the entries...
Amber: ...But it's still a bit embarrassing to just let someone else read my journal!
Amber: Hmm... I guess I could pick out some excerpts from my adventures if you're interested.
Amber: Okay! Where do I start...
Traveler: I'd like to hear more about your past.
Amber: My past...
Amber: Uh... I think you might find it a little boring. Besides, in hindsight, let's just say that little Amber was... a bit of a nuisance.
Amber: I mean, if you really wanna know, I'm happy to tell you about it... but only if you promise you won't laugh at me!
Traveler: Sounds good to me!
