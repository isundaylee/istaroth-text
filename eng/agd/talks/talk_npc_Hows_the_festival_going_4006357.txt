# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How's the festival going?
Murata: Oh, things have been going quite smoothly. Everyone in the editorial team has finally been able to heave a sigh of relief.
Murata: Although the release event has ended, the festival will continue for a while more. I believe that there's also ongoing ikebana and Theater Mechanicus events...
Murata: I'd have gone to take part in them myself if I didn't have to stay here to watch the booth.
