# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Barbara: Oh, sure!
Barbara: Hehe...
Traveler: What's with that smile...
Barbara: Oh, I just realized that I haven't chatted with a friend like this in a long time.
Barbara: I just feel so blessed all of a sudden.
Traveler: Seems like you're easy to please.
Barbara: Uhh... Is that so...
Barbara: Well, maybe... but it's not such a bad thing.
Barbara: The easier you find it to receive joy, the more energy you have to share that joy with other people.
Barbara: Ahh... please, no need to shower me with compliments...
Barbara: Only with constructive criticism can we grow, right...?
Traveler: It's because you're always putting other people first.
Barbara: Of course I do, that's what I'm supposed to do!
Barbara: I've always had so many people looking out for me. I just want to do all that is within my power to repay their kindness.
Traveler: You are every bit as wonderful as people say.
Traveler: Have you suddenly remembered something amusing?
