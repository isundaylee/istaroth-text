# "That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"


## Talk 1

Dori: Have you decided to buy information from me?
Paimon: Hmmm... Paimon's a little curious about your exclusive information, but we need to hear the price first! If it's too expensive, then forget it.
Dori: I'll sell it to you for the fixed price of one million Mora!
Paimon: That's a lot! Never mind, one million Mora can buy lots and lots of tasty food!
Dori: Wait a sec... Let me see... Eh? Paimon is customer number 1,001 for today. The original cost of the information was one million Mora, but for you the price is now free!
Paimon: Eh!? Paimon didn't know such luck exists!
Paimon: Wait, you're not baiting us into spending, are you? Maybe the first sentence is free, but not the next sentence...
Dori: If you don't want it, fine! Next!
Paimon: Wait, wait, wait, forget what Paimon said. We'll listen!
Dori: Dori's exclusive scoop number one! Do you remember the Diadem of Knowledge?
Paimon: Paimon remembers that only the champion was entitled to wear the diadem. It seemed very valuable!
Dori: Exactly. The diadem that Sachin gave the Akademiya was a rather expensive antique.
Dori: Yet this very diadem, after it was donated to the Akademiya, was lost by them once before!
Paimon: Eh? Why didn't we hear about this?
Dori: Hehe... if everyone knew about this, would my information still be considered "exclusive"?
Dori: Of course, this information doesn't come from nowhere. I've got witnesses, too.
Dori: There's a young fellow named Kashmer from the suburbs. If you're interested in delving further, you could ask him.
Dori: The password is "that incident from twenty years ago"!

## Talk 2

Kashmer: Who are you guys? Is there something you need?

## Talk 3

Paimon: There's a hole in the tree. It seems completely empty, and there's nothing in it...
Paimon: Eh? Wait! There's a note there!
Paimon: "The good Nara taught Arakasyapa how to read. Arakasyapa must protect the good Nara..."
Paimon: What's this supposed to mean?
