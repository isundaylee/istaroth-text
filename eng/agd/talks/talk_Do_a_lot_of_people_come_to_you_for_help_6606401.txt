Traveler: Do a lot of people come to you for help?
Kahuna: There was no shortage even before, but after the war, the number of missing people commissions increased significantly. I'm sure you understand...
Kahuna: It's not all bad news, though. Being able to help people find their lost friends and loved ones, and seeing their excitement when they're reunited... It makes me feel happy too.
Kahuna: As for the others... well, let's not bring that up for now. Some of the loss of contact might just be temporary. Perhaps they'll just turn up back at home someday, completely out of the blue?
