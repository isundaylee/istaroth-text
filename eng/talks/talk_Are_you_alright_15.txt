Traveler: Are you alright?
Sania: Today, perhaps. Tomorrow? I'm afraid we can't be sure.
Sania: With a husband like mine, we're struggling to make ends meet every day.
Sania: I mean, I'm not demanding that he earn huge sums or anything, but I'd at least like a steady income.
Sania: But apart from cooking, he can't do anything at all.
Sania: And everyone here in Aaru Village knows how to cook their own food. It's how we survive here... So who's going to buy food off the street?
Sania: And even that would still be acceptable... But not only does he make no attempt to earn Mora, he gives out the food he makes to others! For free!
