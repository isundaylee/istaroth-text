# Garcia's Paean: Easy Peasy


## Talk 1

Garcia: My hands... Ugh! They're both numb...
Lutong: Sir, you still need to do accounts for Ms. Kaia later. Please don't exhaust yourself.
Garcia: Not right now, Lutong! I—I am well aware!
Lutong: Of course, if you can't make it, I will stand in for you.
Garcia: No! I will do that myself. I am just... I just need to... forge a couple more gears...
Garcia: ...
Garcia: Okay, I give up, I just can't continue anymore...
Traveler: What are you doing now...
Garcia: Oh, it's you, Traveler... Ouch... My hands...
Garcia: Well, here's the situation. Mr. Ahangar is also otherwise engaged, and so it is not possible to constantly commission him to make the parts I need...
Garcia: Moreover, the parts he makes are often ever so slightly different from those that I picture in my mind.
Garcia: So, to ensure the reliability of these parts, I asked Mr. Ahangar to teach me some forging skills and decided to forge the parts on my own.
Garcia: Fortunately, I have acquired relevant experience in Fontaine... But some of the techniques Mr. Ahangar spoke of were just so hard to remember. Ouch...
Garcia: Traveler, could you please ask Mr. Ahangar about his forging techniques? I really need some rest...
Traveler: Have a good rest here, Mr. Garcia.
Garcia: Thank you for being willing to help. Ugh... My hands...
Traveler: Who is Kaia?
Garcia: A business partner! A... um... very talented and... rich business partner!
Garcia: We have signed a long-term accounting contract with her! And that is why I've been meeting her often, as I'm certain Lutong can attest to.
Lutong: That is perfectly right, sir.
Garcia: S—So that's how things stand... Traveler, do help us find Mr. Ahangar as soon as possible. I shall be waiting here.

## Talk 2

Ahangar: I told you! Just wait a sec... Huh. It's you.
Traveler: I'm here to ask some questions on Mr. Garcia's behalf.
Ahangar: So he actually went and did that himself... What a weirdo.
Ahangar: I've been a blacksmith for a great many years. This is the first time I've encountered someone with such strict requirements.
Ahangar: He even brings a ruler to measure the seam between iron tubes, and the distance between threads.
Ahangar: I just can't put up with him, so I told him to do it himself... And you know what? He actually came the next day and asked me to teach him some forging skills.
Ahangar: Really, there's nothing I can do about him, so I let him be. As long as he pays for the materials, I'll let him use whatever tools he wants.
Ahangar: *sigh* I've no idea what this guy has in mind...
Traveler: He's making a wondrous machine.
Ahangar: Eh, it's probably something strange, whatever it is. You're here to ask about forging skills, right? To be honest, I have nothing much to teach regarding gear forging...
Ahangar: I have noticed something about the gears he wants, though. They all have sharp edges but are concave in the middle...
Ahangar: Molds are not enough for such specially-shaped gears, so he has to reshape the gears afterward.
Ahangar: I've taught him about the techniques in detail. You just need to tell him...
Ahangar: First, <color=#00E1FFFF>remember to add enough fuel to really heat up the fire</color> when putting it into the furnace for the second time.
Ahangar: Then, when you take it out to process it, <color=#00E1FFFF>hammer it from the inside out</color>.
Ahangar: Did you get all that? Alright, go back and tell him if you did.
Ahangar: What a weirdo...
Traveler: He's making a weird machine.
Traveler: Mr. Garcia's hands went numb from all that forging, and he needs rest.

## Talk 3

Garcia: Lutong! This gear is ready for demolding! Come help me!
Garcia: Traveler, you're back. So, Mr. Ahangar has taught you his tricks, I trust?
Garcia: Tell me then, how should I process this gear?

### Additional Talk 9

Black Screen Text: Garcia begins his work...
Garcia: Aha! Success! This gear looks mighty fine, if I should say so myself!
Garcia: The spacing between its teeth... Thickness... Size... Ah, I must fetch a ruler...
Lutong: It's best that we leave Mr. Garcia to his measurements. Traveler, here is your payment. Please take it.
Traveler: Are you still... cautiously pessimistic?
Lutong: Yes, that's how I have always been.
Lutong: Mr. Garcia and I have been wandering in front of a giant mountain for some time now, and we have only just removed a tiny stone from the foot of this mountain.
Lutong: We have, in truth, not yet found a way up.
Lutong: Hopefully, Mr. Garcia's talents will lead us to the right path...
Lutong: Or I will have to tell myself that "when your path is blocked by a mountain, there will be a way through."

### Additional Talk 10

Lutong: Sir, I humbly suggest that we might have to... change our approach.
Garcia: Change our approach?
Lutong: Perhaps we might make something less complicated but equally intricate.
Lutong: I believe that with your talents, making machines of this sort should be...
Garcia: My dear Lutong, we have spoken of this matter before. You know my answer... but I will always respect your choices.
Lutong: Perhaps we should instead discuss where you shall have dinner with Ms. Kaia next, sir.
Garcia: Ah, thank you, Lutong.
Lutong: My pleasure, sir. Our contract has not ended yet.

### Additional Talk 11

Ahangar: Do you have other questions for me?
Traveler: Has Garcia been here for long?
Ahangar: Quite some time, I would say. This guy is even more passionate than some of my apprentices.
Ahangar: But he just doesn't look like someone who wants to make a living as a blacksmith...
Traveler: Did anyone visit them other than me?
Ahangar: Hmm... There is a woman who visits him quite often, and she comes bringing lots of things.
Ahangar: He has told me that the woman is named Kaia... Or something like that.
Ahangar: I don't get it. These people look nothing like blacksmiths, so why do they hang around in my smithy...

### Additional Talk 12

Ahangar: What on earth does this guy have in his mind...
