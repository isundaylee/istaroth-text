Traveler: Tell me about the Bathysmal Vishaps...
Eboshi: They are primordial elemental beings, unbent and unbowed by the power that came from the heavens owing to their living deep underwater.
Eboshi: They are actually very intelligent, and they are adept at evolving. They would even evolve into different elemental forms throughout the history of their war against us.
Eboshi: I would not be surprised at all if they have learned language or perhaps even evolved into lizard-people of a sort.
Eboshi: The Holy Soil phenomenon is, in fact, the expansion of their habitat. That means that the primordial elemental power of the three realms is growing stronger.
Eboshi: Only by using Watatsumi Omikami's life force to awaken its second servant could we convert this raw, raging elemental power.
