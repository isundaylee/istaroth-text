## Talk

Chuyi: This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
Chuyi: The new owner says that all who approach are guests, so you might as well head up for some tea.

## Talk

Traveler: You're under new ownership?
Chuyi: The previous owner sold this property due to debt problems.
Chuyi: The new owner made some adjustments to how we operate after taking over...
Chuyi: ...But not that you'd understand, anyway. Just treat this place like any other "teahouse." Heh.

## Talk

Traveler: Not going to "escort" me away?
Chuyi: No idea what you're talking about. Of course not.
Chuyi: Our new owner also hopes that more people will come to drink tea... As long as they behave, drink tea, and chat, they are welcome here.

Huai'an: It's a rare thing to lose... By the way, do you want to go upstairs?

Chuyi: Don't forget, I am Yanshang Teahouse's hostess. Playing cards is second nature to me...

## Talk

Chuyi: This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
Chuyi: Now that you're here, are you mentally prepared? Did you bring enough money?

## Talk

Chuyi: It sounds like the tea here must be quite expensive.
Chuyi: Who said that a teahouse must only sell tea?
Chuyi: Someone stupid like you shouldn't be out making a mess of our city. Your time would be better spent listening to an opera or sitting in a restaurant.
Chuyi: There're some places you don't belong, and you're most certainly not needed around here.
Chuyi: If you don't leave, I will have to ask security to "escort" you away.

## Talk

Chuyi: No, thank you. Goodbye.
Chuyi: Oh, so you do have some manners...
Chuyi: I'll return the courtesy by not calling our security. Good day.
