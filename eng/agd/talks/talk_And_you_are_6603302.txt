Traveler: And you are...?
Bayajidda: I'm a volunteer at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. When the competition's on, I'm responsible for maintaining order inside, guiding contestants to where they should be, and so on.
Bayajidda: I also wander around between matches to see if anyone needs help.
Bayajidda: Anyway, things have been a bit quiet lately, so if you need any help at all, don't hesitate to let me know!
Bayajidda: Oh, and if you'd like to join our team of volunteers, just say the word and it shall be so!
