## Talk

Antila: *sigh* There are more important things we could be doing...

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Antila: I'm a photographer from The Steambird. I'm here with Houallet for an interview.
Antila: But really, this case just looks like a series of coincidences — if we're unable to interview the fugitive involved, there'll be nothing to write about, really.
Antila: That "Monsieur" has quite the good temper, to be going along with Houallet like that.

## Talk

Traveler: A fugitive?
Antila: Well, the case went like this...
Antila: The "Monsieur" tripped a thief who had stolen a wallet with a crowbar.
Antila: The wallet contained a picture taken by the owner of the wallet, and in the background of that photo was a criminal on the run.
Antila: ...And yeah, that's how evidence fell from the skies, enabling the Maison Gardiennage to catch a fugitive.
Antila: The culprit has already been locked away in the Fortress of Meropide — hardly a convenient interview subject. As such, there's really no opportunity to dig any deeper.
Antila: I know that Houallet knows this as well, but he just doesn't want Charlotte to score the monthly reprint slots with her stories again.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Antila: See you. To be honest, I'd have left myself if it wasn't for work.

## Talk

Traveler: Why's he called "Monsieur"?
Antila: Oh, interested in this title, are you? This is the term of address given to distinguished Honored Citizens of Fontaine.
Antila: These titles are gained by valiant deeds that aid investigations that make great contributions to defending the peace in Fontaine, much like that dear "Monsieur" did.
Antila: Not that an Honorary Citizen is very high up the "Monsieur" totem pole — as I recall, the highest you can go there is "Duke."
Antila: And that's not the sort of person Houallet can interview, I reckon.
