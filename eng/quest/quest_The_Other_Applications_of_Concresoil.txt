# The Other Applications of Concresoil


## Talk 1

Akim: I still need more materials...
Traveler: How's your Concresoil coming along?
Akim: Amazing, actually! As it turns out, this soil can be used for a wide variety of purposes.
Akim: For example, it can be used to make pottery and fix cracks in houses.
Akim: With a small adjustment of the mix ratio, I can even build houses with this soil.
Akim: However... I'm running low on materials due to a surge in orders.
Akim: Critically, I've ran out of Slime Condensate. Traveler, could you please bring me three more portions of Slime Condensate?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Akim: So, Traveler, could you please fetch three more portions of Slime Condensate for me?
Traveler: What about other materials?
Akim: I have made purchases from different channels or asked others for help.
Akim: I just didn't expect that Slime Condensate could run out so quickly...

## Talk 2

Akim: Traveler, have you obtained the Slime Condensate?

## Talk 3

Akim: Thank you. Then I have all the materials I need for now.
Akim: Give me a second while I mix the Concresoil...
Black Screen Text: Akim starts to mix the soil...
Akim: Okay, it's done. Please take the soil to Nima.
Akim: He has been waiting for it for ages.
Akim: This child is... um... unusually imaginative.
Akim: Nima told me he wanted to make a group of talking "pot warriors" that can roll over enemies and have all sorts of magical powers.
Akim: The power of these warriors will vary with the materials stuffed in their pot bodies.
Akim: He even gave these pot warriors a name, called Ad... Well, forget it, I don't remember.
Akim: Unfortunately, I can't really make pot warriors with magical powers. But still, it's an interesting idea.
Akim: So I thought, why not give him the soil as a toy gift?
Akim: This way, he can make his own pot warriors and command them like a general!
Akim: Ahem, anyway, please help me send this pot of soil to Nima.
Akim: Once his pot warriors are complete, maybe he will appoint us both "pot generals" as well!

## Talk 4

Nima: #Hello, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}, what can I do for you?

## Talk 5

Nima: Wow, this must be the soil that can make everything. Just like Akim told me!
Nima: #Yay! Thank you, {M#Mister}{F#Miss}!
Nima: Now I can make "Adri"!
Traveler: What is Adri, anyway?
Nima: #Didn't Akim tell you about it, {M#Mister}{F#Miss}?
Nima: I'm making some pot warriors. Adri is gonna be the first and the best of them!
Nima: He is a kind warrior with a good temper. When he awakens as a pot warrior, the first thing he will do is to apologize to the grass under him.
Nima: His power is... is...
Nima: Iâ€”I haven't decided on it yet... but you'll be the first to know once I have!
Nima: After Adri is done, I'll make Ivar, his adjutant, and Lasson, his disciple.
Nima: The three of them... no, the three pot warriors... They will embark on a long, long journey...

## Talk 6

Akim: I still need more materials...
Traveler: How's your Concresoil coming along?
Akim: Amazing, actually! As it turns out, this soil can be used for a wide variety of purposes.
Akim: For example, it can be used to make pottery and fix cracks in houses.
Akim: By making small adjustment to the mix ratio, I can even build houses with this soil.
Akim: However... I'm running low on materials due to a surge in orders.
Akim: Even the Whopperflower soil has run out... Traveler, could you please go and get me some more of that?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Akim: Thank you. Don't forget, it's the soil where Whopperflowers grow that we're looking for!
Traveler: What about other materials?
Akim: I've made purchases through various means and asked others for help.
Akim: But I'm out of this particular type of soil. I really should have stored more of it...

## Talk 7

Akim: Did you get the soil?

## Talk 8

Akim: Thank you, these should last me for a while.
Akim: I'm thinking that there might be other ways to improve the Concresoil...
Akim: For example, perhaps the soil can also be highly water-retentive and nutrient-rich...
Akim: *sigh* I'm just not smart enough. If it was those wise folks, they would have definitely come up with more good ideas...

## Talk 9

Akim: Traveler! Thank goodness you're here. I was just in need of someone's help!
Traveler: So you've made progress in your soil research?
Akim: Well... I don't think I could call it "progress," but a customer of mine did give me some useful advice.
Akim: He said that he enjoys growing flowers and the thing that troubles him most is finding the right soil.
Akim: The soil needs to have good permeability and adequate nutrients. Plus, it should be water retentive but not soggy...
Akim: Knowing that I've made such improvements to the Concresoil, he asked me if I could devise a version of it for flowers.
Akim: I found it worth researching, so I'm looking for other materials to further upgrade my Concresoil.
Akim: Could you please help me look for some fertile soil this time?
Akim: I'll mark the location of the soil on the map for you.
Traveler: Why is it so far away...
Akim: I asked around, of course. It's a little out of the way, but they say the soil there is very fertile.
Akim: But there seems to be a lot of monsters over there too, so I wouldn't dare to go myself...
Akim: I'm counting on you, Traveler!
Traveler: How did you find this place...?

## Talk 10

Akim: Did you get the soil?

## Talk 11

Akim: This is exactly what I'm looking for! Thank you so much.
Akim: Please take these as your reward.
Akim: Well... as fertile as it is, this soil is pretty weighty, and it doesn't seem to have great permeability...
Akim: Hmm... I'd better mix it with some other soil types...

## Talk 12

Akim: Ugh, this is awful. Where did I go wrong...
Traveler: What's going on?
Akim: Ah! It's... it's you, Traveler...
Akim: *sigh* There's something wrong with my Concresoil...
Akim: Was it the mix ratio? Or the lack of experimental trials...
Akim: Many customers who have built their kitchens using Concresoil have reported cracking after only a few days.
Akim: Perhaps the temperature grew so high that some parts of the soil just failed to work?
Akim: *sigh* Anyway, I have to go fix those cracks for them.
Akim: There were too many people needing repairs for me to take all the scraped Concresoil away, so I asked them to just keep it in some pots. And ah, there were very many pots indeed...
Akim: Traveler, could you please help me collect the used Concresoil from this house, while I go to another one?
Akim: *sigh* Where did it all go wrong...

## Talk 13

Akim: Did you get those pots of Concresoil back?

## Talk 14

Akim: Thank you. I'll evaluate this batch of soil.
Akim: How could this happen? Do I need to adjust the ratio again...
Akim: Ugh, why is making the ideal soil so hard?
