# Tales From the Court


## Talk 1

Isadora: This is where I was attacked by those gulls! Those things are bad luck, I swear — I have no idea why they decided to swoop down at me!
Isadora: I could only flee while clutching the documents. Thank goodness you were on hand to chase them off, Officer Muirne!
Muirne: But it doesn't look like there are any documents here... Let's keep going.

## Talk 2

Muirne: Nothing here either... and there are police patrolling this area, too.
Muirne: If they discovered the documents, they would've reported them to the Palais right away.
Muirne: Let's keep walking.

## Talk 3

Isadora: Ah, these are the documents I need! Oh, thank the Archon, they're all here!
Traveler: Why were you doing accounts at the cafe?
Isadora: W—Well, I need lots of coffee to make sure I'm counting it all right.
Isadora: This is the expenses of all the offices within the Palais, mind you — counting it up's supposed to be five people's work.
Isadora: But apart from me, everyone in the office is often being borrowed by some other office, sent out on work, or is busy with some visitation...
Isadora: So when it came time to count expenses, it was just me doing it — I haven't slept in days!
Isadora: Not only did the expenses need counting up, but even the settling of the bills got left to me. My vision's practically swimming over here...
Muirne: Regardless, it's good that we found those accounts. If you'll allow me, Ms. Isadora, I'll accompany you back to the Palais.
Isadora: Thank you, Officer Muirne. *sigh* I swear, you and the Traveler are the only two good souls I've met these last three months.
Isadora: Everyone else is either yelling at me or pushing me to work.
Isadora: Ugh, no, no, I need to stop complaining. I need to go back, or Ms. Keiser's going to yell at me again...
