Traveler: You built this tavern overnight? Impressive!
Lambad: Hahahaha! You're making me blush.
Lambad: I was exaggerating when I said that, but I wasn't kidding about being a great sailor in the past.
Lambad: I've passed through vast thunderstorms more wrathful than the Raiden Shogun, and I've pierced through glaciers steelier than the Tsaritsa's heart.
Lambad: But that was nothing...
Lambad: ...Nothing compared to being able to return safely to Sumeru and open this lively tavern! Hahaha!
