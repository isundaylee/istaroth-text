# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello.
Shahin: Oh, hello! I rarely meet anyone here who would start a conversation with me.
Shahin: Great hero, where are you from? What are you doing here?
Shahin: I'm not making this up, the people in this garden are so boring. All they ever say to a question is "I don't know," "I'm not sure," and "Stop asking about it."
Shahin: I expected working away from the city to be fun, but accepting work in the city with the Corps of Thirty seems much better now.
