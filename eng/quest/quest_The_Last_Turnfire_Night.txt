# The Last Turnfire Night


## Talk 1

Traveler: Yeah, let's head off.
Paimon: Off we go!

## Talk 2

Trinidad: Are you ready?

## Talk 3

Toba: #{M#Mr.}{F#Miss} {NICKNAME}! You're finally here! I even dragged my uncle out to watch the ceremony.
Ponche: Although I'd hoped for the Malipo name-bearer to perform this ceremony, that was never anything to do with you. So please don't take it personally.
Ponche: I got thinking last night, and I realized: If the lesson of Mal{RUBY#[D]Turnfire}ipo is to look forwards, then I should accept that my book is gone, and start anew.
Ponche: Besides, I'll have even more to write about this time, given this will be our first Turnfire ceremony featuring a flame bearer from another land.
Ponche: I'll be taking detailed notes.
Toba: #Good luck, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} {NICKNAME}! You got this!

## Talk 4

Wayna: #{NICKNAME}, you've come at just the right time. I have some good news for you...
Wayna: Trinidad's condition has stabilized. He suffered burns on much of his body, but we believe he'll survive.
Paimon: Guess that's the best news we could hope for...
Paimon: Paimon has to ask, is everyone in your tribe such a risk-taker? First Kinich, then Elder Trinidad... Is this the Scions of the Canopy's adventurous spirit in action?
Wayna: We're simply not afraid to charge ahead into the unknown.
Traveler: Is Kinich okay?
Wayna: He's fine, don't worry. He's gone to check on the Mountain King — something most mysterious has happened.
Wayna: After the incident yesterday, a transparent shell has formed around the Mountain King's body. We don't understand the mechanism behind it, but this shell appears to insulate him against the influence of Abyssal power.
Wayna: It is somewhat akin to a scab, in that it stops the Abyssal energy within him from bleeding out, while also preventing further Abyssal energy from seeping in and infecting him.
Wayna: We've never seen anything like it. The tribe's most senior elders believe it was caused when he was burned by the sacred flame, similar to the way burned wood becomes charcoal.
Wayna: I think their theory makes sense. After all, we've never thrown the Mountain King directly into the sacred flame before.
Paimon: Wow, so it's made a barrier against Abyssal energy? That's... a good thing, right?
Wayna: It's practically a miracle, from what we've seen of it so far. It means that the Mountain King's level of Abyssal energy is now stable. No longer will we need to perform an annual cleansing ceremony.
Paimon: Wow! That's amazing!
Traveler: Was it really just the power of the sacred flame?
Wayna: I know what you're thinking. The young people in the tribe are already speculating that yesterday's ceremony was a Turnfire Night like none other in our history.
Wayna: Because you and Kinich... You summoned the very flame that appears in our ancient legends. A great, transparent ball of fire.
Wayna: And that fire is what saved the Mountain King.
Paimon: Whoa! So that was the real Turnfire?
Wayna: Haha, I may be the chief of this tribe, but I've only ever known the Turnfire as a concept in our legends. I cannot answer that question.
Wayna: If anyone can answer it, I suspect it would be the bearer of the Mal{RUBY#[D]Turnfire}ipo name. He is in the Mountain King's cave as we speak.
Paimon: Ah... So, Kinich then. Why don't we go see how he's doing?

## Talk 5

Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Trinidad: Of course, there's no rush. I can wait for you right here.

## Talk 6

Trinidad: Here we are.
Wayna: Our honored guests have arrived.
Wayna: I have heard much about your fine work over the past few days. I hope you'll allow us to thank you properly after tonight's ceremony.
Paimon: Don't worry about it. Getting this huge venue ready must've been a huge task. No need to make extra work for yourselves on our account.
Trinidad: If it means getting the Mountain King issue resolved, no cost is too great to bear.
Wayna: A resolution will come in due course. But every great fire starts as a tiny spark. We must take it one step at a time.
Trinidad: No one would disagree with you if that were possible, Chief... But it's been far too long since we've seen a real step forward.
Trinidad: Look around you. Can't you see how our numbers have dwindled since the last Turnfire Night?
Wayna: The ceremony was arranged on short notice. Many are away from home, and could not make it back in time.
Trinidad: That may be so, but still...
Kinich: #Good evening, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Paimon: Kinich! Not a moment too soon...
Kinich: #Chief Wayna, Elder Trinidad, could you give us a minute? I'd like to give {NICKNAME} a few pointers as the previous flame bearer.
Wayna: Very well, but make it quick. Let me know when you're done, and we will begin the ceremony.
Kinich: Let's step to the side. Has anyone gone over the key steps of the ceremony with you yet?
Paimon: Yeah, Elder Trinidad did. But uh... Paimon seems to have forgotten them...
Ajaw: What a surprise, the flying ant has an ant-sized brain.
Kinich: If you don't want your tongue to be burned off by the sacred flame tonight, I suggest you stay quiet.
Ajaw: Tch...
Kinich: See those Sacred Flame Pillars? Once you've lit the fire, go light each one up in turn.
Kinich: Once that's done, head down into the cave where the Mountain King slumbers, light the braziers along the way, then bring the flame to the final altar. Then, the ceremony is complete.
Paimon: That sounds simple enough.
Kinich: The process isn't complicated, but remember — you mustn't turn back at any point. If you miss a pillar, you can't light the next one then come back to it.
Kinich: You have to keep moving forward, or it's seen as disrespecting our ancestors. If that happens, you won't receive the blessing of the Turnfire, and you'll have to start over.
Kinich: I made you a diagram that summarizes the steps. Take a look.
Traveler: Got it.
Paimon: So that's our part. What about you?
Kinich: I'll be with you the whole way, and once you've lit the altar, I'll start summoning the Rift.
Kinich: You can leave that side of things to me. Just focus on your part.
Paimon: Okay. We'll try to remember all that and get it right first time.
Traveler: Well then, shall we begin?
Kinich: Ready when you are.
Kinich: But I think I saw Huni and the others just now, maybe you should say hi before you start. Might make you less nervous.
Kinich: Just tell the chief when you're ready.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Yeah, we're ready to go.
Wayna: I'm counting on you. Don't forget what we talked about.
Wayna: By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on...
Wayna: My brothers and sisters, the time has come to light the fire once again, and let the Turnfire Night shine bright in Huitztlan!

## Talk 8

Trinidad: Ah, at long last, you're back.
Trinidad: I hear that you've done much for our people these last few days. Everyone has nothing but praise for you.
Trinidad: Many young people have heard the rumors, too. They're all eager to meet our new flame bearer.
Paimon: Well, they won't have to wait long! It's almost time for the ceremony!
Paimon: We really hope we can resolve the Mountain King situation quickly and smoothly. Seems like a lot of people have been worrying about it, huh?
Trinidad: Haha, well, it's nearly time. So, if you're ready, then follow me to the ceremony site.

## Talk 9

Wayna: How are you doing? Is all in order?

## Talk 11

Kinich: What happened to getting some rest?
Traveler: I'm still a little anxious about Enjou.
Kinich: You're cautious, like me. I get it. But don't worry — like I said, I investigated, and I'm confident he has nothing to do with the Mountain King situation.
Kinich: Before he got tangled up with us, he was looking into the Mare Jivari. That's another major part of Natlan's history.
Kinich: Our ancestor, Burkina once fought a campaign there alongside the five other heroes. But it's not such an easy place to get to these days.
Kinich: That's about all I know, though. I have yet to take a job that involves the Mare Jivari.
Traveler: I'm pretty curious about Ajaw.
Kinich: Heh, Ajaw's piqued your interest, huh? It's true that he's a relic from an earlier Saurian age, but since we're bound to each other by a contract, you can see him as my companion for now.
Kinich: I know he can be awful, but don't worry. As long as I'm still around, he can't do that much damage.
Traveler: ...As long as you're around?
Kinich: Mhm, that's a key part of the contract. Ajaw has to obey my orders and lend me his power for as long as I live.
Kinich: And after I die, Ajaw gets control of my body. That's the price.
Kinich: Crazy, isn't it? That was probably the first time I really appreciated what it meant to pay a "price." Then, once I signed the contract, I received the ancient name "Mal{RUBY#[D]Turnfire}ipo."
Kinich: But that's a whole other story. We can get into it another time, if you're interested.

## Talk 12

Huni: #{M#Mr. Traveler, you look so cool today!}{F#Miss Traveler, you look so pretty today!}
Huni: You're gonna make sure the Mountain King never threatens us again, right?
Huni: I believe in you! I'll be cheering you on the whole time!

## Talk 13

Paimon: Woohoo! We've lit up the final altar!
Paimon: That's the Mountain King up ahead, right?
Kinich: That's him. Kongamato, king of the Yumkasaurs from five hundred years ago. He's very powerful.
Paimon: Paimon can tell, he's huge... Let's tread carefully. We don't wanna wake him up...
Traveler: Should we pretend to purify the King?
Wayna: You've made it at last. You did even better than I expected.
Trinidad: #{NICKNAME}, now comes the final and most important step of the ceremony. Please use the power of the sacred flame to cleanse the Mountain King of Abyssal filth!
Kinich: There's no need this time.
Trinidad: Hmm?
Wayna: Such strong Abyssal power! What is that thing?
Wayna: Kinich! What is the meaning of this!?
Trinidad: Is that... a Beastly Rift!?
Kinich: Chief Wayna, Elder Trinidad, this is about to get a little dangerous. You should step back.
Wayna: What do you think you're doing?
Kinich: Solving the Mountain King issue.
Trinidad: You mean... By having him torn to pieces by Rifthounds!?
Wayna: No, stop! We can't let that happen!
Ajaw: Foolish locust! Can't you see? We're trying to shove your Locust King into the Beastly Rift!
Wayna: But... But...
Kinich: I'm sorry, Chief Wayna, and Elder Trinidad. This is the only way.
Wayna: Can you promise me that no harm will come to the Mountain King?
Kinich: I can't guarantee it, but I'm fairly confident.
Trinidad: #{NICKNAME}, this is not what we agreed on! You must cleanse the Mountain King of every last trace of Abyssal contamination!
Traveler: I've changed my mind. I don't want the King to die.
Trinidad: Okay, I see what this is! You've been in cahoots this whole time!
Ajaw: You imbecile! What have you done!?
Paimon: Oh no... The device is destroyed!
Trinidad: You forced my hand. I had no choice...
Paimon: Elder Trinidad... Wh—What are you doing!?
Wayna: No! The Mountain King is waking up... He will cause even more casualties...
Kinich: Everyone, out! Now!
Trinidad: Hahahaha... It seems there is only one way to awaken you all from your willful blindness... More sacrifices must be made.
Trinidad: Take me, O Mountain King! Take me as your next sacrifice!
Traveler: This was Kinich's idea. It has nothing to do with me.

## Talk 14

Thiago: Hey, bet you're surprised to see me? Didn't think I'd be coming, did ya?
Thiago: I was all packed up and ready to go, but then I thought, I wonder if the ceremony will go any differently with a new flame bearer? So yeah, here I am again!
Thiago: I still owe you for that picture you took. So once you start, I'll be dancing to cheer you on.
Thiago: Don't be nervous. You'll do great.

## Talk 16

Trinidad: Mighty outlanders, the time has finally come. You know what must be done.
Trinidad: Please remember, you must cleanse as much Abyssal energy as you can. This is the only way to prolong the Mountain King's slumber.
Trinidad: I am sure you have what it takes.

## Talk 17

Paimon: Hey, Kinich!
Kinich: Hey yourselves. You two doing okay after yesterday?
Paimon: We were gonna ask you the same question... You scared Paimon half to death when you rushed into the fire.
Kinich: Sorry, I couldn't just stand and watch the Mountain King get burned alive.
Ajaw: So you thought you'd try and extinguish the sacred flame with Dendro? Or was that an attempt to make the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw die of laughter?
Kinich: The sacred flame only possesses a fraction of the Pyro Archon's power. It's not as if I was fighting the Pyro Archon herself.
Paimon: Kinich... When you went into the flames, were you intending to... uh...
Kinich: Intending to what?
Paimon: To, um... do the same thing as Burkina...
Kinich: Sacrifice myself? Of course not. My focus was on keeping the Mountain King alive, not on what it would cost.
Kinich: But now I'm curious. What made you think I was going to sacrifice myself?
Paimon: Well... Because everyone's saying the Turnfire is what saved the King last night...
Paimon: And Ponche's theory was that summoning the Turnfire is a tit-for-tat exchange, right? So Paimon thought you'd decided to pay for it with your life...
Kinich: So you've heard that rumor too.
Kinich: I'm afraid I can't say for sure. What happened yesterday was a first for me too.
Paimon: Well, if even you don't know, there's probably no one in the world who does.
Kinich: What I would say is, if that really was the power of the Turnfire, I'd sooner believe that the Mountain King summoned it himself.
Paimon: The Mountain King? Then... what price did he pay?
Kinich: The core meaning of "price" is not atonement or compensation, but what you're willing to give up in order to obtain what you want.
Kinich: It's easy to die for your sins, much harder to live with the guilt and keep on going. In the end, the Mountain King chose the latter option — for Burkina, and for the tribe. That's the price he paid.
Paimon: Alright... So how is the Mountain King doing now?
Kinich: Health-wise, there's nothing to worry about. He'll enter a fighting stance whenever we set foot in his territory.
Kinich: But his attacks are gentler now, and not as crazed as before. Like he said yesterday, he just intends to be a sparring partner for people to practice with.
Paimon: You said "health-wise." Is something else bothering you?
Kinich: Yeah. I tried communicating with him again, but he didn't respond.
Ajaw: Hmph, we daresay that Locust King has well and truly lost its mind. The lights are on, but nobody is home.
Ajaw: Its body remains fighting fit thanks to the perverse power of the Abyss, but time has been less kind to its soul... It was ground to a pulp long ago!
Paimon: But we saw him come back to his senses yesterday...
Ajaw: That was merely one last burst of brain activity before it croaked. As you humans would say, it went out with a bang.
Paimon: Oh, come on! Stop being such a doomer. Paimon bets the Mountain King has finally let go of the tragedies of the past now, and is focusing on moving forward!
Paimon: That's why he doesn't have time to chat with us. He's too busy thinking about the future!
Kinich: #Heh, well, at least it means my fellow tribespeople can move forward now, too. Thank you for your help, {NICKNAME}. I owe you one.
Traveler: Nah, you already gave me that "gift."
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. You caught Enjou for us, remember?
Kinich: But he ended up being completely useless. It's not a fair trade if you lost out.
Paimon: Eh, that's on him. It's not your fault he's useless! Besides, we're friends now. You don't owe us anything.
Kinich: Friends? But your friendship is an even more valuable gift. I can't in good conscience accept it for free...
Kinich: So promise me, if you need anything in the future, you'll come to me.
Kinich: For you, I'll do anything.

## Talk 18

Enjou: ACHOO! Ahem... So in the end, only poor little Huni got the sad ending?
Huni: Yeah! Everyone's happy, except me. First Nanna, then my Dad... Why does everyone in my family have to suffer?
Toba: Huni... It'll be okay. Your dad will get better soon.
Huni: Toba, you're my friend, so I shouldn't say this to your face. But it was all the Mountain King's fault.
Toba: Ehh!?
Enjou: Now hold your horses, kiddo. If you promise not to fight, Uncle Sanka will tell you a story.
Enjou: ...Okay, before you roll your eyes out of your skull, I promise you can trust me. I almost got my eyebrows burned off by the Turnfire after last time. That's why I came back, to make it up to you!
Enjou: ...Alright, I'll just get to the point. Do you know what Uncle Sanka loves the most about your people?
Huni: ...What?
Enjou: Your extreme sports.
Toba: Huh?
Enjou: On my first day here, I got hit by someone falling out of the sky. I believe you call it "bungee jumping"?
Enjou: It's a dangerous sport, to be sure, but the courage it took to make the jump impressed the heck out of me. So I introduced myself to the jumper, we made friends, and I even helped treat her wounds.
Huni: Aw. Such a nice friend.
Enjou: Of course. Anyway, the good times didn't last, 'cause I got captured by a powerful foe, so we had to part ways for a while.
Enjou: In the hands of the enemy, I was scorned, scolded, and nearly given away as a gift. Oh, it was so humiliating! A horrible experience to look back on.
Enjou: "Why does Uncle Sanka always have to suffer?" I thought. So I feel your pain, Huni. I was in the same position.
Enjou: But in the end, I made it through, and I left all of those painful memories in the past. I even managed to reunite with my friend!
Toba: Uh... Is that it?
Huni: The moral of the story is to look forward in life, right? Yeah, we've heard that one millions of times. Sorry, Uncle Sanka, but you're not cut out to be a teacher.
Enjou: Very smart, Huni. But not quite smart enough.
Enjou: What I'm trying to tell you is that after I reunited with my friend, I found her injuries were all healed, but she really missed her family. So, I thought you might like to see her too.
Enjou: She's right behind you. Turn around and see.
Huni: Another trick about not turning back? I'm not falling for that one again!
Huni: ...Huh!?

## Talk 19

Traveler: I still need time to prepare.
Wayna: Very well. Then come back when you're ready.
