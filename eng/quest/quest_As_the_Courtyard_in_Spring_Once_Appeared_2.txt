# As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared


## Talk 1

Mona: ...Seems like similar things happen every time I'm with you. I'll attempt divination, read the signs, zero in on the target, then solve the problem.
Mona: You're surrounded by all kinds of friends, secrets, and destinies. It's incredible.
Paimon: No, you're incredible! You helped Fischl and us solve that Leonard situation.
Traveler: Is this a good thing for an astrologist?
Mona: All things considered, I suppose. Let's hope we can all stick together and resolve this, like we did last time.
Paimon: When you say together, do you mean the two of you, or all three of us?
Mona: Pff...
Mona: Okay, okay, the three of us then! Sometimes, Paimon offers an insightful perspective that can be very helpful to me.
Paimon: Really? Paimon's starting to like you a lot, Genius Astrologist Mona!
Mona: Yes, that's the perspective I'm talking about! You'll never meet another astrologist as clever and charming as me, ohohohoho!
Paimon: Yeah, everything about you's great, except for, um... please don't laugh like Fischl again... ever.
Mona: Ahem! Sorry... Heh, friends' habits rub off on you when you spend a lot of time together, don't they... haha... hah...
Mona: #I'll keep observing the stars. Keep in touch, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 2

Mona: ...When we set foot in this picture-perfect place, I never would've imagined we'd be dealing with such a mystifying occurrence.
Traveler: How do you feel about it?
Mona: Fine, I suppose. I could use some help though.
Paimon: What do you need us to do?
Mona: Um...
Mona: Uhh... nothing, actually.
Paimon: What? Are you underestimating us!?
Mona: No, I just realized that although you never talk much, you do so much for us all, quietly, in the background.
Mona: You're the companion everyone needs. I think we're all very relieved to have you here.
Mona: I know putting high expectations on you might give you some unwelcome pressure, but... I like to think an astrologist's observations can yield insights outside the night sky alone, and noticing other people's strengths is a kind of observation, too.
Paimon: So you just wanted to compliment us?
Mona: I was simply stating the facts, not complimenting anyone.
Traveler: Hmm, so you can't admit...
Paimon: ...that you're actually complimenting someone!
Mona: Stop smirking at me! I told you, it was an objective evaluation, not a compliment! Not a compliment!
Mona: #I'll keep observing the stars. Stay in touch, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 3

Paimon: What's happened here? Everything is broken...
Fischl: ...Alas, the loftier the clan, the more devastating the fall.
Mona: Broken into pieces, and not a single soul around... This must be the way things ended.
Xinyan: C'mon, let's get movin'.

## Talk 4

Listen: Kaedehara, that's you, right? Get on board, I'll get you out!
Kaedehara Kazuha: But... why are you helping me? I'm a wanted fugitive.
Listen: Obviously the Yashiro— Ahem! An anonymous financial sponsor wants you to get out safely.
Listen: But there's only so much they can do. After this, you'll be on your own.

## Talk 5

Kaedehara Kazuha: There was supposed to be a dead plant in that flowerpot. However, there was nothing there.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...While we were separated, I had a lot of time to reflect. I think I finally understand now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The mirage is... me. The empty flowerpot represents the state of my heart.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When the heart is clear, the world is too. And when the heart is unladen, the same is true.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Clear and unladen... that describes how I feel right now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Although, I would not say there are no regrets in this. To be unladen is also to be empty.
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's why this bonsai appeared as part of my mirage. It gave me a chance to fulfill my wishes.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I never realized that deep down in my heart, I also wanted to make my own bonsai... Perhaps this is what it really means to keep Kaedehara traditions alive.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Have you finished doing what you wanted to do, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, you could say that.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You saw my past self and said goodbye to him. Only when you witness my whole story does it become truly consigned to history.
Kaedehara Kazuha: What really matters in life is not how strict we are with ourselves, but the connections we make along the way. There's no future for those who linger on the past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So please believe me when I say that I've already come a long way, and I intend to go further still. I will always treasure your support.

## Talk 7

Mona: Hmm... I wonder what's really going on with my scryglass...
Mona: Leave all further observations to the expert! I'll inform you if anything comes up. Mm-hmm, nice working with you.

## Talk 8

Xinyan: Kazuha seems pretty chill, and Her Highness has Mona to watch out for her, so we don't need to worry too much.
Xinyan: #As for you, {NICKNAME}... you're rockin' it as always, just like I am!

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: "I wander like the autumn leaves that float to the mountains and seas afar."
Kaedehara Kazuha: Though I am still on my journey, my perspective has changed greatly since I first wrote that poem.

## Talk 10

Listen: Hey, buddy! You okay? Need a ride or something?
Listen: Heh, pirates?
Listen: Hah, you could call us that! So, you coming or not?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Kazuha! We found you!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Good timing. I was just reflecting on my life so far, and I think I'm all up to date.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So, what do you think of the Kaedehara Clan's bonsai?
Traveler: Looks like it carries lots of history.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Old things often carry around some form of regret. The Kaedehara Clan is no exception.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But that's okay. Partings produce reunions, if not at home then in a distant land.
Mona: This mirage is quite fascinating. It presents life like a stage play, with each scene more captivating than the last.
Kaedehara Kazuha: They say that astrologists have seen it all. So if this mirage intrigued you, that says it was a worthwhile encounter.
Fischl: Ahem... How fares thy mood?
Oz: Mein Fräulein inquires as to your present wellbeing, Lord Kazuha, hoping your heart is not too filled with sorrow.
Paimon: There's no way anyone could be cheerful after reliving all that...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, you have a point. Thank you all for your concern. Fortunately, all those things are past and gone now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When I first saw this bonsai, I thought of the possibility that... I needed to wait for you. Perhaps that was why I had to be here on my own.
Traveler: Things weren't perfect, but you have nothing to feel ashamed of.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed.

## Talk 12

Paimon: *yawn*... It's been a long trip today, Paimon's getting kinda sleepy...
Xinyan: Everyone must be exhausted. Let's call it a day.
Fischl: ...
Mona: Hmm? What's wrong? You don't look too good.
Fischl: Nothing. Perhaps today's arduous journey is making me feel slightly out of sorts.
Oz: ...
Oz: Mein Fräulein, are you alright?
Fischl: Oz, curb thy curiosity.
Oz: Yes, mein Fräulein.
Mona: ...?
Xinyan: I'll see if I can find something for us to eat. Go ahead and rest if you're feeling tired, but anyone who's up to it is welcome to help out.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'll help.
Mona: Me too.
Paimon: Everyone's volunteering to help! Maybe we should too!
Traveler: Count us in.
Xinyan: Whoa, hey, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but...
Xinyan: Her Highness looks kinda gloomy. Mona, you two seem close, why don't you keep her company for a while?
Mona: You noticed it too. I was going to bring it up with you while we were preparing the food. In that case, yes, just leave it to me.
Xinyan: Alright! We'll prepare the food!
Black Screen Text: Mona gives you a wink, then runs to stay with Fischl. Everyone else collects cooking ingredients...
Xinyan: Yup, this should be enough. We can grill these. Next time we pass by one of those abandoned campsites, I'll see if they have a cooking pot. We'd have some more variety then.
Paimon: Wow, that's such a nice idea! You might not be a chef, Xinyan, but you sure do know how to keep the diners happy.
Xinyan: Aw shucks, Paimon. It's no big deal, just doing what I can!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the crew mates of The Alcor consider Xinyan someone they can rely on.
Paimon: We feel the same way about you, too, Kazuha!
Xinyan: Hahaha, we sure do.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... Well then, as a trusted friend, I have something I'd like to talk about.
Kaedehara Kazuha: From what you've been saying, that miraculous mirage seems to have been based on my life story to date.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...It felt just like a dream to me.
Traveler: Maybe that's it. Maybe it represented your dreams.
Xinyan: In other words... you've always wanted to make your own bonsai, right?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Could that be it...? All that was a means of granting me something I wished for?
Kaedehara Kazuha: And since this happened to me, does that mean it could happen to everyone else, too?
Traveler: Yes, I think so.
Xinyan: I agree. But I wonder whose mirage we'll encounter next?
Xinyan: Hah, I'm actually kinda looking forward to my own mirage, if it's a dream come true like you say.
Paimon: Wait, you actually want something like this to happen with you, too?
Xinyan: Aw heck, any mirage to do with me would probably be music-related. Hahaha, it'd be a good chance to showcase a few tunes!
Paimon: You mean you'd wanna do a performance in there!?
Xinyan: Why not? I don't think any self-respecting musician could stay silent on these islands. Just look at this place!
Paimon: So much confidence and optimism! Xinyan rocks...
Paimon: #Oh, uh, {NICKNAME}! Paimon wants to try some of the fruit growing on that cliff over there. Let's go pick some!
Traveler: (Oh? Is this about...)
Traveler: Carry on without us, I need a moment with Paimon.

## Talk 13

Paimon: So, those strange houses today, huh... And a... a mirage-bonsai? Basically, lots of weird stuff today! Do you think we should tell Venti about it?
Traveler: I thought you were gonna ask me that.
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco! Dodoco!
Paimon: There's no answer... That's weird, why is he ignoring us?
Traveler: This doesn't seem like him...
Paimon: Maybe he got distracted? Or he forgot to bring the bomb to his performance? Or maybe he got drunk and fell asleep under that huge tree...
Paimon: Hmm... maybe we should try contacting him tomorrow.
Mona: Traveler, Paimon. So here you are.
Paimon: Mona! Are you all done chatting with Fischl?
Mona: Hahaha, close enough... She was a little downcast. I think it has something to do with the mirage we saw today.
Mona: Fischl has been very excited about this trip from the start... but I have a feeling she doesn't want to see her own mirage...
Paimon: Why? It seems like this'd be the kind of thing she really enjoys.
Mona: ...I'm not sure at this stage, but I'll keep an eye on her.
Mona: There's something else I wanted to tell you. I tried performing a divination again on the beach.
Mona: My scryglass was still blurry, but I felt a force coming from within. I couldn't see its exact position, but I knew that it was changing.
Paimon: How could you tell that if you couldn't see it clearly?
Mona: Hmm, how can I explain this concept to non-experts... Oh, I know! It's like we're sitting in a room and there's a crack in the walls. We don't know where it is, but everyone can feel the wind rushing in.
Mona: Not only that, but the room is getting colder.
Paimon: Ohh! Paimon gets it now! So you wanna find where that crack is, right?
Mona: You could say that. I need to see the crack first before deciding what to do next.
Traveler: Let's give him a call.
