Traveler: So, who's getting the credit?
Kaji: Ha! You think the Shogunate would believe that the two of us took care of the Tatarigami by ourselves?
Kaji: All they'll do is credit this whole thing to Her Excellency and sing songs about it in Tenshukaku...
Kaji: Well, whatever the case, as long as the war's over, anything goes! Let's not talk about that anymore!
Kaji: Not like I care about it anyway. Us workers from the mines just see it as helping others. Them city people wouldn't get it.
