Traveler: So, about those tax records...
Dongsheng: Isn't it... Huixin from the Yuehai Pavilion? I remember you.
Dongsheng: I told you that all of my transactions are included in the records. My tax declarations are scrupulous, as well.
Dongsheng: I do hope that my business won't be affected by any groundless accusations.
Ganyu: Groundless accusations? Mr. Dongsheng, you seem very sure of yourself.
Ganyu: But I sincerely advise that you cease this behavior immediately. It is liable to affect the fine you'll need to pay in the end.
Dongsheng: Ah... No, no, I'm an honest merchant. I would never get involved with any fraudulent sources of profit.
Traveler: You've got no shame.
Ganyu: Haven't I made myself clear? Mr. Dongsheng, you've already been proven guilty of tax evasion. I just came here to see if you'd confess.
Dongsheng: What? P—Proven guilty? H—How come? That's impossible. Absolutely absurd!
Paimon: He's talking without rhyme or reason. Must be crumbling under Ganyu's pressure.
Paimon: Time for the finishing blow!
Huixin: Mr. Dongsheng, can you tell me what this is?
Dongsheng: I... It... It's an invoice from Fanmu Carpenter's!
Dongsheng: I... I'm... Master Lu, he... I didn't...
Huixin: Do you admit to tax evasion? This transaction was absent from the tax record.
Dongsheng: *sigh* I didn't think you'd find out. I didn't leave a single trace.
Ganyu: Indeed, we wouldn't have found out if it weren't for Mr. Bolai's aid.
Dongsheng: Bolai? That imp from Wanyou Boutique... So he told on me behind my back!
Dongsheng: Hmph, he's got his own share of dirty laundry...
Ganyu: Oh? Mr. Dongsheng, I'd like to hear a little more about this "dirty laundry." Would you care to elaborate?
Ganyu: I don't think you'll need my guidance for what comes next.
Huixin: Yes, thank you, Ms. Ganyu! I can take it from here.
Ganyu: Hehe. That's good.
Huixin: *sigh* I must say, you're truly impressive, Ms. Ganyu.
Huixin: "Your enemy knows you best."
Huixin: To think — you came up with this plan and executed it so masterfully.
Ganyu: Hehe. It's actually one of your father's — the Tianshu's — old tricks. I just took some inspiration from it.
Huixin: M—My father!
Ganyu: Pitting your opponent against their enemies and watching them drag each other down from an advantageous position.
Ganyu: That's how Uncle Tian managed to keep his position in the Qixing secure for so many years.
Ganyu: I figured that as Uncle Tian's daughter, you'd naturally grasp your father's strategies.
Ganyu: So I decided to use one of your father's tricks and play it out for you to see.
Huixin: *sigh* I can see it now... Clearly, I still have a lot to learn about my father.
Huixin: I'm really grateful, Ms. Ganyu! Heh, you're the kindest mentor I've ever had! Thank you!
Paimon: Ganyu's solved both Huixin's work and family problems. Two birds with one stone!
Huixin: Oh, you've helped me so much. You must... You must allow me to repay your kindness...
Ganyu: Ah, that's not necessary. No need to be so serious. It was nothing, really.
Huixin: Then... let me treat you to a meal, hmm? The Traveler and Paimon are invited as well. I appreciate your help!
Paimon: Alright! Come on, Ganyu, just say yes! Let's eat!
Traveler: Paimon, don't forget your manners.
Paimon: Oh, come on, it's just a meal!
Ganyu: If it's just a meal... there's no reason for me to decline. It'll be my pleasure, Huixin.
Paimon: Hee-hee!
Huixin: Actually, I've already booked Xinyue Kiosk. I need a moment to prepare everything first. Let's meet there in a while!
Ganyu: Hmm, alright. We dare not refuse such generosity.
Traveler: Let's wait for Ganyu's decision.
Traveler: Not so confident now, are you?

Traveler: Well, let's hear it.
Dongsheng: I used to be an adventurer who visited every corner of the world.
Dongsheng: But the good times couldn't last. I got into an accident in Dihua Marsh, and was seriously injured.
Dongsheng: Fortunately, a masked adeptus came to my rescue, and I was barely able to escape with my life.
Dongsheng: From that day on, I never ventured out again. This life was given to me by that adeptus. I can't just throw it away that easily.
Dongsheng: An ancient adage of Liyue says that "a withered tree lives again," referring to life being given anew — which fits my experience exactly.
Dongsheng: That's why I adapted the last part of that saying and made it the name of my shop, to commemorate that event.
