## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Seems like it's worth "investigating"...
Paimon: That note on the box sounds... terrifying!
Paimon: Why would something so obviously dangerous be left right by Cider Lake? Could it belong to those two knights over there?
Paimon: It looks like there's a wide gap between the planks! We should be able to see inside!
Paimon: Let Paimon have a look... It appears to be filled with... lots of round, red objects, much larger than Sunsettias...
Paimon: Waitasec, could they be... bombs!?
Paimon: Why would the Knights of Favonius leave a box of explosives by the lake? Are they planning to blow up... those invasive fish that Lisa mentioned?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Haha! Explosives! My kind of fun!
Paimon: Why are you suddenly so excited? We don't even know how powerful these explosives are! What if we hurt innocent bystanders?
Traveler: Blasting fish is blasting fish, just toss 'em into the lake.
Paimon: Eek!
Paimon: But when you put it like that... Paimon really does want to try...
Paimon: Normally we're always hearing about how Klee wants to blast fish, is blasting fish, or is getting punished for doing it...
Paimon: But now that Paimon is here, by the lakeside, with a box of explosives beside her... Paimon really wants to try it, too!
Paimon: Throwing just one should be... no big deal, right?
Traveler: One for each of us!
Black Screen Text: Together with Paimon, you open the suspicious wooden box and each take out a bomb. After studying how to ignite the fuses, both of you count down "3, 2, 1" and set the detonators, and both of you throw the bombs far into Cider Lake...
Black Screen Text: A low rumble comes from underwater, and two giant spouts of water explode from the surface of the lake, sending a few Anglers spinning high into the sky...
You and Paimon give each other a high-five with big smiles on your faces, and get ready to high-tail it out of there...
Black Screen Text: But "Operation Impulsively Secretly Blast Fish" did not go as swimmingly as it appeared. Almost as soon as the bombs exploded, you were exposed...
Phonia: Aaaaaaahhhhh!
Phonia: My ears!!!
Ematol: That scared me half to death! How are you, Phonia, are you okay?
Phonia: A sudden underwater explosion... It almost deafened me! Judging by the sonic signature of that explosion... It must have been one of your bombs, Ematol!
Ematol: Ha? Really? Have I not been standing obendiently by your side this whole time, doing nothing? Do I look like I have bombs in my hands?
Phonia: You! You must've set timed bombs into the lake beforehand, just to see me in this awful state!
Ematol: If that were true, then shouldn't I also have set up Kameras to capture the sight of you holding your head crying on the ground like a baby? Would be a great shame not to have such photos for posterity!
Phonia: You! Don't expect any discount from me for your next month's rent! And the water bill, furniture, and all that food you mooched... I let it all slide before, but now it's time to pay up!
Ematol: Wait, wait, wait, no, no! I shouldn't have laughed! Phonia, my dearest sister, even if I was responsible for the last few dozen pranks... It really wasn't me this time! I swear!
Ematol: If I really could make... timed detonators that were extremely reliable despite staying submerged for a long time...
Ematol: We wouldn't have needed to risk our lives to manually detonate the bombs when we ambushed the Hilichurls last time, would we?
Phonia: ...Right. You're too simple-minded to use timed fuses to pull a prank on me.
Ematol: You!
Ematol: You tricked me, too! Didn't you say that any loud noises would damage your hearing while you're using that detection equipment?
Ematol: Since you seem to have no difficulties arguing, you don't seem to have gone deaf!
Phonia: You don't get it! Hearing damage is accumulative and only manifests in stages! By shouting and talking back at me so loudly right now, you're increasing the damage!
Phonia: Maybe one day, I won't be able to distinguish the signature patterns of soundwaves anymore! And then I'd lose my job!
Phonia: And then, you won't have a place to stay either, because I would have to rent the whole house to someone who can afford higher rent! And then... then ... I'll become a fisherwoman! Anyway, I won't take of you, that's for sure!
Ematol: Then... Then I'll argue with you more quietly... I'll keep it quiet...
Ematol: ...
Phonia: ...
Paimon: Paimon can't make out what they're saying... All they care about is arguing with each other.
Traveler: Yeah! That was super fun!
Paimon: It was really fun! Maybe if we just toss one more...
Paimon: No, no! Once was enough. If we throw any more, those two will definitely come to investigate. We can't get caught!
Paimon: Though it feels like we caused... a mess, but not an overly large one, at least Paimon's curiosity has been completely satisfied!
Traveler: And nothing too bad happened!
Traveler: Now, give it all you've got!
Traveler: Don't you want to know what it's like to chuck some bombs?

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Whoa! So scary! Let's get out of here!
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! A whole box of bombs! We should get as far away from something that dangerous as we can!

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Whoa! It's so scary! Let's run!
Paimon: Even you think it's dangerous!? Does that mean that this box is oozing murderous intent... Let's get out of here!
