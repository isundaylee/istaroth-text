# Latecoming Homecoming


## Talk 1

Traveler: Just a while more...
Giustino: Of course, no trouble at all.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Let's go.

## Talk 3

Giulietta (???): Do you two happen to be heading to sea as well? If so, please, could I trouble you to bring me along to Bayda Harbor?
Traveler: My Waverider's pretty small...
Giulietta (???): Ah, I see... Oh dear, this is going to be a toughie...
Paimon: Well, if it's really urgent, we could still help...
Giulietta: Oh! What kind souls you are! In any case, my name's Giulietta, and I sell instruments.
Giulietta: Not long ago, I inked an order with some outlander gentlemen for a batch of materials from them. I mean, even the greatest artisan wouldn't be able to fashion an instrument from nothing!
Giulietta: According to the contract, the payment must be made within these two days at Bayda Harbor. But I overslept and missed the last boat...
Giulietta: *sigh* It might be the nightmares I've been having lately, but I couldn't sleep well... It is my fault, of course, but right now, I need to get to Bayda Harbor.
Giulietta: So if you'd be willing to help, I'd be immensely grateful. Three times the going rate — that's what I'll pay.
Paimon: Th—Three times!?
Traveler: You sure are generous, huh?
Giulietta: Well, it's a matter of trust and reputation. This is life and death for us businesspeople.
Paimon: W—Well, sure seems that way...
Traveler: Sorry, but I don't intend to go out to sea right now.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Well, what are you waiting for? Get onboard, sailor!
Giulietta: #Thank you so much, good sir!

## Talk 5

Traveler: Hold on, I have some things to handle first...
Giulietta: Alright, but do hurry. Time waits for no one...

## Talk 6

Traveler: Alright, get onboard.
Giulietta: In that case, let us not delay. To Bayda Harbor we go!

## Talk 7

Traveler: You'll have to wait a while longer, I have something that needs doing.
Giulietta: *sigh* Alright. But do come back as soon as you can — we have an agreement, don't we?

## Talk 8

Giulietta: Ah, you're back. Glorious! We can go now, can we not?

## Talk 9

Giulietta: Yes! We're here!
Giulietta: Thank you both so much! Now I can deliver the payment as promised — we can't have our outlander friends viewing us Fontainians as fickle folk who flip on their agreements.
Giulietta: Well then, here's the payment, as promised!
Paimon: Hehe, shiny, shiny Mora. As long as there's some to be had, we can do business!
Paimon: #That said, Traveler, since we're here already, why don't we have a look around? Even if we were to go back to Petrichor now...
Giustino (???): Hmm? Did you two come from Petrichor by any chance?
Paimon: Hey! Don't just talk to people from behind like that! You gave Paimon a fright!
Giustino (???): Oh, did I startle you? My apologies, truly. I simply could not contain myself upon hearing my hometown's name...
Paimon: Did you really have to get this excited, though?
Giustino (???): Well... I left home when I was young, and I haven't been back since. Ten years flew by while I did business in Sumeru. Ten years without word from home...
Giustino: Well, since you've come from there, could you tell me how things have been going? ... Right, I forgot to introduce myself. Just call me Giustino.
Paimon: #Hello there, Giustino. Paimon's name's Paimon, and this is Traveler. And you've come to the right people — we have a "deep" understanding of Petrichor, after all!
Paimon: (Hmm, wouldn't he think we're crazy if we told him that we followed a cat and wound up disrupting an ancient plot and resolving the crisis in his hometown, though?)
Traveler: (Well, those things did happen, but...)
Paimon: Uh, Petrichor's doing great! How great, you ask? As great as before, that's how!
Giustino: Really? Just as before, then? That's good, that's good...
Paimon: Speaking of which, wouldn't it be better for you to go, since you're a local, rather than rely on us outsiders?
Giustino: You speak reason! I should, yes. I did not bat an eyelid when I left it all behind back then, yet now I shrink back from my desire to return.
Giustino: How strange. My courage fails me as I grow older...
Giustino: If I hadn't found this flute in my baggage while packing...
Agent (???): ...
Giustino: When I left home, I had nothing with me but this flute. In truth, my family disapproved of my departure, and my father snuck the instrument out to me at the last minute.
Giustino: Haha, good times, though. Not a Mora to my name, but with the flute's melodic strains flowing free, a fire in my belly, and a dream, it was like the whole world was mine for the seizing.
Giustino: Later, I would make lots of friends in Sumeru, and my business would grow. *sigh* If only I could have written them a letter, but I had all but forgotten my family and home...
Giustino: Ahem... Anyway, if I may make such a request, would you be willing to take me with you when you return to Petrichor?
Traveler: So, you gonna pay us triple, too?
Giustino: Triple!?
Paimon: That's right! The lady we just ferried over had urgent business to attend to, so she paid us triple for the ride!
Giustino: Well... I should have enough for that. Alright, I'll pay you triple too. "Strike while the iron is hot," as they say — since I've decided to return home, any delay will be detrimental.
Paimon: Well, we're not exactly professional boatmen or anything... But hehe, such premiums are tough to refuse!
Traveler: (It would sound like pure nonsense...)

## Talk 10

Traveler: My Waverider's a fast and steady boat. Hop onboard, and we'll be off.
Giustino: Thank you.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Could you wait for a moment?
Giustino: Of course. No worries.

## Talk 12

Giustino: Shall we head out now?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
Loredan: Huh? A Fontainian wearing clothes from Sumeru? Sorry, I was a bit busy thinking about my composition, so I didn't notice.
Paimon: #Hmm, alright then... Guess we should ask elsewhere, Traveler.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
Contarini: I've not seen any such person. Has something happened? If there's an emergency case that requires the Special Patrol's services...
Paimon: Well, it's not anything urgent, really... Anyway, we'll be looking elsewhere!

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation...
Giovanni: So this fellow you're looking for is named "Giustino," and he claims to be from Petrichor?
Paimon: That's right! Have you seen him? Wait — were you two acquainted from before?
Giovanni: Just acquainted? Hah!
Giovanni: Still, even if I recognize him, I wonder if he still recognizes his little brother. So many years away, and not a letter sent back. Why, I've already had a tombstone erected for him behind the town!
Giovanni: And now he's back... and he hasn't paid his boat fare? Disgraceful.
Traveler: Disgraceful indeed.
Paimon: W—Wait, but we're... the victims here, aren't we? And if Giustino really did faint from discomfort somewhere...
Giovanni: *sigh* Fine, I'll go search together with you. I'm a local, so I know our surroundings better. Also, I have some idea as to where he'll be.
Traveler: We shouldn't comment too much as outsiders...

### Additional Talk 4

Agent: Huh? Are you pulling my leg? "I'm sorry, but I really don't remember"?
Agent: Don't you know what this uniform means? Doesn't it remind you of anything?
Giustino: O—Of course I know what you do, but I'm debt-free! Or I should be... unless a friend took a loan in my name...
Agent: A friend? Who cares about those excuses? I only recognize what's written here on the contract in black and white — and it's my duty to make violators pay up.
Agent: This is my first job, you know! I wanted to be worthy of this uniform, so I showed up at the specified location three days in advance! Three days!
Agent: I spent them thinking about the excuses you'd make to get out of paying, and how I'd respond...
Agent: And then you just upped and ran! All that effort I put in, wasted! Now, I've no choice but to go by the book and...
Agent: Teach you a lesson first, and then bring you back to report!
Giustino: No! I don't want to leave Petrichor anymore! H—Help me!
Giovanni: Stop it! Does any amount of money owed warrant such cruel treatment!?
Giovanni: #Please, Traveler! Don't let him hurt Giustino! Only you can stop him now!

### Additional Talk 5

Agent: H—Hired help!? Seriously, would you rather pay through the nose for a powerful bodyguard than just follow a contract? I'll... never understand you merchants...
Traveler: No, I just couldn't control myself after seeing your uniform...
Agent: ...Huh!?
Paimon: ...But y'know, if he's in this much debt, it seems unlikely that we'll get paid at all...
Giustino: No, I... still have enough for the boat fare. I counted — I should be fine on that front.
Giovanni: Then what about the contract and debt he speaks of? Is that, perchance, the "souvenir" you're giving us after more than ten years?
Giustino: How could you say that, Giovanni? I really don't know a thing about the contract he's talking about! *sigh* I don't know what to say to make you believe me, though.
Agent: Heh. The handbook says that people will lie and do all they can to wriggle out of debt, but the contract is clearly written — don't you even try.
Agent: You still owe us payment for ten crates of materials to make those blasted flutes of yours...
Giustino: ...Wait, what did you say? Flutes?
Agent: ...Are you still sticking to the pretense even now, "Participazia"? ... Grr, you Fontainians sure have names that are annoying to pronounce...
Giustino: Sorry... but who's that? My name is Giustino. Giustino Pasquale...
Agent: ...?
Agent: O—One moment! Let me see... Giu? Ju? Pas... Giulietta Participazia, from Petrichor...
Agent: Err. This seems to be... a woman?
Paimon: Uhh... Ah...
Traveler: Um...
Agent: W—Wait! If you're not that woman, then why were you going on about some "flute" back there at Bayda Harbor?
Giustino: ...I was talking about... this flute?
Giovanni: ...
Giustino: This is the flute my father gave me when I was about to leave home. He hoped that I would inherit the family business of instrument-making, but I...
Giustino: *sigh* Forget it.
Agent: Hold on. If this had nothing to do with you, then why did you run?
Giustino: "I'm sorry, but I really don't remember," I said that, didn't I? But you sounded so aggressive and looked so frightening. What was I going to do except run?
Agent: Well, this is my first job — one to remember! Of course I had to double my enthusiasm!
Traveler: To the point that you showed up three days in advance?
Paimon: You were way too anxious!
Agent: Ugh. Then where did that Giulietta Participazia go...
Paimon: Speaking of that, the lady we ferried over first works in the instrument business... Y'know, the one who was going to be late for a business transaction? Didn't she call herself "Giulietta"?
Agent: What? So she's in Bayda Harbor now? I have to find her as soon as possible...
Paimon: She seems to care a lot about credibility, so she probably wouldn't default...
Agent: You're going to get scammed if you hold onto such naive ideas. People lie — that's what the handbook says! Anyway, I've got to go find her, immediately!
Black Screen Text: The Agent departs...
Paimon: Seriously, where does he get the cheek to lecture Paimon based on that handbook of his!? He was the one who made a mistake...
Giovanni: What a farce... I see you're the same as ever, Big Brother. Always sucking people into whatever trouble you get into!
Giovanni: I don't know whether to laugh or be angry.
Giustino: I'm sorry, Giovanni.
Giovanni: And sorry for the trouble, you two, but this is no place for a chat. Let's find a spot where I can treat you to some snacks, and we'll talk.
Traveler: Well, it looks like your career's in dire straits now...
Traveler: Actually, I'm also here to collect a debt.
Paimon: That's right! He hasn't paid us our triple boat fare either!

### Additional Talk 6

Giovanni: Our town's a small place, and our desserts and tea are all quite ordinary, so they might not look like much to you who have traveled and seen much...
Giustino: Giovanni, why do you have to talk like this? My heart is made of flesh and blood, just as yours is. It, too, can be hurt.
Giovanni: Is that so? And here I thought that the heart of one who cares so little about their family would be made of immovable stone.
Giustino: I...
Paimon: (Well... Paimon didn't think it'd turn out like this... This is so awkward!)
Traveler: Stop arguing, you're going to spoil the taste of the snacks.
Paimon: A—Anyway, you brothers have been reunited after many years, so shouldn't you be happier about that...?
Giovanni: ...
Giustino: ...
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler, c'mon! Help talk some sense into 'em, would you?
Traveler: I envy you. At least you've been reunited.
Paimon: #Actually, Traveler's still searching for his missing sister...
Black Screen Text: You briefly explain the reason for your journey to the two brothers...
Giovanni: I see... It must be hard, to have to scour the world for your family — and you're so young, too.
Giustino: #I'm sure your sister has her reasons. I don't think she's forgotten you or has intentionally broken off contact. Please, don't hate her for it.
Traveler: Err... Thanks?
Giovanni: Ah. *sigh* To have been guided by a youth like you... We have truly shamed ourselves as elders.
Giovanni: We may have had our disagreements, but we are still brothers...
Giustino: Thank you... Giovanni.
Giovanni: Ah, but don't be so quick to thank me. It was you who voluntarily gave up the family business. Now, I am the legal heir to the Pasquale name, no matter how you...
Giustino: It's alright, Giovanni, I know what you mean. But of all the things I've lost, I regained the most precious of them — as for the rest, I don't need them.
Giovanni: Again, don't speak too soon. That novice debt collector wasn't talking out of his hat when he said that "people lie"!
Giustino: In that case, let us sign a contract — write a statement in black and white! Or perhaps, if some other means suits you better...
Giovanni: We don't have to go that far...
Giustino: Ah, it seems you're quite the same as you used to be. But I've changed. I'm not the man I was before. Let me work in your workshop.
Giustino: I shall be your assistant, just as you were mine when we were little.
Giovanni: Do your best, then. I'm not going easy on you just because you're my big brother.
Giustino: Of course. No worries.
Paimon: Well, so guess the two of you have made up now, eh?
Giustino: Yes. Thank you so much for your help. Why, I somehow feel as if the triple-price fare was hardly enough! It's just a shame I only have this much on me...
Giovanni: If you can sit yourself down and work hard in the workshop, repaying their kindness would be a simple matter.
Giustino: Hear that? Giovanni's going to take good care of me. If we should have the chance to meet again, I'll treat you two!
Traveler: Actually, never mind my problem. You two...
Traveler: There's no point butting into someone else's family matters.
Paimon: Well, that's true, but...
Traveler: If I'd known, I'd have gone with that Agent...

### Additional Talk 7

Giustino: ...
Paimon: Err, you don't look so good. You sure you're okay?
Giustino: I... I'm just a bit seasick. Ugh... Sorry! I—I'll just throw up over there for a bit. Be right back!
Paimon: Eh? Uh, sure, but don't forget to come back as soon as possible!
Black Screen Text: After a good long while...
Paimon: Wait, something's not right. Why isn't Giustino back yet?
Traveler: Did he vomit till he passed out?
Paimon: Eh!? That serious? But you were keeping the boat pretty steady... Or maybe it's because Paimon floats...
Paimon: Either way, we've gotta find him, and fast!
Traveler: Uh oh, is he trying to wiggle his way out of paying?
Paimon: Huh? Didn't he say he was a big-shot booming businessman, though? Was he fibbing?
