# The Samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Paimon remembers everything!
Nahida: ...Good, you adapted quickly this time.
Traveler: At the end of last night...
Paimon: We definitely took off our Akasha Terminals last night, but we still heard that beep. Why's that?
Traveler: We've been implanted with another form of the terminals?
Paimon: But now, we can at least confirm one thing: The Akasha definitely has something to do with whatever's trapping us in this cycle!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it... Why would the Akasha go this far if all it wants is everybody's wisdom?
Nahida: It's extremely difficult for lab rats in an experiment to understand why they're being treated the way they are.
Paimon: If we're lab rats, then what are you? Nahida, you've never told us anything about yourself...
Nahida: Hmm... I guess I'm the Moon.
Paimon: The Moon? Wasn't that the result of our divination?
Traveler: ...
Nahida: Anyway, knowing who I am won't help you get closer to the truth, so you should focus on other things. Don't get distracted and miss any clues~
Paimon: Okay then... Dehya helped us a lot yesterday, so let's go find her. If Paimon's reading the time correctly, those kidnappers should be showing up soon.
Traveler: We failed at severing our connections with them?

## Talk 3

Dehya: Ah, there you are. I've already taken care of those kidnappers. My lady, did you get hurt?
Traveler: Hold on, something's not right...
Paimon: Eh? Dehya!?
Dehya: What's wrong? Why are you both gawking at me like that?
Paimon: Y—You didn't get hurt this time!?
Dehya: Huh? What do you mean, "this time"? Why are you so surprised that I managed to get out unscathed? Those kids were amateurs.
Traveler: Aren't you still getting used to your new greatsword?
Dehya: Shhh... How did you know about my greatsword? I haven't told anyone about it. Please don't tell Miss Dunyarzad!
Paimon: So Dehya's lost her memories after all...
Traveler: During your battle...
Dehya: Anything strange...? You already know that I got a new greatsword. Hmm... if I had to say something, it's weird how such a new weapon could feel so familiar.
Dehya: It's as if... I've already used it to fight a countless number of battles.
Paimon: You're saying that although you don't remember using it, your body... feels like it does?
Dehya: That's right. Both mercenaries and warriors heavily rely on muscle memory. Only knowing the theory of battle won't get you anywhere.
Paimon: Traveler, what do you think?
Traveler: Could it be because we removed our Akasha Terminals?
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon's feeling really hopeful!
Traveler: Is it possible that... we have already broken free?
Paimon: Ooh, you're right! Earlier in the samsara, something like this would've never happened.
Traveler: We'll know for sure at the end of the day.
Dehya: I have no clue what you two are talking about, but it's still dangerous here, so—
Paimon: So you want us to take Dunyarzad somewhere else to rest while you check if there are still more kidnappers around. Right?
Dehya: How did you know what I was gonna say...? Can you read minds?
Paimon: Forget it, go and do your thing.
Traveler: This has never happened before...
Traveler: Did anything feel strange?
Traveler: Your unfamiliarity usually lands you some scratches.

## Talk 4

Paimon: ...Phew, it's finally nighttime. Aside from Dehya not getting injured, everything seems to have stayed the same.
Paimon: Listen, Nahida! We found out that Dehya got out just fine today, even though she got injured every other time she fought the kidnappers.
Paimon: Do you think the samsara has been broken? Have we saved Dunyarzad?
Nahida: Really? Good job on all that progress. Get some good sleep tonight.
Paimon: Hey, what kind of an answer is that?
Nahida: "Tomorrow will come." Everyone assumes this as common knowledge, but the only way you can know that for sure is if you experience tomorrow.
Nahida: How many "today"s has it been? Is it possible that "today" will be followed by "yesterday"? Does "tomorrow" truly exist as anything beyond a made-up concept?
Nahida: It's even possible that this entire world is a lie, and the history of the whole world has just been one endless Sabzeruz Festival.
Paimon: Okay, okay, no more! Paimon's brain has already shut down!
Nahida: Hehe... That's why it makes no sense to waste your energy thinking about things you will learn tomorrow.
Nahida: Get some good rest! Ya know... Use the bathroom and flush your anxiety dookie away~
Paimon: Huh? Hold on, what did you just say? Did Paimon hear you correctly?
Nahida: Hm? People always say they feel a sense of relief after they take a dook-dook. That's why I suggested you could try that. Is that so strange?
Paimon: Ugh... It's so strange and so against common sense that Paimon is at a loss for words... You were sounding kinda smart just a minute ago!
Traveler: ...We're going to go get some rest.
Paimon: Yeah... Even though it's happy and lively at the Sabzeruz Festival every day, it feels like it's been a long time since we've really gotten to relax. Let's go back to our room.
Paimon: *beep*
Azar: Continue the harvest. Compared to what we stand to achieve, these sacrifices are trivial.

## Talk 5

Kimiya: This is divine wisdom...
