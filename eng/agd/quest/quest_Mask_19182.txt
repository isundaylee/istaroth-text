## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Investigation Notes: (There are newspaper clippings in amongst the notes. They're about shows of different styles. Those on the first few pages have turned yellow, which means they must be quite old.)
Traveler: [Investigation] (Look for mentions of Merieux.)

### Additional Talk 2

Investigation Notes: (Skimming through the early newspaper clippings, none of the headlines mention Director Merieux...)
Investigation Notes: (In more recent years, there are many reports praising Merieux as a forward-thinking director, one of the greats of his era...)

### Additional Talk 3

Investigation Notes: (Merieux's name does appear in some earlier clippings, but mostly in articles bemoaning "A Series of Lukewarm Receptions for an Experimental Art Form" and "Empty Seats at Avant-Garde Play Despite Critical Acclaim"...)
Investigation Notes: (In more recent years, there are many reports praising Merieux as a forward-thinking director, one of the greats of his era...)
Investigation Notes: (The articles are written by a variety of authors from an eclectic range of fields. Corentin and Amaury are the most prolific authors.)

### Additional Talk 4

Investigate Old Drafts: (These scripts seem to be Merieux's older works. Some photographs of the live performances are attached.)
Traveler: [Investigation] (Skim through...)

### Additional Talk 5

Investigate Old Drafts: (The photos from recent years show fancy venues and polished sets, but the earlier photos show much humbler venues.)
Investigate Old Drafts: (The cast list shows that in recent years, Merieux has collaborated with many famous celebrities, but their acting chops are disputed... And Maloney is listed as an investor.)

### Additional Talk 6

Investigate Old Drafts: (The photos from recent years show fancy venues and polished sets, but the earlier photos show much humbler venues.)
Investigate Old Drafts: (I don't see anything else noteworthy.)

### Additional Talk 7

Investigate Official Script: (The official script for The Lost Puppet details how the dancing puppet protagonist is rejected by humanity and then begins searching for the meaning of life...)
Traveler: [Investigation] (Read carefully...)

### Additional Talk 8

Investigate Official Script: (After a quick read through the script, I understand the gist of the story.)

### Additional Talk 9

Investigate Official Script: (In Act IV, the protagonist loses the ability to dance due to wear-and-tear in her circuitry. There's a note saying: "Some cursory movements to get the point across will suffice. The audience's focus will be on the fancy set and the extras.")

### Additional Talk 10

Investigate Original Script: (Let's see what differences there are between the current version of The Lost Puppet and the original script.)
Traveler: [Investigation] (Read carefully...)

### Additional Talk 11

Investigate Original Script: (After a quick read through the script, I understand the gist of the story.)

### Additional Talk 12

Investigate Original Script: (Act IV seems to be a solo performance by the protagonist, and the set is just some decrepit ruins. There's a note saying: "This will focus the audience's attention on the solo performer.")

### Additional Talk 13

Investigate Manuscript: (Merieux's original script is littered with amendments. It's practically illegible.)
Traveler: [Investigation] (Read carefully...)

### Additional Talk 14

Investigate Manuscript: (The reason it's so hard to read is that it's been edited with correction fluid multiple times. I'd estimate that each line was rewritten at least three times... Looks like Merieux wasn't happy with his edits.)

### Additional Talk 15

Investigate Manuscript: (...Nope, I can't read this at all.)

### Additional Talk 16

Jaiques: ...Do you think this move needs jazzing up a little?
Cyril: Not jazzing up, per se. I was thinking more, like... break it down, you know?

### Additional Talk 17

Gillian: Ginna? ...You snuck in? When? ...I thought I told you, no visiting me at work...
Ginna: I'm sorry, Gillian... But I had to come...

### Additional Talk 18

Jaiques: I wonder what got into Director Merieux...
Gillian: Maybe he's been quietly struggling with something...

### Additional Talk 19

Gillian: ...That's strange. I could have sworn I heard a voice just now...

### Additional Talk 21

Observe Crowd: (People are analyzing Merieux's techniques from a classical perspective...)

### Additional Talk 22

Observe Crowd: (Everyone is debating the performance of each actor...)

### Additional Talk 23
