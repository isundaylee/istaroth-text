# Talk Dialog

Yelan: There are real people and real events out there that are more incredible than anything you'll find in fiction. Shame no one'll ever be allowed to write a book about it.
Yelan: Curious? What if I told you that the things I'm referring to... no one'll ever be allowed to talk about, either?
Yelan: Hehe... Okay, we can chat about something that isn't top-secret information if you want... But we'll still have to go somewhere a little more private.
