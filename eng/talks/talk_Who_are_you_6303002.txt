# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Aratani: Oh, me? I work at Yae Publishing House. I'm in charge of the planning and promotion of all our projects.
Aratani: Take the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest, for example. It was I who proposed, organized, and set it up.
Aratani: My boss Hiratsuka didn't approve of that originally. Not sure if it was because he was too much of a stick in the mud or just didn't want to do more work...
Aratani: Thankfully, I pushed harder and promised that I would complete all of the work myself. Only then did the contest become a thing in the end.
Aratani: I mean, just look! Hasn't "This Novel Is Amazing!" become our most important project now? Every light novel reader pays rapt attention to the result of the contest â€” all thanks to me!
Aratani: Actually, I have been planning for some new project recently. Just you wait and see.
