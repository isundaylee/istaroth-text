# Delicious Sakura Shrimp Crackers

Crispy, crunchy crackers. The lovely hue of the Sakura Bloom is perfectly preserved, as is the elegant flowing shape of the Shrimp. Before you even put it in your mouth, you can already taste the fresh fragrance rushing up your nose. The crispy, refreshing flavor spreads throughout your mouth as you chew, with every bite showing off more of the mingled wonders of sakura and sea.
