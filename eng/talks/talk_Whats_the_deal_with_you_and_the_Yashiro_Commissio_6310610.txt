Traveler: What's the deal with you and the Yashiro Commission again?
Kano Nana: Specifically, you're asking why a ninja from the Yashiro Commission would need a shrine maiden to look after her, right?
Kano Nana: This is because the Yashiro Commission is in charge of the religious and ceremonial affairs as well as other cultural matters in Inazuma. Therefore, the shrine maidens of the Grand Narukami Shrine must also follow the orders of the Yashiro Commission.
Kano Nana: Though I suppose a ninja like Sayu who likes to slack off and needs a specific person to look after her is something of an exception...
Kano Nana: They say that the big tail on her outfit has lots of ninjutsu items hidden inside, which can help her hide... Alas, that's a big headache for anyone who is in charge of looking for her, like me.
Kano Nana: Please help me look out for her while you are out traveling. Please!
