Traveler: Is that how it is...
Adelinde: Haha, you're overthinking things, that's just nonsense.
Adelinde: ...Ah, yes. How's your appetite been recently?
Adelinde: I made some extra steaks today. If you're not picky, please take them.
Adelinde: Like I said, don't overthink it. These are perfectly normal animal steaks. There's nothing wrong with them at all... *chuckles*
