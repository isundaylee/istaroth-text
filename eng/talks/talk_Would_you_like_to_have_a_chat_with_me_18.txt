Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Xiangling: Absolutely! Service isn't for a while yet, so there's nothing on the stove.

Xiangling: Oh â€” and...
Xiangling: ...It's really nothing to do with rare ingredients, secret recipes, or anything like that.
Xiangling: I just use my own methods and try to bring out the best in every ingredient! Certainly seems to satisfy my customers.

Traveler: You mean when new concepts don't sell?
