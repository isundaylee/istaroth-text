Tsarevich: Who are you?
Tsarevich: You've never heard the name Tsarevich before? Tsk... I would say I'm surprised, but you are an ignorant country bumpkin after all.
Tsarevich: I'm a very well-known merchant from Snezhnaya. I do business all over the seven nations. Mondstadt has proven to be the most eye-opening place for me... but don't get the wrong idea. I could not have imagined somewhere so abysmal without seeing it for myself.
Tsarevich: People here are so simple-minded, no business sense at all. If you gave me a week, I could raze this whole economic system to the ground.
Tsarevich: Then again, I don't know what I was expecting. If people here knew the first thing about business, this place obviously wouldn't be in the sorry state it is today.
Tsarevich: Why don't you and your minions go?
Tsarevich: Are you joking? Someone like me, getting down and dirty with the monsters? Fat chance.
Tsarevich: And my subordinates are under no obligation to make up for the knights' incompetence. They don't work for free. Are the Knights of Favonius going to cover my extra costs?
Tsarevich: They're a fickle lot. They're always making things difficult for me getting into the city, too. So now they want to take advantage of me, huh? Dream on!
