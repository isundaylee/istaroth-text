Traveler: Petrichor?
Anaka: Petrichor's on the other side of this sea, and it's a town full of "music." I'd so love to go there, even if it was only in my dreams.
Anaka: Daddy took the boat over to that town, and Uncle Giustino also took a boat to come over here.
Anaka: I'm the only one bumming about here. Gah, it's so boring...
Anaka: Uncle Giustino's told me that kids in Fontaine can ride an aquabus and even listen to music beneath the waves. Is it true?
