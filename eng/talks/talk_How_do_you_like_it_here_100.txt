Traveler: How do you like it here?
Faruzan: I'm quite comfortable. Don't worry, I'm not one of those crabby old geezers who love to find fault with everything... I'm usually quite easy to please...
Faruzan: Hmm? Don't you believe me?
Faruzan: Maybe I do nitpick every once in a while... but only with disrespectful students. Or those nonsensical rules at the Akademiya.
Faruzan: You're very agreeable, and the scenery here is quite lovely, so why wouldn't I like it here?
Traveler: Glad to hear it.
Faruzan: Haha, one does not run into youngsters as kind and considerate as yourself nowadays.
Faruzan: Let's say, hypothetically, I were to discover some design flaws after staying here for some time... you wouldn't mind if I shared them with you, would you?
Traveler: Sure! No problem.
Faruzan: Good, good. It seems like I'll be able to research my interests here to my heart's content after all.
Faruzan: Even if it ends up taking me another hundred years... Hehe, I will be quite content here.
Traveler: Do you need anything else?
Faruzan: Hmm... Could you get me some pens and paper?
Faruzan: When I arrived in this realm for the first time, I was very surprised indeed by the unique configuration.
Faruzan: Just what kind of mechanism allows all of this to be ensconced in a single teapot... I need to do some research...
Faruzan: But it wouldn't be polite to leave you with piles of notes everywhere...
