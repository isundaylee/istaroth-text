Traveler: You're still calling yourself Stanley.
Stanley: So you already know about the fact that Stanley was actually my friend. You must have heard the truth at the bottom of my bottle, I suppose.
Stanley: ...I do remember that I did meet you — and someone else to boot — while drunk one day...
Stanley: Hmm, I can't quite remember why, but I've felt much more relaxed ever since then.
Stanley: I only call myself Stanley today in order to ensure that his tales will remain on everyone's lips.
Stanley: Haha, I imagine that if this were me from before, being exposed like this would have frustrated me for sure...
