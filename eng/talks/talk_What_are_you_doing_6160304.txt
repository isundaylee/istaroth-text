Unknown Role (None): What are you doing?
Bruce: I was just having a sleep— Uh... a sweep!
Bruce: ...I was doing a sweep— sweeping survey of all the, uh, safety blind spots in Mondstadt! Mm-hmm!
Bruce: Slacking off? No! By no means, not me! Never! Perish the thought!
Traveler: What a peculiar knight...
Bruce: ...*sigh* Look at me, making a fool of myself.
Bruce: In any case, you can't say peace prevails in Mondstadt unless you've got a freeloading — sorry, I meant free-spirited — knight to show for it...
Bruce: I'm sure my life would have been more interesting if I'd gone with the Adventurers' Guild instead...
Traveler: ...What makes you say that?
Bruce: Just think. As an adventurer, you'd get to go explore wherever you wanted, literally anywhere in the seven nations of Teyvat...
Bruce: And best of all, you can make a living from it! What could be more fun than that?
Traveler: It does sound like a good deal.
Bruce: Exactly! I also feel like the Knights have too serious an air about them for my liking...
Bruce: By comparison, the Adventurers' Guild doesn't have so many annoying rules, and has a lot of interesting people!
Bruce: For example, there's Fischl. I don't always understand everything she says, but it sounds really cool!
Bruce: If only I had joined the Adventurers' Guild back then, I might even be her partner right now...
Bruce: I've even thought of something to call myself. Something like "The Demon King of Damnation." Sounds cool, right?
