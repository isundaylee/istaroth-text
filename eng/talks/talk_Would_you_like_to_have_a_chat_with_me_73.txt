# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Baizhu: What topics might you be interested in? I don't want to bore you with abstruse pharmacology, and you probably don't need to listen to my suggestions on healthy living.
Baizhu: Weren't you rambling about your bottles and jars? I think they're good conversation material.
Traveler: Bottles and jars?
Baizhu: That's right. Apart from herbal decoctions, I sometimes also prescribe topical medications for my patients.
Baizhu: Topical medication often comes in the form of ointments and tinctures. The ingredients are complex and require a precise mixing ratio, so making them is a rather complicated process.
Baizhu: Of course, I wouldn't expect my patients to be experts in medicine, so I usually make everything myself.
Baizhu: The pre-processed ingredients essential for making the medicine are all soaked inside the jars.
Baizhu: Yesss. There is lots of excellent stuff in there.
Traveler: Such as?
Baizhu: Mostly just herbs. Some contain potent toxins that must be processed before they can be used.
Baizhu: While we're on the subject, I have to remind you that to some degree, all medicines have detrimental side effects on the body.
Baizhu: The issue is not limited to a few specific ingredients â€” even the mildest medicines have the potential to do more harm than good if they're not used with caution.
Baizhu: You should refrain from taking medicine unless it's absolutely necessary. Mild discomfort often resolves itself with time.
Baizhu: So if you ever feel unwell, you should check in with me before taking anything.
Traveler: Understood, Dr. Baizhu.
Baizhu: It always pays to be cautious. I had to tell you this even at the risk of sounding insufferable.
