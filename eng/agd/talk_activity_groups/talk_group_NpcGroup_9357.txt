Layla: It's rest time now, right? Why can't I get to sleep...
Layla: Wait, no! That was it — we have something important to do in a minute, right...? Yeah, I can't sleep now!
Layla: Ugh, but if I'm not well-rested when we head off, I'm gonna mess things up for sure. I really don't know what to do...

## Talk

Layla: I gathered the available data, did some analysis, and came up with some more effective battle strategies... Oh, I should write them down for her...
Layla: I wonder if she'll be surprised when she wakes up?
Layla: Well, sleepwalking time's almost up. Keep an eye on her in battle, won't you?

## Talk

Layla: Maybe it would be nice to read something a little lighter for once. It would be a nice break from the academic texts I usually read — they give me such a headache.
Layla: Hmm... Actually, maybe not. I can't afford to relax yet, or I'll end up missing my next thesis deadline...
Layla: I can't just rely on "The Stars' Blessing" to see me through. I have to put in the work myself!
