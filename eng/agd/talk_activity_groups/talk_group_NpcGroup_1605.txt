Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Ellin: Sâ€”So it's possible to win this way... Hmm...

## Talk

Ellin: This game is mine to lose!

## Talk

Ellin: How in Teyvat could you see through other people's tactics?

## Talk

Ellin: Well done! Thanks for the game!

## Talk

Traveler: I hope you succeed.
Ellin: Thank you. I will definitely make it, just like the Dawn Knight from Ballads of the Squire...
Ellin: Have you read this book? I've finished it so many times! If you've got the time, you should definitely give it a read.

## Talk

Ellin: Do you need something? Sorry, I'm all sweaty.

## Talk

Traveler: What sword style is that?
Ellin: Oh... I'm copying Master Jean's technique.
Ellin: Every time she wields her sword... You just know it's a Grand Master at work.
Ellin: Only those of great character can use a sword fighting style like that, right?
Ellin: It seems like I can't just focus on power training. I need to start building character, too!

## Talk

Traveler: So you're with the Knights of Favonius?
Ellin: Who, me? You think I have what it takes? Really!?
Ellin: Yay, woohoo! My training must really be working after all.
Ellin: Actually I'm not a knight yet, but I'm confident I will make it through the tryouts.
Ellin: Then I'm gonna climb the ranks to captain, then get promoted to Master Jean's second-in-command, and when Jean gets to retirement age, she will shake my hand and say...
Ellin: ...Whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself! Anyway, watch this space 'cause I'm gonna outdo my feckless father by a long way, that's for sure!

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Ellin: Oh it's no problem. I'm going to carry on with sword practice now, so keep your distance.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Ellin: It's very scary, but I'm actually not all that worried.
Ellin: I believe that Master Jean will protect us, and all of Mondstadt!
Ellin: *sigh* If only I too were a member of the Knights. I do wish that I could fight alongside Master Jean...

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Ellin: It's just as I thought. Even Stormterror couldn't stand against Master Jean!
Ellin: Even though Jean said that that traveler was a big help to her, I'm sure she was just being modest. She must've done the lion's share of the work!
Ellin: If only I could have fought alongside Master Jean! We would have vanquished Stormterror together, and then, at the award ceremony, she would have looked at me with a smile on her lips...
Ellin: Just thinking about it makes my heart soar...
Ellin: Yes, I must take this chance and train hard before the next crisis comes...
