Traveler: So if I want to meet the Kanjou Commissioner...
Kageyama: If you wish to seek audience with the Kanjou Commissioner, you may send your name card to the headquarters of the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Kageyama: The inspector at headquarters will pick out a guest worthy of meeting the Commissioner based on the status and causes of the applicants.
Kageyama: ...That being said, you'd better give up on that idea if you are a commoner. Generally, outlanders won't have the opportunity to meet the Commissioner.
