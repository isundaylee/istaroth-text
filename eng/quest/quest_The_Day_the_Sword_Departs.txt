# The Day the Sword Departs


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: *sigh* Que'er...
Traveler: Sun Yu?
Sun Yu: Traveler? What a coincidence! I didn't expect to see you here...
Sun Yu: I... I'm doing some training here, and I'm about to leave Liyue soon to travel abroad.
Traveler: What's with the trip away all of a sudden?
Sun Yu: *sigh* Well, this is kind of embarrassing... I've long been talking about reviving the Guhua Clan, but what I've been doing all this time... This so-called "seeking the guidance of the adepti" is merely just me hanging about in Jueyun Karst...
Sun Yu: Although I'm grateful to Que'er for her company, deep down I'm aware that such behavior is nothing but meaningless to the revival of the Guhua Clan...
Sun Yu: Some time ago, when I was doing grocery shopping back in the city, I happened to have a conversation with a merchant from Fontaine.
Sun Yu: He said to me, "You can't find the solution to a problem at the place of its occurrence."
Sun Yu: I've pondered over these words for quite a while. Perhaps, this Fontaine merchant was suggesting that I travel to places other than Liyue.
Traveler: Traveling can be eye-opening.
Sun Yu: That's exactly what I thought! But... Que'er doesn't want to leave Liyue.
Sun Yu: Usually, her bouts of temper aren't serious and can often even be meant in jest. It doesn't take much for me to placate her.
Sun Yu: But this time, she seemed to be really infuriated. No matter what I said, she refused to listen, and she even ran back to the city alone... *sigh*
Sun Yu: But I'm not gonna bore you further with these trivial things. That aside, Traveler, can I ask you for a favor?
Sun Yu: Although I've learned some defensive techniques before, I hardly ever really tried my skills out. If I'm going to travel abroad, I'll definitely run into some sort of fight sooner or later...
Sun Yu: Traveler, I've heard many stories of you adventuring all over the world, and you must know a lot of ways to deal with monsters.
Sun Yu: Can you accompany me to find some monsters around and fight them? You know, offer me some guidance along the way as well?
Traveler: No problem.
Sun Yu: Let's see... There's one place where monsters gather right ahead. Let's go there first, shall we?
Traveler: I'm afraid you can't see my moves clearly.
Sun Yu: Yâ€”You are really that skilled? Hahaha, well, then please do me another favor and slow down a bit.
Traveler: Take it simply as a distraction even.
Traveler: Aren't you going to revive the Guhua Clan?
Traveler: What are you doing here?

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: *huff* That was tough...
Sun Yu: I apologize. Look at me, making a fool of myself. I didn't expect that I would be so nervous when confronting real monsters...
Sun Yu: Needless to say, I still need more training. Anyway, thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: Are you really leaving?
Sun Yu: I haven't fully decided yet. I still need more time to think it through. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can convince Que'er to leave with me...
