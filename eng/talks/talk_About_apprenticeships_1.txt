Traveler: About apprenticeships...
Master Lu: Ah, you must have overheard me grumbling, then?
Master Lu: Haha, my new apprentice, Dayu, is quite quick with his hands, and he's hardworking enough. He just talks too much.
Master Lu: Carpenters like us should just focus on getting the work done with our own two hands. No need to flap those lips unnecessarily.
Master Lu: That kid is pretty unreliable in that regard. Perhaps I should get myself another apprentice...
Master Lu: I mean, with the two of them helping and covering for each others' weaknesses, the future of Fanmu Carpenter's will be secure.
Master Lu: ...Speaking of which, would you be interested in carpentry?
