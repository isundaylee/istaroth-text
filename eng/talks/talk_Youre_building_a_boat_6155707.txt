Traveler: ...You're building a boat?
Ulfr: Yes. Just a little one, so I can take Flora out on the lake.
Ulfr: I thought that with Flora being so light and dainty, no boat would be fit for her unless I got rid of the keel, which is heavy and unwieldy.
Ulfr: I also figured I'd build the hull from her favorite thing in the world â€” dandelions!
Ulfr: ...What? You want to see the boat?
Ulfr: My first attempt is on the lake bed over there, and the second one is on the lake bed right here.
Ulfr: I just don't understand why they won't float.
