Good-Hearted Raven: Wait! Do not do anything foolish!
Good-Hearted Raven: Now, I get it. Sometimes, inexplicable troubles will come upon you. Perhaps they might even have you believe that your circumstances are immutable...
Traveler: Hold on a moment...
Good-Hearted Raven: I understand. I understand! I, too, have been in such straits. I understand sometimes that the choices we make are the culmination of all too many negative emotions...
Traveler: Uh, no, you..
Good-Hearted Raven: Perhaps my words cannot comfort you! But I say to you that life must go on for us to experience more beauteous things...
Traveler: Yeah, sure...
Good-Hearted Raven: Watching this view together... It is a good thing, is it not? You must put faith in such things, yes... To give up here would be a crying shame.
Good-Hearted Raven: Things may seem difficult now, but persist, I say, persist!
Traveler: Um, thanks. Yeah. Thanks.
Good-Hearted Raven: Keep it up! You can do this!
