# Rejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found


## Talk 1

Jeht: How... how could I forget...
Jeht: I hope it's not too late. We should at least search around his tent...
Paimon: Jeht! ...What's going on? Are you going somewhere?
Jeht: #Paimon and {NICKNAME}... You came just in time. There's something I gotta do right now... I need to go to Aderfi's place.
Paimon: Aderfi?
Paimon: Isn't he that traitor who made shady deals with the Fatui? ...Oh, Paimon knows! You wanna go see if there's any valuable stuff he left behind!
Jeht: No, I'm not interested in his stuff at all.
Jeht: The tribe has its own rules on dealing with the belongings of traitors like Aderfi. Hmph... if it weren't for the rules, I would no doubt burn everything down the first chance I get.
Jeht: I'm going to his tent because...
Traveler: Because of Benben, right?
Paimon: Ohh! Oh no, Benben's still over there at Aderfi's place!
Paimon: Jehhht... Why did you leave Benben with someone like him?
Jeht: I—I didn't know he was a traitor!
Jeht: Anyway, I need to check on Benben as soon as possible.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, we should go with her!
Traveler: Then let's not wait any longer...
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon hopes Benben's okay...
Traveler: Let's get going right now!

## Talk 2

Jeht: Energy Transformation Capacitors... I hope Benben will recover once we get them...
Jeht: If you're still unsure, I can go with you!
Traveler: You stay here with Benben.
Jeht: Okay. I'll wait for your good news... Please stay safe!
Traveler: We'll be back real quick.

## Talk 3

Benben: (Benben lies still on the ground without making any of its familiar beeping sounds.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey look, there's something over here.
Paimon: Doesn't look like investigation records to Paimon. It looks more like... a letter.
Jeht: A letter? Let's open it up and see what's written inside!
Paimon: The letter says Benben simply ran out of energy...
Paimon: Now that Paimon thinks about it, Benben opened the gates to the Mausoleum of King Deshret for us and activated our clearance... It really helped a lot during our journey.
Jeht: And even mechanical creatures like Benben get tired. Maybe it ran low on energy after doing so much for us.
Jeht: The letter mentioned something called Energy Transformation Capacitors, but I didn't see anything like that in the tent.
Jeht: Could it be...
Traveler: They might be hidden somewhere.
Jeht: Doesn't look like it. If they were meant for repairing Benben, why would he try to hide them? Wouldn't it be more intuitive to use them right away?
Jeht: Aha, I know! It must be because the transaction hasn't occurred yet!
Jeht: Aderfi didn't bring Benben to the transaction, so there shouldn't be any Energy Transformation Capacitors here anyway... There's only one question left: who did he strike the deal with?
Jeht: Ha, that was a dumb question for me to ask. There's only one group outside the tribe he'll have dealings like this with...
Traveler: Sumeru researchers?
Jeht: It's the Fatui!
Paimon: What should we do now?
Jeht: What else? There's no negotiating with the Fatui. We go to the transaction site and steal the Capacitors from them!
Paimon: Woohoo! Let's go steal them!
Jeht: But Benben... We can't carry it with us in its current state, so we can't take it to the transaction site...
Jeht: It isn't safe to leave it alone either. I don't wanna put it in a risky situation ever again.
Paimon: #Paimon and {NICKNAME} will go raid the Fatui! You just wait here with Benben.
Traveler: Yeah!
Paimon: Yeah! Let's raid the Fatui!
Jeht: #I really wanna go myself, but... {NICKNAME}, Paimon, I'm counting on you to help Benben recover!
Jeht: And... even though they're just a bunch of Fatui, you should still be careful...
Paimon: Don't worry! Just leave it to us!
Jeht: I don't really wanna stay here in this traitor's tent with Benben though. I'll take it to my place.
Jeht: Let's meet up in my tent after you retrieve the Capacitors!
Traveler: Let's raid the Fatui!
Paimon: Yup yup! This won't be our first time!
Traveler: The Fatui!
Jeht: Precisely. Who else could it be?
Traveler: He might've never received them.
Jeht: Ah, I know what you mean! The transaction hasn't even taken place!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Look, it's Benben!
Jeht: I'm glad Aderfi didn't get to take Benben away...
Jeht: Or perhaps you could say that everything here looks exactly the same as before.
Jeht: Did he really think he'd overturn the Matriarch and return to his tent safe and sound...? What a self-absorbed idiot.
Jeht: But thanks to that, nothing bad happened to Benben.
Paimon: You call this "nothing bad"? Ohh, poor Benben...
Traveler: How did it come to this...
Paimon: Yeah, why is it lying on the ground...?
Paimon: Anyway, what happened to Benben? Everything seemed fine the last time we saw it...
Jeht: After leaving Khaj-Nisut, Benben gradually grew weaker... It looked like its parts were malfunctioning, and the sound of its beeps was getting lower...
Jeht: Then it couldn't make any sounds or move at all. It felt as if I was watching its life slowly drain out.
Jeht: At that time, no one in the tribe knew what was going on with Benben except Aderfi.
Jeht: So I left Benben in his care...
Paimon: Oh no... Is Benben gonna stay like this forever...?
Jeht: ...
Jeht: At the very least, Benben's still here with us. I'm sure we'll find a way to fix it, sooner or later...
Paimon: But there's nothing we can work with...
Jeht: Hmm, let me think. I remember Aderfi telling me that whatever's wrong with Benben, it's nothing too serious, and that it should be fixed within a few days...
Jeht: Knowing him, if he performed some kind of investigation, he would've definitely left records behind. Let's have a look around the area!
Jeht: If it really was "nothing too serious", maybe we could even try fixing Benben ourselves!
Traveler: What's wrong with Benben?

## Talk 6

Fatui Negotiator: P—Please stop...
Fatui Negotiator: Please have mercy... We're gonna get killed if you keep this up...
Paimon: Sure sounds convincing coming from the one who's been beaten.
Paimon: Talk!
Traveler: Spit it out!
Fatui Negotiator: Y—Yes, I'll tell you everything! Anything you want to know!
Paimon: Then start with what you know!
Fatui Negotiator: W—We always had dealings with Aderfi... A—And it sounded like the Matriarch of the Tanit had a bias for Azariq... and the new girl.
Fatui Negotiator: And I don't know why, but it seems like Azariq has gone missing too...
Fatui Negotiator: That woman is cruel. She considers everyone who's no longer of any value to the tribe an eyesore... so Aderfi contacted us in order to maintain his status.
Fatui Negotiator: Our business in the desert area never went according to plan, until... until we struck the deal with Aderfi.
Traveler: No longer of any value... What does that mean?
Fatui Negotiator: I don't know... I really don't! That has to do with the internal workings of the desert folks... But if I had to guess, it might've been because she thought we were no longer trustworthy...
Fatui Negotiator: ...And so she began to keep her distance, and Aderfi, who had been in frequent contact with us, was very distressed because of that...
Fatui Negotiator: After all, we can always leave this wretched place when needed. Aderfi, on the other hand, will be used by the tribe until he's no longer 'of value'. His life is virtually in their hands.
Fatui Negotiator: But he was extremely cunning. He somehow made us fulfill his every request, while we, on the other hand, never heard anything of the items we asked for...
Fatui Negotiator: And now the rumors say he's gotten himself in trouble... We weren't sure what exactly happened, but we saw it as a window of opportunity...
Paimon: An opportunity for what?
Fatui Negotiator: We assumed that there wouldn't be many opportunities for us to trade with Aderfi in the future, so we asked him to bring the special Primal Construct he mentioned in his letters...
Fatui Negotiator: If we could get a hold of that Primal Construct before we left this place for good, we would've still gained something...
Paimon: Huh, so you're here to steal stuff too? No wonder we couldn't find any goods OR the Energy Transformation Capacitors!
Fatui Negotiator: Hold on... Did you just say "too"?
Traveler: Yep. Now hand over the Capacitors.
Paimon: Argh... Don't tell Paimon the Energy Transformation Capacitors are all made up!
Fatui Negotiator: No. The Energy Transformation Capacitors are very real, and there's a whole batch of them. They seem to be ancient relics, so we're not sure if any of them are still functional...
Paimon: Tell us where these Energy Transformation Capacitors are!
Traveler: Keep up the imposing tone, Paimon!
Paimon: #Hehe, Paimon will! ...Hey, {NICKNAME}, don't change the subject!
Paimon: Speak up! Tell us where the Capacitors are!
Fatui Negotiator: ...They're at a camp not far away from here. Here's the key to its entrance... I've told you everything I know...
Traveler: Then get moving!
Fatui Negotiator: Alright, alright, I'll make myself scarce.
Traveler: Don't get in our way ever again!
Traveler: It's bad luck you ran into us.
Traveler: This... business you're doing in the desert. What is it?
Fatui Negotiator: ...It's top secret.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: #See, now {NICKNAME}'s mad! You wouldn't want to mess with {M#him}{F#her}!
Fatui Negotiator: Ugh...! Alright, alright! Please don't get mad, I'll tell! But it's... it's not like I know the full story...
Fatui Negotiator: We were asked to investigate the current situation of various desert tribes. After infiltrating them through making business offers, we aimed to attract the Sages' attention... and ultimately work to the benefit of the Lord Harbinger in Sumeru City.
Fatui Negotiator: Professor Froderock was looking for live specimens in the desert — he always defied The Doctor's orders... That's just pure jealousy, if you ask me.
Fatui Negotiator: Ahem, I've gone too far... Anyway, Aderfi had been our point of contact, and he was in charge of everything that had to do with trade.

## Talk 7

Jeht: Hmm... It looks like there's nothing useful here...

## Talk 8

Paimon: Jeht!
Jeht: How was it? You didn't get into trouble, right?
Paimon: Everything went as smooth as it could! Look! We got the Energy Transformation Capacitors!

## Talk 9

Jeht: Huh, so this is what Energy Transformation Capacitors look like... But how are we supposed to use them?
Benben: Beep... Beep-beep...
Jeht: Benben?
Black Screen Text: Benben connects to the Energy Transformation Capacitors and quickly extracts energy from them.
Benben: Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Paimon: Whoa! We resurrected Benben!
Jeht: Silly Paimon. Benben just woke up from a long nap, that's all!
Benben: Beep... Bee-eep...
Jeht: Hey, I wasn't worried! I knew you'd recover, no matter what!
Paimon: Hmph. "I don't wanna put it in a risky situation ever again..."
Jeht: Don't parrot me, Paimon!
Benben: Beep-beeep.
Jeht: #Oh, yeah! {NICKNAME}, Benben says thank you.
Jeht: Even though Benben was lying still without saying anything, it knows everything you've done.
Traveler: No need to thank me, Benben.
Benben: Beep!
Jeht: Mm...
Paimon: Is anything else the matter?
Jeht: Even though Benben has woken up, it still looks like it could use some rest...
Paimon: Right! Have a good rest, Benben!
Benben: Beep-beep...
