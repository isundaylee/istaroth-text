# Talk Dialog

Shigeru: Junkichi, I only pushed your manuscript deadline back and came with you to the Mikawa Flower Festival because you said you'd find some inspiration here... So what are you doing eating and drinking all day?
Junkichi: *cough* Hâ€”How could you besmirch the search for inspiration with the phrase "eating and drinking"? If I'm drinking anything in, it's the festive atmosphere! The sights and the sounds, the humans and youkai at play...
Junkichi: ...And in their midst, an Onimusha, a master of the "Ten Thousand Transformations"! How's that for inspiration, huh?
