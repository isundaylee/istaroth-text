Traveler: Huh?
Maziar: My aunt runs a hotel. There's only one hotel in Caravan Ribat, so it should be easy to find.
Maziar: I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
Maziar: I learned a lot with her, and am getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
Maziar: This is something you'll never learn from the Akasha Terminal.

Maziar: Even if the Akasha Terminals were still around, that wasn't something they could've taught you.

Traveler: Are you heading back?
Maziar: Hmm, not now. I just passed a camp of the Eremites, and he was not there. Maybe he went to the hotel looking for me for a drink.
Maziar: To be honest, most Sumeru people like to drink, but I'm not used to alcohol. I would feel dizzy after just half a glass.
Maziar: But it'd be a lack of decorum to refuse an Eremite. He often comes to invite me for a drink, and I should care about his feelings.
Maziar: I'll just stay out of his sight for now.
