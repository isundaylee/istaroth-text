# Talk Dialog

Juanshu: #O Honorable Traveler Traveler, is there anything I can do for you?
Traveler: About the location of "Iridescent Cloud-Striding"...
Juanshu: Yes! A lot of thought was put into the matter. The adventurers inspired by you and I chose a suitable location after exhaustive research—
Juanshu: "Those with heavy hearts often wander in the tranquil wilderness, far removed from the hustle and bustle."
Juanshu: So, the location for Iridescent Cloud-Striding is neither too far nor too close to Yilong Wharf and Qiaoying Village, so that your radiance may reach as many who need encouragement as possible.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Juanshu: About me? My own experiences are really quite ordinary.
Juanshu: I'm just a researcher of folktales, with no special abilities. When my research was at a standstill, I thought about changing professions, so I registered for the Ministry of Civil Affairs exams, but I ended up flunking.
Juanshu: However, after being inspired by you, I clenched my teeth, overcoming the difficulties posed by both the lack of funds and my own cognitive limitations, and found that there really wasn't any need for me to change my vocation in the first place.
Juanshu: After I came to Yilong Wharf, I discovered there were countless research topics, so I've been studying all kinds of folktales while I work as a Storyteller's apprentice! Every single day is so fulfilling.
Juanshu: And it's all because of you! Once again, thank you so much.
Traveler: I must away — happy Lantern Rite!
Juanshu: Happy Lantern Rite! I'm looking forward to our next encounter!
