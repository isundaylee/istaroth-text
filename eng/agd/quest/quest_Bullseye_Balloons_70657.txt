# Bullseye Balloons

Lizzie: Hello, I'm Lizzie of the Knights of Favonius. I'm sure you've heard this already, but Mondstadt holds all kinds of fun activities during the Windblume Festival!
Traveler: Rings a bell...
Lizzie: I'm in charge of receiving all guests coming to Mondstadt in order to assure that everyone can get the most fun out of this festival!
Lizzie: Because some festival events take place outside of the city walls, someone needs to introduce all the available activities to the visitors. It'd be a shame if they missed the abundance of wonderful games that we've prepared.
Lizzie: Now, allow me to wholeheartedly recommend our "Bullseye Balloons"!
Lizzie: The name itself is pretty self-explanatory, isn't it? Shoot the targets as quickly and as accurately as you can to reach a high score.
Traveler: Sounds enticing.
Lizzie: No worries, let me mark the location for you. You won't know unless you try it yourself.
Lizzie: Besides, based on your score, you can win valuable rewards! No matter if you are a casual player or a perfectionist, it's fun all the same!
Traveler: I wouldn't say no to that.
Lizzie: Sure, you should definitely try it! If you want to learn more about other fun events, come find me!
Lizzie: Have fun!
Traveler: Thank you for your explanation.
Traveler: Sounds quite challenging.
Traveler: First I've heard of it.
