Berbere: If I had the money, I would buy all the spices in Sumeru, haha!

Traveler: And you are...
Berbere: Merchants like me who come from the desert actually rarely trade in spices.
Berbere: Since we can go in and out of the desert, selling specialty goods is a no-brainer for us.
Berbere: But I really like the spices of Sumeru. Different combinations and proportions create a new delicacy every time!
Berbere: You can't find this sort of exquisite flavor outside of Sumeru, can you?

Traveler: See you.
Berbere: Bye, hope you find your scent of Sumeru soon!
