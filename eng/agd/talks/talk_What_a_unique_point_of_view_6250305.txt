Traveler: What a unique point of view...
Wangjuan: The water's too loud! I can't hear you at all.
Wangjuan: Let me guess... You think I'm strange, right?
Wangjuan: Now, I used to be a fisherman who didn't care about anything other than catching fish and making money.
Wangjuan: But several years ago, I heard about the legend about Carp fish from Mr. Deyin at the teahouse.
Wangjuan: The Carp and the Carp Adeptus have been nothing but kind to everyone in Chenyu Vale, but I might have hurt some of the Carp when I was fishing.
Wangjuan: I didn't want to make that mistake again!
Wangjuan: But I don't have any other skills. I've got to do this to make ends meet.
Wangjuan: So if you see a special Carp when you're fishing, please let them go. It'll bring you good fortune!
