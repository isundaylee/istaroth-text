## Talk 10

Kid Kujirai: #{F#Big sis}{M#Big bro}, you're really good at this! You even cracked my "Kujirai Art, Temari Jutsu."
Traveler: About how to play Temari...
Kid Kujirai: If you are looking for the Temari, you need to find the Temari hidden by others within the time limit and you win.
Kid Kujirai: If you are hiding the Temari, you must hide the Temari within the same limited time. It's only fair to the player looking for it. The Big Sister adventurer said that fairness in the game is very important!
Traveler: About yourself...
Kid Kujirai: Hmm, what's wrong?
Traveler: "Kujirai Art, Temari Jutsu"?
Kid Kujirai: Ah, it's a school of martial arts that we created ourselves with Grandpa Shousen's advice. The aim was to develop invincible martial arts using the Temari.
Kid Kujirai: If we can use various methods to blast enemies away with explosive Temari, then we can win without even fighting!
Paimon: Paimon's very sure that that's not how you play Temari...
Traveler: How many people are there in the Kujirai family?
Kid Kujirai: Hmm, let me think...
Kid Kujirai: Besides my mom and dad, we have an eldest sister, named Momiji. She used to play with us a lot.
Kid Kujirai: But ever since she got hooked on fishing, she won't play with us anymore. And she even says we'll scare the fish away!
Kid Kujirai: Then... how many brothers do I have? Honestly, I'm not too sure either...
Traveler: About the adventurer you mentioned...
Kid Kujirai: She's a very powerful Big Sister adventurer!
Kid Kujirai: She taught us how to play Temari, how to sing the Temari song, and how to use the Temari to blow up the bad guys!
Kid Kujirai: When she left, she said she was going somewhere far, far away to do something very important.
Kid Kujirai: That's why we have to study "Temari Jutsu" and help her in future!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Kid Kujirai: #Bye-bye, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}! Help me say hello if you see my brothers and sister!
