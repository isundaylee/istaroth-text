Stanley: I'm Stanley. Remember my name. You're also here for my stories, aren't you?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Stanley: Stanley! It's Stanley! Some adventurer you must be if you don't even know my name!
Stanley: I am a living legend among adventurers! The man who waded through the Mare Jivari and Geyser Realm!
Stanley: I have enough stories to tell for three days straight...
Traveler: The Mare Jivari?
Stanley: Sharp! That's the best out of all my legendary stories.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...And the monster created a vortex in the Mare Jivari, so I held tightly onto my friend's hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Are you guys falling asleep!?
Stanley: Wake up! You!

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Stanley: Wait, you're leaving? I'm not even halfway done!

## Talk

Stanley: Want to hear the tale of yours truly, the great adventurer Stanley?
Stanley: Oh? It's you.

## Talk

Traveler: You're still calling yourself Stanley.
Stanley: So you already know about the fact that Stanley was actually my friend. You must have heard the truth at the bottom of my bottle, I suppose.
Stanley: ...I do remember that I did meet you — and someone else to boot — while drunk one day...
Stanley: Hmm, I can't quite remember why, but I've felt much more relaxed ever since then.
Stanley: I only call myself Stanley today in order to ensure that his tales will remain on everyone's lips.
Stanley: Haha, I imagine that if this were me from before, being exposed like this would have frustrated me for sure...

## Talk

Traveler: Let's hear a tale then.
Stanley: Haha, so you'd like to hear some more? Well then, then I'll make this an occasion, and tell you the real version.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...the monster created a vortex in the Ashen Sea, and I would have been sucked into it, if Stanley had not held tightly onto my hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Hey. Hey! Are you falling asleep? Wake up!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Stanley: Bye. I trust that you will not forget Stanley's tale.
