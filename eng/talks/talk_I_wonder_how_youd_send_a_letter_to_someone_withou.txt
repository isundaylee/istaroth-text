Traveler: I wonder how you'd send a letter to someone without an address.
Tundama: Haha, so it's not so much a letter as a missing person poster, eh?
Tundama: If you're looking for someone, you might want to try your luck with the People of the Springs.
Tundama: Their folks and Saurians are all super knowledgeable. They are adept at both pathfinding and navigation.
Tundama: Some people have said that Koholasaurs are like dogs that live in water, and I think they're on to something.
Tundama: Their only flaw is that they tend to work rather... slowly. You might have to wait a while before you can be reunited again.
