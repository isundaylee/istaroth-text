Traveler: What are you thinking about?
Eloise: I just feel there are some subtle changes underway with Fontaine's legal systems and judicial processes.
Eloise: I've been to other nations and studied their systems. And since, I've come to find our theatrical trials less and less bearable.
Eloise: But I do think there's been less theatrics lately. Our visitors seem to be coming to learn about the law, rather than to see a spectacle.
Eloise: Or am I wrong? I'll have to keep observing.
