# Venti's Plan


## Talk 1

Paimon: So this... "Holy Lyre der Himmel" is...
Venti: One of the most treasured items in Mondstadt. It's the lyre that Barbatos used to play.
Venti: With it, perhaps I can help Dvalin draw his gentle nature back out of this nightmare he's going through.
Paimon: Will it really stop Stormterror from causing more damage?
Venti: Of course. I'm the best bard in the world.
Venti: There's not a single song I do not know, no matter if it's from the past, present, or future.
Venti: Look me in the eyes. Do you not find me trustworthy?
Traveler: ...just what is that in your eyes!?
Venti: Hahaha, that one doesn't work on a bard.
Paimon: So how can we get the Holy Lyre?
Venti: It's said that it's enshrined deep within the Cathedral, somewhere safe.
Venti: I'll go take a look around. You can come if you want.
Traveler: Look into my eyes. What are you hiding?
Traveler: The color of your eyes is like the sky in my hometown.

## Talk 2

Venti: Let me handle this...
Venti: Hello there, Sister.
Gotelinde: May the Anemo God bless you, young bard. How can I help you?
Venti: Actually, I know a secret that can save Mondstadt from its current predicament.
Gotelinde: Oh, what a blessing from the God of Anemo!
Gotelinde: But you should report that to the Knights of Favonius. Why have you come to me?
Venti: Hahaha, because you, dear sister, are able to help!
Venti: I'd like to borrow... the Holy Lyre. With it, I'll be able to help Stormterror—
Gotelinde: Please see yourselves out.
Venti: What?
Gotelinde: It's a vicious dragon indeed, but once the Acting Grand Master makes up her mind, nothing can stand in the Knights' way.
Venti: That's simply not acceptable. Wouldn't Stormterror end up getting killed that way?
Gotelinde: That foolish beast betrayed the winds. Not even the God of Anemo themselves would forgive it!
Venti: Wow...
Venti: Please, I beg of you!
Gotelinde: I'm afraid not, little bard.
Gotelinde: (Strange... Somehow I feel so bad rejecting this sweet child...)
Venti: Then... I guess I'm left with no other choice.
Venti: I cannot hide anymore!
Venti: My disciples, rejoice! Behold, the <color=#00E1FFFF>God of Anemo, Barbatos</color> has descended!
Venti: Shocked, aren't you? Don't you just want to cry out and rejoice? How does it feel to finally meet the god you've been serving?
Gotelinde: If there's nothing else, I'll be going back to handle the Cathedral's paperwork now.
Venti: Wait—

## Talk 3

Venti: Eh? She didn't even bat an eyelid.
Venti: But, I have at least learned what I wanted to know.
Venti: She didn't deny that the Cathedral is enshrining the Holy Lyre.
Venti: #Now, {NICKNAME}, since you're the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius...
Venti: Maybe you can give it a shot.

## Talk 4

Gotelinde: Barbatos bless you.
Traveler: Hello.
Gotelinde: Ah, it's you! The newcomer of the Knights of Favonius, aren't you?
Gotelinde: So what brings you here? Tasks from the Acting Grand Master?
Traveler: Yes, actually. The Knights of Favonius would like to borrow the Holy Lyre...
Gotelinde: Is that so?
Gotelinde: Not that I don't trust you. It's just that a suspicious bard came looking to borrow the Holy Lyre as well.
Gotelinde: He's full of nonsense and even called himself Barbatos. He must be up to something.
Gotelinde: There are regulations in place for the use of the Holy Lyre. Currently, it's only used in Ludi Harpastum.
Gotelinde: Signed documents from the Grand Master, Seneschal, and Community Representative are all required.
Gotelinde: So, may I see the document from the Knights of Favonius?
Traveler: The Grand Master didn't mention it...
Gotelinde: A signed document is required. Without it, there's not much I can do.
Gotelinde: Now, if you'll excuse me. I really am quite busy as of late.
Traveler: I'm sorry, I forgot to bring it here.
Traveler: Paimon ate it on our way here.
Paimon: Hey!
Traveler: #I am the Honorary Knight of Favonius, {NICKNAME}.
Gotelinde: I know you. You and Amber saved Mondstadt that day.

Otto: Man, this stinks. Having to stand around here all <color=#00E1FFFF>day</color> long, having to guard this entrance.
Hey! Don't move! You can't go down there!
Paimon: Seems we're gonna have to wait until <color=#00E1FFFF>nightfall</color> to sneak in...
