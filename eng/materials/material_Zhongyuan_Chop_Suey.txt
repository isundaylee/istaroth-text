# Zhongyuan Chop Suey

A seasoned and cooked meat dish. Though it contains animal organ meat and bits and scraps of other things, the strong-flavored seasonings have masked the stench of the meat. Many have had this dish for the entirety of their lives without knowing "chop suey" is not actually a swear word in the local language.
