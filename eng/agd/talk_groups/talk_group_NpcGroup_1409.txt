## Talk

Cyrus: Drat... If only we had more manpower...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Cyrus: Traveler? Great timing! You've seen the tempests that Stormterror's kicked up in Mondstadt, haven't you?
Cyrus: The Knights of Favonius have mobilized their full strength. Naturally, the Adventurers' Guild will not stand idly by. It is time for the people to witness our strength!
Cyrus: The Knights are in charge of internal security, but those foolish monsters outside the city walls are the specialty of the Adventurers' Guild.
Cyrus: The Guild's experienced hands have all been sent to various places to investigate. But... I just fear for Jack.
Cyrus: He volunteered to go to the Thousand Winds Temple, but we haven't heard from him since.
Cyrus: I like his spirit, but he's too rash sometimes and doesn't have enough experience. I worry that something might happen to him.
Cyrus: Traveler, if you are willing, could you help me go to the Thousand Winds Temple to look for Jack?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure thing.
Cyrus: Thank you! I must oversee the situation here at the Guild, or I would have gone myself.
Cyrus: I am counting on you. The Guild must not lose another young soul.

## Talk

Traveler: There are other things I need to do...
Cyrus: ...Alright. In such times, settling your own affairs is the wisest choice.

## Talk

Cyrus: The storms suddenly stopped...
Traveler: Is that a bad thing?
Cyrus: Ah, no... It's good that they stopped, yes.
Cyrus: Hmm... But it's all too sudden. I came up with so many contingency plans. Are we not going to get the chance to any of them?
Cyrus: My contingencies included ways to scatter the people in the wild to avoid the storms, teach them how to survive...
Cyrus: ...We were going to teach them to set up basic camps, do pest control, avoid beasts and monsters...
Cyrus: Ah, never mind. Rather than take our chances out there, better to remain safe within these walls.
Cyrus: Ah, yes. Some of our investigating adventurers have informed me that there are monsters congregating in the Whispering Woods.
Cyrus: Almost everyone is out investigating, and I must remain here to command them.
Cyrus: Traveler, can I count on you to clear those monsters out?

## Talk

Traveler: Consider it done.
Cyrus: I will leave it to you, then. Don't worry, you will be compensated fairly!

## Talk

Traveler: You seem unhappy about this.
Cyrus: Ah, this... Well, you know how the young people in Mondstadt all wish to join the Knights of Favonius, with their shining armor, their flying banners, the glory, and Master Jean as well...
Cyrus: As for the Adventurers' Guild, the only impression of us people have is that of people who bumble about outdoors... Basically, no one cares about us.
Cyrus: I thought to myself that if there was an opportunity to show the Guild's mettle, we might be able to bring in more fresh blood.
Cyrus: Ah, but it doesn't matter. The safety of Mondstadt is more important than my own personal wishes.
Cyrus: I'll leave those monsters to you. I'll have your compensation ready.

## Talk

Traveler: I've got other matters...
Cyrus: Alright. Go get your affairs in order first. I'll think of a way to get someone to clear those monsters out.
Cyrus: *sigh* Where has that kid Bennett run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.

## Talk

Cyrus: Bah, Stormterror was defeated, just like that? We didn't even get the chance to take the stage...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Cyrus: Oh, if it isn't the Honorary Knight. The storms have ceased, and Stormterror has been defeated.
Cyrus: This is a good thing, yes... But couldn't Stormterror have put up a bit more of a fight?
Cyrus: And here I was thinking that after clearing the monsters surrounding the city out, we could select some elite adventurers to form a team of dragon hunters to challenge Stormterror!
Cyrus: But just as we were having trouble finding a healer, Stormterror was defeated.
Cyrus: We also need to help the citizens find cats and dogs, send meals and clean house... At this rate, we'll have lost our opportunity for sure...
Cyrus: *sigh* Let's leave that aside for now. I've heard from our scouts that there are still monsters wandering the Whispering Woods.
Cyrus: But our forces are scattered throughout the wilds and cannot return, and I must handle some assorted matters.
Cyrus: Could I trouble you to go to the Whispering Woods and see to the situation there?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure.
Cyrus: Thank you. I will be handling commissions here...
Cyrus: A signboard blown away by the wind... Flowers blown away by the wind... A lost cat... *sigh* It is as I expected...

## Talk

Traveler: I have other matters to handle...
Cyrus: Ah. Go about your business, then. Now that Stormterror has been vanquished, these things aren't so urgent...

## Talk

Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Cyrus: Huh!? Jack has never fought like this before!

## Talk

Cyrus: Hahaha! It looks like I'm pretty good at this!

## Talk

Cyrus: Hmph. It's high time we took care of these crooks...
Traveler: What's going on?
Cyrus: When that storm from before had just appeared, the Knights and the Adventurers' Guild sprang into action.
Cyrus: But as we were busy with evacuation and rescue work, it seems as though some Treasure Hoarders managed to sneak in amid the chaos.
Cyrus: These thieves took advantage of that moment when we were stretched thin, and managed to steal quite a few things throughout the city.
Cyrus: Carrots from the Dawn Winery, Philanemo Mushrooms from Springvale, a stack of silverware from the Goth Grand Hotel... Hmph, they've even stolen some of the food stocked in the Good Hunter's larder.
Cyrus: If it's not nailed down, these bandits will take it. Why, if this storm hadn't subsided so quickly, I doubt there'd be anything left in Mondstadt to steal.
Cyrus: We've got enough hands on deck again, but looking for those things may prove very difficult. The speed at which they flee with their loot is only surpassed by their ability to fence it.
Cyrus: Still, we must make them pay.
Cyrus: Honorary Knight. If you're willing, would you like to have a little chat with those Treasure Hoarders?

## Talk

Traveler: Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Cyrus: Good! A fine answer, worthy of your title.
Cyrus: Then I shall leave this matter to you. We have caught the trail of a group of Treasure Hoarders around the city. I will mark it down on your map.
Cyrus: But they are a wily bunch. It would take you some effort to completely clear their camps out.
Cyrus: But for an Honorary Knight like you, it should be a simple matter.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd love to, but...
Cyrus: Ah, is that so... It's fine. You are the Honorary Knight, after all, I should think that there are many other things that you have to attend to throughout the city.

## Talk

Traveler: Can you share some adventurer's experience with me?
Cyrus: Why, of course. Here, take this. I'm sure it'll be of use to you.
Cyrus: ...To put it plainly, you need only remember two words... Courage and perseverance!

## Talk

Cyrus: Hey, kiddo! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild!

## Talk

Cyrus: Hey, isn't it... you... You're here for the wine too?

## Talk

Cyrus: Who are you?
Cyrus: I'm Cyrus, Master of the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch!
Cyrus: I'm sure we'll get to know each other later on. I can tell you are a born adventurer!
Cyrus: How can I tell? Just call it a senior adventurer's hunch, haha!
Cyrus: Listen, if you're interested, we can talk about it some more at Angel's Share another day!

## Talk

Cyrus: Tell me about the Adventurers' Guild.
Cyrus: Ad astra abyssosque!
Cyrus: We have branches all around Teyvat! Haha!
Cyrus: You can meet fellow adventurers in the guild, participate in expeditions to every corner of the land, and get paid for completing commissions...
Cyrus: This truly is heaven for all adventurers! You sure you're not interested, kid? Hahaha...

## Talk

Cyrus: Goodbye.
Cyrus: A youngster like you should be more energetic. Don't be cold!

## Talk

Cyrus: Isn't that a sight to behold...

## Talk

Traveler: Aren't you going to find shelter?
Cyrus: Haha, I'm made of sterner stuff than that! Sure it's been a while since I last went on an adventure, but I'm not Master of the Guild for nothing you know!
Cyrus: There's not an adventurer alive that would want to miss out on a sight like this!
Cyrus: This is exactly how Mondstadt is said to have looked in the early days, according to the legends...

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Cyrus: A crisis? I see this as the opportunity of a lifetime!
Cyrus: If there is any adventurer who does not get their blood up at this, surely they fail as an adventurer!
Cyrus: Once the time is right, I must take Jack and the others out to see the world. And thanks to this incident, our adventure teams can be expanded a little, yes?
Cyrus: And as for the dragon... well, there isn't anything that cannot be conquered with perseverance, is there?

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Cyrus: What a showing from the Knights of Favonius! Most of them are youngsters without much combat experience, but they do have an adventurous spirit! Not bad. Not bad at all!
Cyrus: If I had to criticize, then I would say that they do drag their feet a little, perhaps?
Cyrus: If it was always their intention to send me an adventure commission, they really didn't have to take a whole day to decide that.
Cyrus: Ah, I must be a little drunk... Well, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that I'm treating tonight!

## Talk

Traveler: You are... the Master of the Adventurers' Guild, right?
Cyrus: Haha, you got a good memory.
Cyrus: It's just a title, nothing more.
Cyrus: I only became some legendary adventurer for completing some top-tier commissions by chance.
Cyrus: The real legends... are for you to create! Hahaha...
Traveler: Tell me about your story.
Cyrus: My story? What is there to tell?
Cyrus: Let's see... I slew three dragons, crushed two international pirate organizations, saved Teyvat once... Nothing major.
Cyrus: ...
Cyrus: ...Where was I? I think I'm getting a bit too tipsy...

## Talk

Traveler: Excuse me then.
Cyrus: You leaving? Don't be such a stranger, haha!
