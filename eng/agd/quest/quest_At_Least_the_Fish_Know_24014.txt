# At Least the Fish Know


## Talk 1

Paimon: That should do it. Let's go back and look for Linorea!

## Talk 2

Paimon: That should do it. Let's go back and look for Linorea!

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'll go check out the deep waters.
Linorea: I'm counting on you. Unfortunately, given the state of my divesuit... that's all I can do right now.

## Talk 4

Linorea: Have you helped me place the fry into the water? Given the state of my divesuit, I can only count on you at the moment.

## Talk 5

Linorea: Have you helped me place the fry into the water?
Traveler: I have.
Linorea: Thanks so much. Once I fix my divesuit, I'll come back and continue my work.
Traveler: I hope those fish will grow up safely.
Linorea: Don't worry, I've prepared many species of fry for all sorts of waters and different environments.
Linorea: The batch that you placed earlier was chosen specifically for this region.
Linorea: I'll place a few more batches, and then the adventurers we hired will come over and clear out the Mekafish in the area.
Linorea: I believe that this batch will grow up healthy and restore the ecological environment in this area.
Linorea: Once enough water bodies have recovered, I'll write a long-form report. I'll tell the public what the Fontaine Research Institute has done to our natural environment.
Linorea: Just you wait, Damestier. I won't let you stop me again!

## Talk 6

Traveler: I'll check out the shallow waters.
Linorea: I'm counting on you. Unfortunately, given the state of my divesuit... that's all I can do right now.

### Additional Talk 1

Linorea: Hmph. These Mekafish are clockwork machines created by the Fontaine Research Institute. They're the ones ruining the waters in the Court of Fontaine!
Linorea: A water body usually has a balanced ecosystem where various fish and other creatures live together within a stable order. This order allows them to grow and thrive.
Linorea: Even though this order is sometimes disrupted when, say, people come to fish, when invasive species are introduced...
Linorea: Sometimes, the weather also shifts, causing some fish to leave these waters...
Linorea: There is a subtle balance being maintained within this water body, on the whole.
Linorea: But everything turned into a complete mess ever since those idiots at the Institute created the Mekafish!
Linorea: They promote them as tools that can keep the waters clean by removing trash and other assorted items in the water. Nothing else, they say!
Linorea: And at first, that is what they did, and we believed the nonsense they fed us.
Linorea: But after a while, we received reports that fish populations were constantly decreasing in water bodies where Mekafish were deployed.
Linorea: That's when we realized that the Mekafish labeled other fish as "trash" when doing their cleanup work!
Traveler: So that's how they define "clean water"...
Linorea: Faced with intense resistance from us, those researchers deactivated the Mekafish and prepared for their retrieval.
Linorea: But as they were preparing to do so, there was a huge explosion at the Institute...
Linorea: After that, some of those originally deactivated Mekafish reactivated themselves, and began attacking fish even more fiercely.
Linorea: Several of my colleagues and I agreed that this could not go on. If the Mekafish are left to run amok, they will bring calamity upon our aquatic ecosystem!
Linorea: So, with the help of several environmentalists, we planned to place suitable fish fry in various water bodies and cultivate new batches of fish through artificial means.
Linorea: On the other hand, we hired adventurers to constantly destroy and retrieve Mekafish, thus forming a two-pronged approach to protecting the ecology of our waters.
Traveler: An impressive ambition.
Linorea: Thank you for your praise â€” I know this doesn't sound like something a journalist should be doing.
Linorea: However, I believe that our duty to go to the frontline and do some practical work comes before writing essays and articles.
Linorea: Only by doing frontline work can we obtain the truest and most accurate information, with which the best report can be written.
Paimon: Wow, this reporter's really impressive...
Traveler: What can I do to help?
Linorea: Hmm? Well, thanks for your kind offer. My divesuit is currently non-functional, so I can't go underwater to distribute fish fry.
Linorea: If you don't mind, could you go down and do it for me? Shallow or deep zones, doesn't matter.
Traveler: An admirable plan.
Traveler: Everything that's not water is considered trash...

### Additional Talk 2

Linorea: These Mekafish... What a pain!
Traveler: What's happened?
Linorea: I did, but it fell apart quite quickly afterward.
Linorea: The Mekafish in this area have gone hog-wild, for... whatever reason.
Linorea: No sooner did I try to place the fish fry in their vicinity that they swarmed over, gobbling the fry up non-stop.
Linorea: Some of them even lunged at me to get the few fry hanging off my divesuit...
Linorea: I mean, I know they won't attack me... But that was still terrifying.
Linorea: I struggled, flailing in the water...
Linorea: I don't know how, but that tore another large hole in my divesuit somewhere... Fortunately, I was close enough to the shore that getting back up ultimately proved possible.
Linorea: As things stand, however, I won't be able to distribute the fry for the time being.
Linorea: Traveler, could you help me do it once again? Shallow or deep zones, doesn't matter.
Traveler: Have you fixed your divesuit?
