# Delicious Dry-Braised Salted Fish

Dried fish that has been grilled slowly over a charcoal flame. The rich fats ooze out as the fish meets the grill, and with those sizzling sounds, the fish is clothed in a burnished golden coat. The meat is firm but delicious, and the mouthfeel is quite delicate. Such is the unsurpassed gift of the seas.
