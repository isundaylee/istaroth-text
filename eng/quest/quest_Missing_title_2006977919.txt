# Missing title (2006977919)

Ningguang: Another Lantern Rite is upon us.
Ningguang: Traveler, it seems Liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. Do you miss it here?
Traveler: I miss it all the time.
Ningguang: Is that so? I am delighted to hear it.
Ningguang: Times change. Suddenly, the Lantern Rite of today is a wholly different affair from the past.
Ningguang: The preparations were very lengthy this time. I don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but I, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
Ningguang: I hope that it might be a highlight of your journey. If you ever grow weary in your travels, know that you can always come back and visit Liyue.
Traveler: My focus is on my mission, my journey.
Ningguang: Ah, naturally.
