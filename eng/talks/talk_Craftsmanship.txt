Traveler: Craftsmanship?
Shushan: The craftsmanship of cutting and transporting stones, the techniques required to carve on stone surfaces... These are only some of the many things a stonemason needs to learn to perfect their craft.
Shushan: There's not only jade to be found around here. All manner of high-quality stone lie in this vale, the best materials for building roads and houses.
Shushan: I'm not the only stonemason around these parts, but I'm sure everyone would want their family craft, passed down from generation to generation, to continue shining brightly.
Shushan: Am I wrong?
