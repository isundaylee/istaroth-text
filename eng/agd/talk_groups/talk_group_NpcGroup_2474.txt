Fryslan: No matter how many times I make the journey, it always feels so far to me. In a few years, I fear my body won't be able to endure it...

Traveler: Are you alright?
Fryslan: Thank you for your concern... I can still manage for now. I'm merely venting because of my sore legs.
Fryslan: If you think about it, the transportation distance is quite reasonable when purchasing commodities in bulk from Yilong Wharf right now...
Fryslan: You transport the goods from Yilong Wharf to the docks southeast of Qiaoying Village, follow the waterway to Wangshu Inn before transferring to Liyue Harbor, then load a ship bound for Dornman Port...
Fryslan: Direct land transportation through the Stone Gate is an option too, but it requires hiring too many carts. That's a hassle to manage, so water transportation is more convenient in the end.
Fryslan: I heard some amateur merchant from Mondstadt once transported goods by land the whole way through! What a madman! Just how long would it have taken him? How many dangerous areas did he have to pass through!?

Traveler: Can you introduce yourself real quick?
Fryslan: Hmm, your presence... I'm sure of it. You're a big boss here on business, aren't you?
Fryslan: Nice to meet you! I'm Fryslan, a tea merchant from Mondstadt, and I specialize in affordable tea leaves!
Fryslan: Tea leaves from Yilong Wharf are really popular! Each time I get back to Mondstadt, I sell out within two months!
Fryslan: As such, I'm considering purchasing some high-end tea leaves. That way, the customers get to enjoy them slowly, and I get to improve my profit margins...
Fryslan: Anyway, I'm a regular here. Same seat, same tea!
Fryslan: If you're planning to start a business in Mondstadt, you're welcome to work with me!

Traveler: I won't bother you then.
Fryslan: Huh? It's all right, you can sit down and have a chat. We can listen to stories and watch plays together too!
