Roshana: Are you here to take a picture with the Flower Carriage? Please, go ahead.
Roshana: No, the Flower Carriage has nothing to do with our shop. However, the end of its route is nearby, so it's being kept here temporarily for everyone to admire.
Roshana: A lot of first-time tourists keep coming to ask about it since they think our tavern set it up.
Roshana: Hmm... Maybe I should send Nesmil over there to drum up business...
