Vlad: Um... Have you figured it out yet?
Nadia: Hmm... I'm afraid not.
Nadia: I've been working here for a long time, but Liyue's local sayings are still a mystery to me.
Vlad: That's true. Makes you wonder, doesn't it — why would you sometimes use "wealth" as part of will-wishes, and sometimes as an invective...?
Nadia: ...I'd say we'd be better off not dwelling on that.
Nadia: I mean, something like "love" is expressed in many different languages, but the meaning that we mean to convey is the same, isn't it?
Vlad: Yes, you're right, of course. You know what? That's a good line — wouldn't look out of place on a gift envelope at all, I'd say!
