Pops Kai: I have this fragment...
Pops Kai: A fragment, you say? Show me.
Pops Kai: This writing... or maybe it's not writing at all. I can't read it, anyway.
Pops Kai: Ask the village chief, she's gotta know something.

Traveler: Tell me about your tea store.
Pops Kai: I set up shop here to provide some respite from the grueling and relentless farm work, both for old friends and for anyone else passing by.
Pops Kai: But as you can see, business could be a little better, hehehe.
Pops Kai: Still. Every time someone comes to me for a cup of tea and a chat, I think to myself, this is worth my while.

Traveler: Do you run the place on your own?
Pops Kai: That's right. My son and his wife are off elsewhere, chasing their dreams. It's just the grandkids and I who are left in the village.
Pops Kai: *sigh* If only I had an assistant, I could keep the place open while I was working in the fields.
