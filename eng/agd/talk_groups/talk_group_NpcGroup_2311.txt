Little Nine: I can't find it anywhere...
Traveler: What are you looking for?
Little Nine: A book... Big Nine wrote it specially for me.
Little Nine: I was playing with Big Nine before, he said he had a book for me.
Little Nine: I started reading it and got really into it... I was so into it that I didn't even notice when Big Nine left.
Little Nine: I went to look for him but then I fell in the river... I made it out, finally, but then I lost the book...
Little Nine: #Traveler, can you help me look for it? That book's really special to Big Nine, if I lose it he will be really sad.

Little Nine: Hmm, let's see... The river carried me a long way, I know that. The water was really cold, it froze my hands stiff...
Little Nine: But I definitely didn't open it! I held it as tight as I could, because Big Nine told me how special it is...
Little Nine: Finally, I crawled onto the river bank. The first thing I did was find somewhere to dry the book out in the sun.
Little Nine: Then I was so exhausted that I lay down and fell asleep for a while. When I woke up, the book was gone.
Little Nine: It was in the woods over there that I dried the book out. You can have a look in there.
