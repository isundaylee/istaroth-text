Aranishat: Aralila! The next match, Aranishat will hide like raindrops in the river.
Aranishat: Aralila can't find a raindrop in the river, so Aralila will lose!
Aralila: Aranishat, silly. Raindrops don't always fall into rivers, they get stopped by leaves, and flowers.
Aralila: Aranishat will hide like raindrops on the leaves, and Aralila will see Aranishat, easily.
Aranishat: Well... Then Aranishat will hide like a seed in the soil.
Aralila: Hmm... Aralila needs to think before searching, but Aranishat will lose!
