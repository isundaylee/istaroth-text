Traveler: How do you like it here?
Nilou: I—I'm good... No need to worry about me.
Nilou: I'm really happy that you invited me to hang out here...
Traveler: Are you nervous?
Nilou: Uh, um... Ugh, you saw right through me...
Nilou: *exhale* Give me a moment. ...I am in a sea of Zaytun Peaches.
Nilou: Gently push the peaches away... There. And that's how you chase the jitterbugs away.
Nilou: Ah, but back to your question... I really like the way you've decorated this place. It's so snug and cozy.
Nilou: But I've never left Sumeru City before, so suddenly being taken to a new place is...
Nilou: I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, or who to talk to...
Nilou: Can I stay here a little longer, so I can get used to everything?
Nilou: Hehe, I won't be nervous anymore once I'm more familiar with this place.
Traveler: Do you want to pet Tubby?
Nilou: Huh? Wait, so that round bird is named Tubby?
Nilou: *Giggle* That name is quite on the nose. It sure is descriptive.
Nilou: Just looking at her makes me feel relaxed, like right after you do a huuuge cat stretch.

Traveler: Want to chat?
Nilou: Sure, I'd be happy to. What do you want to chat about?
Traveler: I'd like to hear your latest thoughts...
Nilou: Huh? Mine?
Nilou: I've been wondering which came first: the audience or the performance?
Nilou: I'd probably have to sift through a whole bunch of documents and stuff if I really wanted to get that answer, but I'm no good at things like that.
Nilou: Hee-hee, so it's just a random thought...
Nilou: Oh no, we were supposed to chat together, but I've been doing all the talking...
Nilou: Alright, the ball's back to you — catch! I want to hear about your experiences and the people you've met.
Nilou: Tell me all about them! I'm all ears!
Traveler: About everyone at the Grand Bazaar...
Nilou: Oh, I just love the atmosphere. It feels like one big, happy family.
Nilou: Everyone has different personalities, so there are some small squabbles here and there...
Nilou: But if anyone runs into a problem, everyone else will help out however they can.
Nilou: Isn't that what family's like?
Nilou: They bicker and fight, but they'll always be your biggest supporters.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Nilou: Hmm... Want to make some flower pots?
Traveler: You know how to do that?
Nilou: Well, I didn't, but I wanted to do something memorable with you, so... I got my friends at the Grand Bazaar to help me learn in secret.
Nilou: Oh, don't worry, I made sure I knew how to make them before asking you.
Nilou: Because I want to, um...
Nilou: I'd like to transplant some Padisarahs.
Nilou: I grew them myself, and I've already picked out some good ones.
Nilou: They're my favorite flower, so I wanted to give them to you, my favorite person.
Nilou: May happy times always be with you.
Traveler: Thank you, Nilou.
Nilou: No need to thank me. As long as you like them.
Nilou: Whenever you're free, let me know and I'll do a performance for you.
Nilou: Relax, I'm confident now. I don't even need to do the deep breathing exercises... After all, we've already known each other for a long time now.
Traveler: Any flower you want to plant in particular?
Nilou: Yes — I've put a lot of thought into it.
Nilou: I want to do something special for you in return for all the help you've given me.
Nilou: You don't seem like you're too worried about anything, so my movement therapy won't be of much use. Instead, I was thinking...

Nilou: Wooow, how dazzling!
Nilou: Hehe, I actually noticed a long time ago that you have good taste in art.
Nilou: The same beauty is found in all forms of art. Whether it's a dance or a gemstone, you use the same pair of eyes to admire it, right?

## Talk 10

Nilou: Did you... build this theater yourself? Wow, it's the spitting image... Amazing.
Nilou: But we can't let a fantastic stage like this be without a dancer, can we?
Nilou: Hehe, I can't wait to try out my new dance on it. The dance still needs a name, though... Could you pick one for me?
