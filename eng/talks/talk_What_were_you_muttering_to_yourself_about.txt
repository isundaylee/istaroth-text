# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What were you muttering to yourself about?
Vile: Sara decided she wanted to import Liyue chili peppers recently. Allegedly, they're hot enough to reduce even Mondstadt's die-hard spice lover Barbara to tears.
Vile: My view is they'd be nigh on impossible to sell, seeing as eighty-six percent of Mondstadters won't touch them.
Traveler: ...Barbara is a die-hard spice lover?
Vile: Oh, you hadn't heard? It was my understanding that everyone in Mondstadt knew.
Traveler: Tell me some more things that everyone in Mondstadt knows.
Vile: Things like when Outrider Amber volunteered to cook at the last Knights of Favonius get-together, burnt the steak, and smoked out the whole kitchen?
Vile: Even though Amber made everyone there promise to never tell a soul...
Vile: ...I think you might be the last person in Mondstadt to hear about it.
Traveler: You should tell her about your concerns.
Vile: Oh believe me, I've tried.
Vile: If I can't think of anything better, I may have to send in Prince Charming...
Vile: Kaeya's got a certain way with words. He would only need to drop a few subtle hints and the whole thing would be sorted.
Vile: Ahem. Anyway. Thanks for the chat.
