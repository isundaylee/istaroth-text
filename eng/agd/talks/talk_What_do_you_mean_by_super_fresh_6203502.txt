Uncle Sun: What do you mean by "super fresh"?
Uncle Sun: The only fish that I sell here are "super fresh" fish.
Uncle Sun: It might not sound like there's much difference between fresh and super fresh, but they couldn't be more different. In terms of size, or quality, you name it. They're worlds apart!
Uncle Sun: And I can guarantee one thing for sure: my prices are better than the opposite stand over there.
Uncle Sun: The opposite stand...
Uncle Sun: *sigh* You see, not long ago we were both charging higher prices, but my fish were selling better because they were more fresh.
Uncle Sun: Then, Uncle Gao started lowering his prices, probably just jealous of all the business I was getting. Before I knew it, I was stuck in a price war with him.
Uncle Sun: So in order to provide fresh fish to everyone at a reasonable price, I decided to lower my prices to just breaking even...
Uncle Sun: *sigh* I don't know how long I can keep my prices so low. I can only count on the support of all my local customers at this point.
