## Talk

Reza: There's only so much I can do sometimes...

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Reza: Hello, I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos, in charge of tax levies, customs, etc.
Reza: Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
Reza: And make sure to report any violations. Everyone will thank you for it... except the offenders.

## Talk

Traveler: Need help?
Reza: Thanks for asking, but some of the problems go a long way back and can't be easily changed.
Reza: According to new Sumeru regulations, foreign trading is limited to Port Ormos, but a lot of people have been doing business in the city for a long time...
Reza: It's just too hard to dissuade them from the old way of trading.
Reza: So it's not that we don't want to solve certain issues, but that we just don't know how.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Reza: Farewell and safe journeys.

## Talk

Traveler: Violations...
Reza: Port Ormos is the key trade hub in Sumeru, so the most common offense is smuggling.
Reza: Anyone seen sneaking around with suspicious cargo is likely a smuggler.
Reza: For your financial security, please do not give in to greed and refrain from dealings with suspicious individuals.
Reza: Also, occasionally — and I mean occasionally — there would be fugitives trying to escape from here.
Reza: If you run across them, don't try to stop them and just flag down one of the Eremites patrolling nearby for help.
