## Talk

Gontharet: *sigh* What are we going to do about this?

## Talk

Traveler: What's the matter?
Gontharet: There's something terribly wrong in Fontaine, that's what! Something's got to change, and we're all responsible for making that happen! We have to band together and fight for our rights!

## Talk

Traveler: Not working?
Gontharet: Work? Why, I'm doing something far more important than work!
Gontharet: Those who always work and work will find themselves little different from clockwork machines. It is only through constant questioning and asking that we can forge a new path!
Gontharet: Our history and present are all proof of this.
Gontharet: If you do not mind treating me to a cup of coffee, we can continue this line of conversation.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Gontharet: ...Wait, you're leaving already?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you talking about, anyway?
Gontharet: Fontaine, of course, Fontaine! The Palais Mermonia, our energy situation, our top-down system... We have so many problems here. Can't you see?
Gontharet: I've spoken to Arouet about them many times, and he agrees with my points â€” why, he's even treated me to coffee several times!
Gontharet: It's just that... Well, that hasn't worked as well recently. He says that my opinions don't attract him the way they used to.
