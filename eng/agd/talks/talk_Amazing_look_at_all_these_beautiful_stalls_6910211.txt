Mualani: Amazing... look at all these beautiful stalls! ...I can arrange them however I want? Really!? Okay, lemme think...
Mualani: Let's put the Snug Saurian Lounger here... and a display for the night-time sunglasses over there, and... oh, we can't forget the Friendship Triangle Tandem Surfboard! It takes three people to ride it, and oh boy, is it a blast!
Mualani: These are all brand-new products I got in recently. See anything you like? Feel free to take your pick, it's on me!
