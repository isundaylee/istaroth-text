Michiru: Ah, my daughter has fled the country for some time now. I wonder how she's doing...
Yoh: Now, now, didn't our daughter say so in her letter? She's doing well! We don't have to worry.
Michiru: But... She might've been fine when she wrote this letter, but how can we be sure that she didn't encounter any trouble afterward?
Michiru: Not having seen her in person, I can't help but be worried...
Yoh: Just relax. She'll be okay. She is our daughter, after all!
Yoh: Our daughter has been independent since she was little. She knows how to take care of herself. She started cooking for herself at the age of seven or eight. Why, by the time she was a teenager, she could already sail out to sea by herself.
Yoh: She enjoys being free and traveling around. She must have been really unhappy at being trapped in Inazuma.
Michiru: But...
Yoh: Trust me, she'll be fine. She is out of the country, living a free and happy life. She's probably made new friends already.
Yoh: Whenever you think of her, take her letter out and read it again.
Yoh: If our daughter knew how much you worry about her every day, she would be troubled, too.
