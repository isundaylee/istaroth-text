Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Alof: Suddenly, the sound of flapping wings soared through the palace, and a flight of owls swooped in through a window.
Alof: They were the friends of the palace musician, and when the monsters invaded, the musician knew that the palace would become a battleground, and so had sent those owls away to the forest â€” and now, they had returned.
Alof: These warriors, who could see through the darkness, circled throughout the palace, using their hoots to alert the musician to the places where enemies lurked.
Alof: The musician sat before their organ, a grand instrument that had played during countless balls, and which was powerful enough to send its music through to every last corner of the palace.
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Alof: The palace soldiers lifted up their hearts and swords amidst the great swell of the organ, for they now knew where they should swing.
Alof: The musician played, pausing periodically to hearken to the owls' observations, while the soldiers would form defensive formations during those brief pauses.
Alof: Thus were the monsters repelled as the warriors used the palace as their fortress, driving them out through the darkness under the guidance of the owls and the musician.
Alof: At last, peace was restored to the palace, and the music that guided the warriors into battle became widespread... And that's how the story ends.
Traveler: (Stop listening...)
