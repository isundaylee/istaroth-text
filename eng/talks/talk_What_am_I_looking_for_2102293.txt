Traveler: What am I looking for?
Soraya: Hmm... Text, essentially. Written messages from the past.
Soraya: And if you're looking for text in ruins as ancient as these, that means looking for stone pillars and stone tablets.
Soraya: Stone is the oldest, most durable medium for written communication. All the more so in the domain of the Geo Archon.
Soraya: The stones here have borne witness to all of history. I am sure they will not disappoint.
