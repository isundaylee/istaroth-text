# Owe Mora, Pay Mora


## Talk 1

Goth: *sigh* I suppose I might have to sort this out myself...
Goth: Ack, these old bones will fall apart at this rate...
Traveler: Is there some urgent matter?
Goth: Oh, Traveler? Well, this... I wouldn't call it "an urgent matter," but it is getting out of hand for sure...
Goth: As you know, those Fatui have my hotel fully booked.
Goth: And as you know, I, as the boss of the Goth Grand Hotel, have to attend to them.
Goth: I coordinate food catering, repairs, and a slew of miscellaneous matters besides.
Goth: Lately, some rooms have had their furniture damaged, so I've had to contact people to bring the appropriate timber to some carpenters.
Goth: Then there's the matter of collecting rent on a few apartments... and the matter of my lad Marvin being nowhere to be found.
Goth: *sigh* I wonder how long I can last... Or when that boy will finally grow up...
Traveler: I'll lend you a hand.
Goth: You're willing to help? Ah, that's wonderful! ... *sigh* If only that loud Marvin had as good a head on his shoulders as you. That would've spared me much trouble...
Goth: In that case, could I trouble you to fetch some Fir Wood and Birch Wood? I'll need to have them sent to the carpenters soon.
Traveler: You rest here first.

## Talk 2

Goth: Have you obtained the timber? I just need one set of Fir Wood and another of Birch Wood.

## Talk 3

Goth: Thank you so much. These should do. Now to send them off to the carpenter... Oh. Right! I need to collect rent as well...
Goth: *sigh* I just wonder if that... As... Astromona, or whatever she was called, will be in this time...
Traveler: It's Mona Megistus, the Astrologist.
Goth: Right! Yes, that was her name... Ugh. It's a bit long, if you ask me.
Paimon: Mona hasn't paid her rent, you say?
Goth: Well, that's just the thing, see? All my other tenants have already paid theirs. She's the only one left.
Goth: I came by a few times previously, but she wasn't in.
Goth: So please, Traveler, help me go down there and urge her to pay up soon, would you?

## Talk 4

Goth: As... Astro... Hmm, what was her name again?

## Talk 5

Traveler: The Knights of Favonius Library, I'd say.
Paimon: The library... Ooh, that's right! The library's a pretty big place. Maybe she's looking for research materials in there!
Paimon: Well, time to get moving!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Good Hunter. I hear there's salad to be had there.
Paimon: Good Hunter... Hmm... Right, maybe she's gone there for some salad. Let's go have a look.
Paimon: Well, that's assuming she has enough Mora on hand to buy salad...

## Talk 7

Traveler: Let's just go to Katheryne directly.
Paimon: Katheryne, huh? That's a good pick for sure — she knows basically everything, after all!
Paimon: Well, let's get going!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Mona, are you home?
Traveler: Mona, it's rent time!
Paimon: Huh. Mona really doesn't seem to be home...
Paimon: That's weird. Isn't she cooped up in that house most of the time? Is she out on some business?
Paimon: ...Or maybe she's unable to come to the door, faint from hunger as she is?
Traveler: I doubt things are that bad...
Paimon: Huh. Is that so?
Paimon: But where should we go to find Mona...
Traveler: Didn't she say that she's found some way to make money?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Well, no sign of Mona. Lisa isn't in, either.
Paimon: Let's go ask that Knight at the door. Maybe he's seen Mona.

## Talk 10

Wyratt: Hello. How may I assist?
Traveler: Excuse me, have you seen a girl who looks something like this...
Black Screen Text: You describe Mona's distinguishing features to Wyratt...
Wyratt: Oh! I know who you're talking about. It's the girl with the really big hat!
Wyratt: She often comes by to consult some of the texts we keep here. She spends the whole day reading, so she's quite the memorable patron.
Wyratt: That said, she hasn't swung by recently. I doubt you'll find her hereabouts...
Traveler: Seems we're a little late.
Wyratt: If she does come by, I'll make sure to tell her that you're looking for her.
Wyratt: That's all I can do for you in this case, unfortunately...
Traveler: No problem. Thank you.
Wyratt: Think nothing of it.
Paimon: Well, looks like Mona's not in the library. Guess we've got to tell Goth that we couldn't find her...

## Talk 11

Sara: Hi there! Would you like to order anything?
Traveler: Excuse me, have you seen a girl who looks something like this...
Black Screen Text: You describe Mona's distinguishing features to Sara...
Sara: Oh, you mean Mona, don't you? At one time, she came by every evening to grab some salad — she sometimes even asked me for an extra egg or two.
Paimon: Guess she's as short of Mora as ever, huh...
Sara: She hasn't come once in the past few days, though.
Sara: If you're in a hurry to find her, I can pass a message on to her for you the next time she comes by to get salad.
Traveler: Thanks.
Paimon: Looks like Mona hasn't been to Good Hunter. Ugh, guess we've got to go tell Goth that we couldn't find her today...

## Talk 12

Katheryne: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: Have you seen Mona recently?
Katheryne: Mona? Hmm... No, I can't say I have...
Katheryne: If you're in a hurry to find her, why not post a commission here at the Guild?
Traveler: Thanks, but we'll look for her ourselves.
Paimon: Hmm. Katheryne's got no clue where Mona is. Guess it's back to Goth to tell him that we couldn't find her today...

## Talk 13

Goth: How did it go? Were you able to find that Ast... Well, your friend?
Traveler: She doesn't seem to be home today.
Goth: Well, alright that. She doesn't really owe that much rent. We can put it off for a few days.
Goth: Ah, yes. Please take these for your help in the meantime.
