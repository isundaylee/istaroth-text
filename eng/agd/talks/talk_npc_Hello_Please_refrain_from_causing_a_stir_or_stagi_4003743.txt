Jinzhong: Hello. Please refrain from causing a stir or staging any commercial promotions in this area... Oh, sorry. I didn't recognize you there.
Jinzhong: People from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor have been coming here often quite recently for... "business development," was it called? Either way, it's been a massive headache. Please excuse my rudeness.
Jinzhong: Back on topic, then. Do you have something to report to the Millelith?
