Rumipaq: So, mountains like this exist in Teyvat... Living to see victory is such a blessing!

## Talk

Traveler: A lover of climbing, I see?
Rumipaq: Of course. The mountains are my playground, and the mountaintops are my laurels of victory!
Rumipaq: Victories against who, I hear you ask? Why, my former self, of course!
Rumipaq: Victory is when the mountains you climb today are higher than those you climbed the day before.
Rumipaq: My apologies, this is just how we are in Natlan.
Rumipaq: Or should I say, this is how most of us Scions of the Canopy think. If you were talking to the Children of Echoes, they'd probably tell you about heading deep into the mountains, rather than climbing them.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Rumipaq: Goodbye, my friend. May all your battles end in victory!

## Talk

Traveler: Be careful not to disturb anyone while you're up there.
Rumipaq: I know, I know. I was already warned by a young girl out gathering herbs.
Rumipaq: Huh. You look surprised. Did you think I didn't know how this place is home to the adepti of Liyue? Or are you just shocked that I'm making friends with the locals?
Rumipaq: To be fair, I'm a little surprised by that last one myself.
Rumipaq: That kid was so small she could hardly form a proper sentence, but she climbed all the way up here. Are all people from Liyue born naturally good at extreme sports?
