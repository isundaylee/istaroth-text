Traveler: About Marana...
Araja: It's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
Araja: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
Araja: On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
Araja: They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
Araja: Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
Araja: ...Now that you defeated Marana's Avatar with Arama, and the forest sees another Ashvattha, everything should take a turn for the better.

Traveler: About the Aranyaka...
Araja: Nara Varuna left this, and Arama is giving it to you. Arama thinks he did the right thing.
Araja: It's filled with stories between you and Aranara, right? Araja knows that Nara will forget about how to dream, and forget about us.
Araja: However, as long as the Aranyaka keeps the records of our stories and names, you can always read it without the memories about Aranara.
Araja: When that day comes, Araja hopes you will find these stories interesting and touching.

Traveler: About Arama...
Araja: Araja misses him very much. With Arama turning into the new Ashvattha, Araja's dreams have become quieter.
Araja: The time when Nara and Aranara spend time together, and walk the shades together. Araja can't recall anything like that, but stories remain.
Araja: Araja was hoping, Arama could see a similar world as a seed. But everything ends up in Sarva, where Nara and Aranara will be joined.
Araja: #Also, Araja is delighted, for the friendship between Arama and Nara Traveler.

Traveler: About Arana...
Araja: Arana is also an ancient Aranara, with so many blooms and rainfall captured in memories.
Araja: Because of the overflowing love for Nara and the forest, Arana refuses to be Vasara Tree. Vasara Tree, can't play with Nara.
Araja: Araja heard that, Arana and Narana went traveling together. All the stories and beautiful things on the trip, hopefully, will make up for Arana's loss.
