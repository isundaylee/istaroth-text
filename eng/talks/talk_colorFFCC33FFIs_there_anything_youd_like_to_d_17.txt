Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Ganyu: I thought maybe we could plant some flowers together. Or some other plants, like... vegetables...
Traveler: You must be good at gardening, huh?
Ganyu: Yes, indeed... You could say it's my greatest hobby... aside from work.
Ganyu: Though in the past, I've been reluctant to grow vegetables... I always worried that I wouldn't be able to control my appetite and I'd end up eating them all in one sitting...
Ganyu: But I'm sure that if I grow them together with you, I'll definitely be able to control myself!
Traveler: Even if you did eat them all, it wouldn't be such a big deal.
Ganyu: No, uh... you don't understand, I...
Ganyu: I—I put on weight very easily, and...
Ganyu: If my appearance changed, then perhaps... I—I mean, the way people see me — well, the way you see me...
Traveler: ...Would remain unchanged.
Ganyu: Oh! Uh...
Ganyu: Still, I... I think it would be best to share them with you. You know, first rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Ganyu: ...Anyway! I'll go, uh... fetch some seeds. I'll make sure they're the very best.
Traveler: I'll eat them with you, then.
Ganyu: Great! And, uh... you'll help me plant them too, right...? First rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Traveler: I've never seen you grow vegetables before.
Ganyu: That's because... I've always feared I wouldn't be able to control my appetite, and that I'd end up eating all the vegetables I grew in one sitting...
