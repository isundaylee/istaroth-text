Traveler: You can see a person's spirit?
Sergeant Lin: It would be an exaggeration to use the word "see." "Sensing" is more like it.
Sergeant Lin: After all, I'm from the military. I've dealt with plenty of opponents before.
Sergeant Lin: Some were excellent assassins who were good at concealing themselves, not showing their weapons until the very last moment.
Sergeant Lin: I exposed their disguises through the extraordinary presences they had, which they could not quite hide.
Sergeant Lin: And when I fought the ones that could conceal themselves that way... I just had to do my best to block their attacks.
Sergeant Lin: Still, I try to avoid being on the back foot as much as possible.
Sergeant Lin: Anyway, learning to sense these auras is a valuable defensive skill, and the sharper your senses are, the better.
