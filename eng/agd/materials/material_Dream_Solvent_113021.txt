# Dream Solvent

An item capable of changing Character Level-Up Materials obtained from memories and trials into whatever form is needed.
People once believed that spirits and memories had some material form. If someone dreamed of heaven before waking up clutching a flower, then that blossom must have been made from such a fantasy. Dream Solvent dissolves that which is obtained from memory and transforms it into some other dream.
Indeed, blows traded with the strong are stepping stones towards becoming stronger yourself.
