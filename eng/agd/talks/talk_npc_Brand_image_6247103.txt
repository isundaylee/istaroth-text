Traveler: Brand image?
Vert Jr.: What do you think? It's your first time hearing this term, I'll bet!
Vert Jr.: My elder sister Rouge and I are both representatives of this profession!
Vert Jr.: We still haven't made a name for ourselves in the Court of Fontaine, sure, but many stores have sought out our help!
Vert Jr.: We offer comprehensive assistance to stores to improve their public brand, including but not limited to advertisements, news columns, short videos, large-scale events, etc.
Vert Jr.: For many stores, their excellent service is not reflected in their reputation. However, through the publicity we offer, we will bring their repute up to par with their ability.
Vert Jr.: According to the information we've collected, some restaurants in Liyue are suffering from this issue...
Vert Jr.: Most restaurants here offer delicious cuisine at reasonable prices, so they rarely have any competitors in the same price range. Residents only need to spend a small amount of Mora to enjoy a sumptuous feast.
Vert Jr.: However, more high-end food and beverage brands are needed... After all, even chefs require the support of a brand image.
Vert Jr.: If all restaurants operated on a small scale, the culinary profession would be seen as tons of work for little money. Few would be willing to take up the culinary arts.
Vert Jr.: If this profession is to have a future, we'll also need outfits that target the wealthy, earn big, and pay chefs handsomely...
Vert Jr.: This high-low combination will allow the general public to enjoy delicious food without worry. It would also be respectable to be a chef, and you'd be paid proportionately to your skill.
Vert Jr.: Maybe I can help improve this situation... I'll need to get a better understanding of Liyue's food industry first, though.
Vert Jr.: Best to start our research from Yilong Wharf before gradually expanding outward...
