# Charles' Troubles


## Talk 1

Paimon: Lisa? Are you here about the tax return?
Lisa: Oh, hello darling. You're quite right. After I heard about poor Jean, I thought I might lend a hand with some of her more literary duties.
Paimon: Cool, well if we're no longer needed here, we'll be on our way.
Lisa: Oh wait a moment... Actually, Charles here was wonderingâ€”
Charles: Please, allow me, ma'am.
Charles: I just took a rather important order, but unfortunately we've run completely dry and the delivery from the winery is behind schedule.
Charles: If it's not too much trouble, could you go and *do something about this logistical nuisance*?
Paimon: What's so urgent about this order?
Charles: *sigh* It came in at the last minute. Literally, just a few seconds ago.
Lisa: Exactly, hence the urgency.
Traveler: Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Traveler: Okay, but my next drink here had better be on the house!
Charles: Heh... I'm positive that next time my boss Master Diluc is here, he'll pick up the tab for you.
Paimon: Sounds about right!

## Talk 2

Paimon: So this is where Charles' delivery got to.
Ernest: Have you come to rescue me? I've been waiting long enough.
Ernest: In all the time I've been working at the winery, this is the first time I've been robbed by hilichurls. *sigh*
Ernest: If you'd taken any longer, I don't know what I would have done.
Paimon: #Fear not. Traveler here is a hilichurl exterminator extraordinaire!
Ernest: Just as well. Then... please escort this *transporter* to the end of the road.
Ernest: And be careful with it. Just beating up the hilichurls is the not the aim here. You'd better *make sure the goods stay intact* because I certainly don't have the Mora to replace them.
Ernest: I'll be waiting up ahead.

## Talk 3

Charles: It's not uncommon for delivery workers to take a couple of bottles for themselves and make a bit of extra cash on the side. But obviously you don't seem like the type.

## Talk 4

Ernest: Thank you, my friend. I thought I was in deep trouble this time. It's a good thing you showed up.
Ernest: I'll put in a good word for you with the gentlemen at the winery.
