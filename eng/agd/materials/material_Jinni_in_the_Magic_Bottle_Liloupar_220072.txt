# Jinni in the Magic Bottle â€” Liloupar

Born from water lilies, Liloupar, the great Jinni, whose soul had been shattered due to an ancient punishment, was sealed in a transparent magic bottle.
Now, it seems that she has found a new master...

Although she only possesses a-hundred-millionth of her previous great power, she will use what is left of her to help her master pass through the hot sand and ancient ruins of the Desert of Hadramaveth.
