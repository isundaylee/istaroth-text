# Floating Spirits â€” The Investigation Ends

Katheryne: Thanks for your efforts thus far, Adventurer. We have been able to gather sufficient data concerning these Specters.
Traveler: Glad I could help.
Katheryne: Mm-hmm. The observational reports you gathered were very important indeed.
Katheryne: I believe that you need not worry about Specters threatening the ordinary people going forward. I will organize the intelligence we've gathered and submit them to professional researchers for study.
Katheryne: Ah, and yes, please don't forget to claim your rewards from the Guild!
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! The Adventurers' Guild thanks you for your services!
Traveler: Some extra rewards would make for a nice thank-you.
Katheryne: Haha, no problem. In that case, be sure to take part in future commissions as well.
