Mikoshi Genichirou: Hello, see anything you like? If you can't find the right one, I can have one custom-made for you.

Traveler: I'd like to get some souvenirs.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Be my guest. Just let me know when you see something that you like.

Traveler: Tell me about your store...
Mikoshi Genichirou: You mean where the name of this store came from?
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, I see you're not from Inazuma.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Netsuke is a kind of small craftwork that the Inazumans carry with them as pendants. Generally, they are carved into different shapes based on the owner's preference.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Take this one for instance. If you cross the rope from the inner side of the belt and then hang a coin pouch, seal or stamp on it, the netsuke will be stuck onto the belt. Convenient, eh?
Mikoshi Genichirou: As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.

Traveler: What can you make to order?
Mikoshi Genichirou: What would you like? Just tell me, and I will do my best to make it happen.
Mikoshi Genichirou: This store may not be as famous as those old family stores on this street, but we are still proud of our fine craftsmanship.
Mikoshi Genichirou: To be honest, I'm actually the eldest son of my family, but people always say that I am simple and dull, and that I probably won't be able to carry on with the family business.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, that's why I would rather start a small store here and help the neighbors out with my handiwork.
