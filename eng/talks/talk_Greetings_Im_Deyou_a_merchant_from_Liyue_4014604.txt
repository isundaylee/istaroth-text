Deyou: Greetings. I'm Deyou, a merchant from Liyue.
Paimon: Oh, are you here to purchase potions, too?
Deyou: That's right. Your store's doing pretty well, so I'm sure my sales will be good this time... Yeah, very sure...
Paimon: You don't sound very confident...
Paimon: Hey now, our potions are selling super well — orders just keep pouring in, we can barely cope!
Deyou: My apologies. I'm not doubting your sales figures...
Deyou: It's my business that hasn't been going too well. Every time I buy popular products, they just don't sell before prices go down all around — I post losses nine out of ten times.
Deyou: I always convince myself it's just bad luck, but if I have nothing but bad luck, does that mean that I'm just... not cut out for this...?
Deyou: If I don't make any money this time, I'll pack up, head home, and just work for my father.
Traveler: Maybe you're just choosing the wrong products?
Deyou: Is that so...? I suppose there's still much for me to learn.
Deyou: Right. You're right. I can't stay down like this. I'll make money this time — and I'll impress my father, make him see what I'm made of...
Deyou: Okay! Down to business. Let's talk terms.
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Deyou: These are the types of potion I plan to purchase this time.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Deyou: Don't worry. Caution is the better part of valor — and business.
Traveler: Perhaps the issue is with your sales strategy.
