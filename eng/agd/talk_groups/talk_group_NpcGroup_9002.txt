Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Kamisato Ayaka: Haha, you've no need to worry.
Kamisato Ayaka: The sights here are nothing like what I've seen at home. There are new wonders to be found with each step.
Kamisato Ayaka: But there's also an added layer of significance to it, because this place belongs to you.
Traveler: Make yourself at home. I mean it quite literally, haha.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh...
Kamisato Ayaka: That would be too unseemly...
Kamisato Ayaka: However, I appreciate your kindness.
Traveler: It's my pleasure.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahaha... That's very considerate of you. However, you don't have to go above and beyond for me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Please let me know if you ever need my assistance. I hope I can be of some help to you too.
Traveler: I hope that it's a place where you can let go of your worries and just relax.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hm... I appreciate your kindness.
Kamisato Ayaka: I wouldn't dare "let go" and "relax." However, I am more than grateful for being able to rest here for a while.

Traveler: *Do you want to chat?*
Kamisato Ayaka: I'd be delighted. What would you like to talk about...?
Traveler: Let's talk about poetry.
Kamisato Ayaka: My affection for the arts stems from the education I received at home.
Kamisato Ayaka: Whenever I try to delve deeper into the meaning behind the words of a poem, I gain a better understanding of the author's state of mind.
Kamisato Ayaka: Through the author's eyes, I can immerse myself in the sights that only they have seen. Even if the subject is well-known to me, I am able to gain a deeper level of appreciation for it.
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Kamisato Ayaka: "Camellia petals fall to the ground, scattered among the raindrops of yesterday."
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: Just reading it makes me sentimental. This must be what people call "the power of art."
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah... How rude of me to talk about my own interests all the time.
Kamisato Ayaka: Even though I initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you...
Kamisato Ayaka: Would you mind if I took up a bit more of your time? Tell me about the things you like.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Is that alright?
Traveler: Let's talk about natural scenery.
Kamisato Ayaka: Talking about the beauty of nature, it is important to mention that the people of Inazuma believe that everything has its own spiritual essence.
Kamisato Ayaka: Even though we might be familiar with the way nature looks on the surface, each type of scenery evokes a different kind of "feeling."
Kamisato Ayaka: At least, that's a romantic way of approaching this topic.

Traveler: *Anything you want to do?*
Kamisato Ayaka: Hm... Would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
Kamisato Ayaka: In other words... Do you want to try my home-made matcha?
Kamisato Ayaka: I have read in a book before that Mondstadt and Liyue each have their own, unique tea cultures.
Kamisato Ayaka: But when it comes to the intricacies of tea-making, the people of Inazuma also have their insights.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'd like you to try some authentic Inazuma Matcha and tell me what you think!
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Perhaps your feedback will also deepen my understanding of the tea ceremony.
Traveler: I'm pretty sure that someone of your status shouldn't be making tea for me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Please don't say that.
Kamisato Ayaka: You're the one who's embarked on epic journeys to distant places and achieved many great feats.
Kamisato Ayaka: The title of "the daughter of the Kamisato Clan" and involvement in the Yashiro Commission pales in comparison to the depths of your experiences.
Kamisato Ayaka: More importantly... I hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities...
Kamisato Ayaka: I'll just think of you as... my closest confidant.
Traveler: (Closest confidant...)
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: Can I... hold your hand?
Traveler: Let me make some desserts to go along with the tea.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Really?!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem... Please excuse my lack of manners. It is because I'm excited.
Kamisato Ayaka: Being able to enjoy tea with my closest confidant — it feels like I'm in a dream...

## Talk 9

Kamisato Ayaka: These stalls look to have been quite carefully arranged.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's a little deserted here, but it's enough for us to put aside our troubles and enjoy some festive fun and relaxation. Even if it's just the two of us, and even if it's our own kind of festival.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you. This truly makes me happy.

## Talk 10

Kamisato Ayaka: Having a dojo in one's home is akin to placing one's sword on the table. It is a reminder to never be negligent.
Kamisato Ayaka: One of the fundamental principles of the Kamisato Art of Tachi Jutsu is to constantly sharpen your mind, as you would a blade.
Kamisato Ayaka: Since we're both here, would you like to train together?
