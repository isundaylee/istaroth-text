## Talk

Chitose: Tch. Nothing through the smuggling pipeline either, huh...
Chitose: What can I do for you? If you're a tourist, go look for the Outlander Affairs Agency.

## Talk

Traveler: Momoyo?
Chitose: Who? You've got the wrong person.

## Talk

Traveler: Alright. See you.
Chitose: See you.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else. See you.
Chitose: See you.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry about that. What are you going by nowadays?
Chitose: I don't know what you're talking about...
Chitose: ...
Chitose: *sigh* Alright. Looks like there's no hiding from you. Just call me "Chitose" for now.

## Talk

Traveler: New mission, Chitose?
Chitose: Fine. I can tell you — I do still owe you, after all. Hmph. Would make it easier for you to watch your own back, too. You've got Fatui enemies everywhere, after all.
Chitose: I'm still investigating that "Teacher" character. We captured one of his aides, and "persuaded" him to provide us with some interesting information.
Chitose: This "Teacher" was originally an instructor at the House of the Hearth. When the title of "The Knave" changed hands, he broke off with some unsuspecting subordinates and pursued the previous Knave's directives.

## Talk

Traveler: About Lyudochka...
Chitose: Lyudochka? I don't recall anyone by the name. Don't you mean "Gendou Ringo"?
Chitose: And those broken pieces of paper aren't giving her too much trouble, are they?

## Talk

Traveler: Changes?
Chitose: Several years ago, a serious clash appears to have occurred between the previous Knave and a certain child at the House of the Hearth — this led to the latter replacing the former.
Chitose: Of course, this assumes that our captive speaks the truth. Taking a Fatuus's words at face value would be the height of folly.

## Talk

Traveler: You don't know?
Chitose: The "Teacher" appears to be using The Knave's name to keep a hold over his subordinates as they act across various nations — his goal and present affiliation, however, are unclear.
Chitose: He has likely left some "tacks" within Inazuma. My goal is to find every last one — and pluck them out.

## Talk

Traveler: She's doing a great job at the shrine.
Chitose: Hmph. Good. She's more suited to that work than I.
Chitose: You should be taking care of yourself — you and your floating white friend. Keep getting yourself in trouble like this, and you'll grieve "Gendou Ringo"'s poor heart.

## Talk

Traveler: I hope everything goes well for you.
Chitose: Heh. Rather than wish me well, you'd best take care of yourself. You'll grieve people if you keep rushing into danger the way you have until now.
