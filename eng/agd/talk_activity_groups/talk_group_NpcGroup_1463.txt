Eury: Hello! Are you looking for anything in particular?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm just browsing.
Eury: I envy those who can show restraint when shopping...
Eury: Once I see an "on sale" sign, the Mora in my coin pouch goes away like the wind...
Eury: *sigh* Have you seen my alcoholic scoundrel of a husband by any chance? I hope he's not scurried off to find a drink somewhere...

## Talk

Traveler: What have you bought?
Eury: Just now, a beautiful gemstone ring caught my attention.
Eury: I accidentally picked it up. It was a huge mistake...
Eury: I should've known. The price tag is something I can't afford...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Eury: Okay, goodbye! Hope you enjoy Mondstadt!

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Eury: *sigh* I only realized that those days of window-shopping and haggling with shopkeepers was "peace" when I experienced Stormterror's attack.
Eury: I was originally planning to get my husband to kick his drinking habit...
Eury: ...But in celebration of this hard-won peace, I suppose I can put it off for now.
