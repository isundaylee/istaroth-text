Traveler: No, I'm really strong.
Yohanan: Whoa, talk about a braggart.
Yohanan: Well, here's hoping you're strong enough to survive the rainforest.
Yohanan: Otherwise, you'll end up like that researcher over there, who can't afford to hire anyone and just wanders around crowded places.
Yohanan: *sigh* I've heard that many researchers frequent the rainforest to study it, so there are more opportunities to make Mora here. Why can't I find anyone who'll hire me?
Yohanan: I really envy "Flame-Mane." It's said that she's got a huge job in the city. I'll make her buy me some drinks when I get back to the city!
