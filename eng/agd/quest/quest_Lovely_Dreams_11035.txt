# Lovely Dreams


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, didn't we promise Xingqiu that we'd tell him what we found out?
Paimon: #Traveler, should we make a trip to the Feiyun Commerce Guild? It's totally up to you!

## Talk 2

Paimon: So, about your move to Liyue Harbor... You gonna tell the other adepti about it?
Xianyun: I have left an explanatory note in my abode. Those two old fossils will discover it, I am sure, should they come seeking my company.
Xianyun: Considering their recent penchant for going off on... private escapades, however, I find myself caring little for how they shall receive this news, hmph.

## Talk 3

Traveler: (What seems like a book of accounts. A letter can also be found inside.)
Unsigned Letter: Little Yu, my dear daughter... By the time you read this, Mommy and Daddy will have already left to go on a long journey.
Unsigned Letter: Your Granny may get a little forgetful sometimes, so try to jot down little reminders for her around the house whenever you can. Mommy and Daddy are counting on you to take care of Granny while we're gone!
Unsigned Letter: You might be wondering why Mommy and Daddy have to leave. Well, my dear daughter, in this world, everyone's got something that they just have to do. Your Mommy and Daddy are no different!
Unsigned Letter: Did you know? Daddy was actually awfully sick as a child. How sick, you might ask? Well, even the doctor could barely feel Daddy's pulse, it was that weak!
Unsigned Letter: But Daddy still managed to grow up. Looking back, there were many times when Daddy thought he might not make it. In the end, though, Daddy pushed through every time. Pretty amazing, if you think about it.
Unsigned Letter: Maybe Daddy is just really lucky. Or, who knows, maybe he has some super powerful adeptus looking out for him? Either way, Daddy has always felt like he's received a lot of love from this world.
Unsigned Letter: And you know what? Daddy loves this world right back. They told Daddy that this mission would be super dangerous, but both Mommy and Daddy decided to sign up.
Unsigned Letter: You'll have grown quite a bit taller the next time Mommy and Daddy see you again. Maybe you'll be so big by then that Mommy and Daddy won't even recognize you.
Unsigned Letter: How about this? Let's use a code! Do you still remember that one phrase Daddy taught you when you were little? That can be our secret code the next time we see each other again. That way, we'll recognize each other no matter what. You remember it, don't you?
Unsigned Letter: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.

## Talk 4

Xingqiu: We meet again, dear friends. How did everything go?
Paimon: Great! And it's all thanks to you!
Black Screen Text: You quickly go over the whole story with Xingqiu.
Xingqiu: Ah, I see... So the stories didn't get it right after all. Even though she was a celebrated heroine, she had to bear a heavy burden that most could not hope to understand.
Xingqiu: Thank goodness for the help of that adeptus. At least she was able to recover what she had lost.
Xingqiu: Although I cannot claim to know exactly how their story will unfold from here, I trust the ending will be a happy one. Those united in a common purpose always find a way back to each other in the end.
Xingqiu: Thank you for helping me fill in the gaps. And don't worry — I'll keep this all to myself. It's not my story to tell, after all.

## Talk 5

Xianyun: In truth, one had more than a few misgivings about your chosen partner. As an exorcist, his talent was lacking. One could hardly say his skill with sigils was any better.
Xianyun: But soon, one came to appreciate the devotion he bestowed upon you during your illness. He never uttered a complaint and rarely left your side.
Xianyun: Unwilling to begrudge someone of such character, one decided to overlook his aforementioned deficiencies... glaring though they may have been.
Xianyun: Wishing to grant you a life without regrets, one gathered many divine ingredients and used one's own blood to create a form of medicine. Though imperfect, it managed to suppress the more dire effects of your illness.
Xianyun: As for how to deliver the medicine... After much contemplation, one eventually decided to perform the deed oneself.
Xianyun: One took great care to alter one's features and select the appropriate attire. Only after meticulous scrutiny did one finally set out for Wangshu Inn.
Xianyun: As one expected, you were most ignorant of one's true identity. You showed not even the slightest inkling of recognition.
Xianyun: *sigh* One was quite torn... Should one have celebrated the success of one's disguise, or mourned the loss of your acquaintance?

## Talk 6

Paimon: By the way, Shuyu, we have a friend who helped us learn a lot of information about your Granny. Is it okay if we tell him the full story?
Shuyu: Sure! I don't think Granny would mind... As long as you don't tell a whole bunch of people.
Shuyu: I don't think she'd want too many people to know. They might go to Mt. Aocang and start bugging her about it. Granny needs to focus on her training, y'know? But, telling a friend or two is probably fine.
Paimon: No worries! Our friend can keep a secret!

## Talk 7

Xianyun: Those monsters would hardly have pursued you with such ferocity without sufficient incentive. They were likely incited by the presence of godly remains.
Xianyun: ...Said godly remains, in turn, were likely drawn to the trace of one's scent on your body.
Xianyun: One was, after all, an active participant in the Archon War. Some of the gods were likely "shattered" by contraptions of one's very making.
Xianyun: In the end, one was relieved to see you endure through the night. At the break of dawn, one heard an infant's cry pierce through the air, and one saw you carefully cradle the child to your chest. Although certain mortal matters remain foreign to me, one could not help but be moved by your joy.
Xianyun: To see you happy, that was more than enough.

## Talk 8

Xianyun: ...Hah. Perhaps it is now time for one to recount the rest of the tale.
Traveler: Sure.
Traveler: Please wait a moment.

## Talk 9

Xianyun: Just as Yuandai troubled one with her antics, so did you give one many a headache.
Xianyun: Upon finding you burning with fever, one made plans to bring you back to one's abode for treatment. However, upon seeing one's form, you began to cry, refusing to get on one's back.
Xianyun: When one asked you why... Hah! Apparently, you believed that one could not possibly be a true adeptus, because "all illuminated cranes are white from tip to toe."
Xianyun: One had no choice but to apply powder to one's body to conceal the variegated nature of one's appearance. You became more than amenable enough when one stood before you devoid of any other coloring.
Xianyun: It bears mentioning, however, that as a crane, Yuandai was nearly entirely pure white in color. Though you had never encountered her in that form, you still recognized the essence of her being...
Xianyun: Perhaps fate brought you two together in more ways than one.

## Talk 10

Xianyun: Now all has been revealed.
Xianyun: One owes you an apology, Yuandai. One recognized you upon your very entrance into Wanmin Restaurant.
Xianyun: One has always viewed you as a disciple of equal standing with Ganyu and Shenhe. Indeed, one wished to bring your story to a satisfactory end with this visit to Liyue Harbor.
Xianyun: Still, one could not reveal your identity right away. Had one simply informed you of all you had lost, all those cherished memories would merely have become the fictionalized account of another.
Xianyun: Memories are most meaningful when recalled by the those who lived through them, would you not agree? Even if the process was painful and arduous to experience. Have you any further inquiries?
Yuandai: Master... I...
Yuandai: I must ask... If you found me all those years ago, why did you leave me be even though you knew about my mistake? Why did you not bring me back to Mt. Aocang by force?
Xianyun: One has never regarded your action as a mistake. It was a simple choice, nothing more.
Xianyun: When it is time for one's progeny to leave the nest, it is the responsibility of an elder to let them fly free. Yet when your wings grow weary and the night grows dark, just know that you always have a place to which to return.
Xianyun: Tis a refuge referred to by many a name in mortal writing: "Home," "nest," "haven"... Whatever its denomination may be, its essence remains quite unchanged.
Xianyun: One speaks, of course, of a place not unlike one's own abode. One's disciples are free to come and go as they wish, yet the door remains forever open to those who wish to return... One rather hopes you count yourself among them.
Yuandai: Th—Thank you... I just... Thank you so much...
Xianyun: ...Yuandai.
Xianyun: One expects you, too, have sensed the rapid deterioration of your condition as of late, have you not?
Xianyun: Forty years ago, you chose a path without a future. Though one used one's own blood to provide you with a few decades of extra time, it merely delayed the inevitable. One may have extended the path, yet one was unable to alter its final destination.
Xianyun: Even the power of an adeptus has its limits. Had your condition continued to deteriorate, you would have forgotten your life as a human entirely. In the end, you would have turned into a creature lacking in the ability to even comprehend its own monstrousness.
Xianyun: Fortunately, you were able to avoid that scenario by reclaiming your memories. Though one sped the process along by providing some guidance, the result is entirely a reflection of your own effort.
Shuyu: So... what's gonna happen to Granny?
Xianyun: One will help her reclaim her original form as a wild crane. If it be fated, she may recover her sentience one day.
Paimon: She's gotta go back to being a regular crane, huh...
Traveler: Is there no other way?
Yuandai: Master... You've already done more than enough for me.
Yuandai: I don't know how I can possibly repay your kindness. This is a better result than I could have ever hoped for... How much time do I have left?
Xianyun: ...Not long. The transformation is imminent.
Shuyu: Granny... Please don't leave, okay? You're all I have left... Please...
Yuandai: Don't be sad, dear child. Granny has led a wonderful life... My only regret is having to leave you behind.
Yuandai: Don't forget to eat well, okay? A growing young lady like yourself needs lots of good food to grow big and strong. Promise Granny you'll take good care of yourself when I'm gone...
Shuyu: I promise, Granny... I'll do whatever you say...
Yuandai: Good girl, good girl... Don't worry. It's not goodbye forever. Granny's gonna become the most formidable crane in all of Mt. Aocang. Granny will train day and night...
Yuandai: ...I won't stop until I can turn into a human without having to rely on anything but my own power. When that day comes, we'll be able to live together again, you and I... How does that sound?
Shuyu: Good...
Yuandai: That's a good girl. Even though we won't see each other for a little while... As long as we both work hard, we're sure to meet again someday.
Shuyu: I—I'll eat well, Granny, I promise! And I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! I'll wait for you to come back!
Yuandai: That's my good girl... Then, Granny really has no more regrets...
Yuandai: I'm so sorry, Master... Thank you... For everything.
Shuyu: *sob*... *sob*...
Paimon: Shuyu...
Xianyun: Let her be. At her age, crying is a natural, if not fitting, response to such an event.
Xianyun: Tears are a necessary part of maturation. Sometimes, there is scarcely a better vehicle to wash away the toll of stress and misery.
Xianyun: Now that the issue has been resolved, you should also take a moment to relax. Give yourself some time to rest, take a nap if you must. One will wake you in due time.
Paimon: *snore*... Grilled Chicken Drumsticks... Nom nom nom...
Paimon: Huh? Was Paimon sleeping just now?
Xianyun: ...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon wasn't talking to you! Paimon had a dream about eating grilled chicken drumsticks, that's all!
Shuyu: Madam... Adeptus...
Paimon: Oh, Shuyu, you're awake. How do you feel?
Shuyu: I...I feel... a little better, thanks. I know I'll see Granny again someday, so I don't feel so sad anymore.
Shuyu: Madame... Adeptus, could I, uh, ask you something? Would you... take me in as a disciple?
Xianyun: Oh? And have you reasons for this sudden interest?
Shuyu: I know Granny thought that what she did back then was wrong. She felt really bad about it.
Shuyu: But... Without that mistake, I would have never been born.
Shuyu: Even though Granny lost her memories, she never forgot to show me how much she loved me. So, I thought maybe one day...
Shuyu: I could become a cool adeptus like you and help a whole bunch of people, just like Granny wanted to do!
Xianyun: Upon some reflection, one supposes you are no mere mortal. The fact that Yuandai's blood flows through your veins is proof enough of that... If this is what you desire, one shall make it so.
Shuyu: Thank you so much, Madame Adeptus! No, uh, I mean, Master!
Paimon: Uh, Shuyu, are you sure about this?
Paimon: Paimon's gonna let you in on a little secret... We've seen Cloud Retainer's two other disciples, and they pretty much eat nothing but bitter herbs like Qingxin and Violetgrass!
Paimon: If you join them, you'll never enjoy Wanmin Restaurant's delicious cooking ever again!
Xianyun: Hmph, how utterly preposterous. One has never enforced such a rule.
Xianyun: Every individual must find their own path to enlightenment. So long as one retains a pureness of spirit, one's dietary proclivities are quite irrelevant.
Paimon: Well, you say that, but Paimon's not seeing any tasty treats up here, now is she?
Xianyun: Although Mt. Aocang is rich in natural beauty, its location does preclude access to certain finer mortal comforts.
Xianyun: That is precisely why one plans to relocate to Liyue Harbor. Shuyu shall have the honor of becoming one's first disciple in the human world.
Paimon: Woah, you're leaving Mt. Aocang?
Traveler: Is that why you took on this human form?
Xianyun: One has never concerned oneself with the location of one's residence. From the very beginning, one has sought only solace and peace.
Xianyun: Yet, in the end, all of one's disciples ended up in Liyue Harbor. Ganyu, Shenhe... Yuandai... They all chose a life among the mortal world.
Xianyun: One has reflected on this fact for many years now. One can only assume that it is due to some failing on one's part as an elder or master, a failing, perhaps, of recognizing what it was they truly wanted.
Xianyun: One is most curious as to what aspect of Liyue Harbor could have enticed them to remain there. One could hardly offer an opinion on the matter, but perhaps some time in the harbor will prove instructive.
Xianyun: Why are you all so silent?
Paimon: Paimon is, uh, just a bit shocked, that's all... So does this mean we can grab a meal together in Liyue Harbor some time?
Xianyun: Hmph! One has precious little time to squander! However... If one finds oneself otherwise unoccupied, one would not be opposed to the idea.
Xianyun: One will be assuming the identity of a human while residing in Liyue Harbor. You should take care to avoid disclosing one's true identity.
Paimon: Don't worry! We'll help you keep it a secret.
Paimon: So uh... when can we expect to start seeing you in the city?
Xianyun: Perhaps in two day's time. One has some matters to see to before one's departure. Preparation is the key to success, after all. One plans to put up various items from one's collection for sale. The earnings should provide for a comfortable living in Liyue Harbor.
Xianyun: One has already picked out a handsome property near Chihu Rock. 'Tis no small purchase, but what is mortal life if not one expense after another...
Paimon: Seems like you've really thought of everything!
Paimon: Then... How about we meet up in Liyue Harbor in two days?
Xianyun: A sensible plan. See you then.
Xianyun: Oh, also — why don't you take this Suspensus Somnium Mechanism as a souvenir? Any time you should feel ill at ease in the future, you may try quieting your mind and sitting in meditation as you listen to its melodies. It might help you find a new perspective.
Paimon: Awesome! Thanks, Cloud Retainer!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Xianyun: Your concerns are excessive and unfounded. This is but a simple collection of ordinary valuables. Such intense scrutiny is hardly necessary.
Shaozu: ...Er, to be quite honest, your insistence on that fact is my primary cause for concern...
Shaozu: In what way are any of these "ordinary"!? Every single item here could be worth more than everything I own combined! I simply can't risk shelling out that kind of Mora without proper scrutiny. If I'm wrong, I would never be able to earn it back, not even if I worked every single day for the rest of my life.
Shaozu: I have to be careful. Yes, you can never be too careful...
Paimon: We're here, Cloud— Er, Miss Xianyun! What are you guys arguing about?
Xianyun: Ah, perfect timing! This ignoramus is questioning the authenticity of my wares!
Xianyun: I'll have you know, these items have remained untouched in my personal collection for several hundred years. To question their legitimacy is pure folly!
Shaozu: Several... hundred years?
Xianyun: I—Indeed. *ahem* They're... family heirlooms, you see. Passed down over many generations. As families are wont to do...
Paimon: Yup! Yup! They've definitely... been around awhile. We can vouch for her on that one!
Xianyun: Hear that? Had I not found myself in need of Mora, I would scarcely have had the heart to part with them. Indeed, you should consider it an honor to even have the opportunity to behold them with your own eyes.
Xianyun: Doubt their authenticity any further, and I may just decide to take them to another buyer.
Shaozu: Woah, woah, woah! Please don't go! I apologize for any insult, Miss. You see, I know full well that I lack the knowledge to judge the true worth of these items. If you could wait but a moment, I've hired an expert to appraise them for me... He should be here shortly.
Xianyun: #An "expert," you say? ...Very well. I will wait for a little while longer, then. Traveler, Paimon — this is my new residence. If you have cause to seek my company in the future, this is where you can find me.
Shuyu: Master... Oh, it's you two again. Hello.
Paimon: Shuyu! You got a new outfit! It looks great on you!
Shuyu: Mhm, Master made it for me. I like it too.
Paimon: Huh!? You know how to make clothes?
Xianyun: Hmph! Do I "know how to make clothes"? With the support of the proper mechanism, sewing is hardly a challenge.
Shuyu: Master, I brought in most of my stuff. There's a few boxes left, but they're kinda heavy, so I just left them outside...
Xianyun: Fret not. I shall help you move them into your room.
Shuyu: A—Actually, I should probably, uh, sort through my stuff a bit first. Everything's kinda... messy right now, so maybe you could, um, not look yet, Master? Yeah, that'd be great...
Xianyun: Heh. It appears my young apprentice has her own fair share of secrets. No matter — do what you must, child.
Xianyun: Now, this "expert" you mentioned... When can we expect their arrival?
Shaozu: Soon, soon... Ah! There he is!
Shaozu: Here, allow me to make some introductions! This is Mr. Zhongli, a well-respected consultant at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and an expert in all manner of valuables and antiques!
Shaozu: Mr. Zhongli... This is Ms. Xianyun. She's the one who's looking to sell the collection of valuables I mentioned earlier.
Zhongli: ...
Xianyun: ...
Zhongli: Ah, if it isn't Ms. Xianyun. It has been quite some time since our last meeting. What a serendipitous reunion.
Xianyun: Ahem, in—indeed, most serendipitous. Have you been faring well as of late, Mr. Zhongli?
Zhongli: Quite well, thank you. I was fortunate enough over the past few days to enjoy both a stroll in the mountains and a fresh brew of tea from the most recent harvest. The experiences left me with much insight and peace.
Shaozu: Huh... So you two are already acquainted?
Zhongli: Indeed. How fortunate we are that fate has brought us together again. If you are otherwise unaware, allow me to inform you that Ms. Xianyun is a well-regarded collector and appraiser. She is well-versed in all fields and oft-celebrated for her impeccable taste. You stand to gain much from this opportunity.
Xianyun: You are too kind, Mr. Zhongli. True collectors pride themselves on their wealth of knowledge and eye for detail. I can say without a doubt that you are foremost in that regard.
Zhongli: Why, you flatter me, Ms. Xianyun. It would seem that you are as self-effacing as ever.
Xianyun: Not at all, Mr. Zhongli, not at all.
Shaozu: Umm...
Shaozu: While I am loath to butt into this conversation, I must ask...
Shaozu: You two already knew each other, and you... seem to have quite a cordial relationship... Can I be certain that you're not working together to swindle me? I mean, you never know, haha...
Xianyun: Hah, a preposterous accusation! The heavens themselves would collapse before we would conspire to do such a thing!
Zhongli: Ms. Xianyun speaks the truth. Contracts are built on honesty and trust. If that proves to be beyond your capabilities in this instance, this transaction may be taken elsewhere.
Xianyun: Say no more. Let us depart.
Shaozu: A—Ah, I jest, I jest! What fool would still harbor doubts after Mr. Zhongli himself has vouched for the goods? Ms. Xianyun, Ms. Xianyun, wait—!
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...
Shaozu: Ahem... I deeply apologize for doubting you. So, um, Mr. Zhongli... Could you please give me a final verdict on the value of these items?
Zhongli: There is no cause for concern. They are indeed rare and precious valuables. Take this mechanism, for instance. Though one may not immediately perceive its purpose, its structure and appearance are exquisite enough to merit it a place in any fine home.
Zhongli: The same can be said for this one here. Few could hope to possess an item that so perfectly blends mechanical wonder with geometric grace.
Zhongli: I am sure you have heard from your travels that the study of mechanisms is among the most wondrous arts in this world. With that in mind, I earnestly recommend procuring every last item in this collection.
Shaozu: Alright! Since I hired you as my consultant, Mr. Zhongli, I shall, of course, trust your good opinion.
Shaozu: Then, in that case, Ms. Xianyun, I'll take the lot. However... since the final sum is quite large, how about we start with an initial deposit through the Northland Bank?
Xianyun: The Northland Bank? Oh, you refer to the fiduciary house. Very well.
Shaozu: Haha, I fear people only use the term "bank" nowadays. In that case, I'll be off for now. I'll return to collect the goods once you've received the funds.
Xianyun: Phew...
Paimon: Zhongli!
Zhongli: My friends. Have you been doing well?
Paimon: We've been great! How about you? Paimon didn't know you were such a busy consultant!
Zhongli: My days have been quite pleasant as well. I had been quietly enjoying a cup of tea when Mr. Shaozu requested my services.
Zhongli: As for you, Ms. Xianyun... I presume you must be looking to settle in the city?
Xianyun: ...I must say, the name "Xianyun" sounds exceedingly strange coming from you. Perhaps you could dispense of that particular epithet in further conversation.
Zhongli: Whatever for? Am I not addressing you as a friend should?
Xianyun: Well, that is true, but—
Xianyun: *sigh* Alas, refer to me however you will. After all, a name exists such that others may address you with it. One is hardly ignorant of that fact.
Zhongli: Haha, it would seem that you have gained many valuable insights over the years, Cloud Retainer.
Xianyun: One has, indeed. One's previous stays were all brief. Now that one has made up one's mind to move and settle, one has gained a much better appreciation of the hubbub and commotion of the city, as well as the people's hard work and ardor.
Xianyun: This city... is much changed from how it was more than a thousand years ago.
Zhongli: Not unlike the ocean tides, so too shall the movement of people ebb and flow. From turmoil to peace, enlightenment to aspiration — human society possesses limitless potential. In another thousand years, the scene we witness here may change in ways that are impossible for either of us to imagine.
Paimon: Alright, that's enough reflection for one day! No need to get all sentimental on us.
Xianyun: You make a valid point, Paimon. Now that the sale has concluded, what say one plays the host as we try some specialty dishes together? One must profess great interest in trying "Bamboo Shoot Soup."
Zhongli: Hmm? Perhaps you have forgotten, Cloud Retainer, but I once tried my hand at that dish. You were at the table on that occasion, so logic dictates that you should have already tried it.
Xianyun: Oh? ... What occasion was this?
Zhongli: It was a reunion between friends several centuries ago. Alas, you must have been too preoccupied to secure yourself a portion. Or perhaps our other companions simply availed themselves of faster reflexes on that occasion.
Xianyun: Ha! Hardly! 'Twas most certainly out of consideration for the others in attendance. In but a moment, one will show you what it means to have a true deftness of hand.
Xianyun: It is settled, then. Bamboo Shoot Soup, Mora Meat, Crab Roe Tofu, Triple-Layered Consommé... We shall enjoy the lot.
Xianyun: One has already passed word to Shenhe and Ganyu to make a reservation. It is prime time for them to meet one's newest disciple. Is that agreeable to everyone?
Zhongli: It should be a most splendid occasion.
Traveler: Thank you so much, Cloud Retainer!
Xianyun: Shuyu! Come now, it is time to dine. Ah, this gentleman over here is Mr. Zhongli, he is... Erm...
Zhongli: A humble employee of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Shuyu: Nice to meet you too, Mr. Zhongli.
Paimon: That should be everyone, right? Let's go!
Shuyu: Sounds good! Actually, Master, have you ever tried "Adeptus' Temptation"? I heard it's impossible to stop eating after even just one bite! Y'know, cause it's super tempting and stuff. Is that true?
Xianyun: Hmm, that sounds rather implausible. Although, with the right preparation, certain dishes can be too delicious to resist...
Paimon: Huh? Why are you all walking so fast? Hey, wait for Paimon!
Paimon: Hey, hey, wait up!
