Traveler: You're a doctor?
Nanse: That's right, something wrong with that? Most of the Masters of the Night-Wind you'll bump into on the road will be doctors rushing somewhere for a house call.
Nanse: Unfortunately, I just finished an emergency visit, so I'm quite exhausted, and running low on medicine too.
Nanse: ...How about this â€” if you really do need help, you can try your luck and see if you can find a young man wearing a hood out there in the wild.
Nanse: He might sound a tad eccentric when he gets talking, but he's a good person, and I'm sure he'll help you.
