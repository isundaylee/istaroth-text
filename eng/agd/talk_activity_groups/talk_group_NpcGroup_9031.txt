## Talk

Fischl: #Ah, it is you, Traveler, the wayfarer of a world beyond whose fate crosses mine own.
Fischl: Dost thou wish to present any tidings to the Prinzessin before thee?

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Fischl: I behold the magnificent vistas of three thousand worlds and am intimately acquainted with the threads of past and future.
Fischl: Feebly does the expanse that appears before me endeavor to capture my attention.
Traveler: You're very particular.
Fischl: Hmph. No mortal lifetime bears the imagination required to fathom the collective phenomena experienced by the Prinzessin.
Fischl: This place is but a grain of sand in the shadow of my Immernachtreich.
Oz: But mein Fräulein, you previously said that you wished to stay here for a while.
Fischl: #That... that was but to demonstrate solidarity for {F#her}{M#him} as a kindred soul of the outrealm!
Traveler: As long as you like it.
Fischl: For a mortal domicile, it offers a modicum of respite.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Fischl: Stalled have I the inexorable march of time and veiled the omnipresent gaze of fate.
Fischl: Traveler from beyond, the sovereign Prinzessin shall arbitrate the discord of thine heart!
Oz: What mein Fräulein means is that she happens to be free right now.
Oz: If there is something on your mind, she is happy to listen.
Traveler: Actually, I want to know if anything is bothering you, Fischl.
Fischl: Preposterous! I am the Prinzessin der Verurteilung! What mortal follies could venture to imprint themselves upon my psyche?
Oz: When I was out on reconnaissance, didn't the new recruits from the Adventurers' Guild joke about you since they couldn't understand what you were saying?
Oz: I remember that you were distressed about this, mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Nonsense! How could I be perturbed by such trifling antics from my retinue?
Fischl: Alas, I lament that those neophytes lack semblance to you, traveler from an outer world, the one delivered before me by the threads of fate.
Fischl: The one who perceives the truth and meaning of my declarations.
Traveler: You offer a surfeit of praise.
Fischl: Yes, indeed do I perceive rightly...
Fischl: By my regard, should Oz be conducting reconnaissance on my behalf, I grant you permission to remain in my propinquity.
Fischl: Now, relay the will of the Prinzessin to her attendants!
Oz: Frankly, I also think this is a good idea.
Traveler: What if my understanding is off?
Fischl: Allay all doubt, for you are the one that I, the Prinzessin, have personally appointed. Hesitate not and proclaim my decrees to this world's denizens!
Traveler: If you two say so...
Fischl: So shall it be.
Fischl: Rejoice! That wanton brume of devilry hath dissipated beneath my immaculate radiance!
Traveler: I am honored to understand you.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Fischl: Stars cast from the celestial tapestry are the final moments of an hourglass.
Fischl: Tremors erupting from the earth are the dying echoes of an ancient god's heart.
Fischl: Shall I usher in this world's desolate finale with none save my own shadow?
Fischl: Oh, blessed one...
Fischl: You... Would you accompany me to witness this world's end and greet the descension of eternal night?
Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say is...
Fischl: O—Oz!
Traveler: No worries, I understand...
Fischl: W—Wait, really? Are you serious?
Oz: M—Mein Fräulein...
Fischl: Ah! Ahem...!
Fischl: Very good! Allow me to offer resplendent blessings to illuminate your fated travels!
Fischl: I, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort...
Fischl: Along with my familiar of the night, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, will safeguard your path ahead, for fate has revealed to me that this be decreed!
Traveler: I will be at your side.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Fischl.
Fischl: The furtive shades of our destinies intertwine themselves beneath hallowed light. Should tenebrous forces obscure thine path, you may call out my name in humble supplication.
Oz: Mein Fräulein says, "Good morning, the sun is quite fine today. If you encounter any difficulties, please call for me."

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Fischl.
Fischl: Profess tribute, for this space is exalted by my consecration. None shall interfere with your repose.
Oz: Mein Fräulein says, "Good night. May you have sweet dreams."

## Talk

Fischl: Most endearing!
Fischl: Who would've thought that one might find such a study outside the treasure trove of the magus-custodian of books...? It is worthy of one's extended stay, and may invoke seven blessings of the Prinzessin out of ten!
Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say is that most of the literature in this study is of interest to her.

## Talk

Fischl: Hee-hee! One has witnessed how you have poured your heart and soul into the pursuit of the heavens and Abyssal Moon.
Fischl: Travelers, their appetite for adventure insatiable... Surely do they leave the most brilliant marks upon this paradise.
Oz: Mein Fräulein means that she enjoys the style of adventurer camps. She never grows tired of it.
