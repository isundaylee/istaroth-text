# An Expected Plan


## Talk 1

Loillier: ...Proposal... Advice...
Loillier: ...Transport... Institute... Lesson...
Chaussivert: ...Scoundrels... Threatening me...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, we know that Covault has left, but where is he?

## Talk 3

Drunkard: B—Boss! Chaussivert! Please forgive me, big man!
Chaussivert: Forgive you? Well, that depends on your behavior.
Chaussivert: Lemarcq, tie him up and take him back to the ship!

## Talk 4

Chaussivert: You think you can take me down by hiring a few Treasure Hoarders? You underestimate me, Covault.
Drunkard: Tsk... What's with you guys!? Go get him! Whoever takes him down gets double!
Fusilier: You... Stay away from me! Or I'm gonna hit you! This device is pretty sturdy, you know!
Chaussivert: #Get behind me, Institute Lady! Traveler, let's clean up this trash!

## Talk 5

Panicked Treasure Hoarder: Someone snitched...! Who are you!? Who sent you!?
Chaussivert: Loillier sends his regards. The shipment has been delivered, and you've outlived your usefulness.
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: Just to save the last bit of payment? That penny pincher!

## Talk 6

Fusilier: The signals are getting stronger... We're close!
Paimon: Look over there! Am I mistaken or is that... a house?
Chaussivert: Smoke is coming out of its chimney. Someone's living in there. Stay sharp — I'll take point.

## Talk 7

Edwin Eastinghouse: Why are you... You're back again. Told you. You can make five rounds of the place, and you still won't find him.
Edwin Eastinghouse: It's not working out for you, clearly, so why don't you just sit down and have some tea? I just bought five cups... and a few bowls.
Lemarcq: You really like the number "five," don't you, Mr. Edwin?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Yes! It's a magical number! Use it right, and you can unlock the doors to endless inspiration!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Listen up. There are five doors to endless inspiration, and you have to turn each handle five times... Five! You hear? Five times!
Lemarcq: Sorry, but I'm really trying to stop myself from punching you five times. Would you please kindly shut your trap?

## Talk 8

Drunkard: Heheh... I'm gonna be rich... How dare you belittle me... Burp.
Chaussivert: That's him. There's no one else in Lumidouce Harbor with a rat-face like that.
Chaussivert: Covault! Get up!
Drunkard: Wh—Who are you? I'm in the money now... Don't... Don't you dare shout at me!
Chaussivert: Oh, sure. So where did you get it? Details, if you please.
Drunkard: Y—You... Chaussivert!
Drunkard: You... It's all because I worked for you... that I missed out on making big money!

## Talk 9

Chaussivert: We're almost there... It seems like the shipment hasn't arrived yet.
Chaussivert: Let's wait here for a bit. Keep your ears sharp. They might show up any second.
Black Screen Text: Everyone finds a place to hide and waits for the couriers to arrive...
Fusilier: Look over there! Are those the people we're waiting for?
Chaussivert: Must be. They seem to be handing off the shipment... They'll definitely start transporting it soon.
Paimon: Why are we eavesdropping again? But this time, we're eavesdropping on the Treasure Hoarders...
Traveler: This is how the Institute does things.
Fusilier: That's not true! Oh, s—sorry...
Chaussivert: Let's follow him. But be careful, don't get caught again.
Paimon: What do you mean "again"?

## Talk 10

Drunkard: Boss, we're close. We just need to head further in.

## Talk 11

Drunkard: Romaritime Flower... Romaritime... Flower... Heheheh...
Traveler: What are you saying, Covault?
Drunkard: I... I'm talking to... the Romaritime Flower... Who's Covault?
Drunkard: You... You're also Romaritime Flower? What a... coincidence! Hoohoohoo...

## Talk 12

Chaussivert: Wait. Now that we've gone far enough, what does your device say, Little Miss Institute?
Fusilier: No reaction... at all. There is no residual Arkhium energy here.
Fusilier: Strange. I've already tuned its sensitivity up to max, and Arkhium energy flow doesn't dissipate that easily...
Fusilier: This prototype was made by Mr. Edwin himself... There's no way it doesn't work...
Paimon: Huh? H—How come they... and those meka behind them...
Chaussivert: I knew it. Pattyn, how much did Loillier promise you?
Pattyn: An amount I'd never earn slaving under you in a lifetime. It's nothing personal, Chaussivert. But I have mouths to feed.
Chaussivert: Don't you feel dirty getting mixed up with the likes of Loillier, taking his money like that?
Drunkard: Hehehe... Boss, we all roll in the same mud puddle. The money we earn? It's never clean.
Drunkard: You're the only one riding your high horse, saying "this business is no good, that business harms people," like you're some kinda saint.
Drunkard: In the end, you earn no money and win no people. Only a fool like Lemarcq would stay loyal to you.
Drunkard: We've sailed together for a long time. I'm sure Morgen will make his death painless.
Paimon: No... Oh no! Mr. Lemarcq is still on the ship!
Fusilier: Don't worry. He has the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device, which was personally modified by Mr. Edwin himself. He'll be fine.
Traveler: You only just came up with that name, didn't you?
Pattyn: Hmph... Come on, Covault, hurry up and take care of them. Loillier's money is waiting for us to claim it.
Drunkard: Stop telling me what to do! You... Go on, get them!
Traveler: You really are confident in that device of yours.
Fusilier: I'm just confident in Mr. Edwin!

## Talk 13

Raimondo: Please meet Miss Fusilier there as soon as possible. She will brief you on the latest information.
Raimondo: Don't mind me saying this, but the situation at Lumidouce Harbor is... delicate. Please be extra careful when handling matters there.

## Talk 14

Choiseul: Lumidouce Harbor... I remember that Doutey used to be in charge there. He seems to have found a way to be assigned elsewhere, though...
Choiseul: The person in charge right now should be Cassigneul... With a woman like her around, there's no way I'd ever do business in Lumidouce Harbor.

## Talk 15

Lemarcq: Hmm... This device sure is handy.
Paimon: Hmm... Looks like Lemarcq just took care of that guy all by himself...
Lemarcq: Boss, you're back. Looks like you were ambushed, too. That means...
Chaussivert: Loillier has bought both Pattyn and Morgen off. Covault was to lead us into an ambush.
Traveler: Sadly, they didn't expect me to be there.
Fusilier: Wait a second. If they were bought off by Loillier, then what about when you were talking to him...?
Chaussivert: Hmm. That can only mean that he had that meeting so he could eliminate me. Hmph. Brutal, but that sounds like him, alright.
Lemarcq: Then I suppose it's a good thing that you lot came out of the blue to mess with their plans.
Lemarcq: Otherwise, given the narrow space... we might not have made it out alive.
Paimon: Still, they've attacked us twice in a row now. Could they have something to hide?
Traveler: Just a motley crew.

## Talk 16

Chaussivert: I hope you're well-rested. Pattyn and Morgen have told us everything.
Fusilier: How? They were all bent on killing us not so long ago...
Chaussivert: Well, that you don't need to know, Little Miss Institute. Lemarcq, tell them.
Lemarcq: Aye, aye. To put it simply, with their cooperation, we have learned that two shipments will be delivered to a certain location today...
Lemarcq: Unfortunately, those two don't know the precise location. All they know is the time when the shipments will arrive at the shore.
Traveler: So, more guesswork on our part.
Fusilier: I have an idea. We may be able to find some clues using this energy flow detector.
Fusilier: If that place is indeed where Nacker is hiding, then people going in and out will carry traces of Arkhium energy.
Paimon: Ooh! That means that all we have to do is to use this device, and "beep beep beep" — we'll know exactly where to go!
Fusilier: What do you mean, "beep beep beep"? Only those obsolete relics do that! I'm using the latest, silent model.
Chaussivert: Beeping or not, this is a good shout. No time to waste. Let's move.
Traveler: About those two...
Chaussivert: They've gone back to where all sailors come from. No need to worry about them... Anchors aweigh!
Traveler: Never mind. We'll see how it goes.

## Talk 17

Panicked Treasure Hoarder: Loillier, blast him... He's already paid the bulk of the payment, but he can't afford the rest!?
Chaussivert: Chill, man. We're all underdogs here. Don't blame the messenger.
Traveler: Boss, what should we do with him?
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: W—Wait! Stop! How much is Loillier paying you? I'll pay you the same amount!
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: Or, how about this: Let me live, and I'll take Loillier out and grab his money, and then we can split the cash?
Chaussivert: There's no need for any of that. I just have a few questions for it.
Traveler: Answer them to my satisfaction, you live — or your head will roll.
Paimon: Roll!
Chaussivert: Loillier hired you to get the shipments here — that's it? Did he say who they're for?
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: I... I don't know. All Loillier said was to leave the shipments here, and that someone else would come pick them up.
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: The previous two runs were exactly like that, just at different locations...
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: I once stayed behind to see who the buyer was, but they didn't show. Another group of people took the shipment and headed that way. I dared not linger any longer, so I took off.
Panicked Treasure Hoarder: So... are you satisfied?
Chaussivert: Good enough. Get out of here. You'd better stay away from Loillier. He's up to no good.
Lemarcq: Boss, should I follow him?
Chaussivert: No need. Let him go and cause some trouble for Loillier. So, he said that someone would come to pick the shipments up, hmm?
Chaussivert: Institute Lady, it's time for you to get that device of yours beeping. We need to move.
Fusilier: Didn't I say that this is the latest model, and it doesn't beep?
Traveler: Ma'am, what should we do with him?
Fusilier: Wh—Why are you asking me? And, what's with the "ma'am"? I'm not part of this outfit!
Traveler: Paimon, you handle him.
Paimon: Sure! Heheh, just watch Paimon... Hmmm... How many strands of hair should she pull?

## Talk 18

Fusilier: The readings... are high. There are clear residual energy readings from all around this house...
Paimon: Nacker... Why would he go through all the trouble to build a house here?
Traveler: He must have strong nerves!
Chaussivert: The lock on this door doesn't seem too sturdy. I think I can break it open. Stand back.
Fusilier: Hey, don't just bash the door in! It might be someone's home... You know, that got irradiated for some reason...
Chaussivert: If that's the case, we'll compensate them. It's your investigation, so the money should come out of the Institute, naturally.
Fusilier: Huh!?
Edwin Eastinghouse: What are you doing in my house?
Paimon: Wow, you showed up, Nack—
Paimon: Wait, you're not Nacker... But you're wearing the Institute's uniform...
Edwin Eastinghouse: You're here to deliver the supplies, aren't you? Just leave the things at the back of the house. Can't you read the note on the door?
Fusilier: You're...
Fusilier: Mr... Edwin?
Edwin Eastinghouse: How do you know me? Tsk... Did Loillier leak my name?
Edwin Eastinghouse: No matter. Just hurry and get me the supplies. The suppressor will be ready soon... Hmm? Why are you staring at me?
Paimon: Paimon must be seeing things from flying too fast...
Traveler: Well, well, well! Edwin Eastinghouse, come back to life, I see!
Paimon: Aren't you supposed to have died in the explosion at the Institute!?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Wh—What are you talking about? Stop wasting my time. I'm in a hurry to complete my research.
Fusilier: I—I'm Fusilier from Section 3! You were my research advisor, and you helped me modify the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device!
Edwin Eastinghouse: What Section 3? What Ray...? Oh, now I remember. You're talking about that highly inefficient radiation device, aren't you?
Edwin Eastinghouse: What was the researcher's name, again... I can't remember. Whatever the case, that device was a solo project with no real practical value...
Edwin Eastinghouse: #Wait... You must be the Honorary Senior Researcher, Traveler. Your reputation precedes you...
Traveler: You know me?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Hahaha! Concini told me about what you've done, and the title you've earned.
Edwin Eastinghouse: I have to say, the title suits you well! Just look at you, all hardworking and... Ahem.
Edwin Eastinghouse: But of course, I know full well why you're here, Honorary Senior Researcher...
Edwin Eastinghouse: You must be here for that Arkhium Kinetic Core, which that slippery fish, Nacker, stole...
Edwin Eastinghouse: I apologize, but despite his lack of creativity, pedestrian research skills, and how he's been constantly messing up my facility...
Edwin Eastinghouse: We're still in the same boat, so I cannot reveal his location to you...
Lemarcq: I hear you, sir. However, I found this map in the house that marks a certain area...
Edwin Eastinghouse: Gosh! How did you find this map... But no matter. His precise location won't be that easy to find.
Edwin Eastinghouse: You are welcome to go and look for him, but trust me, you could make five loops around the place, and you wouldn't find him. That place took us five full years to build!
Edwin Eastinghouse: I still remember that when that place was completed, I restarted five projects and rebuilt five devices. If I were still in the Institute, my salary would've quintupled...
Paimon: #...So, what's happening now, Traveler?
Traveler: He's monologuing...
Chaussivert: Lemarcq... stay here and keep an eye on this guy.
Chaussivert: Miss Institute... I mean, Miss Fusilier. This will be a dangerous trip, so why don't you give me the device? I'll handle things going forward.
Fusilier: No. Let's get moving. I... I want to leave!
Paimon: Wow, she seems pretty upset. What happened? I thought she worshipped Edwin...?
Traveler: ...Let's catch up.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Good luck. You will never find him! Five rounds, you hear!?
Lemarcq: If you keep this up for five more seconds, I'm gonna punch you five times.
Traveler: Edwin didn't even notice her.
Traveler: Something must've triggered his inner Institute scientist.
Traveler: Looks like you didn't quite get blown away far enough.
Traveler: Oh no, the Institute is gonna get blown up again...
Traveler: Or he took it from someone else.

## Talk 19

Panicked Treasure Hoarder: Wh—Who are you? What are you doing here!?
Chaussivert: Tsk. You've found me. You've got a keen nose.
Chaussivert: We'll leave the thinking to you, Miss Institute Lady. You're the brains, and we're the brawn, after all.
Fusilier: Huh...? Hey! Wait! What do you mean by that?
Chaussivert: #Lemarcq, Traveler, let's take them down!

## Talk 20

Paimon: So... Those three are all in league with each other?
Paimon: That Concini guy is like the owner of a restaurant, getting Loillier to find a chef to cook for Nacker...
Chaussivert: I told Loillier to beat it, so he went and found someone else to work for him... And then, he wanted to silence me...
Paimon: Hmm, it feels like someone who messed up trying to cover their own mistake.
Chaussivert: Huh, I see! Well, that certainly does sound like the right amount of trashy for Loillier! You may be little, but you're quite brainy, you know?
Paimon: Hey, you can keep the first part of the sentence to yourself! Anyway, now we're sure that Nacker is in Lumidouce Harbor, and we've narrowed down the search area by quite a bit.
Traveler: (But things are never that simple, are they...)
Lemarcq: Ahem... Boss, we better interrogate them to see if they have any useful information.
Chaussivert: Hm, good idea. Pattyn, you know the rules, yes?
Pattyn: ...I'm at your disposal, Mr. Chaussivert.
Chaussivert: Good. At least you accept the consequences of your own actions. Lemarcq, tie him and Morgen up real good.
Chaussivert: Go to your cabins and rest. And remember to put on some earplugs... Let's just say that this won't be a silent night.
Black Screen Text: After some contemplation, you decide to sit down and rest. In the middle of the night, you are awakened by strange muffled noises and the sound of something heavy falling into the water outside of your cabin. Did something or someone fall into the water? Should you go help? Wait. Chaussivert warned you that this will not be a silent night...
Black Screen Text: You walk to the door and grab the handle. The commotion outside has quieted down by now, and only the muffled sound of waves hesitantly lapping against the hull remains as you stand hesitantly before the door. What awaits outside? A question? An answer? Regardless, with just a twist of your wrist, you can verify... certain thoughts of yours, can't you?
Black Screen Text: You hesitate. Despite already having the answer, you still want to ask for Fusilier's opinion. You turn around and see how Fusilier is trying to cover her ears, pretending to be fast asleep.
Black Screen Text: In the end, you suppress your and Paimon's curiosity and decide to not investigate. You just hope that this night will pass quickly...

## Talk 23

Traveler: Have you seen a guy called Covault?
Pitot: Sure. He just bought another round for everyone before stumbling out the door.
Pitot: Humph... I wonder where he got all that money.

## Talk 24

Drunkard: No... It's not my fault... I didn't want this... It's not me...
Traveler: Covault, you're in trouble!
Drunkard: You... Oh. You're not here for me? Great... I didn't do anything wrong... Forgive me! I'm trying... I'll do better... *sobs*

## Talk 25

Drunkard: More... more! Who's drinking with me? You... You! You drink with me!
Traveler: Covault, cut it with the drinking!
Drunkard: Who... Who? Never heard of him! You drink? You no drink? Whatever... I drink!

## Talk 26

Fusilier: Look over there. Those are the people we're waiting for.
Fusilier: According to my investigation, they're reselling a batch of goods linked to the Fontaine Research Institute.
Fusilier: And this may be connected to Nacker... Let's get closer.

## Talk 27

Drunkard: Drink up! More... Heheheh... Another Bulle Fruit... Put it... on my tab...
Traveler: Covault, time to pay up!
Drunkard: Who... Who's that? Who's... Covault!? Ah, move aside!
Drunkard: Uh, no... I'm not Covault...

## Talk 28

Paimon: What are we doing here? We look like eavesdroppers...
Fusilier: Well, we are here to be eavesdroppers. But I think we have to wait a little longer... Let's get behind those shrubs for now.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lemarcq: You go with Chaussivert and try to find this guy. I'll stay here and guard the ship alongside Morgen.
Lemarcq: I even borrowed that device from the Institute Lady. The ship will be in good hands.

### Additional Talk 2

Morgen: ...What is it? Go do your thing.

### Additional Talk 3

Chaussivert: Sober yet, Covault? Can you speak properly now?
Drunkard: B—Boss! Chaussivert! I—I... Please forgive me... That was the alcohol talking...
Traveler: You want some more to help you relax?
Drunkard: You... You're right, right. Whatever you say!
Chaussivert: I ask you a question, you give me an answer. Anything more or less, I knock your teeth out. Clear?
Drunkard: Yes, yes! Crystal clear!
Chaussivert: First question. Were you hired by Loillier?
Drunkard: I...
Chaussivert: On the count of three.
Drunkard: Yes, yes! He hired me to escort someone to a certain location in Lumidouce Harbor. I don't know who the person is. I just escorted him to the designated location, took the money, and got out of there!
Chaussivert: Second question. This person you were escorting, was he carrying something?
Drunkard: Well, he had a large backpack on his back, and nobody was allowed to look at it... But... it was very strange. It was warm, and it kept on buzzing...
Traveler: Could that be...?!
Fusilier: It's the self-heating effect generated by bound Arkhium. Mr. Edwin's talked about it before. The backpack must contain the Arkhium Kinetic Core.
Fusilier: And the person must be Nacker.
Traveler: Guess we've got our man.
Paimon: Paimon's gonna give him a good bashing...
Chaussivert: Third question. Where did you escort him to? Give me the location.
Drunkard: B—Boss... could you give me a map? It's too remote a location to give that precisely...
Chaussivert: Sure. I'll get you a map. Don't try anything, or else.
Drunkard: I wouldn't dare... hehehe...
Black Screen Text: Covault nervously marks the location on the map...
Drunkard: Boss, there you go. That's the place.
Chaussivert: I assume that there won't be an ambush waiting for me? Or have you hired somebody to take me out?
Drunkard: I would never, boss! You know I won't lie!
Chaussivert: Heh... Fine. When we get there, you take point.
Chaussivert: Chart a course! That's where we'll be heading!
Traveler: Tsk. If only we could just blow it up.
Paimon: Haven't we had enough of that already?
Traveler: Alcohol steels the soul...

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: About Covault...
Lasselin: Oh, him? I just saw him stumble out the door. Not sure which direction he was heading in, though...
Lasselin: I can't remember, but he's not in the tavern, that's for sure.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: About Covault...
Permingeat: That drunkard? He went outside to sober up. If you're here for some money he owes you, you're wasting your time.
Permingeat: Judging by how much he's had to drink... he's probably in a bush somewhere, trying to remember his own name.

### Additional Talk 6

Morgen: ...Looking for trouble, are you?

### Additional Talk 7

Pattyn: Hmph... A job that doesn't make you any Mora...
