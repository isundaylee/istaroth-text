# Time Waits For No Man


## Talk 1

Cyrus: Bah, Stormterror was defeated, just like that? We didn't even get the chance to take the stage...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Cyrus: Oh, if it isn't the Honorary Knight. The storms have ceased, and Stormterror has been defeated.
Cyrus: This is a good thing, yes... But couldn't Stormterror have put up a bit more of a fight?
Cyrus: And here I was thinking that after clearing the monsters surrounding the city out, we could select some elite adventurers to form a team of dragon hunters to challenge Stormterror!
Cyrus: But just as we were having trouble finding a healer, Stormterror was defeated.
Cyrus: We also need to help the citizens find cats and dogs, send meals and clean house... At this rate, we'll have lost our opportunity for sure...
Cyrus: *sigh* Let's leave that aside for now. I've heard from our scouts that there are still monsters wandering the Whispering Woods.
Cyrus: But our forces are scattered throughout the wilds and cannot return, and I must handle some assorted matters.
Cyrus: Could I trouble you to go to the Whispering Woods and see to the situation there?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure.
Cyrus: Thank you. I will be handling commissions here...
Cyrus: A signboard blown away by the wind... Flowers blown away by the wind... A lost cat... *sigh* It is as I expected...

## Talk 3

Traveler: I have other matters to handle...
Cyrus: Ah. Go about your business, then. Now that Stormterror has been vanquished, these things aren't so urgent...

## Talk 4

Cyrus: A signboard blown away by the wind... Flowers blown away by the wind... A lost cat... *sigh* It is as I expected...

## Talk 5

Cyrus: Back so soon? Well then, I suppose nothing serious is happening...
Traveler: No, there's still a lot of monster activity.
Cyrus: What? There are still monsters wandering around, and in even greater numbers than before?
Cyrus: That's strange. Wasn't the large force that attacked Mondstadt defeated previously? Why are they still skulking about in the area?
Cyrus: Could they have some other plans? ...I must gather the adventurers and re-issue our commissions. We cannot take these monsters lightly.
Cyrus: Conducting careful investigations into the activities of monsters in the wild falls within the purview of the Adventurers' Guild. It's time to show everyone what we're made of!
Cyrus: Ah, yes. Please take these as thanks for you efforts.
