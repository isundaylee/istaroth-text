# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Flagpole Cheng: Oh... So you were looking for someone to talk you... You gave me a fright.
Flagpole Cheng: Speaking of which, someone did show up some time ago who had a very similar silhouette to yours...
Flagpole Cheng: ...But my glasses had already been broken before that. It's also possible that you passed this way earlier and I caught sight of you.
Flagpole Cheng: So, is the person I saw the one you're looking for? I don't know either...
