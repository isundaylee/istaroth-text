That's all you've got?
What happened to searching for your answer?
Fight's over
Do you yield?
You won
Well then, looks like you found your answer
I give his glory to you
I've seen that light...
That is the light of our Lord... The great Hermanubis, priest over all other priests
His spirit dwells within that lightning, and his will lives on
Once a warrior of Tighnar, he emerged from the barren desert sands
To serve the God King, Al-Ahmar
After the death of the God King, Hermanubis gathered his followers
And the Tighnarian priests
And led them to the city of Tulaytullah
There, they founded the Temple of Silence. And from that day forth
We became stewards of all knowledge
That survived from King Deshret's civilization
Barely a century passed before war ravaged the desert
One by one, Eremite leaders took up arms against each other in battles
That would devour what little remained of their civilization
Only the wise city of Tulaytullah
Was spared under the guiding hand of the Tighnarians
But peace did not last
Coveting the knowledge of King Deshret, the beasts set their eyes on Tulaytullah
The king of Gurabad laid siege to the city
And ordered the sages to surrender to him the Temple of Silence, as proof of his victory
The ruling elite colluded with their oppressors
Betraying the Temple so as to hold onto their rule over the city
They declared that the knowledge guarded by the Temple was the true cause of corruption
These were dark days, and we faced enemies on all sides
Our Lord had long since exhausted his strength
Keeping the forbidden knowledge introduced by King Deshret at bay
To ensure the Temple's continued survival
He broke his being into many pieces
And began the ceremony of Hermanubis's legacy
Bestowing his power upon his mortal followers
With this power
The Temple was able to defeat the tyrant's army
Yet we were not hailed as heroes
Strange and unfamiliar as this power was
It struck fear into the people's hearts, and drove them to reject us
In the end, the people of the Temple and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians
Left the city for good, and made their way to the rainforest
What followed next was inevitable
The elite of Tulaytullah fell, and were decimated
War engulfed the desert...
And we wandered from place to place, always in hiding
All the while keeping close watch over our secrets
And staying true to our mission
Betrayal forced us out of the desert and into the forest
Then mistrust drove us from the forest, into the desert once more
We have lived in exile for far, far too long...
Yet today, the Temple of Silence has borne witness to the glory of Hermanubis once more
...Thank you
