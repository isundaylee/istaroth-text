## Talk 1

Lisa: I guess I could give this a go.

## Talk 2

Lisa: Hey cutie.
Lisa: You're going to help me out too? How kind of you.
Lisa: Don't hesitate to come to me if you need anything.
Traveler: What kind of things does a librarian do?
Lisa: Good question.
Lisa: Basically, things other than that which require brawn... or brains.
Paimon: So... what does that leave?
Lisa: So you should as well.
Traveler: Why would a librarian be at the ruins...?
Lisa: Hmm... Good question.
Lisa: Well, because Jean trusts me.

## Talk 3

Lisa: Dragon of the East, Lion of the South, Wolf of the North, Falcon of the West...
Lisa: They are the Four Winds of Mondstadt, affiliated with Barbatos, the God of Anemo.
Lisa: The Dragon of the East, Stormterror — its real name, is Dvalin.
Lisa: Though most in Mondstadt seem to have forgotten that in all this "Stormterror" business.
Lisa: So now you know why Dvalin is only able to channel three of the Four Winds' power.
Lisa: Because it has been consuming itself from the beginning.
Traveler: Why?
Lisa: Because of hatred, I presume.
Paimon: Hatred...?
Lisa: Hatred for Mondstadt.
Lisa: Hatred drove it to become something more powerful than the wind itself — to become Stormterror.
Paimon: But why would one of The Four Winds...
Paimon: Hate the city it was supposed to protect?
Lisa: ...
Lisa: As a child of Mondstadt, it's something that's really hard to say aloud.
Lisa: Here, take this. It's a very old story from more than a century ago.
Traveler: Why would it go to such lengths?
