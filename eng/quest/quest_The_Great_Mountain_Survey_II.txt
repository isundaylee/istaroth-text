# The Great Mountain Survey II


## Talk 1

Paimon: Brr... Th—That should d—do it...
Paimon: So c—cold... Can we g—go now...

## Talk 2

Esther: Did you put the beacon in place?
Traveler: Yep.
Esther: Wonderful! Thank you, now I can finally get a reliable measurement of the height of the mountain.
Esther: Oh, and regarding compensation — I asked Cyrus to put something together. Ask him for it next time you're in the city.
Esther: And since you'll see him before I do, could you also give him this letter for me? He promised to keep me in the loop about a second exploration team headed for the mountains, but I still haven't heard back about it.
Esther: Once the rest of my beacons are fixed, I'll have to head back up and set them all up. There's a lot of things that still need surveying on that mountain.

## Talk 3

Cyrus: Hello, how may I help?
Traveler: I have a letter for you.
Cyrus: A letter? ...Oh, it's from her. I'll wager she's asking about the next exploration team again...
Cyrus: *sigh* I don't know what I can do. It's rare to find a team that's willing to take on the mountain these days — it's just too dangerous up there...
Cyrus: I'll write her a letter shortly to explain the situation. Thank you for making the trip to deliver this.
Cyrus: Speaking of letters, she sent another not long ago asking me to prepare a reward for you. Here, please take it.
Cyrus: One last thing... I can see that you are a hardy type, but nevertheless — I urge you to be careful in the mountains.
Cyrus: Ah, Dragonspine... If ever the chance arose to lead a team of explorers there in person, I would surely take it!

## Talk 4

Esther: A beacon placed right at the summit will be sure to minimize the margin of error in my measurements...
