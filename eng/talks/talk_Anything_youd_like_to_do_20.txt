# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Lyney: As you're the owner, there is one matter on which I would like to inquire your opinion.
Traveler: ...Huh? Why so formal all of a sudden...
Lyney: From what I can see, not only is the environment here quite comfortable, but the security is also beyond reproach. It seems this would be a great place to raise pets.
Traveler: Yeah, I have a few.
Lyney: Just so you know... I've already greeted them. Politely, of course.
Lyney: I refrained from touching them or feeding them anything I had brought with me. Such actions require your permission first, no?
Traveler: Why do I feel like you're being exceptionally earnest today...
Lyney: Hehe, is it because I'm usually dramatic and flamboyant? That could have left you with a rather one-sided impression.
Lyney: If that's the case, I really ought to do a good bit of self-reflection!
Lyney: Anyway, I just want to find a warm, free, and peaceful home for all of my animal assistants.
Lyney: A place where they'll always enjoy care and being lovingly looked after, with no need to worry about food or shelter...
Lyney: To be perfectly honest with you, this is by far the best choice for them that I know of... but I wouldn't want you to feel pressured to take them in, or to persuade you using honeyed words.
Lyney: But if you really were willing to take them in of your own free will, truly, that would be wonderful.
Traveler: I don't really have much experience with pets...
Lyney: No problem. As long as you aren't opposed to the idea, I'm happy to share my knowledge on the subject with you.
Lyney: Naturally, if you have any concerns, I will respect your thoughts and decisions.
