## Talk 2

Paimon: Whew... That sure was scary, with those monsters attacking out of nowhere like that. Good thing we're super strong, huh?
Traveler: Guess I'll be counting on you next time, Paimon.
Paimon: Huh? No no no, Paimon can't do that! Who'd want to fight those scary monsters, anyway!?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: Heh, looks like he's getting anxious already. Let's just find a way to hatch the egg first!
Traveler: Activate the incubator.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): The incubator is back in action...
All you need to do now is wait...
Hours pass, but nothing happens to the Saurian egg. It doesn't change at all...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err... Errh?
Paimon: Weird. Nothing seems to have happened. Have we messed something up? Let's try again!
Traveler: Let's try again...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You reboot the incubator as the instructions indicate...
But just as with your previous attempt, nothing happens to the Saurian egg...
Paimon: Aw... How long do we need to wait? Paimon's zoning out over here... Also, she's getting dizzy... and hungry...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrah... Grgh...
Paimon: Huh!? Wait! Wait! It moved!
Traveler: Let's wait a little longer, shall we?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): After a long while...
The Saurian egg remains unchanged. No reaction, no sign of hatching.
Paimon: Still nothing... Could this incubator be broken? But its lights are on! Hmm. Is the problem with the egg, then?
Paimon: ...Hmm, waiting around doesn't seem like it'll help... Should we just take the egg with us?
Traveler: No matter how hungry you get, don't even think about eating it, alright...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wraah! Wraah!
Paimon: #Come on, of course not! Also, don't give {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} any strange ideas!
Paimon: Well, little fella, Paimon means that... if the problem's with the egg, it might never...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rroo...
Paimon: #Don't be sad, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. There's nothing we can do about it...
Traveler: Perhaps the environment here isn't suitable...
Paimon: Y'know, you're right! Maybe the egg isn't hatching because it thinks Natlan hasn't changed and isn't suited to be its home!
Paimon: After all, it's been hiding inside here for so long, right? Of course it doesn't know what a wonderful place Natlan's become!
Paimon: So, let's take it back and take good care of it! We'll tell it stories about beautiful landscapes, thrilling adventures, and all the wonderful people we've met — every single day!
Paimon: In short, we'll let it know how great Natlan is now! Once it gets excited enough, it'll surely hatch on its own!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ...Brwarh.
Traveler: Or perhaps... the egg doesn't believe that this is the right time...
Traveler: #What do you think, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err... Errh?
Traveler: No, it didn't.
Paimon: #Huh!? But... Just now... Was Paimon imagining things? No, it can't be. Did you see that, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err... Errh?
Paimon: #Ah... So you didn't see it either? Was it really just Paimon's imagination, then? So, what do we do, Traveler? Are we gonna just wait?
Paimon: Or... could the problem be with the egg? B—But, if that's the case, does that mean it'll never hatch?
Traveler: The egg itself might be the issue here.
Paimon: Huh? So, does... does this mean that it might never hatch?
Traveler: Hmph, is that all they've got?
Paimon: Exactly! You'd think they'd be super strong with how scary they looked! But really, our little fella hits harder than they do!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: To think that these things happened... Milchi, and the person who left these notes behind... Everyone was so brave...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: This is... This is that hibernating Saurian egg mentioned in those notes!
Paimon: #Are you trying to say that we should use the incubator to hatch it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: Hmm, the egg does look like it's in good shape, and there's a manual for the incubator. Let's give it a try, shall we?
Traveler: No clue if it'll work, but we can give it a go.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Nice, looks like our little buddy's about to meet a new friend!
