# The Black Nacre and the All-Devouring Kraken


## Talk 1

Park Announcement Speaker: Staff and equipment in position. Mechanisms are prepped and ready.
Park Announcement Speaker: This performance of "The Black Nacre and the All-Devouring Kraken," a play from "Daiya's Three-Day Reverie," will now begin!
Narrator On Speaker: Docked in the port closest to the rumored location of the treasure, the crew of the pirate ship "Black Nacre" is recruiting new sailors and restocking before the final and most crucial leg of the voyage...
Narrator On Speaker: Experienced adventurers set foot on the deck of the Black Nacre. They're outstanding fighters, but novice sailors...
Chief Mate: Ahoy there, landlubbers! Get on over here!
Paimon: Huh? The voice from the speaker changed. It sounds like someone really serious is calling us...
Paimon: So, it's trying to interact with us?
Chief Mate: Who else would I be talking to? You're the best out of this sorry bunch of scallywags, we can't set sail without you!
Chief Mate: I'm the Chief Mate of the Black Nacre! You'll be working with me on this voyage, savvy?
Chief Mate: Perk up, sailors! It's your first day on deck, and our quartermaster will make sure you get the best preserved meat, cream, hardtack, and Dandelion Wine!
Black Screen Text: The speaker continues to narrate the scene before you—

The Chief Mate appears to greet the raw recruits, dressed in ragged clothes and swaddled in bandages.
It is obvious that he has just survived a fierce fight.
Looking around, you see most of the sailors are seriously wounded...
However, they are in high spirits, showing no signs of fear or being discouraged...
The sailors gather around you, applauding the newcomers and offering welcome gifts and food.
Paimon: Oh! So the speaker also provides detailed narration of the scene, like the scene just now — we were just welcomed onboard the Black Nacre...
Paimon: So... shall we play along?
Paimon: Hehe, thank you, thank you everyone! We haven't had the preserved meat or hardtack here yet, but they must be tasty!
Traveler: It's a pity that we can't see the actors or props.
Paimon: Yeah... the attraction is called "Three-Day Reverie," so are we just supposed to rely on our own powers of daydreaming?
Paimon: Though, it probably does save a lot on costs... Building a real pirate ship, actually being able to sail anywhere at a moment's notice... That must be expensive...
Paimon: But still! Only having a narrator is too far. We can only imagine so much!
Traveler: Guess we'll have to try!
Paimon: Alright, Paimon will give it a try...
Narrator On Speaker: As the noise dies down, a powerful-looking man appears on the bridge.
Narrator On Speaker: He is dressed just like a common sailor, save for the ragged tricorne on his head. His left hand is missing, replaced by a rusty hook.
Chief Mate: Attention on deck! Captain Will's arrived!
Captain Will: The time is now, me hearties! Get to your positions, double check your weapons and our supplies, and prepare the ship! Get ready to weigh anchor!
Paimon: Whoa! The Captain is here. He sounds so calm... and reliable!
Captain Will: The treasure isn't far now, lads! The final leg of the voyage is by far the most important!
Captain Will: Our wounded comrades, drowned supplies, lost Dusk Birds, and even the casks of rum we scrimped and saved for... the price we paid will not have been in vain!
Captain Will: As long as we find the legendary treasure, we can appease the Kraken before the deadline! Never again must we seek dishonest merchants to plunder for pocket change!
Captain Will: So give it your all, you scurvy seadogs! Do it so our town may know peace, and our friends and family need no longer fear tyranny and toil! Full speed ahead!
Sailor: Treasure! Treasure! Full speed ahead! For peace!
Narrator On Speaker: Having welcomed powerful new recruits aboard, the Black Nacre prepares to weigh anchor and set sail for the treasure.
Paimon: Oooh, the speaker really set the scene! The goal of these pirates is really different from what Paimon imagined... Paimon's curious what happens next!
Paimon: The speaker said we can ride the Choo-Choo Cart to continue the play... Paimon likes this pace!
Paimon: #Anchors aweigh, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Paimon and me, that's how it's gonna be!
Traveler: Otherwise, this could be quite immersive.

## Talk 2

Narrator On Speaker: Marvelous! Congratulations! With the strength of the new sailors, Captain Will easily defeats his old enemies, sending them running.
Narrator On Speaker: Having overcome every challenge the voyage could throw at them, nothing can stop the crew of the Black Nacre now!
Captain Will: Such is the loyal crew of the Black Nacre, me lads! Even when those lily-livered biscuit eaters ambushed us, not one of you panicked...
Captain Will: And of course, our newest crewmembers contributed mightily! They swept away all opposition like it was so much flotsam and jetsam!
Paimon: #Of course! Bad pirates like that? Paimon and {NICKNAME} could fight two or three boatloads more!
Traveler: Getting into it, Paimon?
Paimon: I—It's okay! The journey was pretty thrilling, and we've been through thick and thin with Captain Will. So Paimon can be a bit more serious!
Captain Will: Based on our research, if we break that stone wall, we can find the legendary treasure.
Captain Will: The crucial moment has arrived. I shall give the honor to our heroes, our new companions!
Captain Will: And after that, I've got a new idea I'd like to discuss with all of you...
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}! See how much the Captain values us? He's even letting us handle something as important as this!
Traveler: Fire in the hole!
Chief Mate: Get ready to celebrate, lads! Heroes, go ahead and open it!
Traveler: Let's open the treasure together!
Traveler: Guess it's not that bad after all?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Yay! We found it! The legendary treasure! So much Mora, Paimon can really swim in it!
Paimon: But, why does this Mora seem different from the Mora we usually see? Don't tell Paimon...
Narrator On Speaker: Hey! The legendary "pool of Mora" is actually just a bunch of decorative fake coins!?
Narrator On Speaker: Faced with such an unexpected development, what will the crew of the Black Nacre do?
Chief Mate: Captain! We were hornswoggled! Could our intel have been wrong? The legendary treasure... how could it all be fake?
Captain Will: No wonder I had a bad feeling about this.
Captain Will: The so-called legendary treasure could be bait— luring us into a trap.
Captain Will: And their goal: the very people who braved hell and high water in search of treasure... and the quality weapons and advanced ships they bring with them.
Captain Will: The sailors, exhausted by the journey, can easily be captured and sold as labor.
Paimon: No, NO! We were all tricked! How could this be a giant trap!?
Traveler: From a cost perspective, it makes sense.
Paimon: Oh! Uh... you have a point. Paimon forgot we were acting...
Paimon: Okay, even though there aren't any other actors, and the set is a bit shabby, Paimon can tell a lot of work went into this! Paimon thinks we should respect that.
Paimon: Let's hear what our crewmates from the Black Nacre have to say!
Narrator On Speaker: Captain Will gathers the inconsolable sailors in front of the fake treasure.
Chief Mate: Captain, is this... is this the doing of your enemies?
Captain Will: No, this is beyond them. If we didn't make it, they'd be disappointed in their old foe.
Captain Will: Perhaps... the ones behind this are on their way here now. Given our current state, it wouldn't be wise to take them head on.
Captain Will: Clean up the area, see if there are any chests we missed, and get ready to withdraw.
Captain Will: Ho! I always said hard work is rewarded. See that chest over there? It's for our newest sailors, who've done so much! No arguing, it's theirs even if the rest of us go home empty-handed!
Sailor: Ugh... Not only did we not make any money, we racked up a lot of losses!
Sailor: What're we going to do? Keep searching for dishonest profiteers to try and scrape together enough booty to satisfy the Kraken?
Captain Will: I was about to point out that on this voyage, we of the Black Nacre found a treasure more precious than Mora, and are not going back with nothing to show for it!
Captain Will: We found the ways to cross the roaring seas, strategies to defeat our enemies, and the courage to face any challenge!
Captain Will: Think about it, me buckos! Even if we found an ocean of Mora, would it really buy peace for our town?
Sailor: ...That makes sense...
Sailor: We all know how greedy the Kraken is. No matter how much treasure we shove down its filthy gob, it'll always ask for seconds!
Sailor: Aye, he's right. I've heard even rich towns have given it dozens of times more treasure than we, yet still it hungers.
Traveler: The problem is that appeasement of a monster...
Paimon: You're right! If it was up to Paimon, we wouldn't let that monster have its way. But the Captain and his crew are just ordinary people...
Captain Will: So, we must solve the problem at its source! That's why giving it more Mora doesn't make any sense.
Captain Will: With the fighting experience we gained on this voyage, I'm sure we can defeat the Kraken, and lift the shadow it casts over our town!
Captain Will: Come, me hearties, do you trust your Captain?
Chief Mate: It sounds risky, Captain, but it's worth a shot.
Sailor: This is the only way. If we keep giving in, eventually we'll have nothing left... and we'll have nowhere to run.
Sailor: The Captain's right! It's worth risking our lives for. We can't take it any longer!
Captain Will: Then it's settled! From now on, I will train everyone on the Black Nacre for this sole purpose.
Captain Will: Especially now! Our newest crewmates are true swashbucklers, they're practically invincible!
Captain Will: Captain Will is by no means a rich man, but if you lend us your strength, the whole crew of the Black Nacre will do everything in their power to repay you.
Captain Will: Will you voyage with the Black Nacre, train with us, and punish that Kraken for its perfidy?
Paimon: Yeah! That's the spirit! Be brave, and fight that awful sea monster!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's help our friends on the Black Nacre!
Traveler: My pleasure!
Captain Will: Arrr, amazing! Yer no longer novice sailors, yer old salt, core members of the Black Nacre crew! Yer my helpers and the saviors of the rest of my crew and all the people in town!
Captain Will: Now it's time for the Black Nacre to return to port. We'll rest up and prepare for our final battle against the beast!
Black Screen Text: The speaker begins to summarize the end of the first act——

After triumphing in numerous trials, the new sailors are now pillars of the crew.
Led by Captain Will, the crew is preparing for a crucial counterattack...
Please stay tuned for the Black Nacre and the All-Devouring Kraken Act II: "The Black Nacre Strikes Back"!
Black Screen Text: The narration ends, and the motion of the mechanisms inside the cave grinds to a halt. Silence reigns once more...
Paimon: Ah, it just ends there? Paimon was just starting to get into it!
Traveler: Maybe they haven't finished the Kraken yet.
Paimon: You have a point there. If the play was any longer, most guests would be too tired to fight a sea monster...
Paimon: And the set really could use some work. Something as exciting as a boss fight deserves a proper stage!
Paimon: Daiya's Three-Day Reverie certainly has potential! Paimon's getting curious who this Daiya person is!
Traveler: Kind of nice to have an intermission.
Traveler: Sushi's on the menu tonight!
Traveler: Is never the best answer...
Traveler: They can't actually have a pool of Mora here.
