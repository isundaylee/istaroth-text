# Missing title (903892247)


## Talk 1

Grandmaster Hanakado: Splendid, splendid!
Grandmaster Hanakado: I did not expect the Arataki Gang to defeat so many mighty beetle fighters. It seems that you are well-versed in this art.
Grandmaster Hanakado: I take back what I once said. You are respectable and worthy opponents, and I must face you as such â€” with my full strength!
Paimon: Alrighty! Bull-Chucker, you're our leader. It's your time to shine!
Paimon: And, uh, don't take what was said earlier seriously!
Traveler: You're up, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King!
Arataki Itto: Hahahahahaha! Oh, it's on! The final showdown, and my soon-to-be final victory!
Arataki Itto: I don't know how you've been leading your crew, but the results speak for themselves: The Arataki Gang rules!
Arataki Itto: Grandmaster Hanakado, get ready to battle!
Traveler: The King versus the Grandmaster! This will be legendary!

## Talk 2

Grandmaster Hanakado: I see. I see... Let us battle once more. This time, I'll see through all of your methods.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Victory and defeat no longer seem so important... Let's just battle for fun, shall we?
Grandmaster Hanakado: It's rare that I should find such a great opponent. It would be a shame to end our battles so soon, would it not?
Arataki Itto: Sure! Bring it on!
Arataki Itto: But seeing through my secret beetle-fighting techniques? Nah, little fella, that ain't gonna happen!
Arataki Itto: If you'll admit that I'm the stronger beetle fighter, I'll fight you for as many rounds as you want!
Paimon: Huh, looks like Bull-Chucker and Grandmaster Hanakado are still raring to go... Well, let's leave them to it! They can battle beetles till the beetle-battling's done!
