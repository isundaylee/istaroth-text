## Talk 1

Conulaf: *sob* I did not expect to be locked up in this cage... My dignity as one of the Masters of the Night-Wind is all but gone now, surely!
Conulaf: A disgrace to the tribe, a disgrace indeed...
Traveler: You again? What happened this time?
Conulaf: Ah, my savior, we meet again... *sigh* I'm sorry you had to see that.
Conulaf: Ah, did I not say previously that my name is Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind?
Conulaf: As the name suggests, I'm presently in training to become a priest. And... Well, our tribal elders told me that my ancestor, Sanhaj, used to get into betting battles with people from other tribes, often tricking them silly in the process.
Conulaf: And so the elders said, "Go make and win some bets! That's the only way to qualify as a true Master of the Night-Wind!"
Conulaf: So when I passed by and saw a tournament taking place, I... I made a bet too. I mean, who cares if you've got a "defending Tepetlisaurus champion" or a "Qucusaurus, the decade's strongest rookie"...
Conulaf: Our Iktomisaurs would be the strongest, naturally!
Conulaf: That's what I thought, anyway... but I bet on the wrong Saurian.
Conulaf: Not only did I wind up in debt, but I got locked in here to boot...
Conulaf: "Heh, tell you what," they said. "We'll give you ten times your Mora back if the Iktomisaurus emerges the champ. If not, you can just stay in this cage, alright?"
Conulaf: What should I do now? Oh, if only there was an Iktomisaurus who could give those other two Saurians a good thumping...
Conulaf: That way, I could get out of here, and get ten times the Mora too! ... Ah, I mean, most importantly, we can't have those two tribes look down on our wonderful Iktomisaurs!
Conulaf: *sob* Please, dear savior. If you could find such an Iktomisaurus...
Conulaf: *sigh* I probably shouldn't spout such nonsense. You're not of our tribe anyway — where are you supposed to just find an Iktomisaurus like that?
Traveler: I'll see about finding one...
Conulaf: R—Really, could you? I—In that case, I'm just going to stay in this cage and wait for an update from you...

## Talk 2

Conulaf (???): *sob* I did not expect to be locked up in this cage... My dignity as one of the Masters of the Night-Wind is all but gone now, surely!
Conulaf (???): A disgrace to the tribe, a disgrace indeed...
Traveler: Who are you, and how did you wind up here?
Conulaf: Me? I... I'm Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Conulaf: As the name suggests, I'm presently in training to become a priest. And... Well, our tribal elders told me that my ancestor, Sanhaj, used to get into betting battles with people from other tribes, often tricking them silly in the process.

Conulaf: *sob* Please, dear blonde traveler. If you could find such an Iktomisaurus...
Conulaf: *sigh* I probably shouldn't spout such nonsense. You're not of our tribe anyway — where are you supposed to just find an Iktomisaurus like that?

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: The Iktomisaurus makes a sudden, dynamic entrance and defeats the original victor, the "Crimson Dancer."
As agreed, the organizer frees the reckless young lady from the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Conulaf: *sob* Ohhh... I thought I was about to be sent home in a cage, my family forced to pay my debts...
Conulaf: And while I was in there, I suddenly remembered that our ancestors would stack the deck first before betting, which is how they'd win...
Conulaf: So, yes, I had much time for self-reflection while in this cage — you know, about my unrealistic expectations of beating others at their own game.
Conulaf: I don't know where you managed to find such a powerful Iktomisaurus...
Conulaf: But I'm grateful all the same! With your help, I've recovered my investment, and even earned back ten times the Mora I put in!
Conulaf: I, on the other hand, barely did anything... But I'll need to find a soft bed to lie down on all the same. My back hurts all over from being stuck in this cage for half a day.
Conulaf: As for the winnings, you keep them, dear savior! The elders said that keeping an unexpected windfall close will only bring one misfortune, so it's best I give it away!

## Talk 4

Excited "Children of Echoes" Warrior: Come on, Gigadrill! You're the previous champ — no way you'll lose to that soft-looking Qucusaurus!
Excited "Children of Echoes" Warrior: That's it, Drill, that's it! Bob and weave, and look for an opportunity!

## Talk 5

Conulaf: Oh great Sanhaj, please take pity upon your poor descendant... Guide my savior to *a mighty Iktomisaurus indeed*...
Conulaf: May those from the other tribes who have humiliated your progeny be taught a lesson... *sob*

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior: Odds are one to one-point-zero-five. Both sides are quite evenly matched in strength... But I'm hoping Gigadrill takes the win.
Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior: Still, you saw how Crimson Dancer warded off Gigadrill's signature drill attack by ducking into its feathers — launched a counterattack right after, too.
Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior: The situation's looking dicey for Gigadrill, I'd say...

### Additional Talk 2

Relaxed "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior: Hmm? You're a new face. First time watching the contest? No rules here, mind, but if you lose the bet, then your Mora goes to the house, y'hear?
Relaxed "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior: We had a lass from the Masters of the Night-Wind who couldn't pay up after losing a while back. You know where she is now? Bawling inside that cage, that's where.

### Additional Talk 3

Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior: Both sides are engaging full-force now, but if they keep doing that, it's going to take a huge toll on their endurance...
Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior: Hehe... Come on now... When do we get to see those finishing moves...

### Additional Talk 4

Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior: Good, you're not seriously injured, and there's a sauro-vet clinic nearby... We'll do a complete checkup once we get there.
Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior: But I can see that we've still got a long way to go, Gigadrill... Let's do this together.
"Gigadrill": Wroo...

### Additional Talk 5

Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior: Heh... Feeling sore about that loss, are ya?
"Crimson Dancer": Crooo...
Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior: That Iktomisaurus... *sigh* Can hardly believe such a strong one exists. Still, a loss is a loss. We'll just have to win next time!
"Crimson Dancer": Grrawk!
