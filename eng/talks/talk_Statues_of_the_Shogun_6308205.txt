Traveler: Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: *sigh* It used to be our best-selling product...
Kaede: Sadly, we've lost our customer base ever since the lockdown happened. And such a delicate item is not cheap to craft, so we've had no choice but to take them off the shelves.
