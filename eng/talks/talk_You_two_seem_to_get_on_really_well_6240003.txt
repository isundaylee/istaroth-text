Traveler: You two seem to get on really well.
Sun Yu: I've always treated her like a sister...
Sun Yu: We've always been inseparable when practicing martial arts, like a form to its shadow. I consider us equally matched, both in combat and in courage.

Sun Yu: She has an odd temperament, normally being prone to chatter... Yet with me, she is like a completely different person. I find this a bit of a headache to comprehend.
