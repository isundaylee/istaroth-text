Smiley Yanxiao: *sigh* What should I do...?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, it's you. Nothing's wrong... except I might need to start looking for a new job soon.
Smiley Yanxiao: The other day, the innkeeper asked me to prepare a new dish that would attract more guests.
Smiley Yanxiao: It should be presentable and tasty, but also stylish and artisan. Oh, and have personality...
Smiley Yanxiao: I've been trying to come up with something satisfactory over the last week, but the innkeeper didn't like any dish I came up with.
Traveler: What did you make?
Smiley Yanxiao: I gave it all I had, really. I utilized everything I learned while honing my culinary skills in the mountains.
Smiley Yanxiao: Candied Silk Flower, Qingxin and Lotus Seed Duck Stew, Crab Roe Stewed Meatballs...
Smiley Yanxiao: ...But he would shake his head at everything and ask me to give it another thought.
Smiley Yanxiao: But I've already reached my limit, eh...
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, right! I still gotta cook something for that freeloader. It's about time he came around...
Traveler: Do you mean Jiangxue?
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you know of any other parasites who'd shamelessly come here every day asking for food...
Smiley Yanxiao: Since you're already here, why don't you grab a bite too? You can sit over there. I'll serve the food when it's ready.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haven't you already reached your limit?
Smiley Yanxiao: At least he isn't as picky as the innkeeper. A few regular dishes should be enough for him.

## Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: What do you think you're doing? You can't just waltz into the kitchen whenever you feel like it!

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That they did, alright. There's a guest lodging here named Ling'guan. She ordered a serving of Almond Tofu a while earlier and, after paying, wanted me to deliver it to someplace north of Dihua Marsh.
Smiley Yanxiao: But we've been really busy here at the inn, and I haven't the time to go out and deliver the food myself. If you could help me out, that would be great. I'll be sure to compensate you fairly.

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: What, you here to lend me a hand?
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, you're just in time. Someone named Ling'guan ordered a Matsutake Meat Roll from me.
Smiley Yanxiao: She wanted me to send it to some spot northwest of Dihua Marsh. The Mora's already been paid out, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, if you've got time, how about helping me deliver it? You'll be compensated.

### Talk 1 related talk 2

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: Sure did. That... guest, Tingfang, ordered some Black-Back Perch Stew earlier.
Smiley Yanxiao: He said that he wanted it delivered to some place in Sal Terrae...
Smiley Yanxiao: If you're up for it, why don't you help me take it out to him? You'll be paid for your work.

### Talk 1 related talk 3

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: So it's like this: that air-headed Ling'guan ordered some Come And Get It, saying that she'd come back and eat it later. But my money's on her having wandered off somewhere and gotten lost.
Smiley Yanxiao: Go deliver this to her. *Steady now, and don't run around however you like*, or it'll spill.
Smiley Yanxiao: *Try to avoid touching elemental stuff as well, or the taste might get all mixed up*.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it goes bad, come back here and I'll whip up another serving for you.

### Talk 1 related talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That fellow Tingfang ordered some Black-Back Perch Stew. He should have headed off to Qingce Village by now.
Smiley Yanxiao: This Black-Back Perch Stew has had greater emphasis placed on the quality of its soup. So you *can't fly or climb all over the place*, or you'll spill it for sure. You'll want to make the delivery quick, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.

### Talk 1 related talk 5

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: Aye, you heard right. Ling'guan ordered some Stir-Fried Filet before heading northwest.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it isn't too much trouble, deliver it to her while it's hot, will you?
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.

### Talk 1 related talk 6

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That's right. Ling'guan asked for some Almond Tofu before heading off to Mingyun Village again.
Smiley Yanxiao: It's an odd place, Mingyun Village is.
Smiley Yanxiao: In any case, I hope to get someone who can help me deliver it to her.

Traveler: About Sausage...
Smiley Yanxiao: Yes, I've just posted a commission for some. Have you already prepared two Sausages?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.

### Talk 1 related talk 10

Traveler: ...Wh—Who are you?
Smiley Yanxiao: I am Yanxiao, a sous-chef.
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you have something seriously urgent to tell me, you'd better get out of my kitchen.
Traveler: ...Just a sous-chef?
Smiley Yanxiao: What's the big deal? Didn't you see me chopping meat and making a soup?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.

### Talk 1 related talk 11

Traveler: Oh, sorry...
Smiley Yanxiao: It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.

Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Smiley Yanxiao: Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
Smiley Yanxiao: But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called Chongyun through some friends.
Smiley Yanxiao: If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.
