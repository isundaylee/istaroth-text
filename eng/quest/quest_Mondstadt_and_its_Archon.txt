### Additional Talk 1

Grace: Have you gathered the Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: Have them right here.
Grace: These should be enough. Please wait here for a moment...
Grace: ...Lord Barbatos, please hear me...
Paimon: Wow, she's so... devout. So... many words...
Paimon: Who knows if that Tone-Deaf Bard is listening...
Grace: Alright. Please take these dandelions seeds. Help me go up and scatter them.
Grace: I should really do this myself, but with my physical abilities... I would probably have a hard time getting back down, even if I could climb up there.
Grace: So I'm counting on you.

### Additional Talk 2

Grace: Have you scattered the Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: I've done just that.
Grace: Regardless, I do hope that Lord Barbatos will be able to hear my voice.
Grace: Thank you for your willingness to help. Please take this for your troubles â€” and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
Traveler: The wind will carry them far abroad.
Grace: That's wonderful. It should be easy for Lord Barbatos to notice.

### Additional Talk 3

Grace: Lord Barbatos, I hope that you can hear me...
