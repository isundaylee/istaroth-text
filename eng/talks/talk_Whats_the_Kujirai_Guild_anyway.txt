Traveler: What's the Kujirai Guild, anyway?
Kujirai Momiji: It's an association for the children of the sea...
Kujirai Momiji: *cough* Sorry, was that too hard to understand? Let me try that again.
Kujirai Momiji: The Kujirai Guild was created by yours truly, and it's a fishing association revolving around the Kujirai Fishing Method.
Kujirai Momiji: It's not the biggest organization around, but each of our members is a certified ace angler!
Kujirai Momiji: And it is my belief that with our hereditary art, the Kujirai Fishing Method, our guild will one day spread all over the land!
Kujirai Momiji: How about it, then? If you join now, you'll get to be a founder, y'know?
