Hirotatsu: So many congratulatory letters and gifts from everywhere... Gotta make sure to keep a record of them all.
Hirano: Dandelion Wine from Mondstadt, Cor Lapis from Liyue Harbor... Hmm? These... are marked for delivery to the Yashiro Commission and Amenoma Smithy.
Hirotatsu: Huh. They look like forging blueprints, and none I've ever seen before... But they are of Inazuman style. Could they be schematics that were lost at some point in the past?
Hirano: I'd guess Akademiya historians recreated and collated them. Couldn't have been easy, I'll say that. The sender has signed off as... the Vahumana school?
