Safety Notice: "Article 133: Mining tools are not to be disassembled or repaired without authorization. In case of a malfunction or problem, the equipment in question is to be delivered to the Macuahuitl Workshop!"
Safety Notice: "And definitely don't go thinking the mining tools safe operation limits are set too low, or that they aren't up to the task, and make your own personal 'super modifications' to them..."
Safety Notice: "Last time, one of the crew adjusted the drill's power to three times the normal output... He's still in the hospital recovering, and we don't have any indication when his bones will mend or his hearing will recover."
Safety Notice: "If you're still not convinced, why not go have a chat with him yourself?"
