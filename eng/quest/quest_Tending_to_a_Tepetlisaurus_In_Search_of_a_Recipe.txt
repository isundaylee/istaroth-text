# Tending to a Tepetlisaurus: In Search of a Recipe


## Talk 1

Cazcal: Hmm... Looks like we'll need to try a different recipe...
Hora: Oroooo! Rrroooo!
Traveler: Another bright idea? Let's hear it then.
Cazcal: R—Roar!
Cazcal: Normally Hora can finish a whole bowl of fruit, and once he's done, he'll go on playing all day long.
Cazcal: But now, he only eats half a bowl, then he just sits there not moving a muscle...
Cazcal: I was so worried he might be ill that I went to find a vet in the middle of the night to ask his advice.
Cazcal: The two of us spent the entire night trying to figure out what was wrong with him, only to realize he wasn't ill at all, just... a very picky eater.
Cazcal: The vet said that the best solution would be to find a new recipe.
Cazcal: He also said that I could try playing some music for Hora during mealtimes, that it might stimulate his appetite...
Traveler: That sounds like a great idea...
Cazcal: Hahaha, yeah, I did find a record, and Hora was pretty into it, too.
Cazcal: But we were forced to abandon that idea... when Hora jumped up and bit the record in half.
Cazcal: Don't look so shocked. From a Tepetlisaurus's point of view, a record made from obsidian and phlogiston is a tasty treat in itself...
Cazcal: Now, my only option is to head over to the Scions of the Canopy and see if anyone there can help me find some new ingredients to try out.
Traveler: I'll go find some ingredients for you.
Cazcal: You'd really help me out? That would be terrific! My Scion friends can only search within Natlan, but you could source ingredients from anywhere, couldn't you?
Cazcal: Hold up, let me look at the list of ingredients the vet recommended. That doc knows a lot, even about things beyond our borders...
Cazcal: Huh... It says that we can try <color=#00E1FFFF>"Rainbow Roses," "Lavender Melons,"</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>"Qingxin."</color>
Cazcal: Thanks so much for doing this. If you come across any unique ingredients, just bring them straight back to me.
Hora: Orrooo, orrooo!
Traveler: I'm a pro when it comes to ingredient gathering.
Traveler: I had no idea such records existed.
Traveler: (Pet Hora.)
Hora: R—Roar!

Hora: Missing text (237648106)

## Talk 3

Cazcal: Now that's a pretty flower. Nice-sounding name, too... Hora, fancy a bite?
Hora: Wroo, rrooh!
Hora: (Hora chews it carefully, as if savoring the flavor of the petals.)
Hora: R—Roar...
Cazcal: Oh! From the way he looks, I'd say he likes it a lot. But flowers on their own won't be enough to fill him up...
Cazcal: Plus, this type of flower sure doesn't look cheap... Anyway, I'll just go ahead and write it down for now.
Cazcal: How do you make flowers into food? Oh, maybe we can... mix them into some kind of cake?

## Talk 4

Cazcal: Whoa, that's one big fruit! It should be enough to fill him up, from the look of it. Fancy a go at it, Hora?
Hora: Wroo, rrooh!
Hora: (Hora starts chomping away, and before long it's all gone.)
Hora: Oroooo! Rrroooo!
Cazcal: Hahaha, gone in a flash. You must have liked that a lot, huh, kiddo?
Hora: Wroo, rrooh! Hroooo—
Cazcal: Great! I'll go find someone to ask in a bit, see if anyone knows where to find Inazuman merchants. I need to get my hands on more Lavender Melons...

## Talk 5

Cazcal: This one smells pretty good. Real refreshing aroma...
Cazcal: Hora? You... Well, would you look at that! He's only gone and eaten it whole!
Hora: (Hora swallows the Qingxin in a single gulp, then blinks at you...)
Black Screen Text: Hora suddenly turns around and eats up the half bowl of fruit next to him, all in one go...
Cazcal: Hora's appetite seems to have returned all of a sudden... How did that happen? Was it really all thanks to this Qingxin thingamajig?
Cazcal: I—I have to talk to the vet about this...
