Traveler: Something on your mind?
Zohreh: Yes, I'm a logistics buyer for the Akademiya. I mainly purchase things like spices and blankets.
Zohreh: I said I'm a buyer, but the reality is that most of my time working is spent on calculating prices and applying for budgets...

Traveler: See you.
Zohreh: See you. I have to prepare another pitch for a new budget application...

Traveler: The Akademiya wants to purchase these things...?
Zohreh: That's right. After all, researchers, students, and other staff all need to sleep and eat.
Zohreh: The Akademiya may have a handle on knowledge, but they still depend on the people for production and need to purchase daily supplies from the private sectors on a regular basis.
Zohreh: However, the Akademiya also provides everyone with free healthcare, imparts knowledge through the Akasha Terminal, and covers the costs of holding necessary festival celebrations.

## Talk 5

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? Don't tell me you've got yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya!
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine with school!
Sanad: I just want to borrow your theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need some reference materials! Yeah, that's what they are for, reference only!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: What's more, if it's something of reference value, it's probably already archived in the Akasha. Why don't you apply for access?
Zohreh: Instead of borrowing my out-of-date theses, why don't you discuss your ideas with top students in your school?
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... One could even say he's an overacheiver. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.

## Talk 6

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? You haven't gotten yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya, have you?
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine at school!
Sanad: I.. just want to borrow some of your old theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need them as... reference materials! Yeah, that's right!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: I'd say that you might get more out of discussing your ideas with some better students in your cohort, as opposed to borrowing my theses from way back when.
Zohreh: Perhaps a little discussion might lead to something new altogether. You never know...
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... or perhaps we should say that he achieves too much. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil right now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.
