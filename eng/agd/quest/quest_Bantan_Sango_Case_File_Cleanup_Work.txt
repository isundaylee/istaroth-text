# Bantan Sango Case File: Cleanup Work


## Talk 1

Ryuuji: Huh. What are the odds, Traveler? Sango was right about us meeting again.
Traveler: What brings you here?
Ryuuji: Sango asked me to finish up the last job.
Ryuuji: Which just involves bringing some dessert to the Doushin to thank them for their assistance.
Traveler: They should be thanking us.
Ryuuji: That's true. Well, it's just an excuse to improve our relationship with them.
Ryuuji: After all, our detective agency may need their help someday.
Traveler: It sounds just like Sango...
Ryuuji: Haha, yes. Your intuition is as sharp as ever.
Traveler: So what do you think of all this, personally?
Ryuuji: Me? Amano and Andou... We used to be colleagues, so it's normal to show a bit of kindness with some dessert.
Ryuuji: But... Sango also asked me to investigate another matter today, so the timing is a bit tight...
Ryuuji: Traveler, could you please help me deliver these desserts to three people?
Traveler: No problem.
Ryuuji: Thanks for your help.
Ryuuji: Here are three packs of desserts for Amano, Andou, and Mr. Owada.
Traveler: Mr. Owada?
Ryuuji: He is also my... former colleague. He was good to me before I left the police force.
Ryuuji: He also helped us deal with the police on the serial burglary case previously.
Ryuuji: I'll leave it to you then, Traveler. After you finish delivering the dessert, we'll meet back here.
Traveler: I think it would be better for you to deliver them.
Ryuuji: But... Sango's request is more important...
Ryuuji: I'll find time to visit the three of them later.
Traveler: Sango must have taught you this.
Traveler: Wasn't it us who helped them?

## Talk 2

Amano: Oh, it's you, Traveler. What are you doing here?
Traveler: This is for you from Ryuuji.
Amano: Oh? Let's see... Wow, Sakura Mochi... Ah, that lad Ryuuji, he really didn't have to...
Amano: #Hey, Andou. Stop being so cautious. The Traveler may be an outlander, but {F#she}{M#he} just helped us, didn't {F#she}{M#he}?
Amano: I'm surprised Ryuuji still remembers what we like. Being colleagues with him sure has its perks...
Traveler: You guys worked together with Ryuuji?
Amano: Hmm? He didn't mention it to you? We worked with him for a short time.
Amano: But he suddenly got wrapped up in a certain incident.
Amano: Thanks to Sango, the real culprit was caught and Ryuuji was exonerated. Later, he left the police station and went to work for Sango.
Amano: That's all I know...
Andou: Okay. That's probably enough about that.
Amano: True. Anyway, he's been having it a lot easier with Sango than with us.
Amano: If I could, I'd also like to...
Andou: Hey, come on...
Amano: Ahem! By the way, thank you, Traveler. I'll take these desserts.
Amano: Say hello to Ryuuji and Sango for me.

## Talk 3

Owada: Hmm? You're... the Traveler, right? I heard Amano mention you.
Owada: Is there something you'd like to see me about?
Traveler: This is from Ryuuji.
Owada: Wow, it's Sakura Mochi... Well then, I can't simply eat it casually. I'll have to find a nice place to enjoy it.
Owada: Uesugi, please cover for me a bit. If someone comes to see me, tell them to wait a moment.
Uesugi: But it's work hours, Mr. Owada...
Owada: Hahaha, it's okay. I'm just going out for some air. I'll be back soon.
Uesugi: *sigh*... Okay, but please come back soon. If any of the higher-ups come by...
Owada: Don't worry, we just solved a case, so if someone comes, they'll be here to praise us.
Owada: I'll leave it to you then, Uesugi.
Owada: Traveler, walk with me for a while. I know a perfect place for enjoying these Sakura Mochi.

## Talk 4

Owada: Ah... this place is nice, isn't it? I often come here...
Owada: The view is nice and the air is fresh.
Owada: If you have anything to ask me, now's the time.
Traveler: Are you Ryuuji's former colleague too?
Owada: Did Ryuuji tell you that? Yes, Ryuuji and I did work together once.
Owada: I don't know if Ryuuji has mentioned what happened back then.
Owada: Simply put, Ryuuji was too impulsive. He wound up walking into a trap and becoming a scapegoat.
Owada: I vouched for him, but the judge still insisted on convicting him.
Owada: I asked many people to help investigate, but they either came back empty-handed or told me not to continue the investigation.
Owada: Heh. At that time, I... How should I put it... I heeded the warning and didn't investigate further.
Owada: It is a "secret" that everyone knows, just like the fact that Ryuuji was wrongly accused, so I don't mind telling you.
Traveler: But since everyone knows...
Owada: Ah, it's precisely because everyone knows that no one dares to interfere.
Owada: Fortunately, a detective who was out of the loop happened to come to the police station for business and became interested in the case.
Owada: Thanks to that detective, the case was finally solved and Ryuuji's name was cleared.
Owada: Ryuuji left the police station and worked for that detective from then on. That's the whole story.
Traveler: Why are you telling me this?
Owada: Who asked you to give me this gift?
Traveler: Ryuuji.
Owada: I'm sure this gift was Sango's doing.
Owada: Given Ryuuji's character, if Sango had asked him to deliver the gift personally, he would have delivered it to me in mint condition even if I was trapped in a sea of fire.
Owada: But Ryuuji asked you to deliver the gift to me, which means that Sango asked him to have you do it.
Traveler: So Sango wanted me to know, then?
Owada: Hahaha, you're no slowcoach either. Your presence here means that Sango is telling me, "I have a new helper."
Owada: It seems that she isn't over what happened back then.
Owada: Actually, that's not surprising. After all... she hasn't found the real person who laid that trap yet...
Owada: Well, I've told you everything I can. You can decide for yourself whether you want to join Sango or not.
Owada: Oh, and thank Ryuuji for the Sakura Mochi for me. I've always enjoyed them.
Traveler: Why did Ryuuji leave the police?
Owada: It was his own choice to leave.

## Talk 5

Ryuuji: Sorry for troubling you, Traveler. Did you give the gifts to all of them?
Traveler: Did Sango arrange all this?
Ryuuji: You found out? Sorry... It was Sango's idea to get you to deliver those.
Ryuuji: Sango said that you will be indispensable in helping solve that case and uncovering the real culprit.
Traveler: Is the case still not completely solved?
Ryuuji: Not yet. Sango said everything had pointed perfectly to the "culprit" back then. Too perfectly, in fact.
Ryuuji: When Sango started her investigation, all the clues, motives, and evidence fell right into her hands and pointed to that "culprit."
Ryuuji: That person was held as the culprit by the police in the end, but Sango believed that the real culprit was someone else.
Ryuuji: I think the reason why she took me into her office was for the chance to solve that case.
Traveler: But what can I do to help...
Ryuuji: Sango's mind... I can't read it. But she mentioned to me that she might be getting tunnel vision from being in Inazuma for so long...
Ryuuji: If we had someone knowledgeable with a fresh set of eyes to help, perhaps there could be a breakthrough.
Ryuuji: Traveler, Sango may believe you are the one who can help her.
Traveler: So I guess I'm a detective as well now?
Ryuuji: If you're willing to help us, then of course you are.
Ryuuji: You have helped our agency so much, so please, accept the payment upfront this time.
Traveler: Did Sango tell you to say all this too?
Ryuuji: No, these are all my own words.
Ryuuji: Thank you again for your assistance. Feel free to come around more often. I'm sure Sango will welcome your presence as well.
Traveler: I suppose this case pays a lot?
Ryuuji: I couldn't give you a number, but the pay will be good enough, I'm sure.
Traveler: Is this case the perfect crime Sango was talking about?
Ryuuji: Indeed. Sango once told me that everything had pointed perfectly to the "culprit" back then. Too perfectly, in fact.
Ryuuji: When Sango started her investigation, all the clues, motives, and evidence fell right into her hands and pointed to that "culprit."
Ryuuji: That person was held as the culprit by the police in the end, but Sango believed that the real culprit was someone else.
Traveler: You could have just told me what happened...

## Talk 6

Ryuuji: I'll leave it to you then, Traveler. After you finish delivering the dessert, we'll meet back here.
