# Element of Different Nature

Paimon: Did... did you just feel the power of Geo?
Paimon: Your connection to the elements is so different from the Vision bearers'! Seems like you can physically switch between elements...
Paimon: If so, then you just need to make an offering to a Statue of The Seven and the elements will respond â€” just like they did in Mondstadt.
Paimon: We're now in Liyue, which is ruled over by the Geo Archon. That's why the statues here look a bit different.
Paimon: If you ever miss using your Anemo powers, you can just get them back from a Statue of The Seven in Mondstadt.
