Traveler: Fine. And you?
Rahman: Well, if I may be frank? Things are changing so very suddenly... It's hard not to feel lost.
Rahman: That's the truth of the matter, I fear.
Rahman: Though I'm not fond of the people on the other side of the Wall of Samiel, I'd like to think myself the sensible sort — I won't be having any further delusions about King Deshret's revival.
Rahman: We're friends now, I say — should you need me, I won't just stand idly by and watch.
Rahman: If I might say something else, I would warn you that you're up against the lofty Akademiya. Whatever you do, you've got to be careful.
