Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Take a look at this new law: 'All acrobatic troupes must stay away from the area of the Palais Mermonia.' What could the reasoning possibly be?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Lady Furina prances to and fro playing, but poor little artists can't even put on their performances. What a joke."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I don't think Lady Furina has ever breathed fire in front of the Palais Mermonia, resulting in the fire suppression mechanisms being activated and damaging a large number of files."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Why not go out and walk around a bit more? Even if just to read The Steambird or something?"
