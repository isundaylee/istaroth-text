Alcina: If you hadn't told me, I would never have known that he was in this line before.
Rege: Heh. I mean, it's not completely unreasonable. Doing dirty business doesn't mean you don't accumulate experience, right?
Rege: Now he's changed jobs to some sort of financial consultant, mentioning a few "investment trends" to the Boss every so often for some easy Mora. Pretty sweet deal.
Alcina: Agreed. Speaking of which, I'm reminded of some kid who wasn't able to join the Spina di Rosula.
Alcina: Had a silver tongue, he did, but no real ability. Lately, I've heard that he's gotten mixed up in another faction, and he's been walking with a real swagger since.
Rege: Ooh, that's dangerous behavior, ignoring the Palais Mermonia like that â€” reckon he'll be "invited" to sing at the opera soon enough.
