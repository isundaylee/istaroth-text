Traveler: About the experimental records...
Ema: I'm not so sure about this book, actually. This one is not technically a borrowed book, either. Instead, these records were supposed to be taken back here for storage, but those researchers have refused to hand it up.
Ema: No one knows where this research site place is supposed to be either. It's all very mysterious.
Ema: Come to think of it, I discovered that the library map has another section drawn on it, which is also very mysterious indeed.
