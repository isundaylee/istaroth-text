# The Adventurers' Guild's Affairs


## Talk 1

Lan: Ugh, these commissions again?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lan: Oh, it's you... I was just looking through the various commissions that have come in to the Guild.
Lan: But honestly, they're getting more mundane by the day.
Lan: Ever since the Qixing have taken control of Liyue Harbor, the scope of the Millelith's duties has been expanding slowly.
Lan: Lately, people seem to prefer approaching the Millelith to help out with tougher commissions, as opposed to asking us.
Lan: The commissions we've got now are all things like looking for lost animals, transporting cargo, delivering letters— you know, the like.
Lan: Like this one over here...
Lan: "Our Ash's gotten lost out in the wild. It's a *gray cat* with the following features..."
Lan: Commissions such as these take time and effort, but they're... Never mind.
Lan: I'm not one to be overly involved in day to day administration of the Guild, but I can't just let us be swamped by these commissions.
Lan: In order to get people to trust in our ability and assign us more important work...
Lan: ...I believe that we must hammer out some commissions of greater difficulty.
Lan: There was a commission that came in not long ago from someone who wanted us to deal with a wandering Stonehide Lawachurl.
Lan: It's been shelved for the moment due to a lack of candidates who can take that creature down, but if you're up for it, why don't you help us settle this matter?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Lan: Great. We're counting on you, then — I'll remain here and continue selecting commissions.
Lan: If we had more adventurers as capable as you around, we wouldn't have this problem...
Traveler: Do you have any other commissions?
Lan: I do, but those are all a bunch of trivial, menial tasks, all of which I still have to sort through. We'll just have to leave the Stonehide Lawachurl to you.
Lan: If we had more adventurers as capable as you around, we wouldn't have this problem...

## Talk 2

Lan: *Ash*, huh... The description is detailed enough, sure, but it's not going to be easy finding a cat that's lost out in the wild.

## Talk 3

Ash (Curious Cat): Meow...
Paimon: Huh? Why would there be a cat here?
Ash (Curious Cat): Meow... Meeeow...
Traveler: A gray cat...
Paimon: A gray cat, lost in the wild...
Paimon: Ah, Lan mentioned a commission to look for a gray cat. Maybe this is the one! Paimon remembers that it was called Ash or something like that...
Paimon: Who'd have thought that we'd find it here... Has it been hiding around here all this time?
Paimon: Guess the Stonehide Lawachurl prevented anyone from searching for it here, and since it was too scared to leave, it just hid.
Paimon: Sure is lucky that we came over, or it might've had to wait for a while longer, huh?
Ash: Meow... Meow, meow!
Traveler: Meow... Meeeow...
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing? Paimon doesn't think it understands what you're saying anyway...
Paimon: Let's just bring it back to Lan, and let her return it to the person who put the commission up.
Ash: Meow... Meow! Meow!
Traveler: Meow... Meow! Meow!
Paimon: Oh, come on! It's not going to understand you no matter how hard you try to copy it. Let's just bring it with us already.
Traveler: It seems to agree with us.
Paimon: How did you even— never mind. Let's just bring it back to Lan.
Traveler: Let's take the cat back to Lan.
Paimon: Yup, guess that's all we can do right now. She'll return it to the person who put that commission up.
Traveler: Maybe it's Ash...
Paimon: A gray cat, lost in the wild...
Paimon: You're right! Lan mentioned that commission earlier, didn't she? Huh. Who'd have thought that we'd find that cat here... Has it been hiding around here all this time?

## Talk 4

Lan: Have you defeated the Stonehide Lawachurl?
Traveler: Sure did.
Lan: Thanks, you've done us a favor. With this commission under our belt, we'll have no problem proving the Guild's ability.
Traveler: We defeated it, and we also found Ash...
Lan: Thanks, you've done us a fav— say what now?

## Talk 5

Ash: Meow, meow... Meow?
Lan: This cat is...
Traveler: It might be Ash.
Lan: Give me a moment, let me check its features against the list of features written down in the commission.
Lan: Let's see...
Lan: It mostly checks out. This seems to be the cat we're looking for.
Traveler: The commissioner should be pleased.
Lan: Hah. After all those twists and turns, we came right back to looking for lost cats.
Lan: I'm really not sure what to say...
Lan: I'll report these commissions to their commissioners. Thank you very much — please accept this as compensation for doing us this favor.
Lan: Hmm, it seems that the commissioner for the cat-related commission has since moved. It'll take some time to contact them.
Lan: Guess I'll just have to take care of this rascal in the meantime.
Ash: Meow-meow, meow!
