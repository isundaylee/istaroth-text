# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello there.
Baiwen: Yes, nice to meet you as well. We were expecting you, in fact. Your movements correspond to the intelligence we have on hand.
Baiwen: If you are looking for Lady Ningguang... Well, this is the Jade Chamber, the foremost intelligence hub and the epicenter of all important decisions in Liyue, after all. You've come to the right place.
Baiwen: Although, based on the intel on file, we estimated that you would arrive a whole two hours earlier than you actually did...
Baiwen: I must reflect on the cause of this discrepancy. Was our source at fault, or did we make an error in our calculations?
