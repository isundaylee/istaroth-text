Manager's Message: "If none of the gemstone designs we provide catch your fancy, clients are welcome to provide their own processing blueprints."
Manager's Message: "Manager Cheven and her apprentice Imix both accept custom design orders. Depending on the complexity of the request, it may take anywhere between two weeks to two months."
Manager's Message: "In addition, from time to time our store will release special gemstone designs personally cut and polished by Xilonen herself. Quantities are limited, so get them while supplies last."
