# Cleansing Defilement


## Talk 1

Hanachirusato: Very impressive.
Paimon: Eek! How did you... When did you... Why...
Traveler: Yikes!
Hanachirusato: I was right to have my eye on you. You are indeed qualified to perform the Cleansing.
Traveler: Why are you here...
Hanachirusato: I was quite concerned as to your actions, and as to whether you could heal the roots or not, so I have been observing you a little. If I have offended you, please forgive me.
Hanachirusato: You have helped me greatly already by being able to undo the barrier.
Paimon: If she's been watching us all this time, that means...
Traveler: Are you reporting us to the authorities?
Hanachirusato: The authorities? Who do you mean?
Paimon: You know, the people in charge of the whole Konda Village thing.
Hanachirusato: Are you referring to the matter that the people of Konda Village have hidden away?
Hanachirusato: I am loyal to Narukami Island, not some police station.
Hanachirusato: Besides, she... I have had dealings with Konda Village for a long time as well. If those families were to be cut off, I would not be able to face...
Hanachirusato: Please excuse me. Let us get back to business.
Hanachirusato: As you may know, the Thunder Sakura trees symbolize the eternal watch of the Electro Archon, and they have the power to remove evil and purify the earth.
Hanachirusato: However, the polluted tree roots will eventually be corroded, and these tainted sections will form tumors, one after another.
Hanachirusato: That is why we must perform the Cleansing Ritual.
Hanachirusato: Unfortunately, my... physical condition, shall we say, prevents me from accomplishing this deed.
Hanachirusato: There are several more barriers of this kind. Can I ask you to aid me... No, to aid this land?
Traveler: What about your physical condition...
Hanachirusato: Do not fret... Our priority is the cleansing.
Traveler: I see. I'll help.
Hanachirusato: Thank you, truly.
Hanachirusato: As for the location of the next barrier, you can visit the abandoned shrine nearby. It's not far northeast of Konda Village.
Hanachirusato: Due to certain circumstances, I fear that I cannot go with you.
Traveler: How will we meet up, then?
Hanachirusato: "The sakura on the east and west banks differ in speed, and the flowers of the north and south branches vary their bloom."
Hanachirusato: However, everything on this island is under her... Under the Sacred Sakura's shade. So long as petals still fall like snow upon this island, we will surely meet again.
Hanachirusato: I wish you all the best.
Traveler: Allow me to help.
Traveler: Grandpa Densuke's secret...
Traveler: Who are you...
Hanachirusato: I...
Hanachirusato: As you can see, I am simply a shrine maiden who wishes to cleanse evil with your aid.

## Talk 2

Hanachirusato: Again, the two of you have my thanks.
Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: This again, eh...
Hanachirusato: I apologize. There are some things that become... a habit, perhaps.
Paimon: Why are you following us again? Couldn't you just say hello?
Traveler: Don't say that...
Paimon: Ah, um, sorry. Paimon's tired from floating around too much... Paimon didn't mean to be rude.
Hanachirusato: It is alright. The barrier here has been undone successfully, and thus does the Cleansing Ritual come a step closer to completion. Thank you very much.
Paimon: What's the deal with the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, anyway? Is it the same as the "cleansing" you asked us to do earlier?
Traveler: Miss Inagi also mentioned this before...
Hanachirusato: Inagi? Is Miss Inagi a shrine maiden named Misato, by any chance?
Paimon: Her name is Hotomi, Paimon thinks.
Hanachirusato: Ah, that's right. It has been such a long time...
Paimon: But she also said that the method has been lost.
Hanachirusato: Ah. Hmm... Well, it has been so long, after all...
Hanachirusato: It is understandable. I mean, so much time has passed. Don't worry, I'm not angry. Yes, it's just my memory throwing a tantrum.
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden does seem to be very angry, actually...
Hanachirusato: ...Anyway, the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is a rite of purification.
Hanachirusato: The Thunder Sakura of Narukami Island can absorb the filth within the earth. But over time, that filth will accumulate.
Hanachirusato: If too much filth accumulates, the Thunder Sakura may wither.
Hanachirusato: Therefore, it is necessary to perform some "minor purifications" on the roots of Thunder Sakura scattered in five places around Narukami Island every once in a while, and to set a barrier up. This way, they are given the power to remove the accumulated filth.
Traveler: What about the Cleansing Ritual, then?
Hanachirusato: When there is enough filth accumulated in the barrier, it becomes necessary to perform the Cleansing Ritual.
Paimon: Mm-hmm, Paimon gets it! So, when performing the Cleansing Ritual, we'll need to use a ward to break the barrier over the tree roots.
Hanachirusato: This is an excellent understanding of the situation.
Paimon: Of course! We've done it twice now, after all.
Traveler: So, those monsters that looked like samurai were...
Hanachirusato: So, is that how they present themselves nowadays...
Hanachirusato: They are the embodiment of the land's defilement. Once driven out of the roots by the ward, they will condense into a physical form.
Hanachirusato: Back then... Uh, I mean, according to past records, they would turn into kasha, inugami, black jades, umibouzu, raging flames, and other such things. And not all of them would harm people, either. For example, there were the tofu boys...
Paimon: Kasha? Tofu boys? What in the world are those?
Hanachirusato: Oh, people don't know about these creatures nowadays?
Traveler: ?
Paimon: ...
Hanachirusato: But now, they have all turned into ferocious ochimusha... What has happened to Inazuma?
Paimon: ...Uh, so, what if the cleansing rituals aren't performed and the trees do wither?
Hanachirusato: As I recall... I mean, the records say that the Thunder Sakura almost withered several hundred years ago.
Hanachirusato: Monsters raged unchecked then. Even the seas turned black. The Thunder Sakura tried their hardest to absorb all the evil and the filth, and they almost died in the process.
Hanachirusato: ...
Paimon: What happened then?
Hanachirusato: The things that came after... I'm really sorry, but I'm not too familiar with them.
Hanachirusato: Either way, the present situation tells me that the problem was resolved in the end. Someone performed the Cleansing Ritual.
Traveler: You mentioned that there are five places...
Hanachirusato: Thanks to your efforts, two root barriers have been undone. Next...
Hanachirusato: Having done and seen so much, the two of you must be tired and hungry. I have prepared some dishes. I hope you will like them...
Paimon: Wow, it looks delicious! You might be wearing a mask, but you're the best shrine maiden in Inazuma for sure!
Traveler: Hooray for the best shrine maiden in the land!
Hanachirusato: Well then, please enjoy yourself...
Paimon: Ooh, this is great!
Traveler: Is it really?
Paimon: Well, now that Paimon thinks about it, we just ate so much, but it feels like we've eaten nothing at all.
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden, did you...
Traveler: ...Poison the food?
Hanachirusato: How could you suggest that I would do such a thing?
Hanachirusato: Regardless, please don't worry. These dishes were made with magic I secretly learned from the bake-danuki. They are absolutely harmless. Generally speaking.
Traveler: "Generally speaking"?
Hanachirusato: The reason I have served you such suspicious... Well, delicious food, is to help heal the remaining roots.
Hanachirusato: The Chinju Forest is also home to a ward and a root that requires cleansing. And I believe that an old friend of mine still dwells deep within that forest.
Traveler: "You believe"?
Hanachirusato: It was a very long time ago. I'm afraid that I'm not entirely sure if he remembers me. Or if he might hate me.
Hanachirusato: He can't move freely, and he can't communicate with people, either. But after eating this, you should be able to communicate with him.
Hanachirusato: That old friend of mine should be able to help you at least a little. So I did this, for the sake of the Cleansing Ritual.
Hanachirusato: The two of you have already twice demonstrated your honor, compassion, and skill.
Hanachirusato: Surely, you will finish this deed for the sake of this land's well-being, right?
Paimon: Yeah! Since Miss Masked Maiden says we have to, let's finish this fight!
Traveler: Are you two teaming up to tease me?
Paimon: Hey! How could you say that?
Traveler: What about the other roots?
Hanachirusato: Apart from Chinju Forest, there is a tree root at a place called Araumi.
Hanachirusato: I wonder if there are still people living there. I haven't been there for a long time.
Hanachirusato: The last one... is outside the Kamisato residence. There is a pit on a beach northeast of there, and the root is within.
Hanachirusato: I leave the Cleansing Ritual to you...
Traveler: Wait a moment.
Hanachirusato: Please go ahead.
Paimon: Back there in the abandoned shrine, Miss Masked Maiden, we saw someone who looked just like you through the Memento Lens...
Paimon: Her name was "Hanachirusato." Are you that Hanachirusato?
Hanachirusato: Indeed I am.
Paimon: H—Has Paimon been cheated?
Traveler: She said so in the beginning, you know...
Paimon: W—Well, anyway, what was that all about?
Hanachirusato: I...
Hanachirusato: I'm sorry. I never meant to hide anything from you. I've just never had a chance to explain.
Hanachirusato: Nor is now the right time either. I'm really sorry.
Paimon: Well... Fine, Paimon gets it.
Paimon: Just let us know once you've got the chance, Miss Masked Maiden.
Paimon: #Right? Traveler?
Traveler: You're right.
Hanachirusato: Thank you very much.
Hanachirusato: Ah yes. One other thing. When you spoke of the "Memento Lens" earlier, what were you referring to...
Hanachirusato: ...Th—That mirror, Hiroshi... He...
Traveler: Wh—What happened?
Hanachirusato: ...*sigh*
Hanachirusato: I lost my composure. Please forgive me. In that case, please keep this "Memento Lens" safe. It is a very precious instrument indeed.
Traveler: I—I understand...
Hanachirusato: Please do! It is very precious!
Traveler: Don't worry, I'll be sure to look after it well...
Hanachirusato: There are small fox statues in many different places. They are called Earth Kitsune. With the Memento Lens, one can summon forth scenes from the past at those statues' locations.
Hanachirusato: If it can be of aid in your adventures, please make good use of the Memento Lens.
Paimon: We'll use it well!
Hanachirusato: Please do, and protect it! Don't bump it against things, and remember to clean it regularly!
Paimon: Okay, got it!
Hanachirusato: That's good. Now then, if you'll excuse me, I must go.
Traveler: How will we meet up?
Hanachirusato: "If the crimson sakura knows the pain of parting, it will forever stay."
Hanachirusato: Our fates shall surely be entwined like those of the Sakura Bloom.
Hanachirusato: Till our next meeting, I will be praying for your success beneath the well in Konda Village, where you successfully purified the Thunder Sakura root. I wish you all the best.
Traveler: I'll keep it safe, trust me.
Traveler: I'm still quite concerned...
Traveler: You're the only one who's been calling her "Miss Masked Maiden"...
Traveler: I have another question.
Traveler: You're too easily led, Paimon...
Traveler: So why...
Traveler: ...Use magic?
Hanachirusato: You seem very sensitive to things of a mystical nature.
Traveler: It seems just a little bit off...
Traveler: Paimon's real hungry, eh?
Traveler: Where should we go next?
Traveler: So, we found this book called the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary...
Paimon: Which Paimon didn't understand at all!
Hanachirusato: People can't read it nowadays? But it was written in the common tongue...
Paimon: "People nowadays"? Hey, just how old are you?
Hanachirusato: Wha— H—Hey, that's very rude of you!
Traveler: She must have her reasons...

## Talk 3

Hanachirusato: That was well done — whether it was dealing with Ioroi's illusory tricks, or the way you defeated those demons.
Paimon: "Eek!"
Paimon: Or so Paimon might have said, but this trick of yours is getting real old, Miss Masked Maiden.
Hanachirusato: Ah, so I disappointed you, then? I apologize. I'll do better next time.
Traveler: There's no need to "do better" at trivial things like this...
Hanachirusato: That is true. So, as for Ioroi... Is he doing well?
Traveler: He's very spry, alright...
Paimon: Even though he's been turned into stone.
Hanachirusato: I see...
Hanachirusato: Usually, when bake-danuki make a mess, we won't send anyone to deal with them as long as they don't cross the line. After all, although they are mischievous, they're kind-hearted and simple, just like children.
Hanachirusato: But when Ioroi dared to steal the ward for the Cleansing Ritual, well, that was enough to get him punished. Since the "Yougou Three" were mentioned in your story, then it was probably Kamuna... an onmyouji from a past age, who did the deed.
Traveler: He also mentioned a "sneaky kitsune"...
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden, are you Ioroi's kitsune friend?
Hanachirusato: ...That's quite the compliment. He was actually talking about the daughter of the Hakushin bloodline, also known as the "Kitsune Saiguu." She was worshiped as the kitsune goddess in many places long ago.
Hanachirusato: The Sky Kitsune and Earth Kitsune were once her emissaries. After she left, they all turned into stone statues to preserve their power and await her return — and when she does, they will all walk the Byakko Plain together once more.
Hanachirusato: Following her departure, the bloodline and mystical might of the kitsune on Narukami Island today have dwindled to less than one tenth of what they used to be...
Traveler: Ioroi said "Our contest isn't over yet!"
Hanachirusato: Oh, that. This is what happened. Did you know that Ioroi's full name is "Ioroi, the Hidden Protector of the Grove"?
Hanachirusato: Ioroi may be dull and impish, but he is also kind and loyal. That's why the Kitsune Saiguu aimed to guide him to the right path a long time ago.
Hanachirusato: In order to make sure that he would comply with the Electro Archon's rule, the Kitsune Saiguu set the two of them up and got Ioroi appointed as the Protector of the Grove. This made him responsible for the safety of the Chinju Forest.
Hanachirusato: That's why, when the world became pitch black, the Kitsune Saiguu was worried that Ioroi might die while fighting against this inexorable evil in his capacity as protector of the forest.
Hanachirusato: So she used a game of Hide-and-Seek, something the bake-danuki are good at, as a way to challenge him...
Hanachirusato: "Ioroi, whatever happens... they're all my magical tricks. Don't fall for them and don't show up," she said.
Hanachirusato: "Of course, you sneaky kitsune. I will definitely defeat you this time," said Ioroi. And that's how their endless contest began.
Paimon: ...So Ioroi is still waiting for her to come back and find him?
Hanachirusato: Based on what you said about Ioroi, that appears to be the case...
Hanachirusato: But after a while, Ioroi sensed that something was wrong and started wreaking havoc. He even stole the ward in an attempt to lure the Kitsune Saiguu out.
Hanachirusato: He didn't realize that it was something required for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. He just thought that it was a comb of some importance to the Kitsune Saiguu. Later on, Kamuna sealed him into stone due to that misstep.
Traveler: What about the Kitsune Saiguu, then?
Hanachirusato: ...She was swallowed up by the darkness. In the end, after that darkness was defeated, she returned to the great land of Narukami along with the soil.
Traveler: And who are you then?
Hanachirusato: Me? As you can see, I am just "Hanachirusato." A shrine maiden who wants to borrow your strength to destroy these evils.
Traveler: That wasn't my question...
Paimon: Miss Masked... Hanachirusato, it's really strange that you know so many things about the past that most people don't.
Paimon: You even know how to use bake-danuki magic and cook tanuki dishes.
Traveler: But you don't know much about the present.
Paimon: It's almost like you're someone from a few centuries ago...
Hanachirusato: ...
Paimon: We also saw someone who looked like you in some memories. She even had the same name as you...
Traveler: So...
Paimon: You must be just like Ioroi, a bake-danuki who was sealed several centuries ago!
Hanachirusato: N—No, that's not who I...
Hanachirusato: I...
Hanachirusato: I inherited her memories. As for other things, please forgive me. I cannot speak of them yet.
Hanachirusato: I made you a promise, back there in the cave. So when the time comes, I will reveal everything.
Paimon: #What do we do, Traveler?
Traveler: I believe her.
Paimon: Okay, if you say so, Paimon will have some faith in Miss Masked Maiden too!
Hanachirusato: Thank you for your understanding.
Hanachirusato: Now, we must part here for the time being.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanachirusato: "We part in body alone, for our hearts drift with the clouds."
Hanachirusato: I will pray for your success beneath the well in Konda Village. I shall be next to the Thunder Sakura root that you cleansed successfully.
Hanachirusato: When the tree roots at all five places have been cleansed, please look for me there.
Traveler: Let's leave it at that.
Traveler: Your kitsune mask...
Traveler: He was turned into stone...
Paimon: But he's very well!

## Talk 4

Hanachirusato: Ah. We meet again.
Hanachirusato: Although it is a pity that we are unable to meet where the sun shines for now, the light from the Thunder Sakura, which symbolizes the divine, and the light from your aura are enough to illuminate this space. If there is anything I can help you with, please let me know.
Traveler: About the other barriers...
Hanachirusato: Apart from Chinju Forest, there is a barrier in a place called Araumi.
Hanachirusato: Finally, there is a pit on a beach northeast of the Kamisato residence's courtyard. That is where you will find the final barrier.
Traveler: I couldn't find the ward...
Hanachirusato: In the past, the ward was guarded by the Sky Kitsune. But after everything changed, the Sky and Earth Kitsune eventually refused to show up, instead sleeping and waiting for her return.
Hanachirusato: If you want to find the ward, look for the Sky Kitsune around the seal... that should be a special fox statue. If you're having difficulties, try to find the Earth Kitsune nearby, or use that Lens to see if there are any clues.
Traveler: About the Memento Lens...
Hanachirusato: I'm afraid I don't know much more about this than you. Apart from the Hiiragi Clan's squandering of their divine gift, that is...
Hanachirusato: There are many sleeping Earth Kitsune in Narukami Island. What you may see before you, though, is most likely to be a small, special fox statue.
Hanachirusato: In the past, though they were weak in strength, they valued loyalty. If you look at them through the Memento Lens, you should be able to see some scenes from the past.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanachirusato: "Our hearts drift with the clouds..."
Hanachirusato: If there is anything I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know.

## Talk 5

Hanachirusato: There should be no problem...
Hanachirusato: Ah, it's you. I wish you all the best.

## Talk 6

Hanachirusato: That was well done — whether it was dealing with Ioroi's illusory tricks, or the way you defeated those demons.
Paimon: "Eek!"
