Traveler: What can you tell me about Konda Village?
Konda Densuke: You see those Lavender Melons in the fields? That's our proud local specialty.
Konda Densuke: Is it good? Oh my, is it delicious! It is filled with useful materials from top to bottom. Merchants and dyehouses love these melons. Not only can you cook with it, the flowers can also be used to make natural and durable dye. It can even act as pest repellent!
Konda Densuke: Oh, our village used to be so lively. Merchants looking for dye, adventurers heading to Inazuma from Ritou, outlanders touring the land... This place used be filled with people from everywhere, and I used to show them around and give them directions.
Konda Densuke: Too bad all that's in the past now. Ever since the Sakoku Decree came into force, it became difficult for outlanders to make their way here. Merchandise became hard to sell and dyehouses no longer needed that much dye. As a result, the fields have all gone to waste...
Konda Densuke: What a shame. This historical village and its fertile land... it's all gone to waste! *sigh*
