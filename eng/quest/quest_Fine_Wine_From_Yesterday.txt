# Fine Wine From Yesterday


## Talk 1

Paimon: Oh, it's Master Diluc! What brings you here? Do you have nothing to do today?
Diluc: Heh, me? "Nothing to do"? Don't count on it. I heard you two were working as bartenders, so I thought I'd drop by to see how you're coming along.
Paimon: Wow, you really do catch wind of things quickly!
Diluc: #So, tell me, {NICKNAME}. How do you like being a bartender?
Traveler: Actually, we just started...
Paimon: Yeah, it's still a little too early to tell. We haven't been at it for very long.
Diluc: Just tell me your initial feelings.
Diluc: Excited? Confused? Anything. How does it feel to be a bartender?
Traveler: It's a new experience.
Diluc: I see.
Paimon: Hey, didn't you want to ask Paimon, too?
Paimon: Paimon's initial feeling is... drinks taste good!
Diluc: ...
Diluc: Good. I'm happy for you.
Diluc: Now, could you make me a Gray Valley Sunset, then? I'll leave the size up to you.
Traveler: Sure, I'll get that started for you.
Diluc: Great, take your time.
Traveler: It's been a little hectic.

## Talk 2

Diluc: Mmm. Not bad, not bad at all.
Paimon: It's all about the ingredients! If the fruit are fresh and juicy, then the drink will naturally be sweet and tasty without adding anything extra.
Diluc: Sounds like I should thank the soil of Mondstadt.
Diluc: It just so happens that Gray Valley Sunset is the first drink I ever mixed.
Diluc: I was still quite young. My father laid out several ingredients and told me to experiment with them.
Diluc: No requirements and no instruction. In hindsight, he probably just wanted to test my creativity.
Diluc: In the end, I just made a glass of fruit punch, much like this one.
Paimon: Oh? But why fruit punch?
Diluc: My father was equally surprised. I didn't really put much thought into it, I just figured that it would taste sweet.
Diluc: Looking back on it, I was so young and naive.
Traveler: I wouldn't be so sure.
Diluc: Oh?
Traveler: I'm sure your father thought it was a good drink.
Diluc: I've never thought about it, I suppose... My father didn't say a word at the time.
Diluc: But, thank you.
Diluc: By the way, there's something I'd like to give you.
Diluc: But, I suppose it's better to wait until you have more experience with your bartender job. I have no doubt that you'll do very well.
Paimon: And Paimon will... uh, be rooting for you! Hehe.
Diluc: Very well. Then, I look forward to seeing your good work. See you around.
Paimon: Come back soon when you have a minute!
Traveler: He must have enjoyed it.
