Traveler: You can use a wind glider.
Henry Morton: Forget it. I've been shut indoors ever since joining the Sumeru Akademiya. I haven't done any outdoor activities since.
Henry Morton: You can't really use your wind glider at the Akademiya either, so I've probably returned all my gliding instructor's teachings back to them...
Henry Morton: If you asked me to glide over there, I'd probably fall into the water halfway.

Henry Morton: Who knows how long a round trip will take, either...
Henry Morton: But I couldn't possibly construct my own boat. I mean, I learned nothing about that in the Akademiya...
