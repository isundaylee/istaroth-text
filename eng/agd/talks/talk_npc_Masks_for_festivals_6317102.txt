Traveler: Masks for festivals...
Sanden: Oh, don't take it the wrong way. You don't have to wear a mask to the festival, and I'm not forcing you to buy anything.
Sanden: Masks used to be mainly used for ceremonial affairs, but nowadays it's become a festival staple.
Sanden: There are many types of masks, each with its own unique points. I've been referencing different things to improve my mask-making craftsmanship.
Sanden: In the legends, the monster-slaying yaksha of Liyue always wore a special kind of mask. As curious as I am... I probably won't ever get to see them with my own eyes...
Sanden: It'd be great if I could take a look at a tengu mask too...
