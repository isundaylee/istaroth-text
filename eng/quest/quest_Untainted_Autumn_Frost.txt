# Untainted Autumn Frost


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.

## Talk 2

Shenhe: Hmm, it's sweet and smooth. Not bitter at all. What is it?
Paimon: It's called a Snow-Covered Kiss! Whisk milk until it froths, and then gently pour it over some juice. It looks like it's covered by a layer of snow.
Paimon: Don't ask why it's called a kiss, though... Paimon doesn't get it either. It's probably just a gimmick to get it to sell better!
Shenhe: A gimmick?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's just guessing... Maybe it's more of a romantic description!
Shenhe: Romantic?
Paimon: Uhh... It's hard to explain! Stop making Paimon come up with things.
Traveler: The milky foam doesn't have much taste to it...
Paimon: Mm-hmm, that's right.
Traveler: The moment you taste the sweetness of the juice...
Shenhe: ...Oh.
Shenhe: I see. I seem to understand now.
Paimon: Oh? Really?
Paimon: But wait, why is Paimon the one who's confused now!?
Shenhe: Occasionally, I chew on divine herbs as I wander about in the mountains. I have witnessed the moment a new sprout breaks through the soil.
Shenhe: The elation in my heart then does bear a resemblance to what I'm experiencing now.
Shenhe: #Thank you for helping me understand these obscure names, {NICKNAME}.
Shenhe: I might need your help again sometime in the future.
Traveler: Like a sprout pushing through the ice to give you a kiss...
Traveler: It's kind of like snow on the mountains...
