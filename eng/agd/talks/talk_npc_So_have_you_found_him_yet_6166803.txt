Traveler: So, have you found him yet?
Joel: No... That Knight of Favonius over there said that he'd headed off for the mountain's summit...
Joel: I wanted to go search for him, but the Knight wouldn't let me. So I'm stuck here waiting for Daddy to come back.
Joel: I'll see him for sure, though. We promised to go see the snow together. There's no way that he'd break his promise.
