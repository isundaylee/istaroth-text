## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Hanamizaka bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices regarding all sorts of matters will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: A number of suspicious outlanders have entered Inazuma lately, wandering around with seemingly sinister motives.
Bulletin Board: The Shogunate hereby notifies everyone: those who report suspicious persons will be rewarded, while those who harbor them will be punished!
Bulletin Board: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: The Vision Hunt Decree operation is coming to an end, but those who conceal their Visions still remain.
Bulletin Board: Following the orders of the Tenryou Commissioner, and in compliance with the command of Madam Kujou Sara, pursuit operations will avoid using force or disrupting the public as much as possible.
Bulletin Board: Please don't worry. The Tenryou Commission will not use its public duties as an excuse to intrude on your daily lives.
Bulletin Board: The Tenryou Commissioner guarantees this in his own name, and that of the Kujou Clan.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! I am here again! Where are you?"
Bulletin Board: "I will never forget that you took my Vision away. As long as I still breathe, I will keep coming for you!"
Bulletin Board: "Don't you ever forget that either!"
Bulletin Board: Everyone, no need to worry! The Tenryou Commission will handle this vandal soon.
Bulletin Board: Madam Kujou Sara promises that she has nothing to do with this person. Please do not worry.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: "Though this is not a serious matter, I still hope that it will become more common knowledge."
Bulletin Board: "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous 'Toki Alley Tales,' written by Takizawa Kyouden."
Bulletin Board: "Though it's nothing major, Lady Yae still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
Bulletin Board: "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
Bulletin Board: "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: "If any citizen discovers Ms. Yoimiya setting off restricted fireworks inside the city, please try to stop her!"
Bulletin Board: "...Or reprimand her, at least. Do not indulge her!"
Bulletin Board: "The Fire Brigade hereby urges everyone to pay special attention. Thank you!"

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: "Night-time robberies, piracy, and false documentation have been rampant in Inazuma lately."
Bulletin Board: "Smugglers, illegal traders, people stirring up trouble"
Bulletin Board: "Imprisonment, bribery, people who travel freely"
Bulletin Board: "Mandatory draft, stagnation, exploitation, and deceit"
Bulletin Board: The above are all lies. None of this is true!
Bulletin Board: Any vandal caught will be punished severely by the Tenryou Commissioner!

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "Due to the war, the supply of Jade Steel has stagnated temporarily."

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: "Bantan Sango: We'll investigate anything on your behalf!"
Bulletin Board: "Missing persons, missing pets, marital investigations, criminal investigations, commercial commissions, delivery services, procurement services..."
Bulletin Board: "Just make us a suitable offer, and we'll even capture the likes of bandit chiefs Zenigata or Domeki for you!"

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: "I heard that another shipment of goods was stranded in Ritou due to piracy."
Bulletin Board: "This is ridiculous! Piracy hasn't been a problem for centuries ever since the end of Ako Domeki's reign of terror."
Bulletin Board: "As it stands, the Sakoku Decree has actually helped to revive smuggling and piracy..."
Bulletin Board: "If this is the will of Her Excellency the Ogosho... the will of an Archon, us mortals simply cannot fathom its meaning."
Bulletin Board: It would be advisable for you to not attempt to fathom it.

## Talk 11

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: Bounty: Yoshino Koheiji, Yoshino Koheita
Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, robbery, night-time assaults, conspiring against officials, distributing belongings to innocent villagers to incite rebellion.

Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, riotous assembly, piracy, robbing officials, ambushing samurai, holding family members as hostages in an attempt to rebel against the Shogunate.
Bulletin Board: This person and his accomplices are wanted dead or alive with a generous bounty!

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: The fight against the rebels proceeds apace. Only one more strike, and they shall be destroyed completely.
Bulletin Board: We hope that all young samurai will join together and fight to accomplish this great work!
Bulletin Board: Come join the army! Or you may regret not having done anything for your country when the war is over!
Bulletin Board: Please visit the Tenryou Commission for information about joining the army.
Bulletin Board: Attention! Families that have received draft orders must send at least one adult to join the military.
Bulletin Board: "This 'final strike' has been going on for three months... and yet the resistance has not been put down."
Bulletin Board: What right do those who haven't joined the army have to criticize the samurai fighting on the front line? It's because of their protection that you are able to complain!
Bulletin Board: "I am too old to take to the battlefield, and I thank all the young people for their contributions... it's just that my three sons have yet to come home."
Bulletin Board: "Could the Tenryou Commissioner please grant my son a few days' leave to come home so that I shall not have any lingering regrets on account of this war?"
Bulletin Board: We hope for this father's kind understanding on the matter. We know that everyone has family members at the frontline and everyone is restless, but please bear with us a bit more. Victory will be ours soon.
Bulletin Board: "Let's hope so. Let's hope so..."
Bulletin Board: Defacing of military draft notices is prohibited! Anyone caught again will face a heavy penalty!

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: With the permission of Guuji Yae Miko, the Grand Narukami Shrine will provide help to those businesses and families affected by the war in the form of aid loans and food aid.
Bulletin Board: We ask that those in need of help visit the Kamisato Clan to file the required paperwork.
Bulletin Board: As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Bulletin Board: "It's all a lie! When it was my turn yesterday, I was told that there was nothing left!"
Bulletin Board: "There must be more food in the Yashiro Commission granaries, right? Lady Yae Miko, please do not let those so-called officials fool you!"
Bulletin Board: We are truly sorry. Let us pray together for the war to end. Things will get better soon.
Bulletin Board: "...Can't even say anything useful, can you?"

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: "Thanks to the careful consideration of Tenryou Commissioner Kujou Takayuki, the Vision Hunt Decree was implemented swiftly, preventing those who opposed it from fleeing."
Bulletin Board: "The real estate assets of the fugitives will be rented out or sold today. The Tenryou Commission guarantees the legitimacy of these transactions!"
