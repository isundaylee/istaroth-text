# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you doing?
Nimrod: Is that a trick question? I'm on my way to have a drink.
Nimrod: Ooh, er... Oh it's fine, I don't think my wife will have overheard that.
Nimrod: So I actually had to sneak out to buy some wine... *sigh* How can you deny a Mondstadter the right to drink...
Nimrod: When even one of the Four Drunkards is a woman, how can my wife be so narrow-minded.
Traveler: Who are the Four Drunkards?
Nimrod: You wanna know more about them, eh? Hehehe... Why, they are nothing short of legends in Mondstadt, on par with the Knights of Favonius' Grand Master Varka...
Nimrod: ...I can see you're only pretending to follow. Are you from out of town? No wonder you haven't heard.
Nimrod: There's no point giving you their real names then, but I'll give you their nicknames and see if you can figure it out...
Nimrod: They are Sir Dullwits the Oblivious Merchant, Dame Workshy the Absentee Boss, Oddears the Incredible Hunter, and Rookie McSchoolboy the Inexperienced Adventurer.
Nimrod: Should be pretty obvious by now, huh? Hehehe, talk to you later!
