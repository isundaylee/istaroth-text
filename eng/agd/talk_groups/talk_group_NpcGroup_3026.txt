Sanada: Ah, why am I the only one left here again... Hello, how can I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: The only one left?
Sanada: I have a comrade who was supposed to stand on guard with me, but he always abandons his post. If I don't pay special attention, he tends to just leave me on duty here alone.
Sanada: I'm debating if I should report this to our superior...

## Talk

Traveler: Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
Sanada: I can't really say. There are way too many people coming in and out of Hanamizaka. And I'm usually the only one on duty. How can I possibly remember that?
Sanada: Gee, can't people just do their job properly...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Sanada: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign! Let me think...

## Talk

Traveler: You should report him.
Sanada: If this gets out, everyone will think that I'm a snitch. What if they ostracize me from now on because of that?
Sanada: I don't want to have a bad reputation at the Police Station. It will affect my chances for a promotion...

## Talk

Traveler: Best keep it to yourself...
Sanada: But what if there is trouble? How am I supposed to handle it myself?
Sanada: I have to patrol this whole area. This is too difficult. Ah, so annoying...
