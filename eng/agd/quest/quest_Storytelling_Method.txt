# Storytelling Method


## Talk 1

Junkichi: ...So this is the structure I have in mind this time.
Junkichi: The supremely-skilled ninja uses all sorts of abilities to infiltrate the enemy fortress and retrieve the required intel in secret...
Shigeru: *sigh* And how many "abilities" are you going to give this ninja this time?
Junkichi: Th—That, uh, might depend on the situation?
Shigeru: Right. So you haven't thought about it, then.
Junkichi: I mean, it's fine! I mean, if you lock down all the narrative devices ahead of time, there's nowhere to adapt from there, right?
Shigeru: Oh, here you go again. If you had these devices locked in beforehand, your writing wouldn't go all over the shop!
Junkichi: I—I have my own creative methods, alright? The story should put its narrative first. How can it be shackled by these devices?
Shigeru: That's just irresponsible, you...
Traveler: What are you two arguing about?
Junkichi: Oh, its you! I was just thinking about to structure a novel about a ninja.
Junkichi: But Shigeru's criticizing the structures that I came up with again...
Shigeru: I'm not saying that what you've come up with is bad, per se. I'm just asking you to put your narrative devices in place first before you start writing...
Junkichi: No, no... I'm not going to list them all down and structure the narrative around them. That's just too staid!
Junkichi: The narrative is the most important thing in the novel, which everything else revolves around, even the setting and narrative devices...
Shigeru: You...
Junkichi: I...
Traveler: Alright, cut it out.
Shigeru: Forget it, you're not going to listen to me anyway...
Junkichi: I'm sticking to my creative principles no matter what you say.
Shigeru: *sigh* ...You know what, Traveler? Since you're here, why don't you be the judge?
Traveler: And how am I supposed to judge...
Shigeru: Uh, no, you just need to listen to Junkichi tell us the structure of this new narrative passage he's dreamed up.
Shigeru: After that, just use your judgment and think about how his ninja would act.
Shigeru: That way, Junkichi should get the feedback he needs about what happens when he just writes his story willy-nilly.
Junkichi: Hmph, sure. Well, Traveler, we're counting on you.
Junkichi: I'll narrate the story for you. Just act according to what you think is natural.
Junkichi: Let's show Shigeru how awesome a story unbound by these... narrative devices can be!
Shigeru: You...
Junkichi: I...
Traveler: Let's just start...
Junkichi: Well, let's begin, Traveler.
Junkichi: So, as I was writing, this ninja is entering the enemy fortress solo, preparing to steal critical intelligence.
Junkichi: Hehe, Traveler, are you ready to play the stealthy ninja?
Junkichi: Having made all the necessary preparations, the ninja infiltrates the fortress stealthily...
Traveler: This creativity business sure is tiring...
Traveler: Am I supposed to read his novel right here and now?
Traveler: Let's call a halt to this real quick, shall we?

## Talk 2

Junkichi: Alright, that's a wrap.
Junkichi: I've... never been this tired. Was this story always that complicated...
Shigeru: That's what you get when you don't decide on things early. Without narrative devices to restrain you, the various elements just clash wildly against each other.
Shigeru: When that happens, you'll end up losing control over the plot altogether. You'd exhaust yourself no matter what you were writing.
Junkichi: *sigh* Alright, alright... I've got no strength left to argue with you. Traveler, thanks for your... judgment.
Junkichi: I think I've gained a lot from this...
Junkichi: Take this as a token of my thanks. I'll get to writing again shortly.
Junkichi: Hmm, narrative devices or narrative... Which is more important?
