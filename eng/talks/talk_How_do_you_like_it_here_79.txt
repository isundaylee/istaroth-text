Traveler: How do you like it here?
Aloy: If you're asking whether it's a comfortable place to stay, I mean, sure. Of course it is.
Aloy: But um... I couldn't really see myself living here for the long term. Sorry.
Traveler: Is there something wrong with the place?
Aloy: No, nothing's wrong at all, everything's great. Very charming.
Aloy: It's just that I'm more used to camping out in the wilds.
Aloy: I'm sure you know by now â€” back where I'm from, not a day goes by without something to watch out for.
Aloy: Like giant machines running around all over the place, or hostile tribes that always seem to have it out for you, or evil machines bent on global extinction...
Aloy: To go from a life like that to something so safe... It'll take me some time to adjust, that's all.
Traveler: You want to go on an adventure?
Aloy: Yes! Don't get me wrong, this is a nice place, but I need to get out. If I stick around here too long, my bowstring's gonna snap.
Aloy: Next time we head out, I want you to give me the full story on these Ruin Guards I hear you talking about.
Aloy: They sound like my kind of prey. Aim for the glowing part, right?
Aloy: That, plus after you defeat them, you can salvage their components...
Aloy: Strange components, sure, and probably not the kind that I could use to modify my gear. Still, they've gotta have their uses, I guess?
