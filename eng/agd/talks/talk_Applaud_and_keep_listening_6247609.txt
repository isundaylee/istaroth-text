# Talk Dialog

Traveler: (Applaud and keep listening)
Jiewu: Ahem... But I usually don't tell such stories in places like this. At most, I tell them in small teahouses and avoid crowded restaurants...
Jiewu: This way, I can tell my stories comfortably, and everyone feels comfortable listening to them.
Jiewu: Otherwise, some old fool would start nagging me, and what would I do then?
Jiewu: Haha, what am I doing, making my skills in storytelling sound so terrible that I can only make ends meet by resorting to unorthodox methods...
Jiewu: Why, if I applied myself, I would be better than anyone! But doing it every day is just, you know, exhausting!
Jiewu: Comfort is everything in life!
