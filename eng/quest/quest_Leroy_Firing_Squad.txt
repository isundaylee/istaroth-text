# Leroy: Firing Squad


## Talk 1

Molli: Nana, Nana, would you like some fish?

## Talk 2

Benoit Leroy: Thank you, Molli. Your kindness sparkles in your lovely lavender eyes.
Molli: Hehe, does it really? Did you really like that doll that I brought you last time?
Benoit Leroy: Oh yes, yes indeed. It was very lovely. You know, I even set aside a place for it at the dining table.
Molli: Really? Oh, that would make it so happy! What about today? Do you need to lean on me during your walk? Or should I fetch your newspaper?
Molli: I could read it to you, too, if you can't make out the words.
Molli: Mama says that I should do one good deed every day, and my tutor wants me to submit an essay this week about good people and good things.
Molli: Oh, um... I don't mean I'm doing this because I need to write an essay, but if you don't mind, I do want to help you out.
Benoit Leroy: Haha. Oh, I'm already fine, really. The best thing you could do to help me is to tell your parents that you often come by my place to play.
Molli: I know, Mr. Leroy, and I've told them, but they don't seem too happy about it...
Benoit Leroy: Will you still come again, even so?
Molli: I sure will — even if they won't let me. I mean, we made an agreement, didn't we?
Benoit Leroy: Haha, you are indeed a child of your word. Good, good. I do like you very much.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, it's you two. Welcome, kind souls, welcome.
Paimon: *cough* Uh, we didn't mean to intrude or anything...
Traveler: Did we interrupt?
Benoit Leroy: No, no, the two of you aren't interrupting anything.
Benoit Leroy: My young friend Molli here is currently out and about, trying to complete her homework. She just happened to stop by my home.
Benoit Leroy: She'd like to do something nice for me, so that she might have some material for her essay.
Molli: Hey, I'm not helping because I want to finish my homework! Well, not just because of that, anyway...
Benoit Leroy: Of course, of course. You're not being a good child just because of your homework, after all.
Benoit Leroy: Much like these two young guests! They're not here to help me just because they need a job, either!
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Uh, well... We...
Benoit Leroy: Well now, it was just a little jest. Surely you won't begrudge an old man that much?
Benoit Leroy: Youngsters have much time that they may spend freely, and you're willing to while that time away with me, and I do enjoy the company of young people... Nothing wrong with any of that, now is there?
Benoit Leroy: Then perhaps I should just give you something to do. People are wont to come and go around the entrance, it tends to get dirty there very quickly, and nobody's swept behind the place for days. So, if I may ask, please help me clean it up again.
Paimon: Well... okay, then.
Benoit Leroy: Molli, would you keep my cat company? Ah, and bring a fish steak if you would — her name's Nana, by the way.
Benoit Leroy: She inherited that name from a dog I had previously... It's a shame, but my daughter took her along when she went off to get married.
Molli: Alright then, Mr. Leroy.
Benoit Leroy: Very well, children, off you go.

## Talk 3

Athos: Have you been sleeping well lately, Dad? Still suffering from insomnia?
Benoit Leroy: Oh, I'm much better. Don't even have nightmares nowadays...
Knock: (The voices of the Leroy family grow less distinct...)

## Talk 4

Benoit Leroy: My children aren't home, which makes cleaning the filth that gathers by the door and the back of the house quite tricky. I'm counting on you.

## Talk 5

Strange Boxes: (Old, decrepit heavy boxes covered in layers of dust. Their presence here in the usually bright and clear Court of Fontaine is quite jarring.)
Strange Boxes: (The bases of these boxes have collected a lot of clear water stains over the years. They must have once been piled in an exceedingly damp location.)
Strange Boxes: (Never mind the stains on the door — these boxes look to be in far more urgent need of a cleanup.)

## Talk 6

Benoit Leroy: Oh, there's no point knocking at this hour. Morticia and Athos aren't in.
Benoit Leroy: They said they'd be back today, but it seems that they've been delayed for some reason.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, that's the trouble with adult children. They always have their own things to attend to, and they're often not around when you need them.

## Talk 7

Benoit Leroy: Are you all done?
Traveler: That's right.
Paimon: Yup, the cleanup's done, and Molli's fed the cat, too.
Paimon: Also, Benoit, there's a pile of super dirty old boxes next to your place. Do you want us to clean those up, too?
Benoit Leroy: Oh, those boxes? I just store some old stuff in them... Otherwise, they don't see much use.
Benoit Leroy: Some of them contain furniture and other small items from my old place, which I haven't had the heart to throw away... But at the same time, they don't fit with my current home, and so, they've ended up just stacked out there.
Benoit Leroy: I don't touch them for the most part, but since everyone around here's a decent sort, no one's stolen anything — so they can stay right where they are.
Molli: Mr. Leroy, Mr. Leroy, was I helpful?
Benoit Leroy: Why, of course you were, Molli. Don't forget to say hello to your parents for me. I'd be even more grateful if you could do that.
Benoit Leroy: And I've got the snacks and pocket money right here, children, so come and get it.
Molli: Oh, no, no, I don't need any pocket money. I'd just like to pet Nana some more. Can I?
Benoit Leroy: Oh, of course, please do, but watch out for her claws, and remember to come back for snacks once you're done playing.
Athos: Why did you go out, Dad?
Benoit Leroy: Well, this old fellow got lonely, what with his children not being around to keep him company and all — so he decided to go get some fresh air.
Athos: Ah, Morticia, would you look at that — gone but a few days, and he's mad at us already.
Athos: But I'm sure he'd forgive us if he only knew what gift we'd brought back this time, don't you think?
Morticia: ...
Benoit Leroy: Gift? What did you bring back?
Athos: Something wonderful, of course. You'll know when you see it. Morticia knows how you like lovely, expensive things. She picked it out especially for you.
Benoit Leroy: Thank you, my daughter.
Morticia: I did only what I should have.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, yes. These two lovely guests are also children who came by to play while the two of you were out.
Athos: Hello there. My father's a friendly man and really loves kids, so thank you for keeping him company, truly.
Athos: Still, since my wife and I are back, we'll take it from here.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, it really is good that you're back. Come now, let me have a look at that present.
Morticia: Alright, Dad. Let's go inside, shall we?
Benoit Leroy: Indeed, indeed. Athos, do remember to give them their pay and some snacks. They helped me sweep the place, and fed Nana, too.
Benoit Leroy: Ah, and give that young lady some of those treats, too, would you? I'm going back inside now.
Molli: Mr. Leroy, Nana let me give her a belly rub... Eh? Where's he gone?
Athos: Are you looking for my father, little lady? I'm his son-in-law... Well, you might as well just consider me his son to keep things simple. Call me Athos.
Molli: Oh, I know what a son-in-law is. That means you're his daughter's husband.
Athos: Haha, you sure are knowledgeable, aren't you? Thanks for keeping my father company — he's gone indoors.
Athos: These snacks are for you. You can leave the rest to my wife and I — it's alright if you don't drop by anymore.
Athos: Anyway, you should head home soon. Your family will be worried about you if you're out too long.
Molli: Oh, don't worry, Mister. It was no trouble at all, and anyway, Mr. Leroy and I have an agreement.
Molli: I think he might need my help going forward, too — you know, with feeding the cat, watering plants, and other stuff. Helping people makes me happy, too, so I'll definitely come back!
Athos: ...
Athos: Tch. And that's what makes things tricky.
Molli: Um, is something wrong, Mister?
Athos: No, little lady, not at all. I have something important to discuss with you... Hmm, no. Discussion isn't the right word. There's something I need you to do.
Molli: Sure. What is it?
Athos: I'm going to give you the snacks and pocket money, and then after that, don't come back again, alright?
Molli: Huh? Why? Did I do something wrong?
Athos: No, of course you haven't! It's just that my father's health has always been poor, and his insomnia has gotten quite bad lately.
Athos: Out of consideration for his health, my wife and I would like him to have an environment conducive to rest. You understand, don't you?
Molli: Oh, so Mr. Leroy's unwell... I get it. Next time, I'll bring extra Bulle Fruit.
Molli: Every time I eat too much cake and get a tummy ache, Papa tells me I should eat less sweets and have more fruit.
Molli: As long as Mr. Leroy eats some fruit every day, he'll be fine.
Athos: ...*sigh* Nevermind. Nothing else for it.
Athos: As for you two, here are your snacks and rewards.
Athos: And now, let me speak plainly.
Athos: I am speaking for the entire Leroy family on this matter: I hope that you will not come and disturb us again in the future.
Athos: I believe that despite your youth, you will be able to understand my meaning. So please, do not go out of your way to return here.
Athos: That's all. I'll take my leave now.
Molli: Huh. Why can't we come back? It's so weird! Mr. Leroy was so nice, but this man just really doesn't want us to.
Paimon: Yeah! This guy speaks politely enough, alright, but he's as cold as they come.
Molli: Well, I don't care what he says. I'm going to come see Mr. Leroy tomorrow. What about you two?
Molli: Come on, just come along. Nana's so cute, and I just wanna pet her a bit more... and also, Mr. Leroy's going to give us more snacks.
Traveler: Last one to show is a rotten egg!
Molli: Alright, no takesies-backsies, 'kay? We've gotta come pet the cat and play with Mr. Leroy.
Traveler: When we've got time.
Molli: Alright. See you next time, then.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Benoit Leroy: Newspaper delivery? Just leave it by the door, thanks. I'll come get it later.
Knock: (You've already helped Benoit out today. It would be rude to disturb his rest. You agreed to meet him tomorrow, so it'd be best to just do that.)
