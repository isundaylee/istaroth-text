# Eroded Horn

The Lord of Eroded Primal Fire's blazing horn, cut off in the heat of battle.
Legend has it that the original primal flame was the birthplace of light and wisdom, and the horn of the Pyro Dragon shone like a pillar of fire, illuminating the savage, desolate world.
And though the base of the flaming horn has been corroded, the light that once illuminated the world remains without blemish.
