# Missing title (585001855)

Wolfy: Bravo, bravo. Another spellbinding performance.
Wolfy: Are you interested in learning any new Thespian Tricks? By which I mean dashing and elegant poses! In fact, what would you say to a friendly exchange? I'll teach you some Thespian Tricks in return for Toy Medals from the treasure chests.
Wolfy: Friendship is a wonderful thing, isn't it? Ah, just the word itself gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart and stomach...
Traveler: It is a lovely thing indeed.
Paimon: Yep yep! Gotta love friendship... But, uh, when you say a warm, fuzzy feeling in your stomach... There is something slightly concerning about that.
Paimon: Aaanyway... Are you sure you're okay with just Toy Medals? What can they be worth if they're just toys?
Wolfy: As long as you believe, even Toy Medals can be more valuable than gold. That is the magic of imagination. Madame Mage told me that. I can't say I entirely understand what she meant, but...
Wolfy: The Thespian Tricks — I actually got those from a wish I made to Madame Mage. So as long as she thinks it's a fair trade, I think it should be fine...?
Paimon: Hmm, sounds kinda ominous... Don't a lot of scary stories start out that way? You make a reckless wish to a wicked witch, but you end up regretting it when she forces you to pay an impossible price in return...
Wolfy: I believe you're misunderstanding the situation, dear guest. There is absolutely nothing to fear. To start with, mages are quite different from wicked witches. And besides, I already told you what the price is — it's the Toy Medals. There's no catch!
Paimon: And you're... sure about that?
Wolfy: Yes, completely! In any case... I was the one who made the wish, so if someone has to end up paying an impossible price, just leave it to me!
Traveler: ...Why do you sound so proud of that?
Wolfy: I enjoy watching your performances, so it's well worth it as far as I'm concerned! Hmm, I wonder how many blank pages are left in this book...
Wolfy: Ah, but not to worry. Even if we run out of space, new blank pages will be added very soon!
Wolfy: I do look forward to the day when all empty pages are filled with stories...
Traveler: We still feel a little bad...
Traveler: All my best friendships are built on a warm, fuzzy feeling in my stomach.
Paimon: Oh for the love of... Please don't tell Paimon you're thinking about "emergency food" again? We're talking about friendship here, okay? Paimon will never understand why that's where your head goes...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wolfy: I'm afraid I still have some work to do before everything is ready... Thank you for your patience, my dear guests.
Wolfy: If you'd like, you can take the stage and perform once more. There'll be Toy Medals waiting for you in treasure chests afterwards!
