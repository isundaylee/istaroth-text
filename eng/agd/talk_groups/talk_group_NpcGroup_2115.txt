Traveler: The two of you really work very hard.
Qinglian: It's true, but right now, my body no longer requires that many herbs — what I need is my husband by my side.
Qinglian: Thanks for hearing me out. If you don't mind, let me give these to you.

## Talk 1

Qinglian: *cough* Hello, Traveler... *cough* I'm sorry, I'm terribly ill at the moment, one part of which is this dreadful cough...

Traveler: You look well to me...
Qinglian: Oh, really? ...Is it that obvious? Yikes, I've been outed...
Qinglian: *sigh* Okay, I'll come clean. But please, whatever you do, do not tell my husband.
Qinglian: My husband is a sailor. I barely saw him for years as he spent all his time out at sea...
Qinglian: But since I fell ill, he gave all that up to care for me full time. He even hand-picks medicine for me from way up in the mountains.
Qinglian: Of course, we're poorer now that we don't have an income. But these have been the happiest days of my life. And each time I think about him heading back out to sea when I'm all better...
Qinglian: I can't bear the thought. I don't have the courage to face up to it. So instead, I have feigned illness ever since I recovered...
Qinglian: *sigh* What a selfish woman I am...
