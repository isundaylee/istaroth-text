# Fortress of Meropide


## Talk 1

Paimon: So if the machine gets jammed, you just need to attack it to fix the problem!
Paimon: Once the widget is hot enough to glow, jump to step on the pedal and hit the widget with the hammer!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Okay, you've got this!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Great, now we can report back to the foreman and give him the processed widgets!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Lyney! Mr. Magician! Where are you? This had better not be some disappearing act!
Paimon: He doesn't seem to be around here. Let's try looking somewhere else.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Where could he be? Did he decide to slack off and sleep the day away?

## Talk 6

Paimon: So we're going even deeper now? Just how deep down are we?
Deakin: It's like a metaphor for your previous life, isn't it?
Paimon: Uh... our lives weren't that bad!

## Talk 7

Sigewinne: Your Grace? What are you doing in the infirmary at a time like this? Oh no, you didn't injure yourself, did you?
Wriothesley: Not yet, unfortunately for you. But thank you for your concern, Sigewinne.
Sigewinne: Hehe, then you must be here for those two.
Wriothesley: Allow me to introduce you. This is the infirmary, and Sigewinne here is the Fortress of Meropide's head nurse.
Sigewinne: Hello, new faces! They call me the head nurse, but I actually handle all the nurse-related work all by myself down here!
Wriothesley: Since you seem to have some rare downtime with no patients, perhaps you could find the time to join us for dinner?
Sigewinne: Oooh, then these two must be some important convicts. Sure, I'll join the welcome party!
Wriothesley: Thank you. Your presence will be the piece de resistance for today's tour.
Paimon: Oh, so the tour part is over now?
Wriothesley: I believe I've already covered the primary aspects of life here in the fortress. As for your work, there'll be someone else to guide you through the details. Hmm, is there anything else...?
Wriothesley: I seldom conduct tours, so why don't you just ask if you have any questions?
Paimon: Oh, uh, well... This is our first time here, Paimon's not sure what to ask...
Wriothesley: Then let's head back to the Coupon Cafeteria. Maybe a meal will help you think up some questions.
Sigewinne: You should at least try to be excited. Our free meals are actually pretty good here.

## Talk 8

Sigewinne: What do you think of the food? Does it meet your expectations?
Paimon: Wow, it looks delicious... Neuvillette made it sound like living conditions in the Fortress of Meropide weren't very good. Who woulda guessed that criminals get to eat tasty food like this every day!
Traveler: The main thing is that it's free.
Sigewinne: Isn't that the meal box that only super lucky people manage to draw? Seems like you two are quite fortunate.
Wriothesley: It actually has nothing to do with luck in this case. I had a word with Wolsey so you didn't have to draw lots like everyone else.
Paimon: Oh, you mean the meals are random?
Sigewinne: Yes, what you get to eat depends completely on your luck. You could say that it's a... distasteful little game that Chef Wolsey likes to play here in the cafeteria.
Paimon: Paimon knew it! If criminals got to eat tasty food like this every meal, the crime rate in Fontaine would skyrocket for sure!
Sigewinne: Excuse me, did I hear you mention Neuvillette just now? I've been wondering how he's doing. Is he busy with work? Has he been taking care of his health?
Paimon: He seems healthy no matter how you look at him, but he works so hard all the time, so it must be really tiring...
Wriothesley: Sounds like he hasn't changed a bit. Looks like you can stop worrying so much, Sigewinne.
Sigewinne: That's good... but I still feel like it's been too long since I've heard any news about him.
Wriothesley: No news is good news.
Wriothesley: Maybe the next time I've got something to discuss with him, I can invite you to accompany us.
Paimon: Hmm? But isn't the Fortress of Meropide independent from Fontaine's court system? What do you two have to discuss?
Wriothesley: Well, we provide all kinds of mechanical products for official use, and some essential goods have to be obtained from the overworld, so we naturally have to stay in touch about this and that.
Wriothesley: Monsieur Neuvillette's character is unimpeachable. No matter the question, you can discuss it openly and freely with him. Talking with him feels quite effortless.
Wriothesley: In light of that, I am quite willing to go out of my way to show respect and accommodate him.
Wriothesley: In fact, right now I'm treating you two as guests invited by Monsieur Neuvillette, but unfortunately, I can only do so until the end of this meal.
Wriothesley: After this, you two will just be inmates here.
Traveler: Understood.
Wriothesley: You're very welcome. Well, your new life awaits.
Traveler: Thank you for your hospitality.
Traveler: Mine's pretty good, too.

## Talk 9

Fielding: #Traveler and Paimon, right? Listen up. As new inmates, the only thing you need to worry about is what to do and when to do it. Don't make any extra trouble for yourself.
Fielding: Your bunks are right over there. Follow me.
Paimon: Whew, so this is where we'll be sleeping from now on...? Paimon can't believe this! *sigh* The days of staying home and reading detective stories are like a dream now...
Paimon: #By the way, Traveler, we saw a lot of things worth investigating just now...
Paimon: Even though the Duke didn't say it too directly, judging from what he said at the end, it seems that he was only welcoming because we know Neuvillette...
Paimon: We are criminals, and Paimon did eat that cake... But we're actually here to help Neuvillette.
Paimon: Hmm... Is it possible that he knows we're here on a mission? Or is Paimon overthinking things?
Traveler: It's very possible...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon thinks so, too. He probably knew why we came here from the very beginning and intentionally wanted to send us a message...
Paimon: Maybe something like, "Hey, I have my eyes on you, so don't try anything funny!"
Traveler: But there's nothing we can do about that.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. It's not like we can go back to Neuvillette empty-handed and say, "The Duke looked scary, so we gave up."
Paimon: Uh... And besides, the Duke said that he was willing to go out of his way to show his respect for Neuvillette, right?
Paimon: So we at least need to try! But Paimon hasn't got a clue where we should start our investigation...
Traveler: There was one other important thing...
Paimon: You mean...
Traveler: Lyney's presence here.
Paimon: Yeah! That's what Paimon was thinking, too! Paimon almost spilled the beans when we ran into him.
Paimon: Fortunately, based on his attitude, it looks like the Duke sees Lyney as just another inmate.
Paimon: We worked so hard to help clear Lyney and Lynette's names, and yet we turn around and bam! He's in prison anyway?
Traveler: If I had to guess...
Paimon: Oh, right! Lyney and Lynette are from the House of the Hearth! They work for The Knave, so they could be here to investigate, too!
Traveler: And look, there's something over there...
Paimon: Huh? Oh, it's a card! Paimon didn't notice it earlier...
Paimon: It looks like a magician's prop, Lyney must have left it here! He's in prison and still doing his little tricks, huh... Let Paimon have a look!
Paimon: It was nice to bump into you again. Let's catch up in the production zone tomorrow.
Paimon: What in the world? It's written like he's greeting a buddy on the street... Paimon thought he'd write something important.
Traveler: This proves that he's up to something here, too.
Paimon: If you say so... We can ask him what's going on tomorrow. Let's get some rest now.
Black Screen Text: With a bit of trepidation, you and Paimon spend your first night in the Fortress of Meropide...
Paimon: Hey, you're finally awake.
Traveler: You're up early today, Paimon.
Paimon: Well, it's Paimon's first day as a prisoner... Last night Paimon dreamed about getting interrogated by the guards until Paimon told them everything, and then Paimon woke up...
Traveler: You told them everything?
Paimon: Hey, c'mon! It's just a dream, okay? Paimon wouldn't really squeal... maybe...
Fielding: Hey, lazybones! What're you still doing here? If you don't want to starve, then get yourselves over to the production zone!
Paimon: Ah! Sorry, we're going right away!
Black Screen Text: You set off as soon as possible after asking Fielding about the location of the Production Zone.
Traveler: I'd say he's here for the same reason we are.
Traveler: We're already here, after all.
Traveler: He probably knows more than he's letting on.

## Talk 10

Grainville: Ah, you must be the catch of the day. Looks like you've got some luck, getting assigned this space...
Paimon: Yep, we just arrived yesterday and...
Grainville: Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking!
Paimon: Yessir!
Grainville: Listen carefully to my instructions. I don't want any mishaps. Every machine here is worth more than the both of you!
Grainville: Working around these machines can be very dangerous. Do your job well, and you can eat in the cafeteria after your shift. Get sloppy, and you dine in the infirmary.
Grainville: Anyway, the Fortress of Meropide doesn't want to lose a single one of its machines, and it also doesn't want to waste the production potential of any inmate. You got that?
Paimon: Got it!
Grainville: Your job is to use the machine over there to process widgets.
Grainville: Watch carefully and make sure you step on the pedal at the right time. If the machine gets jammed, then give it a little "maintenance" with your fist.
Grainville: Here, take this.
Grainville: Bring me the processed widgets and I'll give you some Credit Coupons in exchange.

## Talk 11

Grainville: Bring me the processed widgets and I'll give you some Credit Coupons in exchange.

## Talk 12

Wriothesley: Are you finished eating? Then I recommend that you return to the dormitories and rest. You have work to do tomorrow.
Wriothesley: Perhaps you were hoping to ask for some special privileges? Sorry, you'll have to use Credit Coupons like everyone else. It's not as comfy here as you might imagine.

## Talk 13

Grainville: Hmm, this one is... tolerable... though since the processing is done by machine, the product is all pretty much the same anyway.
Grainville: Alright, I'll pass you for now, and we'll count up how many Credit Coupons you've earned.
Paimon: Whew, Paimon's exhausted! We're done now, right? Oh, that foreman! He's so scary that Paimon couldn't even speak...
Paimon: Ugh... even though Paimon's starving and wants to head straight to the Coupon Cafeteria... we still need to meet Lyney first, right?
Paimon: He probably just finished up his work too, he should be around here somewhere...

## Talk 14

Sigewinne: Now that I've gotten a good look at you two, I think you're very cute.
Sigewinne: After all, heavy is the head that wears the cutesie crown. I guess I just want to say, just take care of yourself and don't get hurt.

## Talk 15

Traveler: It was okay. His attitude could use some work, though.
Wriothesley: I see. In that case, I regret to announce that Deakin here has just missed the best opportunity in his prison career to be promoted.
Deakin: I... uh, I admit that I was only thinking about the coupons... I'm sorry to have disappointed you, Your Grace. I originally... I once hoped for a chance to do some higher-level work.
Deakin: *sigh* I had no idea you two were big shots who were worthy of speaking with His Grace... Losing out on such a big opportunity because I couldn't see past my own nose...
Wriothesley: Plenty of time ahead, Deakin. There will be more opportunities.
Wriothesley: Well, I believe that concludes the introductions. We've already taken enough time here. Deakin, if you would.
Deakin: Yes! Your Grace, I'll take my leave now!
Wriothesley: Please, follow me. To make you feel more welcome, I'll show you around the various facilities of the Fortress of Meropide. I hope it will help you adjust to life here.
Paimon: He's going to personally give us a tour? Paimon can't figure out what this guy's thinking at all...
Traveler: Let's just roll with it for now.
Paimon: No wonder Charlotte's so interested in him! He's one of those mysterious types. Alright, let's keep up with him.
Traveler: But I hope he doesn't know too much already.

## Talk 16

Traveler: He's taken great care of us. Splendid chap, really.
Wriothesley: Outstanding. Well, Deakin, I recall we discussed fate during our last work meeting. I believe that fate will reward all those who take every aspect of their work and life seriously.
Wriothesley: When you return to your bunk, you'll find the guards have issued some extra Credit Coupons to you.
Deakin: Oh, thank you... Thank you, Your Grace! Oh, and you two! I can't believe you gave me such praise. If you need anything in the future, anything, please come find me anytime! No Credit Coupons necessary!
Wriothesley: Well, I believe that concludes the introductions. We've already taken enough time here. Deakin, if you would.
Deakin: Yes! Your Grace, I'll take my leave now!
Wriothesley: Please, follow me. To make you feel more welcome, I'll show you around the various facilities of the Fortress of Meropide. I hope it will help you adjust to life here.
Paimon: He's going to personally give us a tour? Paimon can't figure out what this guy's thinking at all...
Traveler: Let's just roll with it for now.
Paimon: No wonder Charlotte's so interested in him! He's one of those mysterious types. Alright, let's keep up with him.
Traveler: But I hope he doesn't know too much already.

## Talk 17

Lyney: Hey! Over here!
Paimon: Wha—! You scared Paimon! How did you appear out of nowhere like that!?
Lyney: Oh? You scare so easily now? Is there something worrying you these days?
Paimon: You little... The only thing we were worried about was trying to find you!
Lyney: Hehe, sorry, sorry! Come over here, and keep it down...
Paimon: Oh, Lynette! You're here too! You two really are inseparable.
Lynette: That's right, my brother simply can't stand to be away from me.
Lyney: Uh, it's not just Lynette, Freminet is also here. Do you still remember him?
Paimon: Oh, you mean that diver from the House of the Hearth, right? Paimon remembers seeing him in the Court of Fontaine before.
Paimon: Now hurry up and tell us, how did you end up as criminals this time? We fought so hard at court to prove you were innocent, but now it looks like our incredible court battle was for nothing!
Lyney: Sadly, even the tiniest of things can land you in prison these days, you know. I put together a street performance and used the popularity we gained from the opera house incident to attract a big crowd.
Paimon: And then...?
Lyney: Next, I invited several audience members to participate in the show. And then, with the entire audience watching... their wallets suddenly disappeared!
Lynette: My brother was charged with theft, and I was charged as his accomplice, having assisted him in his crime.
Lyney: It isn't really that bad... The missing wallets are all in the leftmost drawer of the Maison Gardiennage's big filing cabinet. We just need to see how long it takes to discover them.
Lynette: Yes, we should be released then.
Lyney: In terms of the magic trick itself, I think the performance went perfectly.
Paimon: ...Leave it to Lyney to magic himself into prison.
Traveler: That's not the point, Lyney...
Lyney: Indeed. Last time I hid my identity from you, I promised that I'd tell you absolutely everything if you were angry about it, no more secrets.
Lyney: So I don't plan on keeping anything from you this time, either. At the moment, the House of the Hearth's interests don't conflict with yours at all.
Lyney: We were instructed by the "Father" of our House, The Knave, to come here and conduct an investigation.
Paimon: Told you so! See, Paimon guessed right.
Lyney: As for what we're investigating... Perhaps you haven't heard, but the Fortress of Meropide hides a secret.
Lyney: Some even say that the entire fortress exists just to protect it.
Lyney: The House of the Hearth has been investigating this for a very long time, trying to uncover its mysteries...
Lyney: But recently all of our informants, including the ones that had infiltrated the guards, suddenly vanished and have not been heard from since.
Lyney: We believe that this is a direct provocation, and it's the reason why we came here.
Traveler: Why is the House so interested about this secret?
Lyney: "Father" has somehow managed to confirm that Focalors does not have Fontaine's Gnosis.
Paimon: Huh!? How did she manage to learn information that important?
Lynette: "Father" has her ways... Many of them are beyond our imagination, and we've never had the chance to see her at work. But we trust her conclusions.
Lyney: It was this information that led us to suspect that Fontaine's Gnosis might be in the Fortress of Meropide, and is related to that "secret."
Paimon: So it's all about the Gnosis again.
Lyney: Well, that's about it from our side, how about you two? Did Monsieur Neuvillette send you here?
Paimon: Bingo! The Knave has been applying a lot of pressure. She wants to know what happened to Childe, so we came here to investigate...
Paimon: #...Ah! Traveler... Are we allowed to tell them?
Traveler: You've already said everything...
Lyney: Hehe, you don't need to worry too much about that. She's just asking for a report on Master Childe's predicament as a means of pressuring you.
Lyney: "Father" used the situation as a pretext to negotiate with two high-ranking officials in the Court of Fontaine. She actually just wants to be able to make concessions on this matter for gains elsewhere, almost like a bargaining chip.
Lynette: Sometimes, you need an excuse to do things you otherwise couldn't, and a Harbinger is more valuable than you might imagine.
Lyney: Of course, it's not a complete farce. If we do manage to find out what happened to Master Childe too, then diplomatic relations with Fontaine could improve, and Snezhnaya might even be able to adjust its stance a bit.
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or does it feel like we're the only ones who actually care about Childe's situation... The relationships between the Harbingers must be as bad as ever.
Lyney: I wouldn't go that far... "Father" just has different standards than we do when it comes to what can be sacrificed for an advantage. By the way, I have a suggestion. Why don't we team up?
Lyney: Even though we have different objectives, we're both here to investigate the Fortress of Meropide. It would be more efficient for us to work together.
Lyney: As you know, the House of the Hearth has many reasons to seek the Gnosis, but our highest priority remains resolving the prophesized crisis. You can trust us on that.
Traveler: Sorry, I must refuse.
Lynette: See? I told you.
Lyney: Is that so... Sure enough, it won't be easy to convince them to cooperate with us...
Paimon: Lyney seems to be thinking pretty hard about something...
Lynette: Of course he is! Lyney has been looking forward to a chance to reach an understanding with you ever since last we met.
Lynette: Or I should say, we were really looking forward to teaming up with you this time.
Lyney: Lynette! Just tell them everything, why don't you...
Lynette: It's okay to open up a little...
Traveler: If all we're doing is sharing info... fine.
Lyney: Very prudent of you, and consistent with your behavior since we first met. That's reasonable enough, and I agree to cooperate on these terms as well.
Lyney: I was prepared for the worst, but you were actually more agreeable than I anticipated. Alright then, there's no time to lose. I have some information to share, so listen carefully.
Lyney: Since Lynette and I arrived here, our investigation uncovered the fact that the Fortress of Meropide has a "forbidden zone."
Lyney: Most people just clammed up and wouldn't talk, but after asking the right questions, we were able to confirm the existence of the forbidden zone from the guards.
Lyney: You should be aware of that while you're investigating.
Paimon: A forbidden zone...? Could that be where Childe disappeared to? You're right, we'll definitely keep that in mind.
Lyney: Good. That's the most suspicious thing about the fortress that we know of so far. We have a few other unanswered questions, and we'll be investigating those as quickly as we can. Anyway, I hope you find our information useful, at least.
Lyney: Oh, look at the time! You two must be hungry. You should go to the Coupon Cafeteria and get something to eat. I'll use my cards to get in touch with you again in the future.
Paimon: That's just what Paimon wanted to hear! Paimon's starving after all that work today! We can talk more about the investigation later, let's go get some grub!
Traveler: But I may reconsider if things get serious.
Traveler: Consider it an exchange of information.
Traveler: The question is, what are you two really doing here?

## Talk 18

Paimon: He wasn't kidding. Today's meal is nowhere near as good as last time. *sigh* Who knows how long it'll be until we're lucky enough to get that super tasty meal again...
Traveler: As long as you're here long enough...
Paimon: Eh, forget about it then. We'll just deal with the regular food for the time being. Let's just get out of here as soon as possible.
Paimon: But life here doesn't seem all that bad, other than the foreman being kinda mean and the work being pretty tiring...
Vidoc: You think so, mate? Ah, if I had a coupon for every fish who's said that...
Vidoc: Seems you fishies still haven't learned your lessons from your life up on the surface...
Vidoc: If you take things at face value, then by the time you reach a dead end, you won't even know how you ended up on that road in the first place.
Traveler: Have some advice for us, old timer?
Vidoc: Heh, I like your attitude. I can let you in on a little something...
Vidoc: Everyone's been telling you to just follow the rules and not cause any trouble for yourself, am I right?
Vidoc: But what they don't tell you is that the rules aren't exactly what they pretend to be — the rules for being a prisoner.
Vidoc: The truth is, this place has a lot of "hidden rules"...
Paimon: Huh? "Hidden rules"? ...What do you mean?
Vidoc: Not everyone knows about those rules, but whether you know 'em or not, once you break one... you might encounter something even worse than death.
Paimon: R—Really...? Ooh, now you're really scaring poor Paimon, don't joke around like that...
Traveler: Have some advice for us, old timer?
Vidoc: Of course, and I'd say that just disappearing would be one of the better outcomes.
Paimon: Oh, you mean that if there really are "hidden rules," then Childe's disappearance might have something to do with that?
Paimon: Uh, in that case... Would you tell us some hidden rules? We definitely want to avoid breaking them...
Vidoc: Hehe... C'mon mate, this is valuable information, the difference between life and death. D'you really think you can just ask and I would tell you?
Paimon: Paimon understands... But we don't have many Credit Coupons yet...
Vidoc: Yeah, yeah, I know... Not like I'm going anywhere. Just come talk to me after you've saved enough.
Vidoc: Moreover, you're new fish, freshly caught, and completely out of your element... What'd be the point in even telling you anything before you've gotten a handle on your new lives? Come and find me once you've been here longer.
Vidoc: I'm usually around the Rag and Bone Shop. Just call me Vidoc. Bye bye now.
Paimon: He left, just like that? Do you think he's just trying to scare us into buying fake information from him?
Traveler: Is it possible that someone would just disappear?
Paimon: Yeah, it might be a good place to start in our investigation. "Hidden rules," huh...
Paimon: But like he said, we don't have any coupons, and we're still not very familiar with this place. There's nothing we can do about it now.
Paimon: Ah! We were so busy talking, we almost forgot to eat! Even if it's not the best, it's probably better while it's warm. C'mon, dig in before it gets cold!
Black Screen Text: After your meal, you spend some time getting familiar with the fortress. Before long, it's nighttime...
Traveler: But I'm still interested.
Traveler: It'll only be a matter of time before you get it again.

## Talk 19

Paimon: So, Paimon just confirmed with the guards that our shift is set for every morning, and we're free to do whatever we want all afternoon...
Paimon: ...But it seems like most of the other inmates choose to continue working through the afternoon to earn more Credit Coupons.
Paimon: Oh, and they also said that you can use coupons to skip work in the morning and free up your time.
Paimon: They weren't kidding... Credit Coupons really can be used to do anything here...
Paimon: *yawn* Paimon's so tired... and we'll need to wake up and go to work in the morning. Without any Credit Coupons, it's not like we can really do anything else.
Paimon: #Nighty night, Traveler. Paimon hopes we can keep making progress on our investigation tomorrow.
Black Screen Text: "I hear... someone calling me..."
