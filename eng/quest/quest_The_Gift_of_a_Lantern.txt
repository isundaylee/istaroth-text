# The Gift of a Lantern


## Talk 1

Ms. Bai: I hope he'll like that Xiao Lantern...

## Talk 2

Ms. Bai: How do you do, Traveler? Thanks for your help last time. Qingce Village hasn't been this lively in a while now.
Traveler: You're most welcome.
Ms. Bai: In previous years, only Zhi and I were around, so we could only make the children a few Xiao Lanterns, talk to the old folks about some domestic business, and whip up a few good dishes...
Ms. Bai: But with your help, we were able to have a lively Lantern Rite this time.
Ms. Bai: But I guess we should look to return to normal now... I should see to the elderly folk in the village. I'm meant to go see Jiangcheng today.
Ms. Bai: If you don't mind, could you come along with me?
Traveler: Lead the way.
Ms. Bai: Alright. Then let us go to his place first.

## Talk 3

Jiangcheng: Is it you, dear? Are you back?
Traveler: I'm sorry, you must've mistaken me for someone else...
Jiangcheng: Nonsense, I haven't lost my senses... How could I not recognize my own wife...
Jiangcheng: I was just telling you that, with such a huge festival just around the corner, maybe we should get some new clothes for our daughter...
Jiangcheng: Oh, I see you've brought a guest... A seamstress! Once again, you've read my mind!
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, it's me, Ms. Bai! I brought you some Tofu the other day, surely you haven't forgotten me already?
Jiangcheng: Ah... Ms. Bai... Of course I remember you, Ms. Bai! Your father was telling me how proud he is of you not so long ago...
Jiangcheng: Eh... When was that? ...Dear, perhaps you remember...
Traveler: ...I remember.
Jiangcheng: Ha! Just like I said, there's nothing wrong with my memory... And, and...
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, why don't you take some rest? No need to strain yourself...
Ms. Bai: Traveler, how about you help Grandpa Jiangcheng clean the house? I'll keep him company in the meantime.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Ms. Bai: Thank you.
Traveler: Of course I do.

## Talk 4

Jiangcheng: Dear, come have a word with Ms. Bai... Her father is such a skilled craftsman...
Jiangcheng: They sell their Tofu in Liyue Harbor, it's top-quality!
Jiangcheng: Right! Ms. Bai, I forgot to ask what brought you here...
Traveler: We brought you a Xiao Lantern.
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lantern... Ah... So considerate. You bring me those each year, Ms. Bai...
Jiangcheng: Do you remember, Dear? I used to make great Xiao Lanterns back in the day. Our neighbors liked them so much that they asked me to make some for them too.
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lanterns are so beautiful, they really light up each Lantern Rite... Wait, I'll hang it for you...
Traveler: Let me hang it up.
Jiangcheng: Alright, just be careful. Don't hurt yourself...

## Talk 5

Jiangcheng: Did you hang the Xiao Lantern? Truly breathtaking. The upcoming year is bound to be another great one.
Traveler: It sure will.
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, it's time for us to leave now. We still have a few errands to run. I'll visit you again soon.
Jiangcheng: I see... Young people like you always have something to do... Can't get a moment's respite...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jiangcheng: Ah, sure. Dear... don't forget to look after our land...
Traveler: Certainly.

## Talk 6

Ms. Bai: I'm really grateful for your help. If I'd gone there on my own, it would've taken me hours to get everything done.
Ms. Bai: I didn't want to leave Grandpa Jiangcheng on his own right before the festival...
Traveler: What about you...
Ms. Bai: Me... I'm going back to the mill. There's still much work to be done.
Ms. Bai: I inherited the mill when my father passed away. I left my job at Liyue Harbor to continue the family tradition.
Ms. Bai: I don't know if it makes sense, but doing the same things he used to do, being in the same environment, it makes me very nostalgic.
Ms. Bai: I often recall the many things that my father used to tell me, especially during this time of the year...
Ms. Bai: Oh, I almost forgot. With Grandpa Jiangcheng on my mind, I didn't make a Xiao Lantern for myself.
Ms. Bai: The problem is I didn't leave any spare materials either...
Ms. Bai: I'm afraid I won't get everything done in time if I go looking for materials now... Traveler, would you mind collecting some for me?
Traveler: Not at all.
Ms. Bai: I really appreciate it.

## Talk 7

Ms. Bai: Have you gathered the materials yet?
Traveler: Yes, I have them right here.
Ms. Bai: Thank you.

## Talk 8

Ms. Bai: Thank you so much. I'll make myself a Xiao Lantern later.
Ms. Bai: I used to release Xiao Lanterns together with my father. When I'm done making this one, I'll have to release it on my own.
Ms. Bai: But I hope... he'll be able to see it.
Traveler: He definitely will be able to see it.
Ms. Bai: Thank you so much. I wish you Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite.

## Talk 9

Jiangcheng: It's you, Ms. Bai... Has your father been well?
Ms. Bai: Uh... He... He's doing fine. The mill is still very much in business. The city folk from Liyue Harbor often come to the village just to buy our Tofu.
Jiangcheng: Haha... Sounds about right! Your father's Tofu is the pride of Qingce Village...

## Talk 10

Jiangcheng: Xiao Lanterns... Xiao Lanterns... Such a wonderful sight...
Ms. Bai: Traveler, could you hang the Xiao Lantern now? I'll look after Grandpa Jiangcheng.
