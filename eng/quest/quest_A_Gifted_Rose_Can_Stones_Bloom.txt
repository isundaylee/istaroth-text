# A Gifted Rose: Can Stones Bloom


## Talk 1

Affan: Oh, it's you.
Traveler: How are the seeds doing?
Affan: None of them have sprouted yet.
Affan: I've checked the surface of the seeds, and there's not even the slightest hint of germination.
Affan: Why is that?
Affan: I'm sure these are the right seeds. I found them in the storeroom based on the old ghost's notes.
Affan: According to his notes, the seeds have a long shelf life, and they won't ever go bad so long as they're kept dry.
Affan: And there shouldn't be any problems with the way I planted them either. I watered and fertilized them as I should... So why?
Paimon: Don't worry. Why don't we wait a little longer, Grandpa Affan?
Paimon: Every time the two of us go to pick fruits and flowers in the wild, we have to wait several days for them to grow back after we pick 'em up.
Traveler: Be patient.
Affan: Ah, I suppose I will just have to wait. Do you guys have time today? Can you help me water them again?
Affan: It took me hours to loosen the soil in the nursery and I'm too tired to run back for water.
Traveler: Got it.
Affan: Thank you.
Traveler: Keep watering them.

## Talk 2

Affan: I'll keep watering them and feeding them fertilizer... But really, will it work out...?
Affan: I don't know anymore. *sigh*
Affan: After dawdling for so long, I've finally decided to do something, and yet I still can't do it.
Affan: I failed to fulfill your wish, old ghost. I'm sorry.
Paimon: Grandpa Affan...
Affan: Thank you for the day, children.

## Talk 3

Traveler: About Affan...
Sabbah: Hmm? Did something happen?
Black Screen Text: You tell Sabbah about the difficulties Affan has encountered.
Sabbah: I see, so that's why you have come to me for help.
Sabbah: I'm honored that I am the one you thought of when something like this came up.
Sabbah: That said, I did not specialize in plant cultivation, and my experience is limited. I'm not sure that I'll be of much help.
Sabbah: Still, I will try my best. The gentleman you mentioned who cultivated a new species of rose also interests me.
Sabbah: I will visit Mr. Affan's nursery when I have some time. You can look for me there later.

## Talk 4

Affan: Have I really been planting stones all along?

## Talk 5

Affan: I'm sorry, Uncle Shafaqat. I wasn't able to fulfill your last wish...
Traveler: Who's Shafaqat?
Affan: Ah yes, you children were pestering me about the old ghost, weren't you? Well, that's not his real name. I mean, who would actually be called that?
Affan: I heard from my elders that his name was Shafaqat. He left Sumeru City when he was young and came to our village.
Affan: He built this house after arriving here and lived in it by himself, and for decades, he barely left.
Affan: I've never seen him as a young man, but they say that he didn't really dislike children at that time.
Affan: He grew many trees and flowers in the front and back yard of his house. Children liked to run over to his place and ask for Ajilenakh Nuts, and also to listen to him talk.
Affan: But by the time I met him, he'd already become old and was called the old ghost, and he'd also come to dislike children.
Traveler: There must be another way.
Affan: What other way can there be?
Affan: Uncle Shafaqat... That old geezer's already passed away in peace. If he was still alive, I could ask him what special methods could be used to cultivate these roses.
Affan: Who can I ask now?
Traveler: I know an Amurta researcher named Sabbah.
Affan: Oh, you mean that outsider girl. Can she help?
Affan: Besides, she came by here before and I drove her away. Will she still be willing to help?
Traveler: I'll give it a shot.
Affan: You're a good kid. It's alright if you can't find anyone to help. The thought is enough for me.
Traveler: Why are you so obsessed with growing flowers?
Affan: Once in a while, some outsiders would be forced to settle here in our village.
Affan: Some people never got used to living here, even if they kept pushing themselves to do so, and so they ended up alone for the rest of their lives.
Affan: That old geezer Uncle Shafaqat was probably one of them. Everyone just accepted this state of affairs over time.
Affan: But no matter how many years passed, I refused to get used to such a thing. It's really such a pity, what happened to him...
Affan: You would have loved his garden too if you ever saw it. Pretty flowers of all kinds of colors, and so many trees of varying heights...
Affan: The person who cultivated such a great garden passed away so quietly. And the only thing people would remember about him now is that the old ghost would take away naughty children.
Affan: I refuse to accept this. He wrote in his notes that he wanted these roses to grow everywhere. And I want to fulfill his wish.
Affan: I'm old anyway, so I don't care how others may see me. My life will be worth it if I can do this.
Affan: I've cleaned up his house for him and sorted out the large pile of booklets he'd left behind.
Affan: I can show you a volume or two if you're interested.
Affan: I'll put these notes <color=#00E1FFFF>in front of the house</color>, just so he can see the sun for a bit through them.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Affan: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish...
Affan: Hmm? You're still here?
Traveler: Why live here?
Affan: Well, anyway, I'm an old weirdo, and "old weirdos behave in inexplicable ways." Few people ask me questions like you do.
Affan: I've always wanted to go out and grab the chance to do something with my life.
Affan: When I was a newlywed, I almost left with the Eremites, but then I thought about it, and I couldn't just leave my wife to take up a life of wandering.
Affan: Later, I met a traveling merchant and wanted to follow suit and do some business, but that didn't work out because I didn't have enough Mora.
Affan: Much later, my wife passed and nothing held me back anymore, but by then, I'd gotten too old to leave.
Affan: I've dragged things out up till now and I've missed out on too much.
Affan: In retrospect, I've found that I belong neither to this village, nor to anywhere else.
Affan: So in the end, I moved by myself to the edge of the village, and I found life here to be more comfortable.
Affan: And decades went by, just like that.
Affan: I'd like to invite you to come and see these flowers when they bloom. It's probably going to be tomorrow or the day after. Will you be able to make it?
Traveler: Sure.
Affan: Alright, alright...
Affan: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish...
Traveler: About the old ghost...
Affan: Only outsiders ask about the old ghost. The children of the village all know his name.
Affan: Whenever a child is naughty, their parents will say, "The old ghost will come take you away."
Affan: These younglings don't know the old ghost at all, but are pretty good at using his name to scare people.
Affan: I met the old ghost myself as a child. He did dislike children, but he wasn't scary.
Affan: For some reason, he became known as the old ghost. I thought it was just a bunch of people talking about him behind his back.
Traveler: Weren't you friends?
Affan: When I was young, I used to sneak close to his garden to play. He'd chase me away with a garden hoe as soon as he saw me.
Affan: He probably took me for a naughty child looking to cause trouble. Why would he remember me?
Affan: He might not have known who I was, but I still remember him and his little garden.
Affan: So I suppose I can call him my friend, right?
Affan: I want to grow the same flowers, just to recreate that little garden in my memories.
