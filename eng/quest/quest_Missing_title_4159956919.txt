Traveler: Let's hope this goes smoothly...
Arapacati: Yes, it will be fine. Aranara are all afraid of fire, except for us brothers and sisters. That's why Arapacati made this pot. With this pot, the fire will be very, very small â€” not too hot and not too scary.
Arapacati: #Arapacati made one for Nara {NICKNAME} as a show of thanks. I hope that the scent of happiness will always be with Nara {NICKNAME}.
