Traveler: Not afraid of scalding yourself?
Ipora: Hah, what are you talking about? I wouldn't be here if I was afraid of the heat!
Ipora: See those Koholasaurs? They should give you an idea of how hot these pools are.
Ipora: But really, I think it's great that you can soak in the pool and socialize with Koholasaurs while you're at it.
Ipora: Oh, and this guy from Inazuma taught me how to make hot spring eggs. So now, I've even got some snacks.
