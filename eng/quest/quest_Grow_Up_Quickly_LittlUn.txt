# Grow Up Quickly, Littl'Un


## Talk 1

Alem: Tahmures! I wanna be an archaeologist too!
Tahmures: Now there, Alem, being an archaeologist means more than just running around digging up rocks. It requires a whole lot of study, you know!
Alem: But, but... archaeologists get to play with baby Saurians! Mama won't even let me find my own Saurian!
Akeor: Alem, didn't your mother already say that she'd talk about it once you were grown up?
Alem: But I'm growing up right now! And you said that the only growing up that matters is your brain growing up!
Alem: So if I learn all kinds of stuff from you, then I'll grow up faster! You said so yourself!
Tahmures: That... is what I said. Hahaha... You're actually pretty sharp...
Akeor: Tahmures... what should we do...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Tahmures: As for us... Ahem... Alem, I did indeed say that, and I didn't lie to you either.
Tahmures: But before you can officially start studying archaeology and taking related courses, you must... um... there's, uh... pre-class... pre-class training you have to take.
Tahmures: #And this good {M#lad}{F#lass} is the... um, mentor we hired, just to train you!
Traveler: #Hi, I'm {NICKNAME}.
Alem: Hooray!
Tahmures: ...Sorry about this, but could you play along for a bit? Please, it's important, I'll definitely pay you back.
Traveler: I happen to be a very strict teacher.
Alem: I'm not scared! We Children of Echoes are tougher than rocks!
Tahmures: Okay! Now let's familiarize you with the curriculum... Akeor, you're up.
Akeor: M—Me? I'm supposed to introduce the... Um... Alem, as you know, all those brave warriors in the tribe have all received "observation" and "endurance" training.
Akeor: As an archaeologist who will frequently venture into dangerous environs, you too must possess such qualities.
Alem: I'll do my best!
Akeor: Very well then. Now, let's leave it up to your mentor which pre-class training to do first.
Traveler: And how should you greet your teacher?
Alem: Hello, Teacher! Nice to meet you!
Traveler: I wanna be an archaeologist too!
Akeor: And you, friend... You needn't do any more growing up. You look plenty mature already.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Let's train her "observation" first.
Akeor: Sounds good. Let's head to the training grounds then.
Traveler: ...There are really training grounds?
Akeor: ...*cough* Keep it down, would you? I busted my chops finding this place. Our tribe uses it for training anyway, it just happens to be undergoing maintenance recently.
Akeor: So though some mechanisms don't work... And others are partially dismantled... It's more than sufficient for training...
Traveler: Truly, your quick thinking is astounding.
Akeor: Sorry, sorry... *sigh* Look, this was the best I could do. It was hard enough to find a relatively safe spot as it is, and I don't have what it takes to give Alem a convincing demonstration...
Akeor: #Help us, {NICKNAME}, you're our only hope! Please, if only for Alem's sake.
Akeor: If we don't give her good advice and find something for her to do, she'll run off from the tribe herself, and then who knows what kinda crazy hijinks she'll get into?
Traveler: Fine...
Akeor: Thank you so much! Phew... I can finally relax a bit...
Tahmures: #Okay! Let's head out sooner rather than later. Alem, you be sure to watch what {NICKNAME} does carefully, okay?
Alem: Got it!
Akeor: ...*sigh* I can't believe we're tricking a kid like this. Wayob, please do not blame me, I don't know what else we can do...
Traveler: Who but you could come up with such an incredible idea on the spot?

## Talk 3

Akeor: Ahem! We're here! This is the training grounds for honing your "observation."
Akeor: It may look all flat and unassuming, but there's a ton of explosive mechanisms buried underground.
Akeor: If you don't exercise good judgment and move too hastily, you might trigger one of them, and then boom! It'll rock you, and down to the ground you go.
Akeor: Normally, we Children of Echoes use our Tepetlisaurus partners to help us excavate the target mechanisms while avoiding the obstacles.
Akeor: However, as archaeologists, we must consider all kinds of extreme circumstances.
Akeor: So... In this training, you can only rely on your powers of observation to find and excavate the buried targets.
Akeor: #Okay, next up, {NICKNAME} will demonstrate how to properly dig those mechanisms up!

## Talk 4

Alem: Tahmures... Do you archaeologists really have to take tough classes like this?
Tahmures: That's a given! And this is nothing. Once you start formally studying, then you'll find out what "tough" really means...
Alem: Oh...

## Talk 5

Tahmures: You've got some serious skill... You dug up the buried mechanisms in no time flat, and not only that... Your clothes aren't even mussed up. You probably weren't ever even knocked over by the explosives.
Tahmures: Thank goodness! We're so lucky to have run into someone as amazing as you...
Alem: Awesome!!! I wanna try too! Akeor, Akeor, let me, let me!
Akeor: No need to be so hasty, Alem. We have to reset the field first. Once everything's ready, I'll bring you back here and walk you through it step by step.
Akeor: But before that, you have to stay with Tahmures and not run off, you hear?
Alem: I know, I know. I'll listen to her, and I definitely won't run off!
Tahmures: That's a good kid, Alem. Now come on over, I'll read you some articles related to archaeology. Make sure you pay attention...
Akeor: #Phew... Thank you so much for your help, {NICKNAME}. I don't know what we'd have done without you...
Traveler: You could've just demonstrated yourself.
Akeor: Me? *sigh* Don't even joke about that. If I didn't dig those treasures up, I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to guarantee Tahmures's safety.
Akeor: And I don't know when she plans to start her next archaeological dig... No, no, wait, if she finishes her expedition, then she'll return to Sumeru, and then...
Akeor: Oh! I... Y—You didn't hear anything. Here's your reward, please, just hurry up and take it, no need to stand on ceremony.
Akeor: Alright, I need to go set things up again. Ugh... What should I bury this time? Maybe I should just bury some Grainfruit...

## Talk 6

Akeor: Wayob forgive me, Wayob have mercy, we have no evil intentions... These mechanisms will knock someone over at most, and will never seriously injure anyone... Wayob, forgive me, Wayob, have mercy...

## Talk 7

Alem: Tahmures, how's my training coming? Can I be an archaeologist now?
Tahmures: Yes, you're doing great, Alem! Once you've got things down, I can start teaching you the formal courses!
Akeor: Tahmures has specially prepared a bunch of resources for you. Once the training is over, be sure to study hard, okay?
Tahmures: #{NICKNAME}, you're here, and just in time! Alem, get ready to go train with your mentor, would you?

## Talk 8

Alem: I'm all set, Akeor!
Akeor: You little scamp, now you're the one rushing me... Look, I'll go set up the grounds right away, so just hold your horses, okay?
Tahmures: Your skills are just as incredible as ever... You dug up all the mechanisms just like that.
Tahmures: Perhaps it's only because she has such an amazing example to follow in you that she's so enthusiastic about training.
Tahmures: ...Seeing how motivated she is, I can't help but think that she might really become an outstanding archaeologist.
Traveler: Haven't you already prepped a bunch of study materials?
Tahmures: Oh, those! Just some of my notes and things I've learned over the years, along with a bunch of random stories.
Tahmures: I never imagined she'd actually get through it all.
Tahmures: Anyway, this is for you. Please, take it. I'll go prepare some more study materials for Alem in a bit.
Tahmures: Before I leave Natlan, I'll be sure to teach her everything I can.
Tahmures: Hehe... I hope that a new star of archaeology will rise up from Natlan.
Traveler: Are you going to take nurturing her seriously now?
Tahmures: "Nurture" might be a bit of a strong word. With my qualifications, at most, all I can do is give her a primer in archaeology.
Tahmures: If I were to try and teach her any more than that, I'd probably end up hampering her progress...

## Talk 9

Traveler: Let's train her "endurance" first.
Akeor: Sounds good. Let's head to the training grounds then.
Traveler: ...There are really training grounds?
Akeor: ...*cough* Keep it down, would you? I busted my chops finding this place. Our tribe uses it for training anyway, it just happens to be undergoing maintenance recently.
Akeor: So though some mechanisms don't work... And others are partially dismantled... It's more than sufficient for training...
Traveler: Truly, your quick thinking is astounding.
Akeor: Sorry, sorry... *sigh* Look, this was the best I could do. It was hard enough to find a relatively safe spot as it is, and I don't have what it takes to give Alem a convincing demonstration...
Akeor: #Help us, {NICKNAME}, you're our only hope! Please, if only for Alem's sake.
Akeor: If we don't give her good advice and find something for her to do, she'll run off from the tribe herself, and then who knows what kinda crazy hijinks she'll get into?
Traveler: Fine...
Akeor: Thank you so much! Phew... I can finally relax a bit...
Tahmures: #Alright, let's head out sooner rather than later. Alem, you be sure to watch what {NICKNAME} does carefully, okay?
Alem: Got it!
Akeor: ...*sigh* I can't believe we're tricking a kid like this. Wayob, please do not blame me, I don't know what else we can do...
Traveler: Who but you could come up with such an incredible idea on the spot?

## Talk 10

Akeor: Ahem! We're here! This is the training grounds for improving your "endurance."
Akeor: Er... Our tribe actually invited the Scions of the Canopy to come and make some special modifications to the grounds.
Akeor: Put simply, this training is all about reaching the finish line as fast as you can, any way you can!
Akeor: #Okay, next up, {NICKNAME} will demonstrate how to get to the finish line super quickly.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Let's train her "observation" today.
Alem: I'm all set!
Akeor: You seem to have gotten out on the right side of the bed, Alem! Let's head to the training grounds now.

## Talk 12

Black Screen Text: After a short while, Tahmures and the others emerge from the path to the side...
Akeor: How do you run so fast? We took shortcuts and still couldn't keep up with you!
Tahmures: Thank goodness! We're so lucky to have run into someone as amazing as you...
Alem: I get it now, so can I start running? I'm all ready!
Tahmures: Hold on now, Alem. No need to rush. Akeor still needs to make some adjustments to the course. So that... it'll be more suitable for you to really shine.
Akeor: So before that, you need to stay with Tahmures, and no matter what, do not run off, or jump the gun.
Alem: I know, I know. I'll listen, and I definitely won't start the run early!
Tahmures: Alem, you're such a sweet kid. Come here now, let me see to your clothes, and make sure they don't trip you up halfway through...
Akeor: #Phew... Thank you so much for your help, {NICKNAME}. I don't know what we'd have done without you...
Traveler: You could've just demonstrated yourself.
Akeor: Me? Don't even joke about that. Without my Saurian companion, and just under my own power? My legs can't carry me that fast.
Akeor: *sigh* If only I could dig up some more treasures. But I don't even know when Tahmures plans to start her next archaeological dig...
Akeor: No, no, wait, if she finishes her expedition, then she'll return to Sumeru, and then...
Akeor: Oh! I... Y—You didn't hear anything. Here's your reward, please, just hurry up and take it, no need to stand on ceremony.
Akeor: Alright, I need to go set things up again. Ugh... What should I set up this time?

### Additional Talk 2

Alem: Tahmures, I already finished the book you gave me last time, and took some notes too! See?
Tahmures: Oh... Oh! These notes are... really not bad at all.
Alem: Yeah! Because just like you said, I have to study hard if I wanna be an archaeologist.
Tahmures: ...I see.
Tahmures: Alem, I believe that you'll become the best archaeologist there is.

### Additional Talk 3

Akeor: Just like last time, there's a bunch of buried mechanisms.
Akeor: Since Alem's already pretty good, I... upped the difficulty a bit, and buried even more.
Traveler: ...You buried new mechanisms?
Akeor: ...Shh, keep your voice down! It's just we didn't finish dismantling all the explosives from last time, did we...
Akeor: #Anyway, {NICKNAME}, I'll leave the demo to you. I'm sure they won't pose a problem for you.

### Additional Talk 6

Alem: I'm the best at running! I'm so fast, that sometimes not even Mama can catch me!

### Additional Talk 7

Alem: Tahmures, I don't quite understand the notes you gave me before...
Tahmures: Let me see... Huh? This... This question...

Black Screen Text: After a short while, Tahmures and the others emerge from the path to the side...
Alem: I kinda think... I can just go for it. No need to adjust anything, Akeor.
Akeor: Pfft, you little scamp, why're you in such a hurry? Let me clean up those sticks and rocks in the way. Haven't you thought of what would happen if you tripped?
Tahmures: You're just too fast... I think that no matter what kind of shortcut we take, we just can't keep up with you.
Tahmures: Perhaps it's only because she has such an amazing example to follow in you that she's so enthusiastic about training.
Tahmures: ...Seeing how motivated she is, I can't help but think that she might really become an outstanding archaeologist.
