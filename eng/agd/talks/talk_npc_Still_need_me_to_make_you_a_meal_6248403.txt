Traveler: Still need me to make you a meal?
Huang the Third: Oh, no, no! Your sincerity was well-felt indeed!
Huang the Third: On the contrary, it should be I who should whip up a good dish for you, or perhaps treat you to a restaurant meal!
Huang the Third: Uh, hang on a moment, let me check our expenses over the last few days...
Huang the Third: *cough* Well, let's have that feast another day, shall we?
