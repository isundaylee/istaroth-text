Traveler: Setaria?
Fargana: Huh?
Fargana: ...Hmm, my bad. I've only recently returned to the Akademiya from Aaru Village, so very few people speak to me. I subconsciously assumed that you're one of Setaria's friends.

Traveler: Aaru Village, you say...
Fargana: That's right. I was previously one of the Village Keepers... That's what the villagers told me, anyway.
Fargana: Village Keepers are researchers who have been exiled to Aaru Village. But in truth, I don't really remember what I did there.
Fargana: It's almost like I had a dream that I no longer remembered once I awoke... and yet my mind is still quite clear.
Fargana: Later, a lady named Setaria helped me settle some procedures that would let me return to the Akademiya. Honestly, it was a lot of procedures indeed, so I'm quite thankful for her help.
Fargana: She should be busy here with her work as an educator at the moment. I plan on helping her to look for some necessary materials, such as books about basic infrastructure...
Fargana: Once I've finished settling those things, I'll contact her again.
