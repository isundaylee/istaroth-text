Traveler: Sure, hit me with it.
Maile: Haha, that was quick! I like your style.
Maile: That said, I don't actually have much to talk about... *sigh* You know, the Masters of the Night-Wind come and go like the mist. I knew this would happen, even before coming over to see her.
Maile: I learned a new instrument recently, and wanted to play it for her. If I spent all the time I've been waiting for her practicing, I'd definitely be on the road to becoming a master!
Maile: But playing the same tunes over and over is pretty boring. Maybe I should become a graffiti apprentice somewhere close by...
Maile: Ah, my apologies. I've let myself get a bit carried away... You should get back to your business.
