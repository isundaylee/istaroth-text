Jiu: You're a little early... Are you here to witness the resurrection of the most ancient, most awe-inspiring individual in Liyue's history?

## Talk

Traveler: Do you mean Rex Lapis?
Jiu: Hah... That usurper?
Jiu: Humans... They care only about history since the dawn of the age of mankind...
Jiu: Are people really happy to just draw a line under the litany of atrocities humanity's ancestors are responsible for, call it "ye olde worlde," and just get on with their merry little lives?
Jiu: Well, I hope that anyone who willfully indulges in this fantasy world of false prosperity will be consumed by it, and thus get what they deserve.

## Talk

Traveler: Resurrection?
Jiu: The adepti thought to suppress it with trees. Hah! Fools! Little did they know that after thousands of years... the trees that hold the beast shall surely become one with the beast...
Jiu: And lo, it shall stretch wide its arms, and unfurl its body, and reach out with its roots... And the ley lines of the world shall heed its call.
Jiu: Then, once the beast has quenched its great thirst for that energy which only the ley lines can provide...
Jiu: I imagine any significance we presume to have in this world will vanish for good. Wouldn't you agree?

Traveler: I don't quite follow...
Jiu: Oh don't worry... You will see.
