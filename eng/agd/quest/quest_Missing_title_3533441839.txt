Mualani: Whoa, our Archon really is amazing! And super brave, too. She even went toe to toe with Lord Xbalanque!
Kinich: Don't be so modest. You'd have done the same.
Ajaw: Hah, like any of us wouldn't! I'd have jumped at the chance! What about you?
Kachina: I... I wouldn't dare!
Kinich: Fighting is in a warrior's nature. If the opportunity was presented to you, I'm sure your instincts would make that choice for you.
Citlali: *sigh* I swear, you're all just brimming with energy over here... This is Lord Xbalanque we're talking about. Our greatest ancestor! Are you really that into sparring with your elders?
Mualani: Granny Citlali! Let's spar sometime, too!
Citlali: No, no, we're absolutely not doing that.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Mausau: Say, what kind of vegetable do you think I'll become? A red one, or... a green one?
Ororon: You? I have a feeling... that you might turn into an onion.
Mausau: An onion?
Ororon: Someone who looks ordinary, but who can make anyone who attacks you break down and weep.
Mausau: Really? That sounds super strong...
Iansan: What are those two even talking about...
Ororon: Onions are super powerful. One of my friends happened to be cutting onions when I came over to his house. He began to cry, and the Saurians also began to cry, and eventually, nearly every living creature in the room was crying.
Iansan: What about you? Did you cry too?
Ororon: I was also in the room, but I shielded my eyes with my cloak just in time. Cacucu and Ifa couldn't see my face, so they thought I cried too.
Mausau: I'd like to become an onion-man, and make people cry too!
Ororon: Sure, no problem.
Iansan: I really want to interrupt you, but I have no clue what to say to derail this line of conversation...
Ororon: Well, Iansan, you're a tiny... mushroom. Yes.
Iansan: No one asked you!
Iansan: Although... mushrooms are pretty resilient, I guess... Okay, I approve.
Mausau: Then you must be full of life too, right, Miss?
Ororon: Yes she is.
Iansan: Yeah... Sure, why not?
