Traveler: Play safe, y'hear?
Little Kuang: It's fine! Chenyu Vale is huge, so there are so many places where I can play!
Little Kuang: My parents wouldn't let me leave the city when we lived in Liyue Harbor, so I was limited to playing by the entrance or at the docks...
Little Kuang: But there were too many people in both those places. I kept running into people all the time. Sometimes, there would be groups of people moving things at the docks, and that put me at risk of being struck by something.
Little Kuang: Yeelong Barf is much better. It may be small, but it has just the right amount of people, so I can play to my heart's content!
