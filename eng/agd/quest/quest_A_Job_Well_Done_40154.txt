# A Job Well Done


## Talk 1

Sucrose: #Greetings, Traveler, Paimon, and Lisa!
Paimon: Sucrose! It's been a while since the last time we saw you!
Sucrose: On the way here, I overheard quite a few people talking about alchemical potions.
Sucrose: At first, I was worried something might have gone wrong with the herbs, but judging by the way people were talking, it seems like they were pretty pleased with the results!
Lisa: Hehe, Sucrose, your bio-alchemical expertise was exactly what we needed for potion making.
Paimon: Yeah! We've been able to make potions with all sorts of different effects!
Sucrose: #You mastered potion-making in such a short amount of time? I guess that's expected for someone of your talent, Traveler.
Lisa: #I wouldn't be surprised if he became a potion master one day.
Traveler: I've still got a long way to go...
Sucrose: #Still, if you managed to master potion-making in such a short amount of time, Traveler, we should be able to start teaching the public about it as well.
Lisa: Wait, was that also a part of Jean's plan?
Sucrose: Yep. It's something she and Mr. Albedo talked about... As I understand it, the goal was not just to create and sell potions, but also to teach the principles and practices of alchemy to the people.
Sucrose: Thanks to your shop, the public's understanding of alchemical potions has increased quite a bit. Perhaps, one day, they'll even be able to make simple potions themselves...
Lisa: Hmm, without the proper training, though, those potions could be dangerous to use...
Sucrose: #You're right... With Lisa there to mentor you, Traveler, we could rest assured that nothing would go wrong during the potion-making process. However, when it comes to the general public, we have to think of a way to ensure that any resulting potions would be safe to use.
Sucrose: So, Mr. Albedo is planning to establish a set of criteria to evaluate various levels of potion-making ability. People will have to pass the exam that corresponds to their level of proficiency before being allowed to brew their own potions.
Lisa: Let me guess... You would like us to also take part in this exam?
Sucrose: Yes, although it would probably be more accurate to say that... we would like you to help us finalize the contents of the exam.
Sucrose: #In order to ensure a proper level of difficulty, we need to first collect the relevant data. That's where our mock exam comes in. If you could take it, Traveler, your results would serve as a very important reference for us.
Sucrose: You will, of course, be compensated for your efforts!
Lisa: Hehe, what a great idea! I must admit, I'm very interested to see how much my cutie's alchemy skills have improved.
Traveler: I guess I could give it a go.
Sucrose: Wonderful. Then let me explain a little bit about how the exam works. The exam has four levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.
Sucrose: To pass, all you need to do is brew a potion within the time limit that satisfies the main objective.
Sucrose: Satisfying additional objectives will earn you extra rewards.
Paimon: Okay, all this is starting to sound pretty official. Paimon's nervous all of a sudden.
Sucrose: Just do what you normally do and you should be fine. If you don't pass the first time around, you can always retake the exam, so no need to put too much pressure on yourselves.
Paimon: Oh, retakes are allowed! Phew, that's a relief!
Sucrose: Yep! Just let me know when you're ready.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: Bring it on!
Lisa: Hehe, confidence is a good look on you, cutie!
Traveler: I'm just a beginner.

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: You continue to run the potion shop. Thanks to all your hard work, your earnings surpass expectations...
Lisa: Wow, I have to hand it to you, cuties. I never imagined that you'd be able to bring in so much Mora in such a short amount of time...
Lisa: You're practically geniuses when it comes to business.
Traveler: It's all thanks to your help.
Lisa: Hehe, always so humble...
Lisa: Although, with results this impressive, I would say you could stand to take a bit more credit.
Lisa: If I had your help all the time, I bet I could take double the amount of vacation without a care in the world.
Lisa: With all your hard work up to this point, we've already collected enough sales data for our research. Thank you so much for all your help.
Lisa: Of course, if you're interested in continuing to run the shop, you'd make me a very happy Lisa.
Lisa: In either case, I should already have more than enough to report back to Jean with.
Jean: #Traveler, Paimon, it's been a long time.
Paimon: Jean!
Lisa: Oh, you're here! I wrapped up some business with my cuties, and was just about to go report back to you at headquarters.
Jean: No need. I already talked to some other knights, so I think I have fairly good understanding of the situation.
Jean: #Looks like you've troubled Traveler to help you once again?
Lisa: Hehe, how could I not? When it comes to work as important as this, a smart and capable partner is simply a must have â€” especially if we want good results.
Lisa: Look at the success of the shop! I could have never produced that kind of result on my own.
Jean: Well, I do have to admit, your success is remarkable.
Jean: I've been meaning to come see you for some time now, but work kept getting in the way, and I simply couldn't find the time... Regardless, I just knew I had to come thank you in person.
Traveler: We should thank you for your support as well.
Jean: It's truly reassuring to have such outstanding members among our ranks.
Lisa: Hehe, once this is all over, I do believe I'm due for a vacation.
Lisa: I've lost quite a few strands of hair to all the stress.
Jean: Of course. Thank you for all your hard work.
Jean: Seeing you cooped up in that library all the time, I was worried you might be bored. So I thought I'd give you an opportunity to truly make use of your talents.
Jean: Perhaps I put too much on your plate at once...
Lisa: #It wasn't that bad. After all, it's not like I was in it alone. All the help from the Knights and Traveler really helped to lessen the load.
Lisa: Plus, it was fun to get back into research. It's nice to relive those days every once in a while.
Jean: I'm glad to hear that.
Jean: #Thank you again for all your help, Traveler. Please take this as your compensation.
Lisa: Ah, speaking of compensation, I've also prepared a little memento for you. Here, I hope you like it!
Traveler: It was a group effort.
Traveler: We just got the hang of it along the way.
Lisa: Hm, a testament to your ability to learn on the job.

## Talk 3

Jean: Public reception towards alchemical potions has been much more favorable than expected.
Jean: If things continue like this, the potions industry could end up becoming a new revenue stream for the entire region of Mondstadt...
Lisa: We've got more than enough time to make big plans for the future. Right now, we should focus on the hard-earned success we've been able to achieve so far. How about we find a time to celebrate together?
Paimon: Ooh, a celebration! As long as there's yummy food, Paimon's in!
Lisa: Of course. Once I've made the preparations, you'll be the first to know. I'll even do you the honor of extending your invitation in person, hehe.
Jean: That does sound nice. You certainly deserve to relax after all your hard work.
