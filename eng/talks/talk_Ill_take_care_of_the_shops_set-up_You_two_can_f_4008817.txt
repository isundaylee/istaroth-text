# Talk Dialog

Bernhard: I'll take care of the shop's set-up. You two can focus on preparing the necessary funds!
Traveler: About how to prepare the funds...
Bernhard: You could help nearby customers place orders with the wine merchants or supply winemakers with ingredients...
Bernhard: Either method is fine, so you can just prioritize based on your preference.
Traveler: About the person in charge being appointed through draws...
Bernhard: Well... The person in charge was determined by a random draw mechanism that was intended to give each Knight an equal chance... to facilitate dialogue between us and the public...
Bernhard: I can do my usual work just fine. But when it comes to deciding on a direction or coming up with a plan, I'm always afraid that I'll make a mess of things...
Bernhard: So, it's a good thing that you, our Honorary Knight, have stepped up to the plate! You could say that you saved this charity event â€” not to mention me!
Traveler: Let me give it a try first!
Bernhard: Okay! I'm looking forward to hearing the good news from you.
