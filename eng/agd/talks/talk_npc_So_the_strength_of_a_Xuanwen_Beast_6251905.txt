Traveler: So, the strength of a Xuanwen Beast...
Keshen: That's difficult to quantify.
Keshen: Just like how some people are completely hopeless at martial arts and some are talented geniuses, there are large weak men and slender youths who have extraordinary sword skills...
Keshen: I'm sure some Xuanwen Beasts might be extremely weak to the point that even poorly-equipped hired guards can manage them.
Keshen: We currently have very little information about the strongest Xuanwen Beasts.
Keshen: I'm just estimating here, albeit assuming that they're on the stronger side... But a single paw swipe may be equal to a direct hit from the Guizhong Ballista.
Keshen: *sigh* Can a mortal really block such a mighty blow?
Keshen: ...No, I can't let this discourage me. I need to train harder!
