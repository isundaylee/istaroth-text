Traveler: Are you bored?
Sharp: Of course. After chasing the monsters away, I have absolutely nothing to do.
Sharp: Earlier, the young master asked me to help him pick some flowers, but he and that young lady started getting all lovey-dovey right away...
Sharp: What need do they have for flowers? I reckon the young master's forgotten all about it already.
Sharp: Do you want them? Just take them if you do. They're no use to me, anyhow.

Sharp: Who are you?
Sharp: Sharp.
Sharp: Master Goth's PSD.
Sharp: If you know the first thing about me, you'll keep away from my VIP.
Sharp: "PSD"?
Sharp: Tsk. Of course. You wouldn't know.
Sharp: PSD, personal security detachment. Bodyguard. We take the hit, so our clients don't have to.
Sharp: Personally, I much prefer "merc for hire." But now that I work for them, they've insisted on PSD.
Sharp: "VIP"?
Sharp: That one, over there. Marvin.
Sharp: My client. VIP, very important person. Very important to me, anyway, because he pays my wages.
Sharp: Master Goth's young... esquire.
Sharp: Tsk. They insist that I refer to him as "esquire." Well, what can I do? They pay my wages.

Traveler: What are you doing?
Sharp: Master Goth pays me to protect his young esquire. His young esquire pays me to keep this a secret from his old man.
Sharp: To get paid double, I just have to stay put and keep my mouth shut.
Sharp: Hmph, look at them. Being all lovey-dovey when I'm right here watching. Young people these days, no sense of shame...
