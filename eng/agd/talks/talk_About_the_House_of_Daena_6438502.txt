Traveler: About the House of Daena...
Katayoun: The House of Daena is the library of the Akademiya. Researchers and students can borrow many books on general knowledge.
Katayoun: Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews.
Katayoun: After all, most knowledge can be obtained through the Akasha. Many people who still read just want to see the source of knowledge with their own eyes.
Katayoun: I'd say the House of Daena is more like a museum in spite of being known as "the library of Sumeru."
