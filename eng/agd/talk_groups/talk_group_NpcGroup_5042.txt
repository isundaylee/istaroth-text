Traveler: Tell me about "Tales of Humanity"...
Euphrasie: One of the primary reasons we had for establishing our newspaper was to ensure that information flows and that everyone can understand what's happening around them.
Euphrasie: Slowly, we moved to not only attempting to let readers "know," but to also let them "express" themselves.
Euphrasie: Thus, "Tales of Humanity" was born. Everyone can write in to this column, and similarly, everyone can read it.
Euphrasie: As for the result... Well, you've seen it, haven't you? Our prints are practically drowning in all manner of content.
Euphrasie: But that's not a bad thing. In my experience, listeners also need some light reading to go with their explosive news.
Euphrasie: Additionally, being able to help our readers does our reputation good.
Euphrasie: In other words, we'll be troubling you somewhat further. Fret not — you will find our payment quite suitable.

Traveler: Not really.
Euphrasie: Well, that's good. She is a live correspondent, and they tend to put themselves in the line of fire — I almost thought that someone had come to make a threat again.
Euphrasie: Ah, don't worry, we have our ways of dealing with such matters.
Euphrasie: After all, we'd have gone bust a long time ago if we couldn't handle ourselves in a little tussle or two.
