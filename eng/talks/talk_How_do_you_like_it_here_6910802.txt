Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lan Yan: It's a lot different from what I'm used to.
Traveler: Is there something you don't like?
Lan Yan: Oh, no, no! That's not what I meant at all!
Lan Yan: Being here... It's just a new sensation, that's all!
Lan Yan: I've never been somewhere so amazing! I'm so excited, my heart feels like it's beating a mile a minute!
Traveler: I guess this place is pretty big...
Lan Yan: Definitely... The size is only part of it, though. What's really impressive is what you've done with the place!
Lan Yan: I never get lost in the mountains back home, and that's a big area, too.
Lan Yan: But, as I was exploring this place just now, I really had to pay attention, or I never would have found my way back!
Traveler: It's okay. I would come and save you!
Lan Yan: Hehe, really?
Lan Yan: Then, if you hear the frantic ringing of a silver bell, come find me, okay?
