Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Draff: Stay away from my daughter, Diona.
Draff: She will learn the hunting trade from me and take over as leader of this town.

Draff: *sigh* Never mind, I just need to be patient. She's my daughter after all, and if she's got her heart set on doing something she'll not go back on it easily.
