# Windsong Lyre

Use this traditional instrument from Mondstadt to play songs.
An instrument of incredible workmanship, it will surely produce moving music when played by able hands.
Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song, and thus also boasts a long history of constructing instruments to that effect. Bards are most proud of their songs and poems, and perhaps the instruments, too, would be proud of their owners and their musical tradition.
