Traveler: About Iotham...
Jehiet: Iotham... There was a foreign couple in Vimara Village once, and they left Iotham behind when they left.
Jehiet: We didn't quite know what to do...
Jehiet: At that time, I felt terrible for the little child. If they didn't want to raise him, I would!
Jehiet: It was just one more mouth to feed. How could I watch him starve?
Jehiet: Iotham is a good boy who's sensible and holds respect for the elders. Now my biggest wish is that he can grow up happy and healthy.
