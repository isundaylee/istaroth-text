Huixin: Hello, welcome to the Moonchase Festival here in Liyue.
Huixin: The theme of this year's Moonchase Festival is gourmet food, and this iteration of Masterful Chefs is being organized by the Liyue Qixing themselves. With all the great chefs taking part, this is one show you don't want to miss!
Huixin: I hope that everyone will have a good time during the festival. Of course, if you do have civil affairs at hand, please direct your concerns to the Ministry.
