Traveler: Then why are you here?
Hao: Me? Well, I don't have any other talents other than mining, and you've got to make Mora somehow, am I right? Heh. Don't worry, I reckon I can still make ends meet this way.
Hao: Still, people like us miners... We aren't an awfully talented lot. We tend to stick to this one path, unlike you adventurers. Going out and seeing the world as you like... If only I could do that.
