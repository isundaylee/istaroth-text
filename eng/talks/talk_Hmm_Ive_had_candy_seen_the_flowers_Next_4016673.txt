Ayten: Hmm... I've had candy, seen the flowers... Next...
Karima: Next? What's next on your list?
Ayten: Hehe... I wonder if there's any weaponsmiths around here? I want to buy a sword, the bigger the better!
Karima: Huh!? But... That's dangerous... And could you even lift it?
Ayten: If I can't, you're here to help, right? The two of us should be able to carry it back to Aaru Village!
Karima: Then... Then I also have something I want to buy! And you have to help me carry it, Ayten!
Ayten: Heh... Say no more. I already know exactly what you want.
Ayten: Don't worry. We'll pick you out a shield every bit as awesome-looking as Candace's.
