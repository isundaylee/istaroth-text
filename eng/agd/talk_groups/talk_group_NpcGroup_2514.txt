Traveler: What are you reading off?
Bosu: It's a folk verse in Chenyu Vale. Every ferryman knows the words.
Bosu: This one is easy to understand. There's another, a more elegant one...
Bosu: "...The spring's cries ripple through the vales, the shrines depart from northeast shores. The heights and shallows in the southwest hide..."
Bosu: I'll sing you this one when you take the raft to Yilong Wharf.

Traveler: This boat is quite unique.
Bosu: Good taste!
Bosu: Chenyu Vale's shallow and has a lot of bends, so big ships would get stranded here all too easy.
Bosu: But not a raft! It's light and sits high on the water, so no bends or unseen reef can stop us.
Bosu: Most importantly, the scenery of Chenyu Vale can only be appreciated in detail from a raft.
