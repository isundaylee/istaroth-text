# The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur


## Talk 1

Neuvillette: You...
Focalors (Uh... Furina?): Pfft... Hahahaha...
Focalors (Uh... Furina?): ...Sorry! That shocked expression on your face is just too amusing, I couldn't help myself.
Neuvillette: You are not Furina. Who are you?
Focalors: Ah, the sweet sound of bewilderment. Marvelous! A sure sign that my attempt to deceive everyone was a resounding success... But to answer your question: I am Focalors. You know? The god?
Neuvillette: Focalors... Why did you deceive us?
Focalors: Oh, that wasn't my goal, of course. Goodness, no! But I had to fool everyone else, too, if I was to stand any chance of deceiving...
Focalors: ...The Heavenly Principles.
Neuvillette: Deceiving the Heavenly Principles...
Focalors: It's all because of that pernicious prophecy. Dreadful, wasn't it? Everyone doomed to dissolve, Fontaine condemned to be flooded...
Focalors: One was not amused, in fact, one was positively bemused, when that problem was thrust upon me by my dearest predecessor — that's the former Hydro Archon, Egeria, for the uninitiated. It hardly gets more disastrous than a preordained national catastrophe, now does it?
Focalors: She knew full well that the prophecy would surely come to pass.
Focalors: And as one of The Seven, she also knew full well that... one defies the Heavenly Principles at one's peril.
Focalors: So yes, as you have no doubt surmised, it was a rather impossible situation that I found myself in.
Focalors: I spent a terribly long time mulling it over, alone on the ocean floor... and I was almost growing barnacles by the time I finally realized: There was only one possible solution to this confounding conundrum.
Focalors: I had to outwit the Heavenly Principles. Allow the prophecy to be fulfilled, ostensibly at least, while saving everyone at the same time.
Focalors: I'm a genius, I know. I can only assume that's why Egeria chose me as her successor.
Focalors: Although looking back now, it was hardly the inheritance one dreams of... Between the task of saving the nation, the quotidian duties of the Hydro Archon, and not to mention the original sin of creating a new race of humans, I dare say she left me quite a colossal mess to clean up.
Focalors: *sigh* But one can only play the hand one is dealt. I did not choose this, any more than I chose to be one of her Oceanid familiars.
Neuvillette: So, you were also once one of the Oceanids, transformed into a human by Egeria's hand?
Focalors: Yes, I was. I always dreamed of becoming human... And I still do, even now. In my eyes, to be human is to be part of the greatest opera ever known.
Focalors: After becoming a god, I separated my divinity from my body and spirit, leaving behind only a self that was as naive and bewildered as my past self on her first day as a human being.
Focalors: The "me" you see before you now is that "divinity," and the human counterpart I left behind, I named "Furina."
Focalors: She could feel joy, sorrow, and everything in between. She could be as vain and conceited, or as meek and vulnerable as she wished...
Focalors: Her strengths were of a kind only a human could possess, as were her shortcomings.
Focalors: But in my eyes, Furina's humanity was what made her perfect. She was perfectly human in every way... the person I always wanted to be.
Focalors: Anyway — so then I cursed her.
Focalors: ...All part of the plan, of course. The plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles.
Neuvillette: ...
Focalors: Do you still remember the final scene of the prophecy? The Hydro Archon, alone, weeping on her throne.
Focalors: In order that the prophecy might appear fulfilled, I invited Furina to be an actress: to play the part of the Hydro Archon in the prophecy.
Focalors: Under the curse I placed on her, so long as I, Focalors' divinity, continued to exist, she could not die. But nor was she free to live her life in the pursuit of happiness.
Focalors: Instead, she was forced to take the stage in the opera house, to embrace the role of leading lady, to forever play the part of the god from the prophecy... All to create a deceitful appearance of that prophecy coming to pass.
Focalors: I suppose now you probably understand why your court is called the "Opera Epiclese."
Neuvillette: ...But Furina is only human, isn't she?
Neuvillette: Even though she has had a long life, her mind is no stronger than that of any other ordinary human being.
Neuvillette: I cannot begin to fathom what she has had to endure... It must have been torture for her.
Focalors: It has indeed. And although she is, in a sense, "me" in human form... I most definitely owe her an apology for it.
Focalors: It's been five hundred years...
Focalors: ...And all along, she's been playing her part in the most unimaginably long, unbearably lonely, and agonizingly painful opera of all time.

## Talk 2

Traveler: (Where am I? Am I still in the opera house? No. That's not quite right...)
Traveler: (I came into contact with Furina's... tears? If I remember correctly, tears often contain a being's strongest emotions...)
Traveler: (With sufficiently strong Hydro sensitivity, I can form an emotional connection, just like I did with that Oceanid at the Fountain of Lucine...)
Traveler: (Wait, could this be... Furina's inner world?)
Traveler: (Furina? What is she doing onstage? Wait a moment. That probably isn't Furina. That's likely a reflection of her "inner self.")
Traveler: (If I can directly speak to that self, I might be able to easily get what I wanted to know.)
Traveler: (I came here for answers. Either way, this opportunity is not to be missed. Let me try talking to her.)

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: Scene 6, Opera House, Furina
Black Screen Text: Scene 182375, Opera House, Furina
Unknown Voice: Lady Furina! It's... It's like a dream, being able to speak with you up close like this...
Unknown Voice: I've heard that the first member of our family who was honored to receive an audience with you was Madame Deoteria, almost twenty generations ago!
Furina: Hahaha... And what a fine family yours is, indeed! It brings me great joy to meet such a faithful believer, a descendant of a line most ardent.
Unknown Voice: Ehehe... Surely you exaggerate, Lady Furina...
Unknown Voice: Um... My Lady?
Furina: Hmm? What is it, good citizen...
Unknown Voice: Are... are you crying?
Furina: Eh... Huh? Hahaha, really now? I didn't even notice.
Furina: *sigh* This must be the overflow of Hydro from my person! Well, can't quite help being the god whose dominion is the waters, can I?
Unknown Voice: Ah, no wonder, no wonder... A manifestation of your power, then... O, Archon, I am honored to have witnessed it. Honored indeed...

## Talk 4

Furina: (The day's finally over. I haven't had a moment to breathe this whole time...)
Furina: (But it's good to see that everything's getting "on track." There are no longer any voices of suspicion.)
Furina: (Maybe this is fine. I just need to keep going, and everyone will be saved...)
Furina: (Phew... Alright, Furina, don't think too hard about this. You need rest — tomorrow's a new day.)
Black Screen Text: Scene 4, Opera House, Furina
Unknown Voice: Lady Furina, here are the new trial reports for the latest cases, as well as a summary of the follow-up...
Furina: Ugh, there'll be no need for that. I've seen them already. There's no need to go back over scenes I've witnessed in person before!
Unknown Voice: Lady Furina! I've waited for so, so long, for this chance to see you in this manner...
Furina: Indeed, my dear, loyal citizen, this joyous moment is an honor for us both!
Unknown Voice: Lady Furina. We're detecting significant hydrological anomalies near Poisson...
Furina: Understood. Keep monitoring. Keep me informed should anything come up at the Institute.
Furina: (Phew... I don't think I let anything slip today. I must show the people that there is nothing to worry about...)
Furina: (I just... don't know when these days will end...)
Furina: (I feel utterly exhausted. Best to rest early today, too.)
Black Screen Text: Scene 5, Opera House, Furina

## Talk 5

Focalors (???): Furina... Furina...?
Furina: Huh? Who's that? Who's calling me? Where are you?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Be not nervous. Be not afraid. I am before you.
Furina: W—W—Wait a moment! You're... mirror-me? How can this be?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Hmmm. "Mirror-you," huh? You know what? That's not bad. Let's go with that.
Furina: "Mirror-me"... Wh—What do you wish to say?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): The "prophecy"... Have you heard of it?
Furina: What prophecy...? Oh, wait. I know — I think. I don't know why, but it's... in my head somehow...
Furina: "The people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne. Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away."
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Oh, very good. You know it well.
Furina: What's... going on? I can't seem to remember... anything clearly. The only thing I know for sure is this prophecy... Will it really come to pass?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Yes, it will, and that is why I've come to you. Disaster will come to Fontaine sooner or later. Things will develop just as the prophecy declared — there is no escaping it.
Furina: But... Doesn't that mean everyone will die? I'm a Fontainian just like them — will I dissolve too?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Hehehe... Don't worry. Magical meetings exist in this world precisely to give people a chance to turn things around. It is the reason why you met me today.
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): I will tell you how to save everyone, but... you may have to suffer somewhat...
Furina: O—Oh, so there's still hope after all? Goodness, you frightened me — you spoke so much, and with so much certainty...
Furina: As for the suffering... Well, I will admit that the first thing that came to mind was, "Why do I have to be the one to suffer?"...
Furina: But if the prophecy will come true, I'll also die anyway, right? So if I've already met you as my magical meeting in this world...
Furina: If there were scales, with all the people of Fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other... Is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Hehe... You truly are the perfect human — my "ideal."
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): I suppose this would also be the "justice" that belongs to you.
Furina: Huh...?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Don't worry, it's nothing. Listen well. Fontaine has just lost its Hydro Archon. I need you to "play" a role — that of the new Archon.
Furina: Play as... a god?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): That's right. You must begin a never-ending masquerade. You must never let anyone suspect your identity...
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): If you can keep it up, then I shall have my way of defying this prophecy... But should your identity be revealed, then all hope will be lost.
Furina: But... how will I do this? A human assuming the role of a god without being exposed...
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Don't worry. What you must do is not to turn yourself into a real god. You simply need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be.
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Being a human yourself, I'm sure you already know what such an entity would be like.
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): Remember, your true challenge will not be pursuing "divinity," but contending against "humanity."
Furina: Um... I'm still not sure I understand, but... I'll try. I'll try to do this.
Furina: So, how long am I going to have to play this role?
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): To accomplish this mission, you will have to stay on the stage for many, many years. You will endure and not grow old until your task ends.
Focalors (Person in the Mirror): But I promise you... all will eventually end in a magnificent and dramatic trial, and everyone will be saved.
Furina: A trial, huh... How exciting. I'll be looking forward to it.
Black Screen Text: Scene 2, Accession Speech, Furina

## Talk 6

Furina: (Phew. The Maison Cardinalice has announced my accession, but this is my first time facing the people...)
Furina: (What should I say... to most appear like a god? To be honest, I still don't know. Perhaps I should first try to act natural...)
Furina: Summon Courage
Furina: *cough* Um, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the Opera Epiclese.
Furina: I'm sure you've all heard about how I have taken on the role of Hydro Archon. Indeed, I am Furina de Fontaine, your new Archon.
Furina: Appear Earnest
Furina: In truth, I know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
Furina: As the god Focalors — the God of Justice — I shall do all within my power to lead you into an age of fairness and justice.
Furina: Close Politely
Furina: Once again, thank you all for coming. If you should have any questions or suggestions, please send them to the Maison Cardinalice — the future of Fontaine will require us to work together, after all.
Furina: (This... should do it.)
Furina: (I thought I might stammer, but thankfully, I was able to convey my thoughts just fine. Okay, and next...)
Questioning Audience Member: That's the new Hydro Archon? Is this some kind of joke by the Maison? I would've thought that a being that surpasses humanity would be a bit more... assertive...
Jeering Audience Member: Hey, did you hear that? She even told us to send her suggestions there at the end...
Frustrated Audience Member: Shouldn't gods be all-powerful? She's being so modest... What's the difference between her and an ordinary person, then?
Skeptical Audience Member: If you ask me... Perhaps the succession didn't actually happen. She might just be a Maison-backed puppet!
Furina: (Wait, what's going on? Why is everyone suspecting me of being a fake? Oh, this is bad. If I get exposed here... there'll be no saving the people from the prophecy...)
Furina: (Right! "Mirror-me" said that I just need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be...)
Furina: (Calm down, Furina... Think. Think. What do the people want? How would they imagine a god to speak and act?)
Furina: (Assertive, with a strong sense of presence, one who can dispel all doubt... That is the character I'm fated to play...)
Furina: ...
Furina: Hahahaha! ...Very good, my people. Only ones such as you are deserving of my rule.
Furina: Now, I was wondering — if some weak puppet were to one day come onto the stage and claim ownership of this opera house, would the children of Fontaine follow them?
Furina: ...Well! It seems that you would all see right through them. Having passed my test, you are qualified to witness wondrous trials alongside my august self, here in this opera house!
Furina: You may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. I thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
Furina: Now then, let us be re-introduced!
Eureka-Moment Audience Member: Ah, so that was just a performance! How could I have forgotten that we were inside an opera house?
Agreeing Audience Member: Such personality! It's quite shocking, to be honest, but I suppose it's a better look than before...
Delighted Audience Member: Such a fascinating and bold deity. How wonderful! Our future may yet be bright after all...
Furina: (It seems I've turned them around. Best follow this flow and restart my accession speech...)
Furina: Summon Courage
Furina: Resolutely, with Conviction
Furina: My dear people. Whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, I say to you — keep faith in your ardor for justice!
Furina: We have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. Well, I say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
Furina: Appear Earnest
Furina: Turn up the Drama
Furina: (No, this won't work... They'll suspect me again. I must play the role that they want me to play.)
Furina: The scales of justice should not weigh heavy in the hands of its god. On one side, it must carry fairness and justice, and on the other, praise and applause.
Furina: May law be the prayer on our lips. May judgment be our worship. Let us light the fires, and drink to the future of Fontaine!
Furina: Close Politely
Furina: End the Speech Emphatically
Furina: (No, this won't work... They'll suspect me again. I must play the role that they want me to play.)
Furina: There is no trouble in this world that justice cannot solve. All that is needed is for you, my people, to believe in it, heart and soul.
Furina: So long as I, the Archon Focalors, stand within the Opera Epiclese... so long as I stand before the Oratrice... I shall even judge the gods of this world!
Eureka-Moment Audience Member (Audience): (Whoops and cheers from the audience)

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: Scene 3, Opera House, Furina
Unknown Voice: Lady Furina, here are today's case reports as well as a summary of the follow-up, for your perusal...
Furina: *sigh* Come now, was I not just at the opera house in person? Leave these kinds of things to Neuvillette.
Furina: Besides, none of these trials were the one that I'm looking forward to the most...
Unknown Voice: Um, if I may be so impertinent... What kind of trial are you truly looking forward to?
Furina: A magnificent, dramatic, and wondrous trial, a trial to end all things... Ah, how could you hope to understand...
Unknown Voice: That's true... I... fear I lack the ability to grasp your divine thought, Lady Archon...
Furina: No need for fright, and do not take what I said before too seriously. Go now, to your duties. The trial I await... it will come one day.

## Talk 8

Unknown Voice: Lady Furina! I... I don't know what to say... Thank you for agreeing to see me!
Furina: No need to thank me. Rather, thank your own sense of perseverance instead. Long have you stood in line to meet me, have you not?
Furina: Hahaha... I'm afraid that's just an inevitable consequence of my divine charm.
Furina: Alright. Deoteria, is it? How is your son's illness?
Unknown Voice: Ah, y—you... remembered me, and you knew of my family, too...
Unknown Voice: He is doing much better now. In fact, he is far more of an ardent believer than I. He was the one who forced me to seek an audience with you, and to bring your words back to him...
Furina: Haha... Good, very good. If this should happen again in the future, please do not hesitate to come and tell me. Going down to citizens' homes every so often, while not usual practice, should serve as a fine change of pace...
Unknown Voice: Ah, you're such a gentle and wise god. Thank you, once again, on behalf of my son...

## Talk 9

Unknown Voice: Lady Furina, here are the latest hydrological reports. As for the specific parameters you asked us to take note of... I'm afraid things still don't look good.
Furina: I see. It's as I thought, then. As your god, I did already expect this, but I wanted to see how far your human wisdom would allow you to analyse it.
Furina: All manner of signs indicate that the prophecy will still come to pass... Forget it, that's not something you need to worry about right now.
Unknown Voice: Hmm... Well, as I understand it, the Fontaine Research Institute is also trying to find a way to counter the rising water levels...
Furina: Really? Have they found anything?
Unknown Voice: I'm afraid that they haven't found any effective solutions thus far.
Furina: *cough* Ahem, is that so? Well, no wonder. This issue has reached the realm of the gods, after all. Still, their spirit is praiseworthy.

## Talk 10

Furina: ...
Furina: (So interminable... so lonely... Just how much longer...)
Furina: (Hundreds of years must have passed by now. Perhaps this show must go on for hundreds more...)
Furina: (I never imagined that it would hurt so much...)
Furina: (Have I... reached my limit? No, perhaps I reached it long ago. Today, I didn't even notice my own tears.)
Furina: (I want to tell someone, anyone, about this... But would that not destroy all I've done so far?)
Furina: (I've conducted so many investigations across the centuries, but there's not even a sliver of hope that we might break the prophecy...)
Furina: (All I can do is keep heart. I must maintain this act. It is the only way to save Fontaine. Please, "Mirror-me." You have to succeed...)
Black Screen Text: Scene 182376, Opera House, Furina, and...
Traveler: Furina... You don't have to shoulder this burden alone.
Traveler: Although I don't know what you might be keeping from everyone... Your people are more than willing to share your burden with you.
Traveler: (That's... my voice? Is this scene... from when we were within that Giant Magic Box?)
Traveler: (This is great... I didn't think that this scene would replay in her inner world. Surely, I'll find out what she wanted to tell me this time.)
Furina: Share my burden...
Furina: That's impossible. It was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
Traveler: But even if your burden doesn't need to be shared... you can still choose to confide in someone.
Traveler: Just share it with me. I'm what you'd call a "witness."
Furina: A witness... Ah, yes. I've heard that you came to Teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? In other words, you never belonged here...
Furina: And if Teyvat is, in its entirety, a show on a stage, then you're just a "spectator," aren't you?
Furina: If that's the case...
Furina: #({F#She}{M#He}'s right. I could confide in {F#her}{M#him}, couldn't I?)
Furina: (But... If things don't play out as expected, the people of Fontaine will be the ones to pay the price...!)
Furina: (No, Furina. You shouldn't be selfish...)
Furina: (...)
Furina: (But what if... what if it's really alright?)
Furina: (Furina, you've worked so hard for so, so long. Surely it would be okay to put yourself first for once... just this once?)
Furina: (Is it such an outrageous thing to do, anyway? To find someone in whom you can confide your frustrations and sorrows? Surely, it could not hurt?)
Furina: (If you let this opportunity slip through your fingers, it might never come by again.)
Furina: (Think about it long and hard...)
Furina: ...
Traveler: ...
Furina: No, I have nothing to say. I am Furina, the Archon of Fontaine! Everything will surely get better!
Furina: All you need to do, dear spectator, is to witness my performance until the curtains fall.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...Fine.

## Talk 11

Neuvillette: So even Furina doesn't know the truth? You've never once let her in on the full plan?
Focalors: Yes. It had to be done. To deceive the Heavenly Principles, you must first deceive yourself.
Focalors: She did very well. If she had let her resolve falter even once in these five centuries, Fontaine would have been doomed to the most tragic fate.
Focalors: It seems that "trusting humanity" was the right decision, after all.
Neuvillette: I believe that I understand how your deception works... but that is only half the truth, is it not?
Neuvillette: How would you build on this foundation to save the people of Fontaine? That is the most important thing.
Focalors: Ah, good, good. Of course the Iudex of Fontaine has pinpointed the crux of the issue.
Focalors: I'm sure you've long sensed that the Oratrice is no simple machine, yes?
Neuvillette: I've always suspected that it had its own consciousness, and Lyney did mention that he heard a "human voice" within the core chamber...
Neuvillette: It now seems that that "person" was you, hidden within the machine all along. Am I right?
Focalors: And then I "became one" with the Oratrice, taking Fontaine's Gnosis with me... Yes, it would seem so, wouldn't it?
Focalors: Alas, your understanding of this device still lacks sufficient depth.
Focalors: In truth, it is no enactor of justice... It is, in fact, a device created to kill the God of Justice.
Neuvillette: ...I beg your pardon?
Focalors: Oh, you have it — and to be more precise, not only will the Oratrice take down the God of Justice, it will also take down the divine throne upon which she has been placed.
Focalors: Hehe, I mean, did you think I would be the sort to enjoy peaceful repose while Furina suffered?
Focalors: My work over these last five hundred years... has been to constantly accumulate Indemnitium within the Oratrice.
Focalors: But really, some have already discovered that only a small fraction of the energy generated by the device was ever used to provide power to Fontaine...
Focalors: The vast majority has been — had to be — accumulated... to enact this death sentence.
Neuvillette: It was all a part of your plan, then — both the trial and the sentence...
Focalors: Indeed. This power, accrued over five centuries, could have sustained Fontainians for millennia had it only been used for that purpose. Almost all of it has now been stored within the Oratrice...
Focalors: But only power of this magnitude could hope to destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, shaking the rules established by Celestia and breaking through the institution that is The Seven.
Neuvillette: So, the Oratrice's call for death was for neither Furina nor Focalors, but for the Hydro Archon...
Neuvillette: The destruction of that divine throne... If I do not misunderstand your intent, you must be...
Focalors: Returning what's rightfully yours to you, of course!
Focalors: In other words, this was all done to return the authority of the Hydro Archon to the Hydro Dragon of this planet.
Neuvillette: But...
Focalors: What? Getting sad again, are we?
Focalors: The authority of the ancient dragons shall soon be yours once more, O Hydro Dragon Sovereign, and this is the face you make? Hehe...
Neuvillette: All you've done throughout the years... is just so you can sacrifice yourself at the very end?
Focalors: I've never quite seen it that way, you know. Even now, I'm quite pleased at how well my deception worked, hehe.
Neuvillette: ...
Focalors: "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry."
Focalors: I must say, had it been within my rights, I would have loved to judge the Heavenly Principles themselves. Were they not guilty of essentially the same crime?
Focalors: Egeria stole the power of the Primordial Sea, and the Heavenly Principles stole the power you ancient dragons possessed.
Focalors: I, for my part, am the God of Justice. And is it not just that your original powers should be returned to you?
Focalors: Speaking of justice, I have always believed that justice lies in the process of pursuing human existence itself.
Focalors: So if the theft of the Primordial Sea's might was Fontaine's "original sin"...
Focalors: Then, leaving matters of procedural right and wrong aside, the descent of the Fontainians as humans and their right to exist in this world... would be Fontaine's "original justice."
Focalors: In other words, "existence" was Egeria's justice... and to me, justice is the "continuation" of that existence.
Focalors: Defying the prophecy and ensuring that Fontaine's people shall live on — that should be the justice enthroned over all others.
Focalors: At this point, we — whether it be myself, or all other Fontainians — have shouldered the burden of this "sin" for far too long.
Focalors: Iudex Neuvillette, the highest judge in our land... When you regain your full power as an elemental sovereign, what verdict shall you pass upon us?
Neuvillette: So, when I was invited to the Court of Fontaine to serve as Iudex... I see now that that was your idea, too.
Neuvillette: At last, I now understand the true purpose behind this position.
Neuvillette: In the beginning, I was uninterested in human existence, but these five centuries of living alongside them have gradually brought about mutual understanding between us, and I have even attempted to feel as they feel...
Neuvillette: You are a devious one, Focalors.
Neuvillette: Things being as they are... Surely you know that I could never declare them to be "guilty."

## Talk 12

Neuvillette: ...
Navia: What just happened? Has the death sentence been carried out?
Lyney: Was that bright light some sort of misdirection? I have a feeling that something huge just happened.
Lynette: But since we're all still alive and haven't been dissolved, I assume whatever happened was good for us.
Neuvillette: It's time to end this. We must mete out punishment to that beast.
Paimon: But didn't you say just a moment ago that it can't be defeated?
Neuvillette: I have gained the strength sufficient to deal with it. Through... certain means, I now have the ability to separate the power of the Primordial Sea from that creature.
Neuvillette: We should seize the opportunity to pursue our quarry.
Traveler: You obtained power?
Neuvillette: #Traveler, now that the Oratrice can no longer function, I require an "executor" to help me mete out justice.
Traveler: You... You mean me?
Neuvillette: The root of the calamities befalling Fontaine, the beast that enacts the prophecy... Its name is the All-Devouring Narwhal.
Neuvillette: ...Come with me, Traveler. The hour of execution has come.
Traveler: Just now?

## Talk 13

Traveler: (That's all the spotlights turned off. In Furina's heart, they must have symbolized the eyes of the people on her.)
Traveler: (Speaking of which, I think I just received some sort of signal. Was that her true voice?)
Traveler: (Hmm...? A ticket? When did that end up here?)
Traveler: (Either way, looks like the show is about to begin. In that case, show me how you truly feel, Furina.)
Black Screen Text: Scene 1, Before a Mirror, Furina

## Talk 14

Skirk (???): Thanks for helping with the "cleanup." It should've been my job, but... Oh well.
Skirk (???): It was just supposed to be a short private training session for me... I didn't think that my disciple and my master's pet would start brawling in the meantime.
Skirk (???): Well, actually, I had a feeling that it would happen at some point, but they bumped into one another earlier than I'd thought. What a blunder... I suppose I'll have to swing my sword three million times as penance.
Traveler: Disciple...?
Neuvillette: That power... Who are you, exactly?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon has an idea... From what she said earlier, she must be Childe's master... Skirk, right?
Paimon: It's just that he gave us the impression that she was a less... talkative person.
Skirk: I simply did not have anything to say to the weak. But you, on the other hand, managed to defeat the All-Devouring Narwhal without using "power from beyond this world"...
Skirk: So you may speak to me as equals.
Traveler: What sort of person...
Skirk: I have to agree. It's a strange use of a planet's primordial waters just to raise an All-Devouring Narwhal.
Skirk: That kind of power is wasted on it. It's not cooperative, it eats too much... and I have more important things to do with my time than pet-sitting. The only thing that creature has going for it is its looks.
Skirk: All in all, it fails as a pet.
Paimon: ...Uh, Miss Skirk, I think you might have missed the point.
Skirk: The point being?
Paimon: Well, being that this "pet" almost destroyed an entire nation...
Paimon: So, what sort of person is your master — well, Childe's master's master? ...Is that right?
Skirk: Ah, right, so you don't know him... Sorry, I assumed you did.
Skirk: His name is Surtalogi.
Traveler: Who?
Paimon: Huh?
Neuvillette: I am unfamiliar with that name.
Skirk: Huh. So Master is insufficiently famous. Hmm, how should I describe him, then... Have you heard of the name... "The Foul"?
Neuvillette: "The Foul"...
Skirk: Still nothing? Well, how about "The Visionary," Vedrfolnir then? Or "Gold," Rhinedottir?
Paimon: Ooh, that one we've heard! Rhinedottir's part of the Hexenzirkel — she's Albedo's mom, right?
Skirk: Ah, so you do know that name. To be honest, I also heard all of those names and titles from my Master. I don't actually know them either.
Skirk: But I suppose you understand now, yes? My Master is likely a similar sort to Rhinedottir — they are both "pursuing some form of perfection."
Paimon: Wait. Didn't you also mention a... "Visionary" person? Paimon didn't quite catch their name...
Skirk: Actually, never mind that. I believe it expedient to inform you...
Skirk: That the All-Devouring Narwhal used up nearly all its strength fighting you.
Skirk: Such roiling Hydro energies will prove difficult for the planet's deep seas to digest.
Skirk: As such, the Fontaine back on the surface has most likely been thrown into chaos.
Skirk: In other words, the prophecy that you have been fretting over should now be in full swing.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: No...
Traveler: (It is natural, after all. The prophecy will surely come true. We knew this... and accepted it.)
Traveler: (However...)
Neuvillette: Not to worry. Focalors has... already managed to deceive the Heavenly Principles.
Traveler: ...There's little to be surprised about, Paimon.
Traveler: ...Would take the All-Devouring Narwhal as a pet?
Traveler: Your master's pet?

## Talk 15

Furina: Oh? Who permitted you to come onto this stage? Now, I understand your admiration for my august self, but I must ask you to keep to the rules.
Traveler: Come on, it's me.
Furina: Alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. There is no need to state your name. Just be off with you — do not distract me from my performance.
Traveler: But...
Furina: Hah. Do not jest. Can you not feel it?
Furina: I am Focalors. The eyes of countless Fontainians are upon me. I must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
Traveler: (Something's off. There's no getting through to her — even in her heart of hearts, she's still "playing" the role of the Hydro Archon...)
Traveler: (What sort of resolve must she have that even her inner self and subconscious would have such an impenetrable defense?)
Traveler: (I have to find a way...)
Traveler: I don't see an audience here?
Traveler: Uh... Furina?
