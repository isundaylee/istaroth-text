# The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hee-hehe, Paimon's a Fungi-naming expert! Every one of these will sound really cool when you call them out in the arena!
Traveler: The names you came up with for the second Fungus...
Paimon: The round hat on this little guy's head kinda looks like a drum, don't ya think? The first thing that came to Paimon's mind when she saw it was... If you hit it on the head, it's definitely gonna go "bing bong"! Hmm... How does the name "Bongo-Head" sound?
Traveler: Hmm, I think "bing bong" is optimistic.
Paimon: But look how happy it looks! That means it likes the name. Okay then! Bongo-Head it is!
Paimon: Aw, Bongo-Head's just like a little puppy... Paimon's never seen this side of a Fungus before.
Paimon: From now on, we need to look out for each other, Bongo-Head!
Paimon: Okay, let's go catch some more Fungi and make a team for Bongo-Head!
Traveler: Probably more like a "squelch."
Traveler: All three suggestions were the same...

## Talk 2

Haniyyah: This is where you'll capture your Fungi. The Fungi in this area are highly compatible with the Wisdom Orb, and they're ideal for training and competing with.
Haniyyah: The Wisdom Orb can capture and store Fungi. It also serves as a controller.
Haniyyah: I recommend giving each Fungus a code name to make commanding them easier. For example, this one next to me is Pyro-1, which means "Pyro Fungus No. 1."
Paimon: You just go off their element and then number them? Hmm, seems kinda boring to Paimon... Uhh, this Fungus looks pretty lively. Why don't we call it "Bouncy Happyshroom"?
Traveler: Paimon is the best at coming up with names.
Haniyyah: Uh... Thanks, but no thanks. I've got my own way of naming them and I'm gonna stick with it. It's simple, straightforward. It helps me with managing them.
Paimon: Yeah, you're probably used to calling it Pyro-1 anyway... Alright, we'll stop, but wait until you hear the great names we come up with for our Fungi! You might want to reconsider then.
Traveler: I also have some suggestions if you're interested.

## Talk 3

Kautilya: Welcome, contestants, to the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament! I am Kautilya, a senior Amurta researcher and the organizer of today's tournament.
Kautilya: I'm sure you're probably all very intrigued by the idea of fighting Fungi and excited at the prospect of our amazing prizes. But at the same time, you may well have some concerns about the safety of this tournament.
Kautilya: Worry not! The Wisdom Orb we've developed exclusively for this event makes use of Amurta's most advanced "Intellectual Boost" technology. It is absolutely reliable and safe!
Kautilya: So please, cast your reservations aside and enter the tournament with confidence!
Kautilya: Also, it gives me great pleasure to announce that this event is sponsored by Mr. Elchingen, a renowned businessman from Fontaine who has generously provided a grand total of sixty million Mora for our prize fund!
Kautilya: And if anyone is able to prove themselves capable of carrying out Mr. Elchingen's philosophy by passing the Ultimate Trial, he will be willing to give to them his entire fortune!
Kautilya: The only other condition is that the winner must agree to carry on Mr. Elchingen's legacy by hosting the "Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament" in the future...
Paimon: Whoa! Paimon can't believe that rich guy threw sixty million Mora at this event, just like that! And, what was all that about inheriting his entire fortune if you promise to keep his beast-taming tournament going...?
Paimon: Also, hosted by an Akademiya scholar, huh? Whoa, pretty official. Uh, might be a little inappropriate if we just barged in and tried to shut it down...
Paimon: So, um... Why don't we enter the tournament and see if this "Wisdom Orb" thingy actually works?
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: No, that's not it! It's just... now that everything in Sumeru has finally settled down, don't you think it'd be a little unfair to Nahida if we keep picking trouble with the Akademiya?
Paimon: And he sounded really confident. Paimon's curious about how this mysterious Fungi-taming device works!
Traveler: And what if it works really well?
Paimon: Although they've caused us trouble in the past, the Fungi aren't just aggressive monsters, right? They're more like... wild animals with bad tempers.
Paimon: Since there's no longer any safety concerns, we don't need to worry. Maybe we can even try becoming friends with the Fungi! Paimon thinks that would be fun!
Paimon: Besides, if we do well in the tournament, we'll be able to earn some extra Mora. There are basically no drawbacks!
Traveler: Alright, let's see what all the fuss is about then...
Paimon: Yep! That's the way we roll!
Paimon: Looks like we sign up over there. C'mon, let's grab a Wisdom Orb and enter the tournament!
Traveler: But we should stay cautious, just in case...
Traveler: What will you do to the Fungi?
Traveler: You just want the prize money, don't you?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, looks like the people ahead of us are still signing up. Let's wait our turn.
Haniyyah: #Golden Comet {NICKNAME} and Silver Companion... So. You're competing too?
Paimon: Huh? You know us? But... what's with those names? We've never heard them before...
Haniyyah: You're a tough duo, if the posters are to be believed. Some mercenaries who managed to escape from you painted your portraits, warning others to avoid messing with you at all costs.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't know whether to be flattered or to try and explain that we aren't as scary as the rumors suggest...
Haniyyah: Unfortunately, the rules of this tournament state that beast tamers aren't allowed to use their weapons, or even fight each other directly. Your impeccable combat skills won't be any use to you here.
Haniyyah: The tournament is about capturing Fungi, training them, and commanding them in combat. There's no way of knowing whether commanding Fungi is a skill you'll be able to master in time.
Paimon: That's true... We've never captured a Fungus before, and wouldn't know anything about how to get them to fight.
Paimon: Wait a second, you don't look like a staff member. What are you lecturing us for? Who are you anyway?
Haniyyah: The name's Haniyyah. I used to work for the Eremites, taming grumpy Sumpter Beasts. Ended up with a reputation for being a beast tamer, so they got me involved with testing the Wisdom Orb early on.
Haniyyah: Anyway, my name ain't worth remembering — I'm just an illiterate nobody, all I'm good for is doing odd jobs for Eremite mercs. Just think of me as another contestant.
Haniyyah: I do have a lot of experience taming beasts, though. Want me to teach you?
Traveler: You want to team up with us?
Haniyyah: You guys are worth me getting to know — as allies or opponents, 'cause either way, you can get rid of some obstacles for me in this competition. Of course, I'd prefer allies if possible.
Paimon: Well, that was blunt... but also quite honest.
Paimon: It's definitely better to have an expert teach us than figure everything out on our own, right? What do you think, should we take her up on her offer?
Haniyyah: Alright then. Take this Wisdom Orb and let's go catch some Fungi at the designated area.
Paimon: She gets right to the point, doesn't she?
Traveler: You want to size us up?

## Talk 5

Haniyyah: Great, you've now collected all four Fungi. The next step is to use the "Floral Jelly" provided by the organizers to boost your Fungi's abilities. That way, they'll be able to unleash powerful skills during combat...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe we're making progress so quickly. It's all thanks to your help, Haniyyah! Alright, let's all return to the arena now...
Paimon: Huh? Look, someone's staggering along with a Fungus running circles around her... Is she being attacked?
Paimon: She's collapsed! Let's go see what's happening!
Layla: *whimper*... I can't go on... too weak...
Paimon: Are you hurt? How bad is it?
Traveler: Watch out!
Haniyyah: Pyro-1, take it out!
Layla: Wait... it's not an enemy! It's my shroom buddy!
Layla: I'm j—just a little too tired to walk right now... But I still need to find three more shroom buddies to qualify for the tournament...
Traveler: "Shroom buddies"?
Paimon: You mean... you're a contestant too?
Layla: I wasn't counting on running into other contestants here... Maybe this is the end of the road for me. Twirly-Whirly on its own is no match for you...
Layla: Look after Twirly-Whirly for me... take him with you to the top!
Paimon: Hey, don't give up! It's not like we're a bunch of Eremites trying to steal your Fungi... uh, your shroom buddies. We're better than that!
Paimon: You should at least hang in there until we're in the arena, so we can compete against each other properly!
Paimon: Haniyyah over here is a professional beast tamer. And despite knowing that we might be her fiercest competitors, she still gave us lots of help and advice!
Haniyyah: ...Was that supposed to be a compliment?
Traveler: Take it as a compliment.
Paimon: State your name and mission! Golden Comet and Silver Companion shall gladly come to your aid!
Layla: R—Really? Then... could you please help me collect the rest of the four shroom buddies I need? Does this mean my luck is finally starting to change...?
Layla: Um... my name is Layla. I'm just a student in the Rtawahist Darshan, so I don't have any impressive titles or anything... And my goal is to, uh... to make it into the quarterfinals.
Layla: If I can make it to the quarterfinals, I'll get to take my shroom buddies home and delegate some of my physical labor to them. Of course, I'll take good care of them too.
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon read that in the rules somewhere. All quarter-finalists get to take home any Fungi of their choice...
Paimon: But, what do you mean, "physical labor"? You're a student. Shouldn't you be busy with coursework and writing papers?
Layla: Aah, this is pretty embarrassing, but uh... so I must have some sort of congenital sleep disorder or something, 'cause I can never seem to get enough sleep, and I'm always really low on energy.
Layla: Even the smallest amount of exercise makes me... Well, you saw me just now. I get so tired, I collapse from exhaustion. So when I said "physical labor"... I just meant basic stuff like moving books around or fetching things I need from the store...
Paimon: #Ah, you don't need to be embarrassed about that, it's totally normal! Paimon delegates chores to {NICKNAME} all the time.
Haniyyah: First she calls them "buddies," then she talks about wanting to live with them... Ridiculous. She sounds just like Elchingen.
Traveler: (I wonder what Haniyyah's so annoyed about?)
Haniyyah: Well. Looks like you've mastered everything already, and moved on to helping others. I'm delighted for you.
Haniyyah: I'll see you around. Good luck.
Paimon: Huh? Why is Haniyyah leaving all of a sudden?
Paimon: We haven't thanked you or Pyro-1 yet, Haniyyah! Let's at least go get something to eat together...
Layla: What's wrong? That beast tamer, is she... angry?
Paimon: Hmm... probably not? She's pretty blunt and doesn't make a great first impression, but she's definitely not a bad person! Otherwise, why would she have helped us?
Traveler: Maybe she has something urgent to do...
Paimon: Yeah, we'll see her again, and when we do, let's give her some gifts to show her our gratitude!
Paimon: In the meantime, let's follow her example by doing our best in the tournament, helping other contestants, and making sure Layla gets to compete!
Layla: Thank you so much! I'll try my best to contribute, too. I don't want to be a burden to you guys.
Black Screen Text: You help Layla find three more shroom buddies to complete her set...
Paimon: Nicely done! Now that we've put together Layla's team, she should be eligible to take part. Let's head back to the arena and confirm with them.
Traveler: We'll see her again at the tournament...
Traveler: Paimon's really getting into this.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Let Paimon see how the qualifying rounds are looking... Great! We're in a different group from Layla, so we won't have to compete against each other in the early stages of the competition!
Layla: Actually... I hope I don't have to fight you guys in the later stages, either...
Yae Miko: Oh? Hello there, little ones.
Yae Miko: Sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. You two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
Paimon: M—Miko? What are you doing here? Is Paimon hallucinating?
Yae Miko: Hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in Inazuma. They even handed out flyers in front of Yae Publishing House.
Yae Miko: Don't you think a tournament like this makes a perfect candidate for light novel treatment?
Traveler: It does seem like a good place to find source material.
Yae Miko: Yae Publishing House is working on a bestseller that, if all goes to plan, will stay a bestseller for the next fifty years. The theme is "friendship and rivalry," so we decided to bring our up-and-coming author, Souka here, to gather some inspiration.
Yae Miko: I, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. So, I will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
Yae Miko: Here's my little partner in crime. Souka named it "Blitzara" — I think it's rather good. Very distinctive.
Paimon: Who knew there'd be such a big turnout? Even Miko's here...
Yae Miko: Souka, come say hi to the little ones. They are set to be some of the fiercest competition you face in the tournament. You should put them in your novel as major characters.
Souka: Yes, Chief Editor!
Souka: For the s—sake of my readership, I... w—won't back down! I'll b—b—beat... b—beat you!
Traveler: See you in the arena!
Paimon: Yeah! Just 'cause you're with Miko doesn't mean we'll go easy on you!
Yae Miko: Ooh, yes, more of that! Do you feel that, Souka? Declaring a challenge to your arch-enemy-in-the-making before the competition begins is a key plot device that helps build dramatic tension.
Souka: I—I wouldn't say I'm feeling that, exactly! J—Just thinking about competing against Her Excellency's Hanamizaka tour confidante is m—making me so nervous, I'm losing my, m—my, my m—mind...
Yae Miko: Hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. This'll make excellent source material, too.
Layla: She's... terrifying... but she also seems really dedicated to her craft. I hope we can be friends.
Yae Miko: And who is this softly spoken little lady?
Paimon: She's our new friend, Layla. We met her while we were out capturing Fungi.
Paimon: Layla's entering the tournament 'cause she wants to take her trained Fungi back home to live with her. Her goal is to make it to the quarterfinals!
Yae Miko: Training Fungi... and then domesticating them?
Yae Miko: How fascinating... You must be full of secrets. There's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
Yae Miko: I'm Yae Miko, a light novel editor — purely out of personal interest, and right now, what I'm most interested in is you... Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine.
Layla: Uhh... I have no idea how to respond to that...
Layla: Traveler, Paimon, I really appreciate all your help!
Layla: But, I wanna get to know my four shroom buddies a little better and prepare for the qualifiers, so... I'll go do some training now!
Paimon: Don't push yourself too hard, Layla! You'll end up collapsing from exhaustion again!
Paimon: Miko, what are you doing, scaring our new friend off like that!
Yae Miko: Oh? Am I really so terrifying? Well then, I'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up...
Yae Miko: But that can wait... Judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
Traveler: What are you really doing in Sumeru?
Yae Miko: I'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. Unfortunately though... it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
Kautilya: Guuji Yae! What an honor to finally meet you! We're so privileged that our tournament is your first destination in Sumeru!
Paimon: Huh? Isn't that the organizer? And that super-rich businessman is here too...
Yae Miko: Goodness, I presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? Otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
Kautilya: How you jest, Guuji Yae! Those such as your esteemed self deserve nothing short of the most lavish reception Sumeru has to offer.
Kautilya: I see you've already had the chance to try out the Wisdom Orb? What are your thoughts on the future prospects of this technology? You know, with your blessing, it can be introduced into Inazuma, allowing you to swiftly resolve the situation of—
Yae Miko: Ahem... Right now, I am nothing but an ordinary editor-in-chief. I'm here to enjoy my vacation and gather some inspiration along the way, and if I can at all help it, I'd rather not concern myself with such weighty topics as the future fate of nascent technologies...
Elchingen: Don't be so pushy, Mr. Kautilya. Droning on about the Akademiya's business ambitions is hardly respectful to our honored guest who has traveled all the way from the Land of Thunder to be here.
Elchingen: Not to mention that Guuji Yae is busy catching up with her friends. I daresay it was both unnecessary and discourteous to interrupt their conversation like this.
Yae Miko: A most pertinent remonstration coming from you, Mr. Elchingen. You do conduct yourself in such an unobtrusive manner... much as you have in your entire career, quietly amassing an enormous fortune while remaining almost entirely unknown...
Elchingen: Why, to hear such high praise from the great Guuji Yae is more prestige than I could ever hope for. Please, should you require anything at all, do not hesitate to seek my assistance. I will do everything within my ability to make your stay in Sumeru an enjoyable one.
Elchingen: Also... To have the renowned Traveler here at the tournament is an unexpected delight. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you in action.
Traveler: Um... Thank you...?
Paimon: Miko, they're here to do business with you, right? Should you really be turning them away like this? Especially the rich guy? Paimon thinks working with him could have a lot of advantages for Yae Publishing House...
Yae Miko: Promoting an entirely new event throughout all of Teyvat so rapidly would be an impossible feat for any ordinary businessman. I, for one, do not wish for Yae Publishing House to be the subordinate partner in a business relationship with him.
Yae Miko: Besides, the tournament has only just begun. Who knows whether it will go on to be a success? I want to focus on trying to enjoy myself, while keeping one eye open for potential liabilities.
Traveler: Potential liabilities...
Yae Miko: Fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. Letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
Paimon: So it wasn't just us! Yeah, we started out with some safety concerns about this event, but the Wisdom Orb seems pretty amazing!
Paimon: At least, all the Fungi we used it on have been very well-behaved, like our Bongo-Head here. Seems we don't need to be too nervous after all.
Yae Miko: Oh, Paimon, you're just as carefree and enthusiastic as ever. Well, it's about time for me to get into character. As a contestant, I need to go and get ready for the tournament...
Yae Miko: See you in the qualifiers. Blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
Paimon: Coming here was a great idea! Look at us, making new friends, bumping into Miko... This competition is shaping up to be a whole lot of fun!
Paimon: Come on, let's go get some Floral Jelly for Bongo-Head's training, like Haniyyah suggested!
Traveler: So you've noticed.
Traveler: What's going on behind the scenes of this tournament?
Traveler: There are lots of stories you could tell about this.

## Talk 7

Balfour: Ah, the champions-to-be, here at long last! Come on now, use the Floral Jelly and awaken your Fungi's true potential!
Paimon: Champions-to-be? Hehe, thanks for the compliment! So you've heard about us too?
Balfour: Of course, I was standing right next to you when you collected your Wisdom Orb. I couldn't find a convenient opportunity to introduce myself, as Haniyyah was busy explaining the tournament to you...
Balfour: With an expert mentor like Haniyyah, I'm sure you'll become excellent beast-tamers in no time!
Paimon: If even the staff are singing her praises, Haniyyah must really know what she's doing! Well, all the more reason to give it our all!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Look no further! The first ever Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament is about to begin! We anticipate your arrival!
Traveler: Training Fungi to fight each other?
Paimon: But Fungi are monsters! We can't let this go ahead! It's way too dangerous...
Paimon: Let's go check out the tournament. If it's as dangerous as it sounds, at least we'll be there to stop things from getting too out of control.
Traveler: That's a very unexpected mode of entertainment...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Balfour: Greetings, the two of you. Do you want to train your Fungi, or are you looking for someone to answer your questions?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We want to train Fungi.
Balfour: Okay, make sure to use the Floral Jelly according to the instructions in the recipe.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: The name, "Floral Jelly"...
Balfour: Ha, I know what you're gonna say!
Balfour: I hear that the Vahumana researchers studied manuscripts from all over Teyvat and came to the preliminary conclusion that using certain suffixes in a name makes it sound extremely cute. I have to say, I kinda agree!
Balfour: Kautilya repeatedly emphasized that his research is "glorious and ground-breaking," and that it needed a name that's out of this world... But Mr. Elchingen rejected all of his proposals.
Balfour: Mr. Elchingen believed that since most people find Fungi to be cute little creatures, it would only be fitting if the official names used in the competition followed suit.
Balfour: After several heated debates, the name "Floral Jelly" was retained, along with the easy-to-understand name, "Wisdom Orb."
Balfour: But Mr. Elchingen did let Kautilya decide the other names. It's a good thing that most of those names are only used to communicate with future collaborators and aren't used by the contestants.
Paimon: What's with this Kautilya guy? It seems like he's always trying to show off how amazing he is. It seems like he's really pushy.
Traveler: He shouldn't do that, even if he truly is amazing.
Balfour: You think so too, huh?
Balfour: He doesn't get along with many of the staff. Even Mr. Elchingen has to make compromises with him at times.
Balfour: If it weren't for his irreplaceable technology and Mr. Elchingen continuously comforting the staff... the team of organizers probably would've fallen apart a long time ago.
Balfour: It's obvious why Kautilya kept running into dead ends before Mr. Elchingen sponsored him financially.
Traveler: Elchingen is clearly more reasonable.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: About the competition...
Balfour: You can go and take a look at the promotion board if there's anything else you're unsure about!
Balfour: The staff will update the progression of the competition on the promotion board. I hear that they're planning to include interactive events as well. The events will begin once the popularity of the competition reaches a certain point.
Balfour: They might even start to sell a competition highlight "film" after the competition progresses to a certain point.
Traveler: What determines if the competition is popular enough...?
Paimon: That sounds like a pretty harsh requirement, don't you think? The competition venue isn't exactly outstanding. You sure it's gonna work?
Balfour: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that at all. The center of Sumeru commerce, Wikala Funduq, is right next to the arena, and the bridge to the harbor is not too far off either. Any traffic that moves through the area will definitely be able to see the venue.
Balfour: Besides, we've also put up a promotional poster on the bulletin board in Sumeru City. Many of the competitors and audience are here because they saw it.
Paimon: Ohh, we saw it too! So you were the one that put up the advertisement on that bulletin board!
Balfour: Haha, it's pretty good, right? I must say, writing marketing material is one of my strong suits!
Balfour: I'm doing some of the reporting for the competition too. I'll do my best to describe your performance excitedly!
Paimon: It feels like you're in charge of a lot of the work that's being done here. From managing the Floral Jelly and organizing the events to writing promotional material and reporting...
Balfour: Oh, it's nothing compared to the salary that Mr. Elchingen is paying me. I'm being paid ten times what I was making before... Ahem!
Balfour: Anyways, Mr. Elchingen said it best! He said that those capable should take on more responsibility. I'm more than willing to give my all to a boss like him.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: See you.
Balfour: I'll see you next time! Good luck!
