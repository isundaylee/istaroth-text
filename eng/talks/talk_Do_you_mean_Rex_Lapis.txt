Traveler: Do you mean Rex Lapis?
Jiu: Hah... That usurper?
Jiu: Humans... They care only about history since the dawn of the age of mankind...
Jiu: Are people really happy to just draw a line under the litany of atrocities humanity's ancestors are responsible for, call it "ye olde worlde," and just get on with their merry little lives?
Jiu: Well, I hope that anyone who willfully indulges in this fantasy world of false prosperity will be consumed by it, and thus get what they deserve.
