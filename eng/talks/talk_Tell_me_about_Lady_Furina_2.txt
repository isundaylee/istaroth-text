Traveler: Tell me about Lady Furina...
Moniotte: Although many have stopped referring to her as a deity, to me, Lady Furina will always be divine whenever she takes the stage.
Moniotte: Oh, when I heard that Lady Furina was to leave the opera house forever, I was so sad I shut myself away and never wanted to leave the house again...
Moniotte: But I knew that she, who will always be divine in my heart, would not be defeated by such a trivial setback! Ah, our beautiful Lady Furina... I can finally see you on the stage once more!
Moniotte: Her superb makeup, her gentle voice, her agile dance steps... Are they not worthy of a greater, more luxurious stage...?
