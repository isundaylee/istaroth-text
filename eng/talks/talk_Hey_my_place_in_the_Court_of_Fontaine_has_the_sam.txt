Charlotte: Hey, my place in the Court of Fontaine has the same furniture! But somehow, the sight of it has a weird way of making me sleepy...
Charlotte: Oh, I know what it is... There've been times in the past when I've worked pretty much around the clock trying to make a deadline, and I'd be constantly going back and forth between a bed and a chair that are the spitting image of these.
Charlotte: If it's okay with you, could I use this place as my secret writing chamber once in a while?
