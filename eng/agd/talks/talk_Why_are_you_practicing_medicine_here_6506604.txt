Traveler: Why are you practicing medicine here?
Areta: I used to be very poor, and I had no money to support my studies or travel overseas. It was the Spina di Rosula that sponsored me.
Areta: Of course, they did so on the condition that I consider returning here to work as a doctor after finishing my studies. I'd be salaried as is standard, of course â€” with the Spina being my employer.
Areta: I thought it was a good deal, and I understood what they wanted out of it. So I only ask for the most basic fees when I practice here.
