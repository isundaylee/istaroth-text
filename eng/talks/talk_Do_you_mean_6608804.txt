Traveler: Do you mean...
Akeor: Ohh, I mean the wisdom of the ancients!
Akeor: I've dug up a lot of treasures ever since I partnered up with this young lady from Sumeru. We're finding more and more useful tools.
Akeor: Have you ever seen a storage device that can compress phlogiston with three times the usual efficiency? With it equipped, my Saurian runs as fast as the wind, making chasing after monsters and carrying materials an absolute walk in the park!
Akeor: We haven't yet figured out how it works, but man it feels great to use. Miss Tahmures has said that we don't have to get to the bottom of everything â€” that sometimes, science works just like magic.
Akeor: Later, my Saurian and I even made several trips to the other tribes to deliver supplies, so we weren't around here as often... *sigh* This is all thanks to Miss Tahmures's help. I sure hope I'm not slowing her research down in any way.
