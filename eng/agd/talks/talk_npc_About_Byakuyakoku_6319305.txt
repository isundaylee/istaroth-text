Traveler: About Byakuyakoku...
Tsuyuko: Enkanomiya's name was Byakuyakoku once upon a time. There was neither sun nor moon in that underground realm, and the only two astronomical phenomena being the Whitenight and the Evernight.
Tsuyuko: One of my ancestors was a shrine maiden named Eboshi. She was a character of some significance in Byakuyakoku's history, and it is due to her that I am in charge of the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri.
