Timaeus: Oh no. Where did I go wrong?

## Talk

Timaeus: A victory, just as I expected.

## Talk

Timaeus: How could I make such a stupid mistake...

## Talk

Timaeus: It's pretty much what I expected.

## Talk

Traveler: How's your research coming along?
Timaeus: Not too bad, although I haven't had the best of luck recently... My clock is a few minutes too slow, and thanks to that, a whole load of experiments have failed dismally...
Timaeus: It's not much use for keeping time anymore, that's for sure...
Timaeus: But after being used in so many alchemical experiments, it seems to have gained some understanding of the basic makeup and functional principles of the world... Maybe it's undergone some sort of miraculous transformation.
Timaeus: Why don't you take it? Maybe it'll come in handy in your adventures.

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds complicated.
Timaeus: You'll be fine, the procedure is actually very simple. If you're interested, I can show you the basics?
Timaeus: Much as one who uses a wind glider needs not understand how it was built in order to glide.
Timaeus: The process is mesmerizing to witness. I'm confident you'll be singing the praises of ancient civilizations and their ingenuity after you've tried it for yourself.

## Talk

Timaeus: Hi there, are you also interested in alchemy?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Timaeus: I am Timaeus, an alchemy scholar. You may not have heard my name before...
Timaeus: But I bet you'll have heard the names Albedo and Sucrose before.
Timaeus: Albedo is nothing short of a genius in the field of alchemy. And his assistant, Sucrose, is extremely talented for her age.
Timaeus: I'm a total amateur compared to them.
Traveler: About Albedo...
Timaeus: Albedo is an alchemy prodigy. A lot of people call him the Kreideprinz. He's the top alchemical talent in Mondstadt.
Timaeus: They say he's an outlander who just showed up in Mondstadt one day and was instantly taken on as Chief Alchemist by the Knights of Favonius. He's also Captain of the Investigation Team.
Timaeus: His alchemical theory is refreshingly unbridled in comparison to conventional theories. In practice it all works out too.
Timaeus: In his eyes, my work must seem like child's play... *sigh*
Traveler: About Sucrose...
Timaeus: Sucrose is Albedo's only assistant. She's so lucky to have gained Albedo's appreciation.
Timaeus: As a born and bred child of Mondstadt, we should all be proud of Sucrose's contributions to alchemy.
Timaeus: But her research and interests are a little... antiquated, to the point that they rarely render any practical application.
Timaeus: *sigh* If I had access to such a plethora of resources, who knows what I could accomplish.

## Talk

Traveler: Alchemy?
Timaeus: Alchemy is a craft that has been passed down since ancient times, but it is barely understood in the present.
Timaeus: Its mechanisms are magical and mysterious, completely unlike the principles that shape our understanding of the physical world.
Timaeus: If I can get the hang of it, I should be able to create some pretty awesome stuff, and contribute to our knowledge of ancient civilization.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Timaeus: Bye then, I'll carry on with my research.

Traveler: I'd like to use the Crafting Bench.
Timaeus: Sure, please go ahead.
