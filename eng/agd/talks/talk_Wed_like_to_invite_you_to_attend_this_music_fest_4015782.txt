Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Tomoki: Hmm? How did you know I liked music? ... Well, to be truthful, that's where I get most of my creative ideas!
Paimon: Ooh, then you must have music you really enjoy, right? We could play it for you!
Tomoki: Oh, that's a long list you'd be looking at... If I had to pick one, it might be this traditional piece from Konda Village.
Tomoki: That's where I started my culinary journey, in fact.
Tomoki: Could you play the piece if I were to hum the tune for you?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Tomoki: Thanks!
