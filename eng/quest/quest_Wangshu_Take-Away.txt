# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment.
Smiley Yanxiao: Eh? Sure, sure. I'll find someone else. Worse come to worst, I'll do it myself.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Well, I'm heading off.
Smiley Yanxiao: Aye, best be about it.
Smiley Yanxiao: Make sure you <color=#00E1FFFF>avoid monsters at all costs. If you get any weird elements on your person or take a hard knock, that food's toast</color>.
Smiley Yanxiao: Needless to say, if the food's ruined, the customer isn't taking it.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, then, run along. Don't keep the customer waiting, now.

## Talk 3

Laid Back Ling'guan: I've been strolling around here for so long. I wonder why my meal hasn't arrived yet...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That they did, alright. There's a guest lodging here named Ling'guan. She ordered a serving of Almond Tofu a while earlier and, after paying, wanted me to deliver it to someplace north of Dihua Marsh.
Smiley Yanxiao: But we've been really busy here at the inn, and I haven't the time to go out and deliver the food myself. If you could help me out, that would be great. I'll be sure to compensate you fairly.
