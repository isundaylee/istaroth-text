# Dishonorable Trial


## Talk 1

Paimon: Aah! The Abyss Order!
Dainsleif: Don't underestimate the enemy. Let's take them now.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, that was some good intel! Quick, let's go tell Dain.

## Talk 3

Paimon: *gasp* Look over there, it's Razor! And... the Abyss Herald!

## Talk 4

Dainsleif: A huge statue, a grandiose Cathedral... The people of Mondstadt clearly spent a great deal of resources and energy to construct them.
Dainsleif: But how aware of this was the Anemo Archon on receiving this gift, and how much did he give back in return?
Paimon: Faith doesn't ask for anything in return though, does it?
Dainsleif: Hmph, as long as the gods have a clear conscience about it all, there's nothing I can say about it.
Paimon: Shh! We're about to enter the Cathedral. Don't say anything bad about the Anemo Archon...
Paimon: And actually, the Anemo Archon is... Gah, never mind.
Dainsleif: Heh, I never specifically said I would enter the Cathedral. I'll leave you two to mingle with the sisters.
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: But we've done everything else together.
Dainsleif: You are the Honorary Knight of Mondstadt. They will surely allow you to poke into these affairs with their utmost trust.
Dainsleif: Having me tag along would only make them suspicious.
Traveler: Because they don't know you?
Dainsleif: Correct, and just as our little friend said... I might say something bad about the Church at any time.
Dainsleif: When a non-believer steps onto holy ground, the result is never pretty.
Dainsleif: I have never received the favor of the gods in the past. I don't see any reason I would need it now or in the future, either.
Dainsleif: That's enough about that. While we've been chit-chatting, the Abyss Order continues to act.
Paimon: #Okay then, Traveler, we'll just go in ourselves and ask around.
Dainsleif: I should warn you about one thing. Don't go mentioning the Defiled Statue inside the Cathedral.
Dainsleif: The Church of Favonius wouldn't ignore the matter of the statue, but if they rashly tried anything against the Abyss Order, it would only ruin whatever element of surprise we may have.
Dainsleif: Also... Meddling in the affairs of the Abyss usually doesn't end well for anyone.
Traveler: You don't think you will be popular among the sisters?
Traveler: Aren't you curious?

## Talk 5

Dainsleif: I see... Has the Abyss Order already launched a new operation...?
Dainsleif: This could very well have something to do with the Defiled Statue. We should go as well.
Paimon: But, what is the Abyss Order going to Wolvendom for anyway? Are they looking to do the same as they did with Dvalin? Aaaah... Not again!
Dainsleif: No, that's not likely.
Dainsleif: Unlike Osial, who was just suppressed, Andrius died long ago.
Dainsleif: Today it is just his spirit that stands guard over Wolvendom.
Dainsleif: The Abyss Herald may just be targeting the spirit of Andrius in an attempt to garner some information from one of the Anemo Archon's old companions.

## Talk 6

Dainsleif: Go into the Cathedral and ask around. I'll be waiting out here.

## Talk 7

Abyss Herald: Hmph... The ceremony was interrupted. How fortunate for you.
Abyss Herald: How does an old spirit have such determined will...?
Abyss Herald: No matter. This is but a small unforeseen variable. Our grand scheme will not be affected.
Paimon: It disappeared again...
Traveler: At least we stopped it this time.
Razor: Thank you, you came... just in time.
Boreas: Human Lupical... I am ashamed that you must see me in my present state.
Boreas: But still, the Abyss Herald underestimated my strength.
Razor: Lupus Boreas never refuses trial. But, scary outsider... not respect trial rules.
Razor: I, too, didn't see... the trap...
Paimon: Wait... So you mean, the Abyss Order had everything prepared to corrupt Lupus Boreas' mind, then lured him out under the pretense of challenging him in a trial?
Traveler: It's not your fault, Razor.
Razor: #Thank you, Traveler. In the future, my claws... must get sharper.
Razor: You... smelled danger, and came here?
Paimon: No, we heard about the danger. Paimon's nose doesn't even know what danger smells like!
Paimon: Besides coming to help, we actually have something to ask you about, too.
Paimon: Uh... Excuse us, Mr. Wolf God, do you know anything about the first Field Tiller?
Boreas: I pay no heed to the contraptions of humans. I know not what this "Field Tiller" is, though there was indeed one human-made machine that I can never forget.
Boreas: It entered into my proving ground by accident, and I mistook it for a challenger.
Boreas: But it could not think, only fight. It was designed as a pure killing machine from top to bottom.
Boreas: I eventually damaged it greatly with one of my attacks. Before it fell to the ground, it fled the proving ground.
Paimon: Hmm... By the sounds of it, it's possible that could have been the very first Field Tiller, right?
Traveler: Could it spin?
Boreas: Yes. It could spin, leap high into the air, and even shoot fireballs. Although no match for a god, it was stronger than even many who wield Visions.
Paimon: Fireballs...? Hey, didn't we hear this somewhere else recently as well?
Paimon: Anyway, this pretty much proves that the first Field Tiller came to Mondstadt, doesn't it?
Paimon: It sounds like the first one was way stronger than the mass-produced Ruin Guards that came after.
Paimon: But in this story, it was damaged at the proving ground while fighting the Wolf of the North...
Razor: Don't know... But, did we help?
Paimon: Yes, you were a big help! Thanks!
Paimon: We need to go keep investigating something super important. The Abyss Herald may have left, but the Abyss's forces are still attacking. You two be careful!
Razor: Yes. I smell... more danger. Bigger danger.
Razor: You two, also be careful.
Traveler: Could it shoot missiles?
Boreas: "Missiles"? I do not know this strange word... As I said, I pay no heed to the contraptions of humans.
Boreas: It could spin, leap high into the air, and even shoot fireballs. Although no match for a god, it was stronger than even many who wield Visions.
Traveler: Come on, cheer up.
Traveler: It sure ran away quickly.
