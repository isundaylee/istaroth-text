# Kourosh's Sumeru Roses


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the Sumeru Roses...
Kourosh: Ah, are you here to deliver the Sumeru Roses? I need to see those gorgeous flowers for a change.
Kourosh: So, do you have all ten Sumeru Roses? You can give them to me if you do.
Traveler: Here are the Sumeru Roses you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Kourosh: Argh, even roses have abandoned me. Life is harsh.

## Talk 2

Kourosh: Thank you. They're perfect. It would be nice if my next performance could be as impeccable as they are.
