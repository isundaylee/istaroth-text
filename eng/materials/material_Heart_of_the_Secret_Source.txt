# Heart of the Secret Source

Comes from a now-defunct Secret Source Automaton.
It appears to be an intact core by which the Secret Source Automaton was powered, a strange device that seems to have been produced as a universal component. According to legend, the ingenious thinkers of antiquity drew upon the same wisdom used in the creation of golden patterns to design the blueprints by which these extraordinary machines functioned. Perhaps this core was one of them.
