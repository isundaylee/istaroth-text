# Unattributed Ramen Voucher

A thank-you gift for assisting "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King" Arataki Itto in competing against Grandmaster Hanakado in the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl. And it also serves as proof of the rapid rising of two beetle-fighting stars, "Oni King's Right Hand" and "Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon."
The "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King" claims that as long as you show this voucher to the stall, you can "enjoy a free bowl of ramen for two months straight!" But... which stall is "the stall" exactly?
