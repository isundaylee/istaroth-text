Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Bennett: It's awesome!
Bennett: It sure beats sleeping out in the open when adventuring. Way better!
Bennett: You don't need to find a hole in a tree to rest in, and you don't have to worry about sneak attacks from monsters.
Bennett: Rocks crashing from the sky... Whopperflowers popping out of nowhere...
Traveler: You can come here and relax after your adventures.
Bennett: Râ€”Really!? Awesome!
Bennett: I'm so lucky to have someone as nice as you as a partner!
Bennett: Hehe, looks like I'll be bothering you a bunch from now on.
Traveler: That's... pretty rough.
Bennett: Nah, not at all... It's an adventure! They're always like this.
Bennett: With your concern, I already feel like my wounds aren't hurting anymore! Really!
