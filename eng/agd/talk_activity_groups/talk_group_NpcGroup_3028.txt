## Talk

Traveler: Do you have any information about Inazuman ores?

## Talk

Hajime: I'm sorry, but the nearby veins have all been mined, and I don't have any new information on hand, either. Best you come back again later.

## Talk

Hajime: Sorry, I have a lot on my plate right now. I can only talk to you while I work. Would you like to buy a weapon? Or do you have a forging request?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm looking for a handy weapon.
Hajime: These are all works of the Amenoma Art that have been approved by my master. Take a gander.

## Talk

Traveler: I want you to forge something for me...
Hajime: Bring me the materials, and I will get to work right away.

## Talk

Traveler: *I'd like something made.*
Hajime: The previous job you asked me to do has been completed. See if it's to your satisfaction or not. By the way, do you have anything else for me?

## Talk

Traveler: About yourself...
Hajime: Me? I'm just a regular apprentice swordsmith. I do whatever my master tells me to do.
Hajime: As you can see, I practice forging every day, earn a meager salary, and listen to my master's endless lectures...
Hajime: Although I'm the senior disciple, I'm not sure if the master's really counting on me to take over the Amenoma Art.
Hajime: ...Well, whatever. It's not a bad idea, as long as I get paid more.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hajime: Okay, I'll see you whenever you've got another job for me.

## Talk

Traveler: It's tough being a disciple.
Hajime: *sigh* You said it... It'd be bad if my master hears me complaining. If he overhears, he'll lecture me for the entire day.
Hajime: Thank you for your concern. Seeing as you are a Traveler on the move, I'll give these ores to you. If something is wrong with your weapon, they might be of use to you.
