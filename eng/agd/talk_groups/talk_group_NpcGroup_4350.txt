Traveler: Are you picking Nilotpala Lotuses?
Shirin: Not yet, I'm just marking their locations for now.
Shirin: Nilotpala Lotuses are common medicinal plants, but they work best when they're fresh.
Shirin: As the Forest Rangers' doctor, I must do my best to mark areas rich with herbs so that I can pick them easily when they're needed.
Shirin: The rainforest may seem quiet, but its dangers cannot be underestimated. If you do enter the forest, try to stay on the main path and pay attention to your surroundings.

Traveler: I will.
Shirin: Okay. And on top of common emergency medicine, it's best to have a handy weapon.
Shirin: Something that can be used for hunting, or against monster attacks. Ranged weapons like bows are quite ideal. They're also a common choice for us Forest Rangers.
