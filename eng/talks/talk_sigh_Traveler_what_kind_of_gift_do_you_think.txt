Albert: ...*sigh* Traveler, what kind of gift do you think moves people the most?
Albert: Windblumes... I'm sure Barbara-sama has already seen plenty of those and won't be interested at all.
Albert: A letter... I think Barbara-sama gets plenty of those as well, and the feedback from her fans is virtually the same.
Albert: I need to get her something more unique, something more eye-catching...
Albert: Huh, you mean we need to be careful not to cause any trouble for Barbara-sama? Ah, right, thanks for the reminder. That's really important too.
Albert: Barbara-sama's work is essential. As fans, we should do our utmost not to disturb her!
