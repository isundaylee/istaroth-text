Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Thoma: Haha, don't worry, I'll be fine. Believe me, I can feel at home almost anywhere.
Thoma: By the way, I really like what you've done with the place... Especially that funny little bird at the entrance...
Traveler: That's Tubby, a teapot spirit.
Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Teapot Spirit... Wait, what?
Thoma: I've heard my share of stories, everything from fox envoys, to bake-danuki, to tengu warriors... But a teapot spirit? That's a new one.
Thoma: Hmm, interesting. So, that teapot youkai... I mean, spirit. Teapot spirit. Did you catch it yourself?
Traveler: It's a long story. Rest assured, Tubby is no youkai.
Thoma: Not a youkai? So... just out of curiosity, this Tubby doesn't happen to be some sort of god or anything, does it?
Thoma: That would spell the end for me... I, uh, couldn't help but pat it on the head when I came in...
Traveler: That's Tubby, my butler bird.
Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Butler Bird... Wait, what?
Thoma: You're saying you've got a bird that's smart enough to be a butler? It's not some kind of youkai or anything... Is it?
Thoma: Heh, you never cease to impress me. I mean, taming youkai? Who knew you had that kind of talent!
