# Gift and Intent


## Talk 1

Beatrice: How am I ever going to get Quinn to listen to me...?

## Talk 2

Beatrice: What's... what's this? Not an attractive sight...
Beatrice: Smells a little strange, too... Surely this can't be what you want me give to Quinn?
Traveler: O—Of course not...
Beatrice: *sigh* I'll keep waiting for you here then.

## Talk 3

Beatrice: Uh... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... for Quinn?
Beatrice: I have often said that I would bring him lunch... Would this really work? Hmm...
Beatrice: Well, since it's Noelle's recommendation, I'll give it a try!

## Talk 4

Quinn: Fruit, fresh fruit... want some fruit?
Traveler: Bea's gift...? Uhh...
Quinn: Oh... she said something about giving me something to eat... but I'm really not hungry right now...
Quinn: Besides, she's constantly talking about bringing me lunch, so I didn't think anything of it this time...

## Talk 5

Noelle's Study Notes: #"Make time to be together alone," "Give {F#her}{M#him} a cake you made yourself"...
Noelle's Study Notes: Words of counsel and wisdom are penned here in a lovely hand that unfortunately grew shaky towards the tail end.
Noelle's Study Notes: Some of the text has been arbitrarily struck out, seemingly a result of the owner's emotions suddenly running high.

## Talk 6

Noelle: Whew! All these b—books have got my heart racing...
Noelle: I think I should take a break and do something else... to distract myself...
Noelle: Then again, perhaps I should finish this one first. Just the one, right?
