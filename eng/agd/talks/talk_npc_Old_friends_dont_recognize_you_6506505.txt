Traveler: Old friends don't recognize you?
Faustier: Well, I had a short stint in the Fortress of Meropide. Petty theft and such...
Faustier: And when I came out, no one could recognize me any longer — they said I'd changed too much.
Faustier: Well, I certainly was a leaner sight in the past — it took quite some effort just to move chairs, even. But unrecognizable, really? I just bulked up a little, that's all.
