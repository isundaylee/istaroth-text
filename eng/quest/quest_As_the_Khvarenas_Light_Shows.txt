# As the Khvarena's Light Shows


## Talk 1

Zurvan: Well now! If it isn't Sorush and her Yasnapati.
Zurvan: You sure did come back quickly. And while this might sound rude, you have exceeded my expectations.
Sorush: Hmph. Whether it be foolish Mihir or ignorant Rashnu, I have personally saved them and brought them back to our sea of flowers.
Sorush: You will see me in a different light now, I trust, Elder?
Paimon: #Uhh, Paimon thinks it's more accurate to say that we saved them together! {NICKNAME} put in tons of work too.
Sorush: Hmph, you speak too much! I was planning to elevate you, too, to the position of my Yasnapati. But if you will be so petty, Pale Floater, it seems I must reconsider my decision.
Paimon: Whoa... Actually, never mind. Who wants to be your Yasnapati anyway?
Sorush: Now, it may seem strange to say so, but I believe myself and my Yasnapati to be of the same root and stem. Indivisible.
Sorush: And just as the heroes of legend should have many helpers, my Yasnapati's works shall also count for my glory.
Sorush: It also goes without saying that a Pari who shall do such a supreme deed as I will not peddle in the foolishness that is stealing another's credit.
Sorush: Therefore, Yasnapati mine, feel free to add your deeds to the hymn, for thus shall my great deeds seem all the greater for it!
Traveler: By your leave, Your Grace.
Paimon: Oh, stop it with the silly roleplay already!
Paimon: That's right! We're quite used to you talking like this, Sorush, but Zurvan's right over there looking at us like we're a bunch of idiots!
Sorush: *cough* Then let us not speak of things unrelated. Just as we agreed before, Elder, you can give me the Twin-Horned Chaplet now, yes?
Zurvan: Well, we did. But I can't give you the Chaplet.
Sorush: Wait! Are you going back on your word?
Zurvan: Hehe. Now, the Chaplet is the symbol of Khvarena's recognition. How could it be given away based on private whims?
Zurvan: Amidst the countless motes of Khvarena created by the transformed divine bird, only we Pari have been blessed with intelligence. It is thus that we are able to communicate with the remaining consciousness within the mother-tree and guide the power of Khvarena.
Zurvan: But not all Pari may possess such authority.
Zurvan: Only the Bloomguards, those who prove worthy successors to the divine bird's aspirations and have the courage to see that wish through, may gain the Chaplet, the crown that contains wisdom.
Zurvan: Come, then. Pray along with me to the invincible Khvarena. If you have been acknowledged, then our god will grant you the Chaplet herself.
Black Screen Text: Zurvan recites the words of an ancient hymn and Sorush joins her.
It is as if a thousand birds sing out at once, and as if a hundred flowers respond.
Traveler: We're taking this a bit far, I think.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ooh, so the Chaplet just grows out of your head!
Paimon: Well, this didn't go as we thought, but guess you've got your Twin-Horned Chaplet now, Sorush.
Traveler: You look much more reliable than before.
Sorush: Haha! Of course! I am the destined "Bloomguard," after all!
Sorush: Now I need only offer myself as a sacrifice to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha...
Paimon: Uhh... And there you go, ruining our impression of you right away.
Paimon: But since you've got the Chaplet, Sorush, now we can go find that Great Song of Khvarena thing, right?
Paimon: Paimon remembers Nasejuna saying that we'll need to collect enough of those Great Songs if we want to perform that rite of his, and then we can pass through the darkness...
Paimon: But who knows if his words can be relied on or not...
Zurvan: That is the Rite of Chinvat. Now, is this Nasejuna you speak of from the Order of Skeptics? To think that any human remembers that rite. I thought that it had been lost.
Zurvan: I did once travel alongside human heroes to cross the darkness through the Rite and cleanse the impurities tainting the mother-tree.
Paimon: Hey, hey, looks like he wasn't mistaken, then!
Zurvan: But when that happened, I was the one who personally used the Khvarena to repair the seal that held the darkness at bay.
Zurvan: Later, I was the one who fused the strongest Khvarena collected there into five Great Songs, which I used to purify the land.
Zurvan: The Skeptics should not have knowledge of the Great Songs' existence if they relied merely on their traditional records.
Paimon: Maybe Nasejuna's just that interested in researching documents? Maybe there are some documents he found elsewhere that you don't know about, Zurvan.
Zurvan: That would make him all the more suspicious. As I understand it, there are indeed others who would be interested in the Great Songs...
Zurvan: All the same, with you there, I believe such small matters should be no obstacle. In any case, Sorush has only just obtained the Chaplet and cannot collect enough Khvarena.
Zurvan: If we wish to conduct the Rite of Chinvat now, we will need the power of the Great Songs.
Zurvan: At that time, after I first scattered the monsters that had invaded our sea of flowers, the Great Songs were scattered across the land.
Zurvan: Only one was hidden by me within the waters of the Sunyata Lake here, kept away for a future time of need.
Zurvan: Now that Sorush has obtained the authority to touch the Great Songs, you can first go to obtain this one.
Zurvan: As for the rest, you shall have to seek them out yourself. Safeguard them well! Do not let them fall into the hands of suspicious people.
Zurvan: I would also ask you to take care of Sorush for me. Though she may have obtained the acknowledgment of Khvarena, I fear that wisdom and intelligence have never been prerequisites for becoming a "Bloomguard."

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa! Something weird came out from the lake!
Paimon: Is that a Great Song of Khvarena? ... Y'know, it looks kinda cute, actually!
Paimon: It's a lot bigger than all the Khvarena we've seen previously... Maybe we could just call it "Great Khvarena" for short!
Paimon: Paimon didn't think something this cute could be this good at cleansing the impurities, though.
Traveler: Well, Sorush is much the same.
Sorush: Pleasing to the ear, those words are not, but I shall take it that you praise my majesty nonetheless.
Traveler: We've got another powerful cutie on our side here, don't we?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's one Great Khvarena down. Next, we just...
Paimon: Um, wait a moment. We don't know where the rest are, do we?
Sorush: No need to fret! I have already commanded Nasuraia regarding this matter. He already knows where the other four may be found.
Sorush: We need only have him guide us.
Paimon: Umm...
Sorush: Well? Do you doubt my judgment?
Paimon: Well... Paimon just thinks that Nasejuna's documents aren't all that reliable.
Sorush: Hmph. This is different from the matter of the drums. The locations of the Great Songs of Khvarena were not found by consultation of the Skeptics' traditions, but through Nasuraia's own painstaking studies.
Sorush: Apart from the ones locked within the ruins, I have personally checked the rest. There will be no errors.
Sorush: Be assured, Pale Floater! I am the destined Bloomguard now. Would I make such mistakes?
Paimon: Alright then. Paimon's not very assured, mind you. But we can always go ask Nasejuna first and stuff. Didn't he say he'd meet us at the camp?
Sorush: Such considerations are unnecessary. Yours is to simply follow me and record mine accomplishments.

## Talk 5

Nasejuna: Well then, let me help you open this door. The final Great Song of Khvarena can be found in this underground Dahrian factory!
Nasejuna: We are merely one step away, but knowing that we are so close to collecting all the Great Songs, even I feel rather excited.
Traveler: Well, go ahead and do your work, then.
Nasejuna: Haha, long have I prepared for this moment.
Traveler: (Hesitate a little.)
Nasejuna: What? Are you afraid, now that we're here?
Paimon: Hmm, it's just that... You might have read those notes, Nasejuna, but Paimon thinks you're a little too good at working with these ruin machines.
Nasejuna: But of course. While you were away, I was making preparations the entire time.

## Talk 6

Nasejuna: Hah! There we go. Inside at last!
Paimon: Well, this looks like the main hall. What should we do next?
Nasejuna: Hmm, let me think. Just like the previous ruins we've explored, this should also be the energy control hub for the entire ruin.
Nasejuna: If the documents I have read are accurate, this place was used as a manufacturing center, and it was owned by the Dahri warrior band known as the Schwanenritter, just as the proving ground from earlier was.
Nasejuna: According to these records, they resisted the monsters that surged forth from beneath the earth during the cataclysm that occurred 500 years ago.
Nasejuna: Ah, but that's not important right now. Whatever the case, my notes say that the Great Song we must claim here is at the very bottom of this factory.
Nasejuna: We will need to use the elevator to reach that location, which means that activating said elevator is our present problem.
Nasejuna: But just as with the previous ruins, the relays powering the elevator have been sealed by Gray Crystals. We will need to find Farrwicks to eliminate them.
Nasejuna: It seems we'll need... three of those. The notes seem to say that these ruins should contain quite a few of them, though, so we might as well have a look around the adjoining rooms.
Paimon: Well, you say that, but the doors all around look closed. Doesn't look like we're going anywhere fast.
Sorush: Hmph. Pale Floater, you fret over-much. All places are accessible to those who use Khvarena. And is not one of the Farrwicks you wish to find here?
Nasejuna: Exactly. As long as we use the Farrwicks to break the seals over the relays, we can use the mixer to transfer power over to the devices near the doors to open them.
Nasejuna: Well, let's give this a go all the same.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ooh, it really opened!
Paimon: In that case, let's do the same with the door on the other side!
Nasejuna: I'd love to go over there and have a look. My notes say that this factory's smelting center lies that way.
Nasejuna: But seeing the state of these relays, we will need another Farrwick to activate the door here.
Nasejuna: And if we want to activate the elevator, we will need to unseal all three of these relays...
Nasejuna: Considering that, could we trouble you and our great Envoy to go find it?
Sorush: Oh? You almost sound like you presume to command me.
Nasejuna: ...Oh no, no, of course, I would never dare do such a thing, O Great Envoy. Yet this is a great task that only you may accomplish!
Nasejuna: You and your Yasnapati truly work wonders that a mere mortal such as I cannot aid in accomplishing, and as such, mine is only to wait for your return.
Nasejuna: Still, do take these investigation notes along with you, so that you shall not lose your way. It contains the locations of all the Farrwicks you must find.
Nasejuna: It took me much effort to obtain this information, so do keep it safe.
Nasejuna: Without the notes to guide me, I shall not be able to leave this place alone. And you would not leave a poor man such as I here in the dust, would you?

## Talk 8

Nasejuna: Oh my! You're finally back.
Nasejuna: I was beside myself with worry! If some frozen beast were to suddenly revive themselves, I would have been done for, no doubt.
Nasejuna: Fortunately, nothing of the sort happened.
Nasejuna: Well then, that's two Farrwicks we have obtained. In that case, let's open the door on the right, just as before. Following that, if you'll allow it, I shall follow you onward.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow, that's a huge furnace. It's super hot! How is it still in operation?
Nasejuna: This giant furnace is used to make a substance known as Azosite. It is the core of this entire factory, and the Energy Blocks we saw earlier were derived from this place.
Paimon: But shouldn't this place have been abandoned ages ago? No one should have been able to get in here!
Nasejuna: Well, there might be some paths in here that we're not sure of. Those people who worship the dark abyss... and perhaps even the "Fatui" you spoke of may have entered.
Nasejuna: Surely, now that I consider it, the Great Songs might have been stolen by now, were it not for the fact that only Lady Sorush may touch them.
Sorush: Hah! Worthless worries. The Great Songs of Khvarena are my destined inheritance. That any others might taint them with their touch... Inconceivable!
Nasejuna: Indeed, indeed, it is so. But we must find one more Farrwick to activate the relays sealed in crystal, if you are to claim your destiny.
Nasejuna: Then, we can activate that elevator and go to where the Great Song awaits us.
Nasejuna: Come then, let us go.

## Talk 10

Nasejuna: Hah, do you see that giant machine up there?
Nasejuna: That is the central control device of this entire factory. As long as we can get the energy from the relays to that center and then activate this device, we shall be able to activate the elevator.
Nasejuna: Whatever the case, let's hurry and unseal the relays, then use the mixer, as before, to connect this circuit.
Traveler: Hmm...
Nasejuna: What is it? This is no time to retreat.
Paimon: Yeah. You know what? You know this place too well, Nasejuna. It's like you've been here before or something.
Paimon: Don't you find it weird too, Sorush?
Sorush: Well, that is true, but he is a human Vijnanapati. Surely this is not beyond him?
Nasejuna: Hmph. Don't look down on us scholarly types! With the aid of these documents that I read in the mountains, even I can master these devices.
Nasejuna: And I have not only read all the books within the House of Daena, but I have spent much time collecting tomes heretofore hidden.
Nasejuna: As the great Envoy commanded me, I have always paid special attention to records concerning the Great Songs of Khvarena and underground ruins.
Nasejuna: Tell me, is deriving recorded truth from documents not the essential work of those whose preoccupation is such writings?
Nasejuna: And even if you should suspect me, let us save that until we have obtained the Great Song of Khvarena! You would not abandon me here at this juncture, would you?
Nasejuna: Please, let us focus on resolving the matter of this elevator!

## Talk 11

Nasejuna: Good, good. Now we need only activate the central control device at the control platform above, and the elevator should be restored to normal function.
Nasejuna: Well then, Yasnapati of her Eminence, the great Envoy, I leave that to you. I still have work to do here in examining these aged machines.
Nasejuna: We are finally here. The preparations I made were not in vain.
Nasejuna: And yet, let us leave celebrations till later. Who knows what dangers yet lie ahead?

## Talk 12

Nasejuna: Finally! Now we need only use this elevator, and we shall reach the deepest section of this factory.
Nasejuna: Well, my notes do also say that a path into an underground realm still deeper down than this factory may be found there...
Nasejuna: But that is not a place we can reach.
Nasejuna: The road ahead of us is perilous, but I will not falter at the precipice this time.
Nasejuna: This may be considered the deepest parts of the surface realms, after all. If a researcher such as myself were to stop here, I would surely shame the name of my Order.
Nasejuna: As always, I leave myself in your able hands, Yasnapati, Honored Envoy.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Nice! And that's all five Great Khvarena in our hands!
Paimon: Now we just need to take 'em over to Zurvan in the sea of flowers and perform that Ritual of... whatever we're calling it.
Nasejuna: Please wait! As I see it, these Great Songs should go to me first.
Nasejuna: As I mentioned before, I must still examine these Great Songs more carefully before the Rite of Chinvat can begin.
Nasejuna: And did I not put in much effort toward finding them as well? If I were not present, you might yet be stumbling blind through this factory.
Paimon: Well, that's what it looked like, yeah...
Nasejuna: Yes, yes, reasonable, is it not? Come then, give me the Great Songs, quickly now... That way, I can draw up a procedure for the ritual first...
Nasejuna: ...Yes, that's right. That's my work, too, after all!
Paimon: Hmm. Y'know, the more you talk, the more suspicious Paimon's getting...
Traveler: That will be unnecessary.
Sorush: It is as my Yasnapati says. You need simply await the completion of my heroic deed, Nasuraia.
Nasejuna: Silence! You piss me off!
Sorush: Nasuraia, you dare...!
Nasejuna: Hah! Well. I've said it now, haven't I? I've blown my cover.
Nasejuna: But ah, it is such a liberating feeling, to no longer have to grovel and nod before this idiot of a Pari.
Nasejuna: Well! Where should we begin? Even I'm not very sure.
Nasejuna: I'd love to tell you all about my plans. Dead people tell no tales, after all. But I'd wager you'd not like to hear of such convoluted matters much.
Nasejuna: Why don't you just hand the Great Songs over? That'll save me time.
Paimon: Nope, not happening! We spent so much effort getting them, and if we don't have 'em, our commission's a non-starter!
Paimon: Zurvan also said that we'd be idiots to give them to you!
Nasejuna: Bah! Sideshows, all of that, compared to my plans! I've been playing house with you imbeciles this entire time, just to get the Great Songs!
Nasejuna: They call me Vijnanapati at the Order, but they could never understand my labors, and so I acted in secret. I had to!
Nasejuna: In order to get in contact with Khvarena constructs, I came up with the idea of using the Rite of Chinvat to extinguish the Sign and lured in Sorush...
Nasejuna: And that was already a pain in the neck. You've seen it, how most Pari are just obstinate cretin.
Nasejuna: But she was truly useless! Her constant failure to obtain that Chaplet had me on the verge of giving up!
Nasejuna: It was thanks to you two, ultimately, that the Chaplet was gained, and that we made it all the way here! Now, it won't please you, but I am very grateful.
Traveler: Well, that's a bit too harsh on Sorush.
Nasejuna: Is that even important!?
Nasejuna: The songs of the Skeptics do record that some humans did become companions of the Pari. But were it not for the Great Songs, I would never have associated with them at all.
Nasejuna: All that is left now is to use the Great Songs of Khvarena to reverse the Rite of Chinvat, which will release the seal on the Abyss... and the wars of old will begin anew!
Nasejuna: Oh, the expectation! Does it not kill you inside? Shame, then, that you shan't see that glorious sight.
Paimon: Wait, but isn't your Order supposed to help suppress the Abyss? Why do you want to unseal it instead...
Traveler: You've turned your back on your duties.
Nasejuna: Ah, but have you not considered other possibilities?
Nasejuna: Just as you have seen, the Skeptics' documents are a pile of raving-mad myths, while Dahri records are factual. Precise.
Nasejuna: As I see it, the "history" and the "duty" of the Order of Skeptics are but tall tales, invented from nothing.
Nasejuna: My discoveries in the ruins only proved my judgment astute. I found a great many interesting things there, just so you know.
Nasejuna: Well, I have managed to enter this place at times, in secret, alongside the lector who gave me the notes. But this is the first time things went so well.
Nasejuna: According to my research, those who resisted the impurities here were heroes of the Dahri. They are the Skeptics' true ancestors.
Nasejuna: But they were forgotten. Their tale untold. They were smeared as sinners. As the cause behind the disaster.
Nasejuna: Their deeds were wiped from the records by the thrice-be-damned Akademiya, and then mistakenly appropriated as a founding myth by the Skeptics... I suspect this is why the Akademiya never intended to accept us.
Traveler: Sounds like speculation to me.
Nasejuna: No! This is the truth, which I discovered with my own hands.
Nasejuna: I did say so earlier, did I not? I found some interesting records in the ruins. For example, Dahri records of that sign in the sky.
Nasejuna: They called this the Sign of Truth, believing that it reflected the "reality" beyond our skies...
Nasejuna: That is my plan. To bring truth without mercy to this unjust world!
Nasejuna: Now then. My great work requires the Great Songs of Khvarena, so hand them over. If you come quietly, perhaps I might spare you.
Paimon: And what'll you do, snatch it? It's gonna be pretty tough for you, y'know...
Nasejuna: Well, that's too bad. I've come prepared!
Nasejuna: ... My apologies for the wait, O Priest of the Dark Hollow.
Traveler: Regardless, betrayal is betrayal.
Nasejuna: I am merely ending this fratricidal farce.
Traveler: You deceived us, then.
Nasejuna: Call it mere omission. I am, after all, indeed preparing for the Rite of Chinvat.
Traveler: Let's have Sorush decide.
Sorush: Hmph. I see no reason to branch from our path now. You need simply await the completion of my heroic deed, Nasuraia.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm, where's Nasejuna gone off to? He was hiding over there a moment ago...
Paimon: Ugh. How could we have let him slip off like that!?
Paimon: To think that he'd gang up with the Abyss Order to take our Great Khvarena! And what was that crazy nonsense he was going on and on about?
Traveler: This one was a long time coming.
Paimon: Well, now that you mention it, he was pretty suspicious right from the start. And given what Zurvan told us, she must have realized something as well, right?
Paimon: In that case, let's bring these Great Khvarena back and get some answers from Zurvan.
Paimon: As for the Order, didn't Nasejuna say that he was keeping them in the dark too?
Paimon: Well, we shouldn't rule out the possibility that some of them might have been swayed to Nasejuna's side, but Paimon thinks Pyrrho and some others didn't know what was going on.
Paimon: If we've got the time, let's tell 'em the truth!
Sorush: ...
Paimon: Whatever the case, let's head back to the sea of flowers. We've gotta make sure that nothing bad happens, after all!
Traveler: This is still rather concerning...
Paimon: That's true. We can't really trust what Nasejuna says, but Zurvan might still know something about the Khaenri'ahns who fought against the monsters here.

## Talk 15

Nasejuna: Ah, yes. There is one more thing we should prepare before entering.
Nasejuna: According to my notes, these paths have all been blocked by Gray Crystals.
Nasejuna: If we wish to access the Great Song of Khvarena, we need to find a way to bring Farrwicks, which radiate Khvarena, in.
Nasejuna: Let's have a look around, then.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nasejuna: Lady Sorush... Your present form is most astounding indeed...
Nasejuna: Gazing upon your mighty form, I know in my heart that you must have been crowned the Bloomguard of the Pari, acknowledged by all!
Sorush: Startle not, human. This was my calling from the beginning.
Nasejuna: Of course, of course. Such majesty is only to be expected of the honored Envoy, one who shall obtain the Great Songs of Khvarena and extinguish the Sign of Apaosha!
Sorush: Indeed, your words are most suited to be inscribed in the hymns that shall be written in mine honor!
Paimon: Huh... Nasejuna's still his usual self. Paimon's not sure how to feel about this.
Nasejuna: Ah yes, Yasnapati, Paimon, you too deserve thanks in this matter.
Nasejuna: Though your endeavors are naught but the afterglow of the Envoy's mighty works, your labor in Lady Sorush's successful obtaining of her crown shall not be voided.
Paimon: That's not how it went, buddy, but we'll just take this as your way of saying thanks!
Nasejuna: Haha. Our mission now is to search for the Great Songs of Khvarena, and the long-awaited Rite may then be performed.
Nasejuna: Speaking of the Great Songs, they are inextricably linked to the destiny of us Skeptics...
Traveler: Is it story time again?
Paimon: But Zurvan said that you guys shouldn't know about the Great Songs' existence, you know?
Nasejuna: Yes, it is indeed true that the ancient rites have stopped being passed down through our Order. If I had relied solely on our traditions, I suspect that even the Rite of Chinvat might still be shrouded in mystery.
Nasejuna: But I gained access to a large batch of long-lost documents from a very learned scholar. That was where I learned about the Great Songs.
Nasejuna: Those documents recorded a great number of things that the traditional hymns of our Order have never written of. That also inspired in me the desire to reform our Order.
Paimon: That doesn't really help, you know. Your traditions are already pretty suspect. How are we supposed to trust these documents, then? They might've come outta nowhere for all we know!
Sorush: Enough. These sideshows are not fit to be written into my songs. If you so wish to tell truth from falsehood, then let us go and see for ourselves rather than quibble here.
Sorush: Why, if I do not offer myself up as a sacrifice to save this land soon, those who come after may read these texts and suspect that I was a spirit of laxity.
Nasejuna: No, no, how could that be? I do not believe any would hold to such contemptuous thoughts!
Paimon: Hmm. Paimon thinks that you just want us to hurry up and collect those Great Khvarena, Sorush.
Paimon: Wait... Since when did Paimon become your translator?
Sorush: Hmph. To think that you, Pale Floater, should understand my thoughts best.
Nasejuna: Since it is your command, great Envoy, allow me to lead the way.
Nasejuna: It seems that you have obtained one of the Great Songs. It is just as well, then, that I have discovered the locations of the remaining four.
Nasejuna: Although I have not been to those underground ruins myself, I am as familiar with them as I am with this camp.
Traveler: That seems like an overstatement, but alright.
Nasejuna: Haha. Well, the Great Songs are items that I do desire to win, especially after all that effort...
Nasejuna: *cough* Well, let's not speak of unrelated matters. Come with me, everyone.
Traveler: Knew we could count on you.
Traveler: Hang on a second, Zurvan said that...
Paimon: That's right. Didn't Zurvan say that you guys shouldn't know about the Great Songs' existence?

Nasejuna: Since it is your command, great Envoy, allow me to lead the way.
Paimon: That said, we've already picked up a whole bunch of Great Songs of Khvarena along the way.
Nasejuna: Without guidance... But I suppose I should have expected as much from the eminent Envoy and her Yasnapati.
Nasejuna: Now then, I have investigated the locations of the rest.
Nasejuna: Although I have not been to those underground ruins myself, I am as familiar with them as I am with this camp.
Traveler: That seems like an overstatement, but alright.

### Additional Talk 3

Nasejuna: Without the notes to guide me, I shall not be able to leave this place alone. And you would not leave a poor man such as I here in the dust, would you?

### Additional Talk 4

Nasejuna: Now we need only activate the central control device, and the elevator should be restored to normal functionality.
