## Talk

Grosley: Welcome to Fontaine! Please, do watch your step.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine.
Grosley: You may ride the lift at the side to the Court, and there you shall see the Palais Mermonia, the beating heart of Fontaine.
Grosley: If you've ridden one of our aquabuses, I'm sure you've heard a Melusine tour guide introduce Fontaine, yes?
Grosley: Well, now you'll get to experience it for yourself.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Melusine tour guides...
Grosley: As far as I know, Melusines are our special companions.
Grosley: But don't underestimate them on account of their appearance. The ones amongst them in uniform are detectives from the Marechaussee Phantom.
Grosley: ...That includes the guides.
Grosley: Just like us humans, different Melusines have their unique personalities.
Grosley: The sort of introduction you'll get will thus depend on the Melusine serving as your guide.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Grosley: See you! May you have a wonderful day.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the aquabus lines...
Grosley: There are three aquabus lines here in Fontaine — the Callas Line, the Clementine Line, and the Navia Line.
Grosley: These three names were not chosen at random, far from it. They refer to Callas, the President of the Spina di Rosula, his wife, and his daughter respectively.
Grosley: The aquabus had a truly troubled gestation — if not for the Spina, we'd still be navigating on foot.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the lift...
Grosley: It stops at 4 different levels. Level 1 is the main aquabus station hall, and the highest one leads straight to the Palais Mermonia.
Grosley: We are presently at Level 2. Before us is the Clementine Line, which links Romaritime Harbor with the main station. The third level, for its part, is the Navia Line, which leads to Erinnyes.
Grosley: A lot of travelers get the floors mixed up, so be careful now.
