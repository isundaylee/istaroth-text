# For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...


## Talk 1

Paimon: No sign of the Fatui... Hmm, but look at the things scattered around this place. Someone must've been here before.

## Talk 2

Jeht: Go ahead! I take your bullets! You think you kill me with bullets? I take your bullets! Go ahead!
Paimon: It's Jeht. It's like... she's gone mad with fury...
Jeht: You scum! Come back! I'll rip out your livers. I'll grill you alive. I will chomp on your bones!
Paimon: ...Does she even know what she's saying?
Jeht: Capture me alive? Capture me alive, will you? Oh, you'll capture me alright — once I've bled my last drop of blood on these sands! Come on!
Paimon: Hey... There wouldn't be anyone alive to capture in that case...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Jeht... Jeht, where are you?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Jeht! Look, is that Jeht over there? Quick, let's go!

## Talk 5

Jeht: There she is... probably waiting for Nayram and Rezki.
Paimon: Who are they again...
Jeht: Her assassins. We've fought them already.

## Talk 6

Jeht: *huff* *huff* *cough*
Traveler: Now then. Let's talk.
Jeht: ...
Traveler: I won't hurt you. Please, trust me.
Jeht: Whatever, I'm done with this. First, it was Azariq, and now it's you... *sigh*...
Traveler: Calm down. We were all deceived.
Paimon: #{M#He's}{F#She's} right! You said that the Matriarch asked you to hunt us down because we betrayed the tribe, but y'know what? That's the exact same mission she gave us!
Paimon: We didn't believe you'd betray us, so we were trying to find you and figure things out.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: I didn't betray the tribe, nor do I have any reason to do so.
Jeht: Matriarch Babel has witnesses on her side: Yuften saw you deal with the northerners, and Masseira saw you moving around their camp.
Paimon: What? No way! She also told us... that you were spotted colluding with enemies of the tribe!
Jeht: ...
Jeht: So, why did they say you betrayed us? What's going on?
Paimon: Eh... Paimon wishes we knew... Anyway, calm down and let us explain!
Traveler: If it's Babel's design to pit us against each other...
Traveler: Will they defend us or the Matriarch?
Jeht: ...
Paimon: Think about it, Jeht! Who do you trust more? Us or them?
Jeht: Quiet down, would you, Paimon? This whole thing doesn't make any sense...
Paimon: Phew... You finally put your weapons down. Let's not draw 'em again, shall we? You gave Paimon quite a fright...
Nayram: Don't be so optimistic yet, little one... She could still use her blades.
Jeht: Nayram, Rezki! Why are you here? I can handle things alone here. There's no need for you to pitch in.
Nayram: Uh-huh, I can tell you're doing pretty well, Jeht... That's why Rezki and I are both needed to deal with the two of you.
Rezki: ...And there's also this little Jinni.
Nayram: Oh, the little Jinni. I'm quite fond of her. Let's spare her.
Paimon: What!?
Rezki: ...
Rezki: ...Alright.
Jeht: Wait, have... have you also betrayed the Tanit?
Nayram: No, on the contrary, we're here to deal with traitors.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: I see.
Traveler: Who are they?
Jeht: That's not important. They used to be good people.
Jeht: Nayram, Rezki, it was a pleasure being your family. Now, forgive me.
Rezki: Alright. Let's do this.
Jeht: ...

## Talk 7

Jeht: Matriarch Babel sent them... What do you think they will do?
Traveler: You should take a look at this...

## Talk 8

Jeht: ...
Jeht: So, she set the trap up long ago, and was just waiting for us to walk right into it?
Jeht: Wait... Why didn't you... show me this earlier?
Paimon: We would've, but you didn't give us a chance to speak before drawing your weapons, and you wouldn't listen to reason either!
Jeht: Um... *sigh* I'm sorry. Thank goodness you're alright...
Jeht: Regardless, I have to get to the bottom of this. I need answers from her.
Jeht: Ugh... Ow, ow...
Traveler: We still have time. You should rest.
Paimon: Yup yup, there's no need to rush it. We can return any time, while Babel has to wait for us.
Traveler: Paimon's right. The initiative is on our side now.
Jeht: #{M#Mm, you're right. I'm sorry that I didn't trust you...}{F#The initiative, huh...? Hmm...}
Paimon: Alright, Jeht, show us your wounds already. We'll help bandage you up!
Jeht: My wounds? Where? Pfft... That's right. They're everywhere! ...Seriously though, I can keep going.
Traveler: Don't try to downplay it. Let us have a look.
Jeht: #{M#*sigh*... Okay. Sorry...}{F#Mm... Okay...}
Black Screen Text: And so, you all decide to rest briefly and start a campfire...
Black Screen Text: #{M#After carefully tending to Jeht's wounds, you get some rest together with her by the campfire.
Though no words are spoken, you both know what must happen next.}{F#After carefully tending to Jeht's wound, you get some rest together with her by the campfire...
Jeht sleeps peacefully by your side. The mixed odors of blood, sweat, and burning poplar branches cannot fully mask the scent of spices she carries.
Light snoring and raving nonsense intertwine in her dreams — she must truly be tired.
Even without speaking to one another, you both know what must happen once she awakes.}
Jeht: ...Let's go. Let's find Babel and have her explain everything to us.

## Talk 9

Babel: ...It's you, Jeht! You're... You're back.
Jeht: Yes, we're back, alive. I'm sorry.
Babel: It does my heart good to see you return safely... You must be in need of some rest. Come, let me see what I can do.
Jeht: I don't need to rest. I need answers.
Jeht: Why did you lure me into the northerners' trap? Why did you send other members of the tribe to kill me? Why do you want me dead?
Babel: ...
Babel: Calm down. Listen, Jeht...
Babel: Do you remember what I told you? Of how the Eternal Oasis is the Tanit's hope, and how it will bestow a prosperous homeland upon us? It is exactly for this cause that you pledged your loyalty to me, no?
Babel: Now that the door to the Oasis is open to the Tanit, we must keep it a secret from outsiders...
Babel: We must ensure that the Tanit are and will remain the most beloved children of the Queen of All Oases... Only thus can we guide the other wandering desert tribes to gather by the Oasis.
Babel: And when they do... Just think about it — faith will allow us to reunite the scattered peoples of the desert and their resources.
Babel: Under the guidance of the Queen of All Oases, we will rebuild a nation of oases in this desert with our own two hands, and once that is done, none of us shall ever have to bow to those city ilk ever again.
Babel: We will be able to build our own palaces, develop an academic system unique to us. We shall even challenge that god who's naught but a mere caged bird!
Babel: Of all those things that I told you, have you not listened to a single word?
Jeht: And I told you that it was impossible! The Queen of All Oases is long gone. She's not in the Oasis, and there's no way we can resurrect her!
Babel: ...
Babel: Preposterous! Even as my most beloved daughter, how dare you spout such nonsense!
Babel: Whether she is alive or dead, whether she can or cannot be resurrected... As long as the Eternal Oasis is under my control, all such things will be mine to decide.
Babel: I shall be the sole Prophetess of the slumbering goddess, the Tanit's law shall be divine edict, and the prosperity of the Tanit shall be the pre-ordinance of her divine oracles.
Babel: But before all that comes true, Jeht... It's not yet too late to repent. You are my most beloved daughter, and I wish to set you back on the right path.
Jeht: I—I don't understand. What do you mean?
Babel: I've made my point clear: The one and only oracle demands absolute obedience. The only ones who haven't been blinded by the truth of the Oasis are you and your outsider friend.
Babel: And this outsider remains the Master of the Jinni. Though the Jinni herself has long gone silent, we can gain control over her as long as we get rid of her master.
Babel: Of the two of us, it is I who respects her ancient wisdom and the power to rebuild the Oasis. It is more fitting, therefore, that we gain mastery over the Jinni.
Paimon: Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Babel: You dodged the question last time... and that is understandable.
Babel: But today, you must make a choice: Tanit, your home, or this outsider, this friend of yours.
Traveler: Wait. Are you saying that you discussed how to get rid of me previously?
Jeht: #Yes... But I refused. {M#I mean, come on! You're my friend, after all.}{F#I mean, how could I? You're so important to me.}
Babel: #I'm sorry, my child, but sacrifice is necessary... I shall not let {M#his}{F#her} noble blood be shed in vain. On that, you can have absolute faith in me.
Babel: As for you, Jeht, you will become my successor, and one day, you will be the Tanit's new Matriarch and Nabu Malikata's Prophetess.
Babel: Please, consider my offer. The future of our home lies in your hands, my daughter. Merely ask it of me, and I will give you time and one more chance.
Jeht: There's no need. I've made up my mind.
Paimon: Um, you sure you don't want more time? This situation's, like, super tense!
Jeht: Babel, I appreciate your help all throughout this time... Though I'm well aware of the fact that I'm the daughter of a traitor and an outsider.
Jeht: I couldn't be more grateful... for your arrangements.
Jeht: ...The things that I've done for you, the voices I've silenced for you, the elders who disappeared...
Jeht: Elder Bleda, the one who liked crocodiles... surely you remember him? He treated you like his daughter, and he doted on me as well... That's why I could plunge a poisoned dagger into his chest.
Babel: ...
Jeht: Elder Gwaffah was such an eyesore to you, and you were that to him, too. And sadly, it was me in the end with a Sumpter Beast's jawbone. Again, and again, and again, and again...
Jeht: That was the first time I had ever been scared to tears. I was so afraid of myself. I still remember how you wiped my tears away...
Paimon: Hold on... Are you saying...!? ... How could that be...
Babel: Wait. Why are you bringing this up? Why do you have to bring this up in front of them?
Jeht: Ah, and there was also Elder Teyya. She was young and beautiful, and she was the head of the hunting party... a more capable competitor than you.
Jeht: She thought I adored her, but I was loyal to you, for I believed that you alone were my true family. I believed that you could wipe my tears away once more and give me a home.
Jeht: So I made her disappear in the desert...
Babel: And what is the point of this meaningless talk?
Jeht: You are the "sole oracle of the goddess" and my "mother." Why should there be any secrets between us?
Jeht: If you wish to hear more, I can spell every one of my deeds out to you, and to all the Tanit.
Jeht: Everything I've done for you, my mother, and for this family.
Jeht: #I've done enough, and I'm fed up with it. I won't betray {NICKNAME}.
Babel: You're mad... How dare you slander me, your Matriarch! You've forgotten your mother's name! Silence — I bid you be silent now, before it is too late!
Jeht: My mother's name is Ufairah — Ufairah Hindi. She was an honest person.
Babel: ...
Babel: Ah, so it was true, then. The traitor's daughter could never be anything but a half-grown mongrel... just like her father.
Babel: Jebrael and that outsider woman have already paid the price for the unforgivable things they did, and now, their daughter repeats their errors. I should've seen that coming!
Jeht: Ufairah Hindi, that's her name... And it will be mine as well.
Babel: Traitor! All my teachings were for nothing! May the desert mark your treachery!
Babel: Enough! My kin, you know what to do.
Babel: She has angered... and saddened me.
Paimon: #Huh...! Hold on! Don't get so worked up! Didn't you just say that you see Jeht as your daughter... Besides, {NICKNAME} has helped you so many times...
Paimon: A—Anyway, there's still gotta be a way to come to an understanding, right?
Jeht: Paimon, hide yourself.
Jeht: Keep your eyes closed... and don't dirty your white clothes.

## Talk 10

Paimon: You can always trust us, Jeht!
Jeht: I know... It's just that I'm left with nowhere to return to again...
Traveler: But put another way, you're now free to call anywhere you wish home.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Pfft, if it were me back then, I'd have thought that you were mocking me! *sigh* But you're right.
Jeht: You're right... Now, I'm the head of my own house.
Jeht: I'm no longer a servant bound by the name "Tanit." I'm now the master of the name "Jeht."
Paimon: ...
Jeht: I've reclaimed my mother's name... I'm free. Perhaps "Jeht" will also become the name of a new clan someday... Maybe? I dunno.
Jeht: My mother's name gives me pride, and my father's name also holds many memories for me. As long as I remember them, even in this barren desert... Will that not be the home I was seeking all along?
Traveler: Now, "home" need not be a cause of anxiety for you.
Jeht: Thank you.
Jeht: Uh... You know what? Actually, I'd love to go on more adventures with you... Haha, never mind that. You must've had enough of me after all the dangerous situations I put you in...
Jeht: But... I can tell that you have your own journey ahead, a travail of greater solitude and a far grander objective, both of which are beyond what I can bear or imagine.
Jeht: As for me, I've also set myself on a certain path. You've seen it already... It's not gonna be a peaceful one. And I won't drag you down with me.
Paimon: ...C'mon, Jeht, you're not "dragging us down" or anything...
Jeht: Anyway, if you ever feel tired or want to take a breather... I believe that our paths will converge one day.
Jeht: At that time, I might even invite you to go on a crazy adventure with me again.
Jeht: Phew... I've done enough talking... It's time to leave. There's nothing left here but heartbreak.
Black Screen Text: #{M#You hug Jeht before parting ways with her in the desert.
She holds you tightly, and you notice that she seems to be holding back sobs...
However, she quickly draws back and rubs her wet eyes before smiling broadly at you once more.}{F#You hug Jeht before parting ways with her in the desert.
She holds you tightly, almost as if afraid that a blinding sandstorm would sweep you away. You notice that she seems to be holding back sobs...
Then she pushes you away lightly and rubs her wet eyes before smiling broadly at you once more.}
Black Screen Text: "May we meet again under a lovelier sun," she says.
Black Screen Text: Jeht turns away and leaves.
You see Benben, only now emerging out of the ruined camp, hurry to catch up with Jeht.
