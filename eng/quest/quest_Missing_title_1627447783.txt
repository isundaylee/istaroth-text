# Missing title (1627447783)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Why have you got your fishing rod out over here? Are you really fishing?
Iara: There's water, and a rod... of course I'm fishing. To think that you outsiders don't even know that... What's this world coming to, seriously?
Traveler: I don't think this has anything to do with global trends...
Paimon: That's right! We're not complete amateurs at fishing either, y'know!
Paimon: What Paimon meant to say is... Y'know, that it's kinda weird for a Melusine to be using a fishing rod. Paimon didn't think you fished like that.
Iara: I—I'm not being weird! I learned this from an outsider. Delaroche is a great person. She not only taught me how to fish, but she also gave me a rod too!
Iara: Hers looked nicer, of course, but that's fine — she's a "professional," and I'm just a "hobbyist."
Iara: Still... I've been waiting here for so long. Why haven't I gotten a bite yet?
Paimon: Hehe, in that case, why don't you let us pros help you figure out where you're going wrong!
Iara: Huh? Are the two of you really better than Delaroche? She's a professional with a very pretty fishing rod...
Paimon: Hmph! Looks like we might have to prove our skills, eh?
Traveler: But are there actually any fish here?
Paimon: Huh. Now that you mention it, there really aren't any! Paimon thought that was weird right from the get-go, too.
Iara: Fish... Delaroche did say that not all waters have fish in them. Um, does "that" count as a fish?
Iara: If "that" isn't a fish, could it be the reason I can't "fish" it up in the first place?
Iara: #Master {NICKNAME}, Master Paimon, please, tell me. What must I do to fish "that" up?
Paimon: Um, you... sure are polite! Well, of course we'll help you — but first off, what's "that" thing you're referring to?
Iara: It moves very quickly in the water, and it's so slippery that it's really hard to catch.
Traveler: That does sound like a fish.
Paimon: But it could also be some other underwater creature, right?
Paimon: Well, whatever the case, we can be sure that it's something that lives in the water, but since we can't really see its silhouette, it must be hiding deep down.
Paimon: The way Paimon sees it, we need to spread some bait out and get it to come to the surface...
Iara: But it ate so much bait already... I'm not sure if switching baits will help.
Paimon: Well, let's just spread some out first and prepare our rod, then wait for it to bite. We don't know what it is yet, but oh well.
Iara: #What beautiful technique... Let me try again. I'll give you the bait, Master {NICKNAME}, Master Paimon, and then I'll ready my rod... Even though it's not a professional's pretty rod...
Paimon: Oh, that's not a problem. Just leave spreading the bait out to us!
Traveler: Sounds like a Melusine, really.
Paimon: Seriously? Wouldn't it be weird if Iara and other Melusines were to play pretend fishing games together?
Traveler: I'm sure Paimon knows what fishing is.
Paimon: That's true, you did fish Paimon out of the water back then, didn't you... Wait a minute, that's not the problem here!

## Talk 2

Iara: ...Will it still be attracted to bait?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Black Screen Text: Iara places the weakened Ball Octopus into a waiting bucket...
Iara: What lovely fishing technique... But this creature is now no longer beautiful. How did this happen?
Paimon: Sorry... We didn't think the "thing" you were talking about was a Ball Octopus, so we, err...
Traveler: It's my fault.
Paimon: Yeah, you were way too hasty! Well, Paimon didn't stop you either...
Iara: Don't apologize. It is in the bucket now, and that's enough for me.
Paimon: If you say so... But seriously, how did a Ball Octopus end up here? Did it follow the flow and then fall in by accident?
Iara: I caught it outside.
Paimon: Wait, what?
Iara: I wanted to be sure of my skills at using the fishing rod, which is why I went to go catch that... "Ball Octopus," I think you called it.
Iara: If I put it in here, I'd be able to fish it up whenever I wanted.
Iara: ...Or that was the plan, anyway. But I waited and waited, and it wouldn't bite no matter what.
Paimon: It's kinda concerning how you captured one and put it in a pool to practice fishing with a rod...
Paimon: But we just spread some bait out into the water, and it came out just like that. Didn't you think of doing something like that, Iara?
Iara: I tried many different types of bait, like minced meat, bread crumbs, worms, mints, components... It would just eat them and then disappear. I was even starting to think that bait had no effect on it!
Paimon: Components!? That, err, doesn't sound like bait...
Traveler: Best not to feed strange things to aquatic products...
Paimon: That's right— Hang on, what kinda name is "aquatic products"?
Iara: Hmm. Components are very, very important. Since they're not meant to be used as bait, I need to find a way to get them back.
Iara: #Anyway, Master {NICKNAME} and Master Paimon, please take this component as thanks for your help!
Paimon: Oh, it's fine, we didn't do all that much, anyway...
Iara: Eh? But Delaroche said that you need to call people "Master" when you ask them for help, and that they will like it when you pay them "consultation fees." Is that not the case?
Iara: Please, take this dry component. It will be very useful to you in Merusea Village.
Paimon: Well, if you say so, Iara... Thanks a lot!
Iara: Yes. I hope that I can learn more beautiful fishing techniques from you two in the future as well.
Traveler: So Ball Octopuses can actually eat mechanical components...
Paimon: Isn't this more like "eaten by mistake"?
Traveler: I was concerned that it might attack us...
Paimon: Yeah... When there's danger at hand, you've gotta strike first, y'know. But, well...
