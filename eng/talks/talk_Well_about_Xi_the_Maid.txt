Traveler: Well, about Xi the Maid...
Master Hui: Don't bring her into this. I may have lost my bet at The Jade Mystery over a hundred times, but this is what they call gaining experience... was there ever a venture that was all gain and no loss, anyway?
Master Hui: But my stubborn old man wouldn't listen. He booted me out in a fit of pique!
Master Hui: At least Mother understood me, and sent Xi after me with some traveling expenses.
Master Hui: ...But she only ever gives me a little every day. I have to save for half a month before I can open one stone!
Master Hui: Hmph. Well, no matter. Soon, I will be back in the saddle... no, I shall be on the rise!
