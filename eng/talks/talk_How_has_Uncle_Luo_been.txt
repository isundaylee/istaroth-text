Traveler: How has Uncle Luo been?
Grandpa Lu: Luo? He's been going down to the fields, making business deals, checking inventory... Basically, he's either sleeping or working.
Grandpa Lu: And he still takes it out on Jin all the time.
Grandpa Lu: I have to say, though, that while he might make mistakes from time to time, he's willing to learn, and that makes him a good egg. Luo can be mean sometimes, but he's training Jin as his successor in earnest.
Grandpa Lu: It's up to Jin himself whether he can stand Luo's temper or not.
