Lyney: Oh boy, I fumbled that one... It's hard not to get caught up gazing at your facial expressions when I'm sitting right across the table from you. I lost track, and completely forgot to play my strongest card!

Lyney: Figured out how I did it? No? Don't worry, I'll explain. First, you have to put this card over here, and then...
