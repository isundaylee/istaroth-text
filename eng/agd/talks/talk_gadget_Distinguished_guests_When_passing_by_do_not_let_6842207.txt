Jiulue Teahouse Advertisement: Distinguished guests: When passing by, do not let the opportunity to drink in this stunning scenery while drinking quality tea pass you by! Please have a seat, and let our fine establishment serve you the finest teas of Qiaoying Village, washing away your fatigue and soothing the body and mind!
Message: "The tea is actually pretty good, but the storytelling is terrible. What was that story I heard last time...? Fujin's Three Captures of the White Snake?"
Message: "That's nothing less than a story about the Great Adeptus Fujin! How can it be revised so haphazardly? Alas, moral and artistic standards are degenerating by the day, and the character of people today is far inferior to that of their ancestors..."
Reply: "There seems to have been a misunderstanding, dear customer. "Three Captures of the White Snake" is a famous old tale from Liyue Harbor. We couldn't change it even if we wanted to."
Reply: "If the story is not to your taste, we'll be telling "Jade Tales" in two days time. We hope you'll return to patronize our establishment."
