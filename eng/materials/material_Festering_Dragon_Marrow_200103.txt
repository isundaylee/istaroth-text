# Festering Dragon Marrow

Specialized refinement material for Festering Desire.
This is the product of purifying Durin's vile venom, which has seeped into and spread throughout Dragonspine's ley lines. By using it on a bloodthirsty sword with a strong affinity for such materials, you can increase that sword's power.
