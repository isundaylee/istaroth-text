Traveler: About the Corps of Thirty...
Shahin: They're the biggest group of the Eremites in Sumeru, and they mainly focus on work in Sumeru City. Even the color of their clothes isn't the same as ours, they look so much more stylish.
Shahin: I don't know why they're called the Corps of Thirty, I've seen far more of them than that.
Shahin: Maybe it's because they frequently collaborate with the Akademiya, and that air of seriousness has rubbed off on them, so I don't really like them.
Shahin: *sigh* What's the point of saying all of that... Aren't I working for the Akademiya too... Haha...
Shahin: Luckily, I'm not anywhere near the sages, so I have a little more freedom.
