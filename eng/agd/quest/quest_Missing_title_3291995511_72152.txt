Treasure Hoarder's Notes: "...This used to be where the great pirate Rinzou stored his treasure. The lads moved the last few chests out..."
Treasure Hoarder's Notes: "...Rinzou was a cunning man in life, though, and he left all manner of special symbols on the island..."
Treasure Hoarder's Notes: "...It might be a smokescreen, or there might really be treasure. But we'll only find out if we go there and see for ourselves..."
Treasure Hoarder's Notes: "...We've found some of those symbols. Well, time waits for no one. Best we go dig up Rinzou's full hoard!"
Paimon: Wow, this is... really long... Paimon really can't be bothered to read any of this other than the bit about treasure...
Paimon: Wait... Treasure!?
Paimon: C'mon, Traveler, there's treasure to be had! We can't let the Treasure Hoarders get ahead of us!
