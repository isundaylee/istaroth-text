Eloffe: Welcome to Chioriya Boutique. Is there anything you need?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Chioriya Boutique...
Eloffe: This clothes shop was opened by Ms. Chiori, a renowned Inazuman designer.
Eloffe: She has gained great favor in Fontaine's fashion world by incorporating elements of "resistance" and "revolution" into her designs.
Eloffe: I know this sounds like tooting one's own horn, but it is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Chiori has sparked a real fashion craze here in our nation.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Eloffe: I'm Eloffe, a staff member here at the boutique. I'm in charge of taking pre-orders and receiving clients... and placating them, at times.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't really need anything at the moment.
Eloffe: I look forward to your next visit.

## Talk

Traveler: Placating clients?
Eloffe: Our boss's manner of speech is... on the straightforward side. Takes some getting used to, if you catch my drift.
Eloffe: But not to worry. Chioriya Boutique's work is always up to standard.
Eloffe: This is why some customers might leave in a huff, but they'll be back in a few days to commission clothes all the same.

## Talk

Eloffe: Ah, it's you. Welcome. What can I do for you today?

## Talk

Traveler: How's business been lately?
Eloffe: Thanks to you, Ms. Chiori's fashion show was a smash hit.
Eloffe: Since then, we've launched a large number of new products, and customers have been pouring in like a waterfall. If anything, we haven't got enough manpower to handle it all.
Eloffe: Ms. Chiori has even mentioned that she'd like to go on a trip with you sometime.
Eloffe: Ah, but be sure not to tell her that I was the one who told you.
