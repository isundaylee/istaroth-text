# Cooking, a Pleasant Memory


## Talk 1

Arasaka: You consume the dew and grow up quickly...
Paimon: Hello! You're Ara... Ara... What was it again?
Traveler: Are you Arapacati's elder brother?
Paimon: That's smart!
Arasaka: Grow, grow, turn into a delicious dish...
Paimon: He doesn't seem to notice us...
Traveler: Arasaka.
Paimon: Arasaka! Are you Arasaka?

## Talk 2

Arasaka: Eek! Nara... So tall, so scary...
Arasaka: Please, I beg you... Don't pluck them...
Paimon: Okay, we won't do it.
Arasaka: Great. Hehe... I grew these Zaytun Peaches little by little, ever since they were seeds...
Arasaka: Wait, no! Bad Nara! How could you do that to someone else's Zaytun Peaches?
Arasaka: Wh—Why does Nara have such a terrible habit...?
Paimon: We didn't do anything and haven't picked them!
Arasaka: It's already scary when you guys didn't do anything. If you had really done something, it would scare me to death!
Paimon: Hey!
Arasaka: No, no, Arasaka... Think about it. You've worked so hard on these Zaytun Peaches for your cooking training... You cannot back out here. You are not scared...
Paimon: So, you're Arasaka.
Arasaka: Oh! H—How do you know my name... Where you Nara all come from... T—To know my name at first sight...
Traveler: You said it yourself...
Arasaka: Problems are caused by a loose tongue. It's over! My name will be used in terrible curses... Please, please, spare me...
Arasaka: Other than giving you the Zaytun Peaches, I will do anything...
Paimon: Easy now. We're actually here because of Arapacati's request.
Arasaka: Ara—Arapacati? Ah, my dear "younger sister," sunlight in the dense forest...
Black Screen Text: You bring Arasaka up to speed on the events so far...
Arasaka: Ugh... How come Festival Utsava is already approaching... Oh, are you two the Nara who have come to participate in this Festival Utsava?
Arasaka: Sorry for calling you bad Nara. You must be good Nara because only good Nara can enter Vanarana and participate in Festival Utsava.
Arasaka: Festival Utsava is coming. If I give up my cooking training and return to Vanarana now... No... But I can't skip Festival Utsava either...
Paimon: Why are you getting more nervous instead? Don't you still have the Zaytun Peaches you planted?
Arasaka: Th—That's not enough!
Arasaka: There has to be the "taste of happiness." Without it, Zaytun Peaches will just be Zaytun Peaches...
Arasaka: Arachatora, Arapas, and Araphala all don't believe that the "taste of happiness" exists. I will make it and show them. And I want Nara to try it too.
Traveler: "Taste of happiness"?
Arasaka: Hehe, "taste of happiness"... I tried it once.
Arasaka: "Taste of happiness." It's white, crumbles when you rub it... Turns into white Valuka, but is not hard and painful like Valuka. Stored in a hard bubble.
Traveler: White Valuka?
Paimon: White Valuka refers to white sand, right? Uh, but what's a hard bubble...?
Paimon: Paimon can't figure it out. Where can we find that "taste of happiness"?
Arasaka: Wh—Why are you asking me? Do you want to take the "taste of happiness" before I do? How scary...
Traveler: We only want to help you...
Arasaka: Help me? With what? I—I can get it myself...
Arasaka: It's just that there are a lot of Nara walking about, and one that smells like Nara Valuka. Ugh... Too many Nara! I'm scared... If there were fewer Nara, I could do it then...
Arasaka: ...Okay, true, I can't get it. I... don't dare to enter Gandharva Ville. There are too many Nara there, and all the dead trees. I'm scared.
Arasaka: I have a Nara friend living inside. But a long, long time has passed. He's changed now and can't hear my voice.
Paimon: So the "taste of happiness" you're talking about can actually be found in Gandharva Ville.
Arasaka: The "taste of happiness" is not grown from the ground but made by Nara.
Arasaka: I really want to taste it again. I still remember the first time I tasted it and how happy I was. It was an amazing, amazing taste.
Arasaka: We were in the forest together with the Nara friend, counting the number of patches of sunlight that fell between the leaves.
Arasaka: We sang together and tried the "taste of happiness" together. Every time I see the sunlight on branches, I will think of him. Every time I think of him, I remember the "taste of happiness."
Arasaka: So, I want to let Arapacati taste it. And when Festival Utsava starts, I want Nara to taste it too.
Paimon: #Paimon sees. Then leave it to Traveler and Paimon! Right, Traveler?
Traveler: I want to have happiness too.
Arasaka: Really? You are not lying to me?
Paimon: Nope!
Paimon: But there are so many people in Gandharva Ville! Who should we ask for clues?
Arasaka: I know. Not long ago, I saw a Nara passing by here, *going to Gandharva Ville*. And he had it with him.
Arasaka: He had a bulging thing on his back. It's what Nara use to carry things.
Paimon: A bulge on the back... Hm. *It is probably a bag or a back basket*.
Paimon: Got it! We'll help you find the "taste of happiness" now!
Traveler: Since I've promised Arapacati...
Traveler: Aah! Paimon, you're so scary!
Paimon: Hey! Paimon just wants to help Arasaka!
Traveler: Hard bubble?
Traveler: The "taste of happiness" you're talking about is...
Traveler: We knew a long time ago.
Arasaka: What!? A long time ago!? So you had your eyes on me long ago... Wh—What do you want from me...
Arasaka: Could it be the Zaytun Peaches? No! You can have anything else! But not my peaches!

## Talk 3

Arasaka: H—How was it? Did you find the "taste of happiness"? It's in Gandharva Ville...
Arasaka: There's a Nara with a bulging thing on his back. The "taste of happiness" must be inside...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hello!
Iaanesh: Oh, hello... How can I help you?
Paimon: Right, we actually want a certain thing...
Iaanesh: Heh. Of course, everyone comes here to get "a certain thing." But just saying "a certain thing" doesn't mean I know what this "certain thing" is.
Paimon: Oh... Paimon gets it. Let Paimon put it this way: We want...
Traveler: Something white and cubic...
Iaanesh: White and cubic?
Paimon: Right, and it crumbles like sand when crushed, and it has to be packed in a hard bubble!
Iaanesh: What a peculiar description...
Iaanesh: It's not clear what it is from what you said, but what does this white and cubic thing you've described do?
Iaanesh: The use of the thing. You know what it's used for, right?
Traveler: It's edible...
Iaanesh: An edible, white, and cubic thing...?
Iaanesh: Oh! I know! I know what you want... Hahaha...
Paimon: What's so funny!?
Iaanesh: Aha, hahaha! White, cubic, crumbles when crushed, becomes sand... and can be eaten...
Iaanesh: Isn't it just "sugar"!?
Iaanesh: The hard bubble... Are you talking about the glass bottle that sugar is stored in? My goodness! Hard bubble! Hahahahaha...
Paimon: What? So it's sugar...
Traveler: I'm a little embarrassed...
Iaanesh: Ooh, I laughed so much I cried. I've focused on my business the past few years, and I don't even remember when was the last time I laughed like this...
Iaanesh: Speaking of which, it's really nostalgic. I remember a long time ago, when I was still a child, I once had a friend who ate sugar for the first time, and the friend said similar things.
Iaanesh: "This white cubic thing is delicious! So awesome! The taste of happiness!" He was really amazed then.
Iaanesh: Haha... It was so long ago, and now that I think about it, I don't even remember what he looked like.
Iaanesh: Oh! I'll give you this bottle of sugar as a gift in return for the laughter.
Traveler: Thanks.
Iaanesh: Hold it carefully. The hard bubble might be hard, but it can still break if dropped. "Hard bubble"! Hahahahaha!
Traveler: This is awkward...
Traveler: It's for cooking...
Iaanesh: Cooking, white, cubic... Is it a seasoning?

## Talk 5

Iaanesh: My family has always been a merchant group on the move, from The Chasm to Sumeru. We import rare gemstones from Liyue, then send spices over.
Iaanesh: Once, because something came up... I can't remember. Anyway, my father left me in Gandharva Ville for a very long time.
Iaanesh: I remember I was in the forest, and I made a friend. We ran around together, then...
Iaanesh: I don't remember what happened later. I can't remember his name, or what he looked like...
Iaanesh: I only remember it being a really happy time. Then my father finally came back, and picked me up. I'd also thought to go back and look for him but I never had the opportunity, and I eventually forgot about this experience.
Iaanesh: If it wasn't for you asking me for sugar, I would have forgotten about all these things. Why would it be like this...

## Talk 6

Arasaka: That's the one! I didn't think you would get it so quickly... Is it real?
Arasaka: You didn't just make something up to trick me, right?
Paimon: It would be a miracle if we were able to make anything that made sense up from your description!
Paimon: If you're worried, just try it yourself.
Arasaka: ...You didn't put anything strange in it, did you?
Paimon: Of course not! Hmph! If you're not trying it, we're gonna take it away.
Arasaka: N—No, wait! Don't take it away. Let me... Let me try...
Arasaka: Don't take it away, alright? I'll try it now, right now... Hmm...
Arasaka: Ah, it's real... This is the "taste of happiness"! Hehe... This isn't the first time I tasted it, and yet I still feel happy.
Arasaka: I didn't expect to ever taste this again... Ah, but...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Arasaka: Well... How should I put this? The "taste of happiness" is the same as before. But for some reason, I don't feel as happy as the first time I tasted it...
Paimon: Could it be that the sugar he gave us was not sweet enough?
Arasaka: No, it's not a difference in the taste. But when I ate it with my friend in the past... That was the first time I tasted the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Somehow I feel that I was much happier back then. Why is that?
Paimon: #That's normal. Even if it's the same dish, the taste is different every time Traveler makes it...
Paimon: Paimon's mood is different every time Paimon eats it too.
Traveler: Indeed.
Arasaka: No, it can't be... There must be a way for me to be as happy as then...
Arasaka: I know! I had it with my friend at the time. So the "taste of happiness" has to be shared with friends for it to be delicious, right?
Arasaka: That must be it. You are good Nara, and you found the "taste of happiness." You, are my friends. I'm going to make it for you.
Paimon: Yeah, we're friends!
Black Screen Text: Arasaka starts cooking right away and adds peaches and sugar into the pot...
Black Screen Text: Arasaka then hands the finished product to you and Paimon.
As expected, it doesn't have much flavor other than the overwhelming "sweetness."
Maybe this is just the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Ah, what a happy flavor. It's exquisite.
Paimon: Yes, this dish is quite...
Paimon: Quite "happy."
Traveler: Too sweet...
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's much too sweet too...
Arasaka: R—Really? Oh, I guess I must've put too much in one go, then.
Arasaka: But... Hehe. It's true that the "taste of happiness" is happier when shared with friends.
Arasaka: It is different from the happiness I felt the first time I had it, but eating it with you guys... I feel a different kind of happiness.
Traveler: Well, as long as you're happy.
Arasaka: I had doubts about you guys in the beginning, but you didn't hold any grudge... and you helped me find the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: I was able to complete my Supreme Delicacy with your help and complete my cooking training...
Paimon: It's nothing, really...
Arasaka: No, how is it nothing? You've helped me so much...
Arasaka: That's right, I know! I'll teach you how to make this dish so you can share the "taste of happiness" with your friends.
Paimon: (Hmm... If we modify the formula and add a little something extra, it should make a good snack...)
Traveler: I need water...
Traveler: I need water.
Traveler: Really?
Traveler: Is there something wrong?
