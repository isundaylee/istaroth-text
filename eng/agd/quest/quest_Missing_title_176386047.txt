# Missing title (176386047)

Traveler: How's your research coming along?
Timaeus: Not too bad, although I haven't had the best of luck recently... My clock is a few minutes too slow, and thanks to that, a whole load of experiments have failed dismally...
Timaeus: It's not much use for keeping time anymore, that's for sure...
Timaeus: But after being used in so many alchemical experiments, it seems to have gained some understanding of the basic makeup and functional principles of the world... Maybe it's undergone some sort of miraculous transformation.
Timaeus: Why don't you take it? Maybe it'll come in handy in your adventures.
