Darcy: Hello! Another beautiful day, isn't it?

## Talk

Traveler: Yes, quite lovely indeed.
Darcy: If only every day could be as wonderful as today is!

## Talk

Traveler: No. If you ask me, it's a terrible day.
Darcy: Don't be like that! The day isn't over yet. Do something that makes you happy. Then you can welcome tomorrow with a smile on your face.
Darcy: A happy end to today means a happy start to tomorrow. Isn't that great!

## Talk

Darcy: Hey there! Is there anything I can help you with?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Darcy: I'm here to help people like you, of course!
Darcy: All you newcomers, still holding the empty forms Ms. Monglane shoved at you, looking around like lost lambs. You need a friendly face to point you in the right direction, don't you?
Darcy: And who better than me, the former "Pretty Face," to perform this task?
Darcy: I'll tell you something on the down low... You can't repeat it to anyone else! Ms. Monglane herself approves of my work. Not that she can admit to it in public, but I know...
Darcy: That's definitely what she actually thinks!

## Talk

Traveler: Heard any interesting rumors?
Darcy: You mean, apart from "Pretty Face" becoming "Dirty Face"? Ooh, let me think about that for a moment.
Darcy: Haha, just kidding. But honestly, I can't think of any rumors. It's all either big news you must have already heard, or tittle-tattle you wouldn't be interested in.
Darcy: Hey, why don't you tell me some rumors?

## Talk

Traveler: I don't need any help with anything. Bye.
Darcy: Seems like you've already settled in here at the Fortress. That's great!

## Talk

Traveler: I have nothing to say. Bye.
Darcy: Well, no news is good news. Everything is so peaceful!

## Talk

Darcy: I'm so happy to see you, friend!

## Talk

Traveler: About Estienne's game...
Darcy: Congratulations on winning!
Darcy: Now that I think of it, I never even saw Caterpillar that much... I didn't know he had that many Coupons! I'm jealous! If only I had that many...
Darcy: I'd treat everyone in the entire Fortress to new flavors of Fonta... No! I'd pay everyone's wages for a day and give them all a holiday!
Darcy: Or maybe I'd sponsor an Invokation tournament? Oh, how can I choose between such good ideas... Oh! Why would I even have to choose? I can do them all!

## Talk

Traveler: I have something to do. Goodbye for now.
Darcy: So diligent! Take care.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Darcy: I actually like living here! When I was outside, I lived a life with my days and nights all topsy turvy, sleepless at night, dispirited and listless during the day...
Darcy: But ever since I arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I've led a regular and healthy life!
Darcy: If you have had similar issues, I recommend you stay a while longer!
