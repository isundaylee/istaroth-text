Traveler: Can you tell me more about Ritou?
Ebina Gonshirou: The entirety of Ritou falls under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commission.
Ebina Gonshirou: While the Sakoku Decree is in effect, an outlander such as yourself must verify your identity and report your itinerary whether you are entering, leaving, or staying.
Ebina Gonshirou: Don't say that I didn't remind you. If you are rude to Miss Kageyama... Ahem, I mean the inspector, you will be deported right away.
