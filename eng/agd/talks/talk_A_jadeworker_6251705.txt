Traveler: A jadeworker?
Deyin: Hah! When I was young, I was one of the best jade artisans in Chenyu Vale.
Deyin: There's always an inextricable connection between beautiful jade and fascinating stories.
Deyin: As such, I would tell my neighbors stories I had heard while carving jade, which made me somewhat famous in the area.
Deyin: Nowadays, I occasionally give my disciple some of my jade works to sell on my behalf.
Deyin: If you go to Yilong Wharf, you can visit my disciple's store. Maybe you'll come away with jadeware piece that tickles your fancy.
