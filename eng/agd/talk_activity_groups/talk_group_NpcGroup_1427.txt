## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Donna: Every time I think that such a thing happened to us, I grow very afraid...
Donna: (If I were to be captured by Stormterror, Master Diluc would definitely come to my rescue...)
Donna: (This... This must be the part where the dashing prince saves the kidnapped princess!)
Donna: (Then... maybe our story will be written about in fairy tales... No, wait, why am I thinking about something like that now?)
Donna: Whâ€”Whatever it is, it was too terrifying for me. Oh, Lord Barbatos, please protect Mondstadt...

Traveler: Who are you?
Donna: ...Huh?
Donna: I'm just an ordinary girl... helping out here...
Donna: (Gosh, am I blushing?)
Donna: (I was daydreaming about Diluc giving me flowers... Was it obvious?)
Donna: Don't... don't look at me like that... There's nothing special about me.
Traveler: Diluc?
Donna: Oh... Did I just... say...?
Donna: I'm sorry...
Donna: I've been daydreaming about meeting Diluc here... so I...
Donna: No, I didn't...
Donna: (What do I do? I love Diluc so much!)
Traveler: Moon Pie?
Donna: Are you here... for the Moon Pies?
Donna: They are a specialty of Mondstadt, a kind of meat pie that is sweet and fulfilling.
Donna: (I could make a delicious Moon Pie and give it to Diluc...)
Donna: (Stop... stop it, Donna!)
Donna: If you have the chance, be sure to check them out!
