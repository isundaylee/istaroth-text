# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello there.
Navayi: Ah, hello! I'm a traveling scholar from Sumeru, and not a local. Pleased to meet you.
Navayi: I don't know how much you know about Fontaine, but I'm still in the process of understanding it myself.
Navayi: You see, Sumeru is a nation ruled by scholars, while Fontaine is a nation led by judges â€” and their social structures are immensely different.
Navayi: Not a bad research direction, eh?
