# Talk Dialog

Wakea Nui: Mom... For all these years, have you really never felt the need to bring everyone together to expand the family business?
Kupo Nui: Hmm? Why would you ask something like that, my child? Everyone in the family is gainfully employed. Won't you say that they're all hard at work in their own individual spheres?
Wakea Nui: That's exactly what I mean! Instead of each focusing on our own thing, why can't we bring everyone together, so we can all work towards the same goal, and help each other grow?
Kupo Nui: Ahh, I see. Well, if that's how you feel, why not bring it up with the group?
Wakea Nui: *sigh*... But none of them are willing to give me the time of day. It feels like they're all happy to just stick to the status quo...
Kupo Nui: Ah, is that so? Then you should also be happy for them.
Wakea Nui: I can be happy for them, I guess, but I'm a little sad for myself. At this rate, I'll never get a second employee for my international travel agency...
