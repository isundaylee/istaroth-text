Traveler: And who are you?
Ishikawa: Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. Due to my family background, however, the choice wasn't mine to make.
Ishikawa: Well, at least the Shogunate and Sangonomiya have agreed to a ceasefire, eh?
Ishikawa: I mean, war isn't like training. It's real swords and spears that are clashing out there.
Ishikawa: This might seem like a joke, but despite my samurai status, I get faint at the sight of blood. I nearly didn't make it off the battlefield several times.
Ishikawa: I can only hope that by the Electro Archon's grass, this ceasefire between the two sides will be a permanent one.
