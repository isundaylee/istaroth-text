# Cleansing Light


## Talk 1

Paimon: The Sacred Sakura's in danger again, huh. Who'd have thought.
Paimon: Keeping the Sacred Sakura safe was Hanachirusato's greatest wish, and now these mangy mutts are trying to destroy it. Time to teach them a lesson!

## Talk 2

Paimon: They're attacking the Sacred Sakura! Stop them!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This color... It's similar to the color when the Sacred Sakura takes damage!
Paimon: Let's follow it, it should be this way.

## Talk 4

Paimon: As expected, there are a load of rifthounds here, too.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Leave them to me.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Where should we go to find a tea set?
Paimon: Having a cup of tea isn't exactly the most urgent thing to do right now... but at the same time, this lovely old man from 500 years ago has been through so much, and it makes Paimon so sad...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I'm also feeling very nostalgic for his tea.
Paimon: Oh, why don't we go to the Kamisato Estate? There'll definitely be a tea set we can borrow there.

## Talk 7

Furuyama: After my eyes went bad, many aspects of daily life became much more challenging. But I always wanted to be a competent tea brewer, right to the end.
Furuyama: *sigh* But now, it looks like I have to rely on you.

## Talk 8

Hirano: Take care, Almighty Shogun. You too, Traveler... And you too, um, uh... yâ€”you take care too, anyway.
