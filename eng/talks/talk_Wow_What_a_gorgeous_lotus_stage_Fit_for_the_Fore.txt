Stream: Wow! What a gorgeous lotus stage! Fit for the Forest Fairy herself, after all.
Almond: Mhm... A wonderful sight indeed. But, uh... Madame Fairy, I believe the dog over there has been staring at us for quite a while...
Nilou: Ah, that's Swoof! Don't worry, he's a good dog. He doesn't bite.
Swoof: Woof, woof!
Nilou: Haha, that's a good boy! I haven't seen you in ages, Swoof. No eating the frogs and hamsters here, okay?
Padisarah: No eating!
Swoof: Woof!
Almond: Ah... Haha, what a, what a well-behaved doggie. You see, Stream? I told you, didn't I? The outside world isn't nearly as dangerous as we feared.
Stream: Mhm, you were right. But with that said, Grandpa Almond... why are you hiding behind me?
