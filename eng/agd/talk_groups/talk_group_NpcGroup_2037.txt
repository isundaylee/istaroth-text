Sisi: Chaoxi, you've finally returned! Let's settle our engagement plans while you're back this time, what do you say?
Chaoxi: Sisi, I literally just got back from sea and I'm completely drained, mentally and physically. Let's talk about it later...
Sisi: But that's what you said last time, and before I knew it you were running off with some other girl...
Chaoxi: Come now, don't be that way. We're just friends, nothing more.
Sisi: If you two are just friends, then what are you so worried about? Why can't we get engaged?
Chaoxi: There you go again! I don't have any intention of getting married yet. It's not that I can't shoulder the responsibility, Sisi, it's just that I don't want to disappoint you, that's all.
Chaoxi: I'm a sailor and the sea is always calling me, there's no escaping it. You might as well just consider me swallowed by the waves already. You deserve someone better.
Sisi: Don't talk like that, Chaoxi. I know that you'll be just fine...
