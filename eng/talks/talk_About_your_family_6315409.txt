Traveler: About your family...
Saimon Eri: Jirou is safe, all thanks to you, and it seems that he's matured quite a bit, too. I shouldn't have to worry about him hanging around those punks again.
Saimon Eri: The old man doesn't seem any different from before he left. Still always nagging about everything.
Saimon Eri: *sigh* Though the Saimon family no longer has a chance to serve the Almighty Shogun, we do know our place and responsibilities. The most important thing for a family is to be safe and happy. Everything else comes second.
Saimon Eri: So don't push yourself too hard, youngster.
