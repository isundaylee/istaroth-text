Nameless Golem: Dominus Cassiodor! Dominus Cassiodor... Is that you?
Osse: ...
Nameless Golem: It is you! Just as I thought! You've finally returned...
Nameless Golem: I was ordered to guard this fortress, but the cruel Vishaps and attacks of the barbarians were simply too much for me, so I was forced back step by step until I arrived here.
Nameless Golem: It seems as though many, many years have passed since then... What tidings from beyond? Were we victorious?
Osse: ...
Nameless Golem: ...Is that so? Then we lost.
Osse: I am sorry...
Nameless Golem: Do not say such things, Honored Dominus. I had already imagined this day might come when I joined the Sebastos's legions.
Nameless Golem: Did the Sebastos not say that he wanted to lead us to break the shackles of "Fortuna"? But is doing so that simple?
Nameless Golem: After all, what we struggle against is fate itself, and defying fate is a feat beyond even the greatest of the gods.
Osse: In the end, all our efforts were in vain...
Nameless Golem: Nay, say not so, Dominus. We took up arms against divine destiny, and our deeds challenged the laws of heaven. We resisted that prophecy, resisted it most valiantly...
Nameless Golem: Though we failed in the end... Someone must have betrayed us, led us astray...
Nameless Golem: Still, the outcome no longer matters. Come what may, our deeds shall be carved into this world's "history"...
Paimon: Hey! Why did he just fall over like that? Can stone people also just... suddenly faint?
Osse: I still do not know his name... It appears his "history" has now reached its conclusion.
Paimon: Wait, that's so sad! Has he just been fighting here, all these thousands of years?
Osse: But now, he is finally at peace. Let us continue onward.
