# Undetected Infiltration


## Talk 1

Yanbo: Stop! Please stop! Let us explain!
Paimon: Aren't you guys just a bunch of Treasure Hoarders? Just turn yourselves in. There's nothing to explain around here!
Yanbo: #Millelith Squad Leader Yanbo of The Chasm District, at your service. It's an honor to meet you, Traveler.
Yanbo: And your... most eminent flying companion.
Paimon: Hey, hey, hey, it's Paimon to you, mister!
Yanbo: Haha... I apologize. I'm very sorry, but I think there's been a small misunderstanding here.
Traveler: So... you're not Treasure Hoarders?
Yanbo: Well, no, just the opposite.
Yanbo: *cough* Well, and you're not wrong to say that this area was indeed one of the Treasure Hoarders' lairs.
Yanbo: After the workers were dismissed, those weasels wormed their way in here... At first, they were just mining, smuggling some Glazed Sand Crystal, and playing hide-and-seek with our patrols.
Yanbo: But they would grow bolder as time went on, even breaking into and occupying the old warehouse that the miners left behind. They even used the tools there to make their own cheap little trinkets to sell! *sigh* Breaks my heart every time.
Traveler: What breaks your heart?
Yanbo: Such rough-hewn trinkets can only be used to cheat first-time visitors to Liyue or some ivory-tower scholars. And I'll bet that they'll try to get them on the market using lower prices, too, perhaps even try undermining some legitimate brands.
Paimon: It's not like they've got any brand power themselves, right?
Yanbo: That's true. I suppose it's a joke in poor taste to think that they'd make good Mora off this...
Yanbo: That's why we came here and took care of the Treasure Hoarders who originally held this position, before disguising ourselves as them and lying in wait... Well, that was a while back now.
Yanbo: We had managed to ascertain thus far that one of their leaders is in contact with a branch of the Fatui, and that they may be preparing a transaction involving dangerous items.
Traveler: About the contact between the Fatui and the Treasure Hoarders...
Yanbo: Although we foiled the Fatui's plots before, they maintain some strength out here in the wilds... Their professionalism and combat prowess are not to be underestimated. Indeed, we consider them opponents of the utmost peril.
Yanbo: If they were to team up with the Treasure Hoarders to go against us, it could pose a very tricky security risk indeed.
Yanbo: Whatever the case, we were fully prepared for an all-out assault. We just needed to catch them all in one fell swoop, and then we'd have known what they were up to...
Paimon: And that's when we arrived...
Yanbo: *sigh* I mean, we knew that you were good, but we didn't think that you were *this* good... You've pretty much incapacitated about half the people under my command...
Yanbo: Of course, we were here for another reason... This is where one of the Bedrock Keys that hold up the Seven-Star Array is located. We couldn't allow that to fall into the Treasure Hoarders' hands.
Traveler: Um, sorry...
Yanbo: Hahaha! It's not that big an issue. It was partly our fault for not recognizing you, anyway... An order came down that we were to let you pass, but we never expected you to get here this quickly!
Paimon: Wow, this guy is pretty easygoing, huh? Does this mean we can leave?
Yanbo: Uh... So, just because I don't blame you doesn't mean that Liyue's laws won't. Hehe, sorry about that.
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Finish your sentence next time, will you?
Yanbo: Hmm, let me see: battery and assault, obstructing the Millelith in their duties, attempting to destroy the Seven-Star Array, and... damaging premises.
Yanbo: Even with the Millelith's consideration... Congratulations, you'll be offered food and board in Liyue for an extra five to ten years!
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Do I get a lawyer?
Paimon: That's right, give us a namelist!
Yanbo: *cough* But, uh, please, let me finish!
Yanbo: However, if law-abiding citizens or outlander guests might use legal means to assist the Millelith in their duties, they can gain the reward and compensation due to them. This, too, is the law of this land.
Yanbo: So don't worry, that fight previously was not utterly in vain.
Traveler: So, what do we get from helping you?
Yanbo: Well, stolen goods should not be so casually moved, but if you're willing to aid us, any items that you may coincidentally find along the way... for example, "a Treasure Hoarder's secret stash" or something, is yours to do with as you please.
Yanbo: We also have some Mora on us, which I hope you won't mind having. It's not a lot, but we weren't counting on needing outside "help" like this either...
Paimon: Sooo that means no jail time and treasure to be had. Is that right?
Yanbo: Yes.
Paimon: Alrighty then, you've got yourself a deal, mister! Lead the way!
Traveler: One moment...!
Yanbo: Alright, don't be too reserved now... I'm going to head to our rendezvous point to await further orders. Catch up soon, or we'll act first.
Paimon: Okay! C'mon, let's follow 'em!
Traveler: Hey...!
Paimon: Come on, we're assisting with official duties, y'know? And there's Mora to be had, too!
Traveler: I haven't...!
Traveler: You know, I could have hit you a lot harder...
Paimon: Hmph! We were just batting some annoying-looking people around, after all! You guys were wearing Treasure Hoarder uniforms, come on!
Traveler: You did that on purpose...
Traveler: Um, looks like we really beat up the wrong people this time...
Yanbo: Well, yes? But as I said, the fault was ours first.
Traveler: About the dangerous items...
Yanbo: My contact says that those Fatui have exchanged a large amount of Mora and material for something the Treasure Hoarders have... But all he discovered was food and daily necessities, which we fear might just be a ruse.
Traveler: You're... Millelith?
Yanbo: Haha, I apologize for the lack of explanations. In fact, we thought that you were saboteurs yourselves.
Paimon: Well, from a certain point of view...

## Talk 2

Yanbo: You're here. Wonderful. I knew you would be willing to help out.
Yanbo: The Treasure Hoarder smugglers should be undertaking their transaction with the Fatui in the large encampment in the east. They have also set up three smaller camps along the way.
Yanbo: According to the information provided by the contact, these are the *cooking quarters* to the southeast, the *weapon stash* further east, and the northeastern *alchemy camp*. If we are able to take these three camps by surprise, we should be able to cut off their supply line.
Yanbo: Thanks to the previous incident with the Jade Chamber, we've had few patrols in this area, so they've had their fun so far, so much so that they've slackened their guard significantly. This is our chance to strike.
Yanbo: It's just that... Our misunderstanding earlier has left us with only enough support to secure one encampment. But if you need it, we will assist all the same.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'd suggest that you hit the *cooking quarters* first.
Yanbo: Alright. We'll move their food supply off with all haste.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I think hitting the *alchemy camp* first will do the most damage to them.
Yanbo: Good. We'll put a stop to whatever they're brewing.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I think hitting the *weapons stash* first will make our lives easier.
Yanbo: Sure. They'll find themselves disarmed soon enough, mark my words!

## Talk 6

Yanbo: Ready? Let's go!

## Talk 7

Yanbo: That was amazing. Thanks for your aid. Right, here's your reward.
Paimon: Woohoo, Mora! Eh? When did you change your clothes?
Yanbo: When you start fighting... Well, I mean, that's not important. But we had to change our uniforms, lest you ended up sending us flying again in the heat of battle.
Yanbo: The Millelith thanks you for your aid, as always. Ah, and as per our contract, feel free to look around and see if there's anything that you need.
Yanbo: Well, other than the things that we've impounded, of course.
Traveler: Congratulations on a job well done.
Yanbo: Well, it was thanks to you that things went quite so well.
Yanbo: Uh, what I mean to say is... As long as you don't take illegal shortcuts like these bandits, we won't come knocking at your door.
Paimon: Hmph. That's not the kind of people we are!
Yanbo: True, true, haha...
Yanbo: *sigh* Back on topic... People like you who can use the elements really are a force to be reckoned with, regardless of whether you mean to do good or ill...
Yanbo: A mission that we would have needed weeks, even months to accomplish, was but child's play to you... If turned to evil, such abilities could produce outsize damage at a very small price.
Yanbo: That's why I don't really rue the fact that I don't have a Vision.
Yanbo: I have seen people who dedicated their lives to seek superhuman power, only to become tools and puppets for others to use as they pleased. Do you think that was worth it?
Traveler: ...
Yanbo: Those without Vision-based powers make up the vast majority of humans, and those who can truly understand and protect them are, similarly, ordinary folk.
Yanbo: As an ordinary person, I am proud to be among those who can protect the many.
Yanbo: Even if someday, Visions ceased to be given out, and even the adepti who defend Liyue Harbor were to pass away... I would not abandon this post of mine.
Yanbo: Ah, um, sorry... I spoke too much. I didn't take up too much of your time, did I?
Yanbo: Alright, we've got checks to do and contraband to mark out, so I guess we'll cut the chit-chat short here.
Yanbo: Once again, I'd like to thank you on behalf of our comrades. May the rest of your journey be smooth-sailing. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
Traveler: So that means we get out of jail free?
Yanbo: Of course, you were assisting the Millelith... I mean, you were apprehending smugglers with the aid of the Millelith. How could we ever put you in prison?

## Talk 8

Yanbo: Don't worry, we'll move these foodstuffs away as soon as possible.
Yanbo: It's up to you now. Good luck!

## Talk 9

Yanbo: Their alchemy equipment is rather amateurish... Most of the tools were rendered unusable after just a few bumps as we were transporting them.
Yanbo: We'll get these things impounded and cleared out as soon as possible. As for the rest down there, we'll need your help.

## Talk 10

Yanbo: Their bows were actually quite well-maintained. That said, they're ours now. I wonder how many years they'll get just for illegal ownership of these...
Yanbo: We're done on our end. The rest is up to you.

## Talk 11

Amateur Alchemist's Diary: "...The third attempt at creating a cannonball fuse has failed. Fortunately, there were no explosions... But the issue remains the same: the reactant concentration is not up to par, and so no explosion can be possible..."
Amateur Alchemist's Diary: "...The third camp needs a batch of chilled drinks, and our Wolfhook stores are running low. This is quite odd. We'll have to count on our brothers in Mondstadt to deliver once again..."
Amateur Alchemist's Diary: "The fourth attempt at making fuses has failed. We discovered that Unmoving Essential Oil bottles can be adapted for use as the Safe Blasting Device's fuse. We could give that a shot..."
Amateur Alchemist's Diary: "...Clitopho has gone missing, and he's made off with our formula to boot! Erge's hopping mad. Looks like someone's about to be in hot stew."

## Talk 12

Flamehead Fan's Formula: "Onions, mushrooms, ginger, garlic, soybeans, lettuce, wild boar meat, pepper, salt... Amounts... as we can spare them..."
Flamehead Fan's Formula: "...And use some Wolfhooks, Valberries, Clitopho's whole stock, use it all! And maybe some of those weird mushrooms we got from down there... and whatever else that's got taste..."
Flamehead Fan's Formula: "...Make sure the bones have been picked clean, and don't leave any bits that might get caught on the teeth while we're eating the meat!"

## Talk 13

Unsealed Letter: "...Excuse my lack of graces, but please, old man, you're getting on in years, and your eyes and legs are both not what they used to be... Stop following us young lads up and down the mines..."
Unsealed Letter: "Things haven't been looking too good recently, but some of us have scrounged up some Mora for you. Should be enough for you to get out of the business. With your artisanship, you should be able to find decent work in Liyue Harbor and never have to worry about making ends meet in your old age..."
Unsealed Letter: "...Don't worry 'bout us! The lads have all grown up. We can handle ourselves. Please, old man, just take this as a little somethin' from us to you..."
Unsealed Letter: "Brass Bull Zhao"
