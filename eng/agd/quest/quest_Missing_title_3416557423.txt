## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, that's a ton of fish!
Pania: #Wait, don't move, Big Bro Blondie! Those are bait to attract Flowcurrent Birds!
Paimon: Uh, attract Flowcurrent Birds?
Pania: Yeah! Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
Iwai: Hrroo, roooh!
Pania: Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.
Iwai: Rroo...
Pania: Anyway, our original plan was to come down here to play. I mean, no one else usually comes down here other than Uncle Rongo anyway, so this is our super secret base... or something like that!
Pania: But we didn't think that these birds would steal a march on us today.
Pania: And that's why I've got all this fish ready to lure them over with. Flowcurrent Birds love the stuff!
Traveler: Really? They don't seem all that attracted by it.
Pania: Yeah. Could be that we're too far away, and they can't smell the fish? If only we could get 'em ashore somehow...
Pania: If Uncle Rongo was here, he'd say something like *"Just boop them all ashore, why don't you?"*... Iwai and I don't have the raw strength for that though. They'd blow us away instead, I'd bet.
Paimon: #Hmm... Why don't we give that a try instead, Traveler? If we could get them to come ashore, they might be attracted to the fish then!
Traveler: I see, so "Paimon" is in fact a subspecies of Flowcurrent Bird...
Pania: Round like a roly-poly, and fond of fish... Yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
Iwai: Mmm! Mmmm!
Paimon: What? No! Anyway, back to the point — you haven't lured any Flowcurrent Birds over at all!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, there's so much fish! What are you all doing here?
Pania: #Hmm? Oh, hey there, Big Bro Blondie! And your, uh... White... little sister, I guess?
Pania: Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
Paimon: Return to shore? Really?
Iwai: Hrroo, roooh!
Pania: Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.
Iwai: Rroo...

## Talk 3

Pania: #Ah, thanks a lot, Big Bro Blondie! And your, uh... White... little sister? Either way, thanks for getting the Flowcurrent birds back ashore!
Paimon: Uh, and what were you doing here?
Pania: Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
Iwai: Hrroo, roooh!
Pania: Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.

Pania: But we didn't think that these birds would steal a march on us today.
Pania: And that's why I've got all this fish ready to lure them over with. Flowcurrent Birds love the stuff!
Traveler: So that's the situation.
Pania: #Could be that they can't even see the fish I laid out from that far away. If you could lure them ashore, Big Bro, they'd take the bait for sure!
Pania: So, could you do the same thing you did earlier, and get all these Flowcurrent Birds to come ashore?
Paimon: Yup, yup, sure thing. Just leave it to us!
Traveler: I see, so "Paimon" is in fact a subspecies of Flowcurrent Bird...
Pania: Round like a roly-poly, and fond of fish... Yup, I can see where that's coming from.
Iwai: Mmm! Mmmm!
Paimon: Huh? No way!

## Talk 4

Pania: Alright, patience... patience... All we gotta do is wait for the Flowcurrent Birds to come ashore...
Iwai: Hroo, roo!
Paimon: Let's try booping those Flowcurrent Birds ashore, shall we?

## Talk 5

Pania: Thank you! The birds have been attracted by the fish, and Iwai and I can go play now!
Iwai: Hroo, roo!
Traveler: Just glad I could help.
Pania: See you around, then! If you've got time, feel free to swing by and play, alright?
Traveler: Paimon seems to have been attracted by the fish as well...
Paimon: W—Was not! Paimon'll never be attracted to ingredients that haven't yet been cooked into a delicious dish yet... Yup, absolutely not, no way!

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Pania: #Wow, they came after all! Thanks so much, Big Bro Blondie!
Iwai: Hroo, roo!
Pania: I've prepared plenty of fish, so if we could attract all the Flowcurrent Birds over...
Pania (Paimon): Hehe, let's *boop the rest of those birds ashore*, just like before, alright?
