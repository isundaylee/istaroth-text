# Lost in Prosperity


## Talk 1

Rama: Come and have a good look yourself! Traditional spices of the highest quality, made with pride and experience!
Pooria: Haha, you've got a deal! I can't thank you enough for always looking after my business.
Jayant: Believe me, I'm not making this up. Several Eremite mercenary groups are nearly in open conflict, but does the Corps of Thirty care? *sigh* And that's not all, did you know that...
Paimon: Wow, talk about hurly-burly, this place is busy! Guess that's only to be expected for the largest port in Sumeru. Uh, maybe it's because of what Dehya told us earlier, but Paimon can't seem to shake the feeling that there's also danger lurking in these crowds.
Paimon: Let's get our bearings so we can start looking for leads.
Paimon: We know that whatever the Akademiya lost is related to the gods... But other than that, we don't have much else to go on.
Paimon: Hmm... Asfand told us to try posing as Akademiya students while asking around. Paimon checked the Akasha on the way here, and the Akademiya doesn't seem to have any research facilities in Port Ormos.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it... Won't we look even more suspicious going around saying we're Akademiya students AND asking about the stolen item?
Traveler: Right, we should figure that out before doing anything else.
Paimon: Well, given all the people that come through here every day, if there's any information to be found, Paimon bets we could find it in the market. Let's ask around and see what we come up with.
Traveler: Figuring that out could be crucial for the rest of our investigation here.

## Talk 2

Elham: Welcome, welcome! How can I help you two?
Paimon: Hi there, we would like to ask you a question. Uh, do students from the Akademiya ever come to Port Ormos?
Elham: Hehe, of course, especially around this time of year. Students from Sumeru City that are about to graduate often come to Port Ormos to cut loose a little.
Elham: Many people often talk about how hard it is to get accepted into the Akademiya, let alone graduate. But those who finish their studies and go on to become full-time researchers at the Akademiya have it even harder.
Elham: Sure, we may not be Sumeru City, but Port Ormos offers beautiful scenery and a stress-free environment. Some even say it's good luck to come to Port Ormos, so students and researchers come flocking here when things get to be too much at the Akademiya.
Elham: Ah, you see over there? Those are students from the Akademiya.
Traveler: They look pretty serious.
Elham: They've been looking worried and miserable ever since they got here a few days ago.
Elham: If you ask me, the life of a merchant is better. So long as the Akasha teaches us what we need, then life is good.
Paimon: Hmm, those students seem to be discussing something... Let's see if we can listen in.
Traveler: Maybe even a little worried.

## Talk 3

Sidhu: *sigh* It's no good... I've tried asking around, but I haven't been able to learn anything useful. Not to mention that a bunch of scary-looking Eremite mercenaries have been posted along the streets now.
Bandi: There's been a lot of fighting between the different Eremite factions in Port Ormos. If we choose to move on our own, then it would be wise to steer clear of them.
Bandi: Especially the group that's constantly shouting some stuff about "King Deshret" and some "resurrection." I've even heard that the Citadel of Regzar is starting to get fed up with them. What was that group called again...? Ayn something or other...
Kudari: They're called Ayn Al-Ahmar. Today I heard that the thing we're after might be in their possession at the moment.
Sidhu: Wait, come again?
Kudari: Don't you see? Many of the Eremites in Port Ormos deal with trading this kind of thing.
Kudari: They're usually pretty wary of outsiders, but not so with students of the Akademiya. It's because the kind of goods that students are looking for aren't the kind of goods the Eremites are after. As long as they know you're a student, then deals can be made.
Kudari: I've heard that Ayn Al-Ahmar likes to set up shop at the Djafar Tavern. Supposedly, if you're willing to part with half a million Mora, they'll give you info on anything.
Sidhu: Wa—Wait, did you just say half a million!? If information alone costs that much, then how could we ever afford to buy what we're looking for? *sigh* I guess we might as well give up on trying to graduate this way.
Kudari: I wouldn't worry too much. Our field of research is very niche. Who else could possibly be after that kind of shady knowledge? I bet it's practically worthless to anyone aside from us.
Sidhu: Oh, I guess that makes sense. Then the only thing left for us now is to find a way in. Why don't we all just pool our money together and pay for the information?
Paimon: Whoa, did you hear that? A niche field of research and shady knowledge... It all sounds pretty suspicious to Paimon. Is knowledge something people just buy and sell like that?
Traveler: It's very suspicious indeed.
Paimon: So, what's our plan?
Traveler: Let's go to Djafar Tavern.
Paimon: Wait! Didn't you hear what they just said? Buying information is going to cost us HALF A MILLION MORA!!! Have you lost your mind!?
Traveler: Reliable information is worth the price.
Paimon: Oh, alright. Paimon never thought she'd agree to parting with that kind of Mora... But if you know what you're doing, then we should give it a shot.
Traveler: I won't let them off easy if it turns out to be a scam.
Traveler: Let's try talking to one of the Eremites.
Traveler: Whatever was stolen from the Akademiya was also related to "knowledge."

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You sit down and wait for some time...
Eymen: Oh, you've arrived. Please take a seat.
Tariq: So they think that they can go toe to toe with the boss? Hah, once we reclaim the power of King Deshret, they'll be the first that the boss punishes.
Tumart: They're nothing to be afraid of. Our main rival now is The Caracal Battalion. They've also amassed a significant amount of Mora this time, so we mustn't underestimate them.
Tariq: How can The Caracal Battalion compete with the boss when they're nothing but a bunch of money-grubbing opportunists out for a quick Mora?
Tumart: Yeah! With Boss's fervent devotion, he'll be able to use this power to bring our god back this time.
Paimon: Huh, all these guys talk about is King Deshret, so they're probably the ones we're looking for.
Tariq: Hmph, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... That traitor and her followers must not be spared! The day will come when King Deshret exacts vengeance on Sumeru, and all of them shall be punished.
Traveler: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata? A traitor?
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon was wondering what they meant, too. We should ask about that if we get the chance later.
Traveler: What are they talking about?

## Talk 5

Tariq: Huh, who are you? What do you want?
Traveler: I'm a traveler.
Tariq: A traveler?
Paimon: Uh, now's probably not the time to talk about that. Didn't the students say Eremites are wary of outsiders?
Traveler: I'm a student from the Akademiya.
Tariq: A student? Heh, what's a student from Sumeru City doing in Port Ormos?
Traveler: I'm looking for info about a certain... "something."
Tariq: Ahh, well if it's info you want, you've come to the right place. The question is: Can you afford it?
Traveler: Hand him 50 Mora.
Tariq: Huh? What is this, some kind of joke?
Paimon: #Oh, sorry! {M#He}{F#She} must have grabbed the wrong amount... Hey, what do you think you're doing!?
Traveler: Hand him 500,000 Mora.
Paimon: (Ooh, Paimon can't stand to see so much Mora go, but there's no other choice right now...)
Tariq: Heh heh. Here, this is the merchant's address — whatever you're looking for, you'll find it there. ...Hmm? Well, what are you waiting for?
Traveler: I just have... one more question.
Paimon: Oh, that's right. We heard you mention King Deshret just now. We're actually interested to know more, because... Uh, because we're... ah... archaeology students! Hehe.
Tariq: ...Heh, fine. Since you've already handed over the Mora, I guess I can throw in a little extra info.
Tariq: As you can see, members of Ayn Al-Ahmar are devout believers of King Deshret.
Tariq: Years ago, King Deshret founded the great desert nation that was our homeland. It was an advanced civilization, far beyond anything you'll see in present-day Sumeru.
Tariq: King Deshret was the rightful God of Wisdom, but he was betrayed by a companion he trusted... She even stripped him of his title, "God of Wisdom."
Paimon: So you mean the traitor was...
Tariq: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, yes! That shameless wretch destroyed King Deshret's civilization, and our ancestors were forced to flee to this land where we were made to suffer the tyranny of our enemies.
Tariq: Furthermore, she conspired with the Akademiya to cover up the truth of her actions and create the merciful and benevolent facade for which she is now known. Ugh, just thinking about it sickens me.
Tariq: But the story doesn't end there, oh no. King Deshret isn't truly dead. The voice of the Oracle has been heard in the desert, prophesying his resurrection!
Tariq: Mark my words, our god shall return. And when that day comes, all followers of the traitor and all the desert dwellers who have forgotten their true god will suffer retribution together.
Tariq: If what I'm saying makes you shiver with fear, it might not be too late for you to become a believer of King Deshret, hahaha.
Traveler: King Deshret is returning?
Tariq: Hmph, I don't have anything to say to you Akademiya people about that. I think this conversation has reached its end.
Alhaitham: Not just yet. This man is a fraud.
Paimon: Huh!?
Tariq: Ugh, you again! Tch... Deranged Akademiya lunatic!
Alhaitham: Yes, it's me again. I already warned you that if you weren't willing to sit and discuss things with me, I'd take measures to make things... uncomfortable for you.
Alhaitham: Listen to me. That address he gave you is fake — or at least, you won't find a merchant waiting for you there. This group has been boasting all around that they can provide information on a certain "item," as a means of luring people into their territory.
Alhaitham: Once you show up, they keep up the act until they have hard evidence that you want to purchase said item, then they use that to squeeze you for all the Mora you're worth.
Tariq: Hey! Shut it, Alhaitham! What are you playing at, trying to ruin our business like this, hmm?
Alhaitham: I told you the other day: I wish to discuss my terms with your boss.
Tariq: Hah! The boss made it perfectly clear that he won't negotiate with you!
Alhaitham: Yes, and in no uncertain terms. But that was then. It does not preclude him from changing his mind in the future.
Tariq: I'm warning you, don't push us, or this could get ugly! We don't usually get rough with people from the Akademiya because it just complicates things. For a lunatic like you, though, we might just have to make an exception.
Alhaitham: If you're suggesting that we escalate this from a verbal exchange to a physical one, I accept. After all, even the archons used war to negotiate the ownership of Teyvat.
Alhaitham: If, on the other hand, we can't agree on any means of negotiation at all, then I'm afraid my next course of action will sting a little more than the mere falling-through of a few business deals.
Alhaitham: I will jeopardize the Eremites' reputation, which I know you value above all else.
Alhaitham: I am quite confident that if I began to take such action, your boss would willingly approach me himself. However, I fear that by then, some things will have happened that cannot be undone.
Alhaitham: Also, a word of advice... I suggest you tell your boss exactly what happened here today. Otherwise, he might blame you for not telling him in the future.
Tariq: Wh—What did you say?
Alhaitham: Consider this: Have I ever failed to follow through on my word in the past?
Tumart: This guy is really out of his mind...
Tariq: Okay then, if you really have a death wish, let's meet a week from today... The pier in front of the Pharos Lighthouse, four o'clock in the afternoon, sharp. Don't expect us to hold back!
Alhaitham: Not so fast. First, you return the 500,000 Mora to them.
Tariq: Hmph.
Eymen: Please, I beg you, don't provoke them. We can't afford any trouble with this crowd... They haven't even paid for their food yet...
Alhaitham: Ah, Mr. Eymen. There appears to be fewer staff in the restaurant recently. This wouldn't happen to be because they're all busy spreading the word to the students, would it?
Eymen: I, uh... W—Well...
Alhaitham: Someone who chooses to do business with a group like that really can't afford to get so flustered the instant someone confronts them about it. Consider the meal compensation for our silence — I'd say you're getting an excellent deal.
Paimon: Whoa, did you see that? He not only got us our Mora back, but sent the Eremites running, too...
Paimon: Plus, he seems to know a lot about what's going on around here. Let's catch up with him and ask some questions!
Traveler: Can you tell us more about the Oracle?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Wait up! ...It's "Alhaitham," right?
Alhaitham: What do you want?
Traveler: Thank you for your help back there.
Alhaitham: No need for thanks. My goal was to get to them, and you two gave me just the opportunity I needed. We're even.
Alhaitham: Oh, I advise you to keep your distance from them. Since they weren't able to make off with your Mora in the end, they might harass you again in the future.
Alhaitham: *sigh* Alright, goodbye.
Paimon: Hold your horses! We still have something to ask you about.
Paimon: Since you tore through their scam right in front of them, you must know the real story about a... certain something, no?
Alhaitham: Who exactly are you two, and why are you inquiring about that?
Traveler: I'm a student from the Akademiya.
Alhaitham: A student? Heh, right. Look, you should know that those thugs conducting "business" with you had nothing to do with your lie.
Traveler: Perhaps we can also talk terms?
Paimon: #Huh? Oh, yeah! {M#He}{F#She}'s really strong! Weren't you saying something about a "physical exchange"? We can help with that.
Alhaitham: #{M#He}{F#She} doesn't even have a Vision. Forget it.
Paimon: #Maybe not, but {M#he}{F#she} can still use elemental energy! Otherwise, there's no way we'd go asking for info from Ayn Al... Al... hmm, from guys like that!
Paimon: Those hot-headed thugs are definitely gonna bring a lot of back-up for your next meeting. Even if you don't go alone, you won't regret taking us with you!
Alhaitham: Hmm...
Paimon: Uhh...
Alhaitham: Alright, I accept. Got a pen and paper? If you're searching for someone who sells that kind of merchandise, I'll give you one of their addresses, and you can try your luck.
Alhaitham: We'll reconvene at the appointed time by the pier. It doesn't matter if you show up or not.
Paimon: Um... So, since you were happy to give us this merchant's information, does that mean you can tell us exactly what we're after?
Alhaitham: You were willing to part with 500,000 Mora for something, and you didn't even know what it was?
Alhaitham: Okay, well if you truly are as skilled as you claim, then you can beat the answer out of them when they become hostile.
Alhaitham: Look, if you've been making inquiries, then you have to know something by now. Tell me what you know so far, so I don't waste time repeating information.
Paimon: We know it's connected to the Akademiya somehow, and that not only do the Eremites deal in it, but some students wanna get hold of it, too. Umm, what else...
Traveler: It seems like some kind of knowledge.
Alhaitham: You know almost everything there is to know, but you're unable to compile this information because you've never seen the object before.
Alhaitham: This is what you've been looking for.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon can't tell what it is... It looks like some kind of ornament?
Alhaitham: This is a Knowledge Capsule. To put it simply, it's a vessel that can store a fixed quantity of Canned Knowledge. It's like a miniature Akasha.
Alhaitham: Anyone who links it to their personal Akasha Terminal instantly becomes privy to its contents.
Traveler: Anyone?
Alhaitham: Correct, anyone. Unlike the Akasha, which heavily regulates who can access what information, Knowledge Capsules confer their contents without any requisites.
Paimon: That's amazing...
Alhaitham: It's essentially a convenient and harmless vestibule for knowledge. Unfortunately, it's illegal in Sumeru to privately possess or trade them.
Alhaitham: They were created as a means for scholars to transfer knowledge gained from Irminsul into the Akasha, and are intended to be destroyed immediately after use.
Alhaitham: But despite strict regulations, some of these Knowledge Capsules will always escape destruction. After all, there will always be those in this world who are dissatisfied with life as designed for them by the Akasha, and wish to change their fate.
Alhaitham: Over the past century, a wide variety of Canned Knowledge has been leaked from the Akademiya. Now, in Port Ormos, the valuable ones are a means to Mora for the Eremites.
Alhaitham: Meanwhile, those which the Eremites deem to be useless to them occasionally prove useful to the common citizens and hapless Akademiya students.
Alhaitham: Well, I think that about sums it up.
Traveler: I heard that the Akademiya lost something recently.
Alhaitham: Ah, so that's your true objective...
Traveler: I want to learn more about it.
Alhaitham: With our current arrangement, I don't believe I can offer an answer.
Traveler: What do I have to do?
Alhaitham: *sigh* You're still resolved... Fine, let's talk somewhere with fewer people.
Traveler: Perhaps we can negotiate further.
Traveler: Seems like it's a Knowledge Capsule?
Traveler: I know a thing or two about swordplay.

## Talk 7

Alhaitham: Let's continue our conversation here. If you wish to learn more about the Knowledge Capsule that the Akademiya lost, then you must help me with something.
Traveler: What is it?
Alhaitham: I need you to find someone named Dori, a traveling merchant.
Alhaitham: Unlike the peddlers who hawk inferior Knowledge Capsules, she often has quality goods in stock. Some say that as long as there is profit to be made, there is nothing she won't dare to sell.
Alhaitham: She is guarded against people from the Akademiya because most of her wares don't comply with Akademiya regulations.
Alhaitham: I think she blacklisted me. I met with her informant, but it soon became clear that they had no intention of letting me get any further.
Alhaitham: Become one of Dori's customers and earn her trust. This is my condition for further collaboration.
Paimon: Why do you want us to meet with her?
Alhaitham: Until you complete this task, you don't have question privileges.
Paimon: Uh... Fine. So how do we go about doing this?
Alhaitham: You two are outlanders who haven't been here for long, so Dori should view you as "safe" clients. I'll give you the informant's address and their contact password.
Alhaitham: Beyond the password, though, I have no way of knowing what other tricks she might have up her sleeve. You'll have to improvise.
Paimon: Aah, this is kinda nerve-racking...
Alhaitham: The true challenge begins after you meet her. She has a keen nose for Mora and a shrewd eye for wares, and she only likes customers who she deems to have good taste.
Alhaitham: I'll prepare some funds for you. Buy her highest quality wares and earn her approval.
Paimon: But we only just saw a Knowledge Capsule for the first time! We don't know how to tell which ones are good and which ones are bad. Uh... Is that something we can learn quickly?
Alhaitham: Hm, that's true... Have you two heard of Elemental Sight?
Traveler: I can use it.
Alhaitham: Oh? That's a surprise. Guess I'll have to hold you in higher regard. Anyway, that ability should resolve your issue.
Alhaitham: Here are two Knowledge Capsules. Tell me, can you detect any difference in their quality?
Paimon: Umm... They look the same to Paimon.
Alhaitham: Try inspecting them with Elemental Sight.
Paimon: How'd it go? Did ya see anything?
Traveler: They both glow green.
Alhaitham: Rumor has it that higher-quality Knowledge Capsules generally appear brighter when viewed through Elemental Sight.
Alhaitham: That's because knowledge originates from Irminsul, the root of Dendro power itself. The more powerful the knowledge, the richer it is in Dendro energy.
Alhaitham: However, some Canned Knowledge with a high concentration of Elemental Energy is of little use in contemporary times, so those capsules are of little value.
Alhaitham: Using Elemental Sight is merely a stop-gap measure, but it should suffice for earning Dori's trust.
Paimon: That sounds pretty impressive...
Alhaitham: Here's a sheet with the informant's location and contact password, and here is the Mora for purchasing Canned Knowledge.
Alhaitham: Don't be cheap. You'll need to spend to catch Dori's eye. If there's any Mora left over, just keep it.
Alhaitham: Oh, and be sure to exercise some caution. There have been matra present in Port Ormos lately. Your efforts will be for naught if they catch you.
Paimon: Matra?
Alhaitham: They belong to the Akademiya's regulatory body. They also handle cases of illegal Canned Knowledge transactions. Like I said, the Akademiya has banned both their trade and possession.
Alhaitham: The matra are razor-sharp — you're in for nothing good if they lock their sights onto you. If you two want to back out, now's the time.
Traveler: I'm willing to take that risk.
Alhaitham: Okay, then we have a deal. If you succeed in your dealings with Dori, come find me at the Wikala Funduq. We'll have an open discussion then.
Traveler: I'll help you find Dori.
Traveler: The one on the left shines brighter.

## Talk 8

Latish: Hello, what are you two looking to buy?
Traveler: We want to buy some raw Harra Fruits.
Paimon: Wait, are you sure you're remembering that right? Paimon doesn't think it was that on the paper.
Traveler: We want to buy some unripe Harra Fruits.
Latish: Heh, what a unique palate. We have unripe Harra Fruits, but we usually keep them in the back. I'll have someone escort you.
Paimon: Following the paper got us past the first round!
Latish: Raunak, these two want to buy unripe Harra Fruits. Show them to the warehouse.
Raunak: Got it. You two, please follow me.

## Talk 9

Raunak: Before I retrieve your products, I need to confirm a few things.
Raunak: Please forgive me, but we may not have sufficient stock for you today. Earlier, many of our Harra Fruits were taken by mice.
Traveler: I'm sorry to hear that...
Paimon: Hold on, that's not right. "Taken by mice" means they sold out.
Traveler: Congratulations to you.
Raunak: Heh, thanks. If better goods come in, you'll be the first to know.
Raunak: You look like you have some skill. Why don't I pick out some fruits that'll make you dizzy?
Traveler: Dizziness with a side of tinnitus, please.
Paimon: Yep, that's the right answer! ...But eating Harra Fruit that makes your head and ears ring sounds like a bad life decision...
Raunak: Would you like your Harra Fruits to be packaged in the Sumeru City or Port Ormos style?
Traveler: Sumeru City style.
Raunak: I'm guessing that you're going for a more traditional packaging since this is your first time here.
Paimon: Wait a sec, "Sumeru City style" means we're only buying a few things. He won't take us to see Dori if we do that!
Traveler: Port Ormos style.
Raunak: Wow, you two sure are generous customers. We'll be sure to package your products beautifully.
Traveler: I'd prefer something that causes heatstroke.
Paimon: No, that's not it. The paper said that "heatstroke" is the answer to "erudition." Ugh... Eating something that causes heatstroke sounds horrifying...

## Talk 10

Raunak: I'm sorry, but as things currently stand, we won't be able to fulfill your order. Why don't you two think things over?
Paimon: He's cautious of us. Let's take a closer look at the paper that Alhaitham gave us.

## Talk 11

Raunak: Okay, everything has been confirmed. Miss Dori is waiting for you up a— Shoot, it's the matra! Run!
Paimon: What, the matra!? Where? Alhaitham said we're done for if they catch us — we gotta get outta here!

## Talk 12

Dori: Here, over here! You can stop running now.
Paimon: So you were the one who was calling out to us just now. But uh, are we definitely gonna be safe here?
Raunak: These two good customers wish to buy some Harra Fruit, Miss Dori, and if there's nothing else, I'll just excuse myself.
Dori: Oh, very good. Thank you!
Paimon: Huh, wait... You're Dori? Paimon sure thought you'd look a whole lot scarier...
Dori: Hey, whaddya trying to say, Princess Peabrain!? I can be scary enough when I need to be, believe you me! If you don't watch what you say, then you can forget about doing any business.
Dori: But it seems you two have actually done pretty well so far... Not only did you manage to find the informant, your reactions were also pretty sharp. You don't really look like criminals or anything, but I bet my Mora that you've been involved in some shady dealings, haven't you?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's not sure if that's supposed to be a compliment, but we'll take it.
Dori: I can't risk doing business with people who start huffing and puffing after just a few paces — no matter how much Mora they might have. Not only will they get caught by the matra, but they'll also get us into trouble. As decent folks trying to run an honest business, we don't need any of that. Wouldn't you agree?
Dori: So that's why I prefer to have customers like you.
Dori: It's your first time here, but don't worry, I won't ask too many questions. Even if you wish to buy enough Knowledge Capsules to decorate your house with, please — knock yourself out!
Dori: As long as you have lots of round, shiny Mora, then we're all good.
Traveler: Can you show us your products?
Dori: Ah yes, of course, of course! Go ahead, help yourselves — voila!
Paimon: (Wow, she has a trove of Canned Knowledge! Whew... she'd probably be in serious trouble if the matra caught her with all this.)
Dori: What kind of products do you seek, my dear customers? Don't worry, I'm not interested in your reasons for buying — I can, however, offer some suggestions.
Dori: Take this one, for example... "An Analysis of the Sociological Ideology and Dialectics of the Hilichurls." Only three people in all of Teyvat have ever studied it, making it extremely rare! It's on sale now for 350,000 Mora!
Paimon: (Yeesh... Who would wanna be an expert in that topic?)
Dori: Or how about "The Architectural Styles and Construction Methods of Teyvat in the Early Archon War Period"?
Dori: With this one, you can become an expert in historic architecture preservation and find an excellent, well-paying job in nearly any nation!
Paimon: (Now this sounds like it could be useful...)
Dori: Two million Mora and it's yours. No discounts.
Paimon: Whoa! That's a lot of Mora!
Dori: Of course, you are free to pick whatever your hearts desire. The contents and price of each Knowledge Capsule are indicated in small text on the body of each one, down at the bottom.
Paimon: (All right, let's try the method that Alhaitham mentioned.)
Traveler: I'll take this one.
Traveler: And this one.
Traveler: As well as this one.
Dori: Ahhh... You've really got a good head on your shoulders... and quite the eye for quality.
Black Screen Text: You pick and choose a variety of Canned Knowledge...
Paimon: We'll take these, please and thank you!
Dori: My, oh my, you are blessed with a taste for both the exquisite and the extravagant... Customers like you are a rare breed — one in a hundred... No, one in a thousand, even!
Dori: Listen, I have a special offer for you two. If you spend just 100,000 Mora more, you can pick any Knowledge Capsule of your choice up to a value of one million Mora!
Paimon: Say what now?
Paimon: Hey, did you hear that!? Spend another 100k and we get a capsule worth a whole million!
Traveler: Calm down, Paimon.
Paimon: But all the Canned Knowledge we just bought is easily worth half a million Mora. If we spend just a little more, we can get something worth one million Mora. Isn't that a fantastic deal?
Paimon: Think about it, we've gone to all this trouble to get this Canned Knowledge, and so far everything we've bought belongs to Alhaitham.
Paimon: Aren't you even the least bit curious about how this whole Canned Knowledge thing works? We're talking instant knowledge here! Don't you wanna try it yourself?
Traveler: I think you're the one who's curious.
Paimon: C'mon, c'mon! We still have around 100,000 of Alhaitham's Mora left, so let's put it to good use by finding something useful for you. You've got a deal, Dori! We'd like to spend an extra 100,000 Mora.
Dori: Excellent, then please select from this fine collection of Canned Knowledge over here.
Paimon: Uh, hold on a second. Paimon thought we could choose whatever we wanted? Why can't we choose the ones from over there?
Dori: Oh, but my dear customer, the Knowledge Capsules over here are worth one million Mora each. I'm sure discerning customers like yourselves will be able to find something to your liking. Please, take your time.
Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon has a bad feeling about this... Let's use Elemental Sight again to check these.
Traveler: Alright, I'll have a look.
Paimon: So, what did you see?
Traveler: They all seem to be equally bright.
Paimon: So they're all worth about the same amount?
Paimon: Well, anyway, the Mora's already been spent, so let's at least try to find something useful.
Paimon: Let Paimon take a look here... "An Introduction to Traditional Sumeru Brewing Techniques," "The Art of Growing Spices," "An Overview of Ancient Runes"... Oh! How about this one? "Swordfighting Techniques VIII"!
Paimon: Not sure where we'd ever find volumes one through seven, but at least this knowledge should be useful, right? Let's go with this one!
Traveler: Fine by me.
Paimon: Dori, we'll take this one!
Dori: Alright, very good! I'm expecting some new goods in the next couple of days, so be sure to check back again soon! Whether it's Canned Knowledge or anything else you need — bring your Mora to Dori, and doors will open!
Traveler: Whatever makes Paimon happy.
Traveler: Maybe we should just pass this time...
Paimon: Huh? Why?
Traveler: Let's just say for our mental health.
Paimon: Hey, we're getting a capsule worth a million Mora here. Don't be such a party pooper!
Traveler: You just want to see me try it.
Traveler: Don't let her trick you into spending more.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Eymen: Please, just leave. Forget the cost of the meal... Just uh, pretend nothing happened today.

### Additional Talk 2

Sidhu: Half a million... That's a lot of Mora.
Bandi: Do you really think that Ayn Al-Ahmar group can give us reliable info about what we're after?
Kudari: We should discuss things thoroughly before we make any moves.

### Additional Talk 3

Dehya: It's been a while since I've visited the Citadel of Regzar. I'll catch up with Chief for a bit before I head back myself. He really did a lot for me in the past.
Dehya: Remember, to get to Port Ormos, just follow the river south from Sumeru City's port.
Dehya: Just be sure to take care of yourselves out there. We'll meet again at the Sabzeruz Festival.

### Additional Talk 4

Asfand: Hah, you two must really be something if you've got Dehya the Flame-Mane speaking on your behalf.
Asfand: The Corps of Thirty isn't officially overseen by the Akademiya, but because we're hired mercs, there's still lots of sensitive intel that I can't reveal to ya. In the end, when it comes down to it, the city's safety is both the Corps' and Akademiya's top priority.
Asfand: I've told you all I can about what was stolen from the Akademiya... As for why you should pretend to be students in Port Ormos, I'll leave that for you to find out yourself.

### Additional Talk 5

Latish: (Latish smiled and winked at you to keep up with Raunak.)
