Arataki Itto: Look, even if there are a couple o' tough customers lurking around this place, what's there to worry about when you've got Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto on your side, huh? Huh? Haha, there is nothing out there that you need to be afraid of.
Arataki Itto: Let's see who actually has the guts to face me. A couple o' whacks from my club will send 'em all running back whence they came! WAPOW! ...And if not, we'll let Ushi deal with them.
Arataki Itto: Ugh, anyway, no use fighting on an empty stomach. Hey, they do food here, right?
