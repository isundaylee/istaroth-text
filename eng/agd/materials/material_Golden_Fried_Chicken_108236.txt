# Golden Fried Chicken

Fowl that has been seasoned and then fried. The seasonings were made into a paste and smeared onto the chicken before it was fried at high temperature. The fragrance alone brings the vivid image of crispy skin and tender meat to mind. One bite and the luscious juices begin to flow. Truly irresistible.
