Nadia: What are you doing?
Nadia: I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that could arrive at any minute, a boat carrying the thoughts of my loved ones...
Nadia: I'm Nadia from Snezhnaya. I was transferred here because of my work.
Nadia: Sometimes you have no choice but to leave your homeland behind. I do miss my family dearly, so I can only write to them and hope for their replies.
Nadia: So I come here and wait for the boats from Snezhnaya whenever I have a free moment. I guess it's also a way for me to show how much I miss them.
