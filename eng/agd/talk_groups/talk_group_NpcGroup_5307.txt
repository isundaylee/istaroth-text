Virda: I've got to do my best in training... Huh? I don't think I've seen you before. Who are you? Ah, wait, no, let me guess.
Virda: You're tall, and you look completely different from us Melusines... I know. You must be from outside the village!

Traveler: Why do you need to do special training?
Virda: Well, to join the Marechaussee Phantom, of course. Monsieur Neuvillette says that we all have the potential to become Marechaussee agents...
Virda: But you have to undergo strict assessments to become a member for real, so I have to work hard!

Traveler: Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
Virda: Because I want to defend justice as one of their members — and also, their official uniform is super cool.
Virda: Oh yes — my favorite character in "Great Detective Hurlock" is Agent Gina of the Marechaussee Phantom.
Virda: Although her deductions are often full of holes, the effort she puts in to catch criminals for the sake of her future is very inspiring indeed!
Virda: So yes, I dream of becoming a member of the Marechaussee Phantom!

Traveler: Could you tell me what happened to the Eremites from earlier?
Virda: Oh, sure. Sedile contacted the Gardes. They should be in the Maison Gardiennage's custody by now.
Virda: Sedile said that the Marechaussee Phantom is in charge of finding the bad guys — and in the cases that they've been found, we can just directly hand them over to the Maison!
