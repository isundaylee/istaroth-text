# Unexpected Power


## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Ooh! Did you just feel the elements of the world?
Paimon: Seems all you had to do was just touch the statue and you got the power of Anemo!
Paimon: As much as they may want it, people in this world can never get a hold of powers as easily as you...
Traveler: I think I know why, it's because...
Paimon: Ah-ha, it's because you're not from this world to begin with.
Paimon: If we keep heading west from here, we'll eventually reach Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.
Paimon: Mondstadt is the city of wind, because they worship the God of Anemo.
Paimon: So perhaps, because you got power from the God of Anemo, you can find some clues there.
Paimon: #There are also lots of bards there, so perhaps one of them has heard news of your sister.
Paimon: Let's move then!
Paimon: The elements in this world responded to your prayers and Paimon thinks that's a lovely sign.
Traveler: This can't be good...
Paimon: It's a bit rude to say that about the power the gods just gave you!
