# Ascension Challenge IV


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'm here for the Ascension Challenge!
Prince: Meow... (Hmm? Here for the Ascension Challenge? I see... You are indeed qualified for the challenge. Alright...)
Prince: "I'll have Shuyun set up the challenge for you immediately. Do be careful!"

## Talk 2

Prince: Meow! (How wonderful! Congratulations on completing the Ascension Challenge. You're now a Legend player!)
Prince: Meow... (A Legend player, what an admirable title...)
Prince: (I hope you'll keep honing your technique and become a great player who lives up to this grand title!)
Prince: (It might be a bit redundant to say this at this point, but still...)
Prince: #(Traveler, may the fun be with you in the world of Genius Invokation TCG!)

## Talk 3

Prince: Meow... (How unfortunate... Try to be extra careful next time and perhaps make some adjustments to your deck before your next attempt.)
Prince: (I believe you are capable of completing this challenge.)
