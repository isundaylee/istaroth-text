Traveler: Studying the human body...?
Nabati: Nah, it isn't as scary as you're thinking. It's just some extended topics on fighting techniques.
Nabati: How must the body be controlled to release unimaginable strength? Aren't you all curious about that?
Nabati: But while I've suggested it a few times, not a single mentor has been willing to approve it...
Nabati: So, I had no choice but to comply with my assignment and research this topic related to folk beliefs...
Nabati: I think this can't be allowed to go on. Someone must let the Akademiya know that there are many other research directions that are worth our attention.
