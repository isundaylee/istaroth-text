## Talk

Pruniere: Hello there. Is there anything wrong with the waterway?

## Talk

Traveler: Not yet, as far as I know...
Pruniere: "Yet," you say... Ominous, but I suppose no news is good news.
Pruniere: You know what we maintenance staff fear the most? Cracks that we can't see!
Pruniere: It is like sand concealed amidst flour â€” one little error can ruin a whole loaf of bread.
Pruniere: Ah, yes, there's another problem, which is people who take tools willy-nilly.
Pruniere: There was once, when I simply left my crowbar at my side for a moment, and some passer-by just... took it!
Pruniere: Fortunately, he returned it after giving someone a bit of a thwacking or something, or I wouldn't have been able to work that day.

## Talk

Traveler: So, the important thing here is work?
Pruniere: For me it is, yes.
Pruniere: I remember that the person who got tripped up was a thief, right? Serves him right.
Pruniere: There was a journalist who came over for an interview, but I chased him away. I mean, what do I know about public security? It's not something for me to consider.
Pruniere: And wouldn't you know it, isn't there a Melusine in plain clothes looking this way?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Pruniere: Sure, see you.

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Pruniere: Ah, sweet victory. With lady luck on my side today, I suppose there's no need to worry about aquabus safety!

## Talk

Pruniere: Misfortune dogs me today, it seems. I should see if the aquabus is running well...
