Traveler: Transportation proposal?
Lixing: Take this for example. Agency A must transport goods from Lumidouce Harbor to Liyue Harbor.
Lixing: During this process, they transport the goods to the docks between Qiaoying Village and Qingce Village...
Lixing: They can choose to transport the goods and carts to the opposite shore and continue on land.
Lixing: Now, you may have realized that continuing south along the waterway before getting on land at Wangshu Inn is the superior option!
Lixing: But things aren't that simple. The ship traveling down the waterway may not belong to Agency A. It may belong to the Communications Office, Agency B, or independent shipowner C.
Lixing: In moments like these, specialized personnel are required to coordinate the transfers between different individuals or organizations. That is the transportation plan I mentioned.
