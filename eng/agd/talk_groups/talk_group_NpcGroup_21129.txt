Elphane: I'm Elphane, the guide for this trip.
Traveler: I'd like to ask about...
Elphane: Melusines are a young race born in Fontaine. There are many differences between us and humanity.
Traveler: Is there anything else about Melusines...
Elphane: We do have one secret that we can share with you, passenger.
Elphane: We are similar to humans in one way. Each of us has a different personality. Some of us like chatting. Some don't.

## Talk 9

Elphane: Hello.
Traveler: This aquabus is really...
Elphane: "The Court Region Waterway Hub and the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering are working to improve aquabus speed."
Traveler: I was going to say that it was "really beautiful."
Elphane: I'm glad you think so.
Traveler: But you haven't heard what I think of its speed yet...
Elphane: Dear passenger. Previous feedback data indicates that you will either find it too fast or too slow. The official response to either is the same.
Elphane: Of course, if you believe that its speed is "really perfect," then good. Thank you, on behalf of the Court Region Waterway Hub and the aquabus itself.
Traveler: Are you in a bad mood, Ms. Elphane?
Elphane: No. I simply...
Elphane: ...Sorry.
Elphane: Hmm... I'll be frank. If you just wish to experience the joys of an aquabus, I personally recommend that you ride the Clementine Line, for which Aeval is the guide.
Traveler: Could you tell me about Erinnyes?
Elphane: Recommended areas of visitation are the Fountain of Lucine and Opera Epiclese. Other than that, I do not recommend anything. Institute's ruins comprise the northern part of Erinnyes...
Traveler: Well, I'm an adventurer, so...
Elphane: You misunderstand. That area is indeed dangerous, and does also play host to out-of-control clockwork meka.
Elphane: However, the most potent threat present at the moment is the Institute Technicians. They can drone on for an entire day without giving you any information or expressing any perspective. Truly ghastly.
Elphane: Do not go to Erinnyes's depths.
Traveler: Why not?
Elphane: I apologize, but I do not know, either. This was Monsieur Neuvillette's suggestion, and I trust his wisdom.
Traveler: Is there anything else?
Traveler: See you.
Elphane: See you.

Traveler: Looking real cute today, Ms. Elphane!
Elphane: What!?
Elphane: P—Please refrain from jokes in such poor taste, dear passenger!

### Talk 16 related talk 1

Elphane: Hello.

### Talk 19 related talk 0

Traveler: This trip.

### Talk 19 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine...
Elphane: A natural point of interest is The Steambird. As for the reason it's recommended... This is what was written — "Whatever, just find a way to recommend it."
Traveler: Sure, sure. Any personal recommendations?
Elphane: Yes. First, Bertin's House of Curiosities and Chioriya Boutique. Both of them sell very... cute clothes. They even have gloves custom-fit for Melusines. Not that I'm interested or anything!
Elphane: Otherwise, my friends and I often go to Café Lutece. The smell of coffee is just too good — even better than Emilie's perfume.

Traveler: That was a real memorable trip!
Elphane: That's great. Please allow me to thank you on behalf of the Court Region Waterway Hub and the aquabus itself for your praise.

### Talk 22 related talk 1

Traveler: It was faster than the Clementine Line, anyway...
Elphane: Objectively speaking, the Navia Line is shorter. As such — aquabus speeds being equal — your senses match reality.
Traveler: But...
