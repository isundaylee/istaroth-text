# Missing title (43428839)

Traveler: About Lanoire...
Estienne: Actually, it's possible for me to just take her straight out of the Fortress, and bring her right to her family... But that would make me the primary culprit in breaking the rules, and I'm not willing to pay the price.
Estienne: You might say, "Oh, that's so selfish of you!" and I'd say: you're right. There are countless people in the world who need rescuing, but I refuse to drop everything to save even one of them.
Estienne: I'm just a small fry, and I can only do the things that smally fry can do, like lending a hand from the sidelines.
Estienne: Because I'm a small fry, I can forgive myself even if I don't condone my own decisions.
