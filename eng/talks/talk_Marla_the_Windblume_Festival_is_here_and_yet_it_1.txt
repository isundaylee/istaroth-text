Marvin: Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
Marla: Oh, Marvin, say not that!
Marla: We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
Marvin: No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may as well be the Windblume Festival.
Marla: You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
Marvin: Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
Marla: No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
Marla: Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
Marvin: Oh, my darling Marla...
Marla: Oh, Marvin! My love...
