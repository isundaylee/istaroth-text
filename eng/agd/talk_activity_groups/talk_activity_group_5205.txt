Amber: #Hey, it's you, Traveler! Fancy meeting you in the Whispering Woods again. What are the odds?
Amber: It's been a while, hasn't it? What've you been busy with lately?
Traveler: Taking photos to keep a record of the places we've been.
Traveler: Taking photos to commemorate my legendary career with.
Amber: Haha, that makes sense! This place is so beautiful and serene, it really does make for good photos.
Amber: This is my favorite patrol segment when I'm out on scouting missions.
Amber: This was where we met for the first time, too. I even mistook you for some kind of suspicious character back then, too! Ah, I'm getting embarrassed just thinking about it...
Amber: After all, it was thanks to your help that we averted the crisis with Dvalin, and restored peace to Mondstadt.
Amber: #But your sister... I put up so many missing posters, but it seems like it wasn't of any help...
Traveler: It's fine, Amber.
Traveler: You did all you could.
Amber: Thanks. But still, please feel free to tell me if there's anything I can help you with.
Amber: Amber, Outrider of the Knights of Favonius, Mondstadt's Gliding Champion, and your friend — at your service!
Traveler: In that case, step into the frame, please!
Amber: But I don't see your Kamera. Are you sure you've got it on you?

Amber: How did the photos turn out?
Traveler: You did great. Thanks a lot.
Amber: I'm fine with that, but you haven't taken your Kamera out yet. It might be hard to take pictures without it...

Xiangling: #Traveler, it's you! Long time no see! Funny, I just mentioned you to Guoba yesterday, and here we are.
Xiangling: I guess that's what they call "fate," huh?
Xiangling: Ah, right. Where are you headed?
Traveler: I was going to take a picture of this bridge.
Traveler: I'm looking for people to take photos with.
Xiangling: Photo-taking? Ooh, that's a coincidence. I've taken an interest in that lately myself.
Xiangling: We've been using the same poster at the restaurant for so long. It's high time we got a new one.
Xiangling: I've been thinking that we could draw passersby in more easily with some beautiful shots of our dishes.
Xiangling: As the old saying goes: "A fine meal is three parts color, three parts aroma, three parts taste, and one part advertising."
Xiangling: ...Of course, I added that last bit myself.
Xiangling: Dad always talks about the first three — it's as common culinary wisdom as can be.
Traveler: Hardworking as always, huh, Xiangling?
Traveler: Things haven't been too tiring, have they, Xiangling?
Xiangling: Hehe. Thanks!
Xiangling: No way — if anything, my motivation grows the more I do things I enjoy.
Xiangling: Finding rare ingredients, creating new dishes, learning how to advertise... I've still got a long way to go in my culinary journey.
Xiangling: Haha, now that you mention it, it's been a long time since our first meeting, hasn't it?
Xiangling: But many things have stayed the same, too, haven't they? You're still traveling, and I'm still coming up with new dishes.
Xiangling: It's my goal not only to keep Wanmin Restaurant open, but to make it better and better.
Xiangling: So long as I've got strength in my arms, I'll be stir-frying and wok-tossing even when I'm an old granny, delivering delicious, piping hot dishes from pot to plate.
Xiangling: Remember to stop by for a meal more often, alright?
Traveler: I will.
Traveler: We'll see.
Xiangling: Alright then, it's a deal!
Xiangling: Haha, are you worried that you won't be able to walk over by then?
Xiangling: If that's the case, just write to me — I'll send you some food that keeps easily.
Xiangling: Ah, right, I'm kinda getting off-topic here. You were talking about taking some pictures, right? Need any help?
Traveler: Yup. Step into the frame, please!
Xiangling: That's a great idea! I've been studying some photography lately myself... By the way, did you bring your Kamera? I don't see it...

Xiangling: Like this?
Traveler: Awesome. Say cheese!
Xiangling: I'm ready.

Kaedehara Kazuha: The Fortune Slip I received at the Grand Narukami Shrine stated that Great Fortune shall be with me and that I should expect a reunion.
Traveler: We're here to take pictures of Inazuma City.
Traveler: We're looking for people to take photos with.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #It seems the reunion was to be with you. It's been a while, Traveler.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, an elegant pursuit. To take pictures of scenery one has witnessed is to remind oneself of one's journey thus far.
Traveler: What about you, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I have presently made plans to meet Mr. Nakanishi at the teahouse to discuss the art of the tea ceremony. He is well-versed in the relevant disciplines, and is a regular there.
Traveler: Are you an expert too?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I studied for a time in my youth, but my knowledge then was quite shallow. I have found it all the more fascinating while revisiting it for study as of late.
Kaedehara Kazuha: For example, the nations differ in their manifestations of said ceremonies. For Inazuma, we emphasize the spirit of "purity" and "tranquility."
Kaedehara Kazuha: Liyue's Qiaoying Village also produces tea, and the people of that land lean towards "harmony" and "authenticity."
Traveler: You're a real lover of learning.
Traveler: A man of elegant tastes, I see.
Kaedehara Kazuha: These differences also reflect the two people's differences in living habits. Most fascinating.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, hardly... In truth, I did not return here solely for that.
Kaedehara Kazuha: This is the land of my birth, and so it remains, though I was once compelled to leave.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Returning every once in a while, seeing people I knew in my youth, spending time in familiar places...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I feel as if I still have roots here, which relieves the cares of my wanderings.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To use Kameras to immortalize such memories is a wonderful idea. We wanderers need our anchors more than anyone, after all.
Traveler: Alright. Step into the frame, then, if you would!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Anyway, that's quite enough about me. I don't wish to take up your time, but if you need any aid, simply say the word.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think you're saying you want to use a Kamera to take photos, but I don't see yours anywhere. Are you sure you brought one?

Kaedehara Kazuha: Easily done. What sort of pose would be best for the shot?
Traveler: One that's more casual.
Traveler: A relaxed pose.
Traveler: Perhaps one displaying deep thought.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Of course. How does this look?
Traveler: Perfect. Say cheese!
Traveler: Let's go with our relaxed pose instead.
Traveler: I think deep thought works better.
Traveler: Let's roll with the casual pose instead.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let us do so.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Of course.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Fair enough.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm ready.

Traveler: We're here to take some pictures of Sumeru City.
Traveler: We're looking for people to take photos with.
Collei: #Huh? Oh, it's you, Traveler! What's the plan today?
Collei: Ah, photography! True, Akademiya researchers often come here to snap a few shots of the city.
Traveler: Well, aren't you familiar with the Darshans?
Traveler: Take any classes in those Darshans, by any chance?
Collei: Most who do are from Vahumana and Kshahrewar, apparently to study urban infrastructure... and um, architectural history or something like that.
Collei: Not... really. I just know about their research fields and how they set their courses up. I'm still a long way from being a real scholar, though.
Collei: Well, I'm not a student yet, so I can't attend the classes, but Master has introduced some of the basics of their research to me.
Collei: But if you wanted me to take the selection exam... Heh, I doubt I'd pass even the first round of the written test.
Traveler: You'll make it someday.
Traveler: You can do it, Collei!
Collei: I wish I could reach the level of a researcher, of course, but it's still a dream at the moment...
Collei: #Thanks so much, Traveler. Anyway, I'll do my best to learn the basics first!
Collei: Honestly, I'm just happy to learn something new every day.
Collei: And right now, my goal is to be the best Forest Ranger I can be.
Collei: Guiding those who've gotten lost in the rainforest, helping people who've accidentally ingested poison, protecting the rainforest flora and fauna...
Collei: We Forest Rangers do lots of things. Everyone needs me, and I'm more than willing to help!
Collei: I've only done a couple of little things here and there, but still, everyone recognizes my work.
Collei: Guess I'm lucky to have all these people who care about me... and to have made friends with someone as amazing as you.
Traveler: I'm glad that we're friends, Collei.
Traveler: We're both amazing. Don't you forget that!
Traveler: I'd like you to help me with some photos.
Collei: Haha, alright. Anyway, if there's anything I can help you with, just let me know.
Collei: I mean, I've helped Master take some photos of plant samples, but I'm sure you'd need a Kamera to do something like that.
Collei: #Did you bring yours, Traveler?

Lynette: ...So you did come over. I was wondering if you'd notice me. Looks like my concealment failed this time.
Lynette: #Oh well. I didn't put much effort into it anyway. One moment... Traveler Observation Mode, off. Chat Mode activated.
Traveler: We're looking for a good spot for a picture.
Traveler: I'm looking for someone to help with some photos.
Lynette: Previous observation indicates that you are more likely to be enjoying the scenery than just wandering about. Are you here on business?
Lynette: Photos... Have you finally decided to end your travels and work at The Steambird?
Traveler: Aye, but they're real slave drivers. Six days of work, one day off.
Traveler: No, no, I'm a loyal member of the Adventurers' Guild!
Lynette: Understandable. An adventurer's income is unstable, and you have Paimon to feed as well — that can't be easy.
Lynette: You followed up with a joke of your own. Wow. I underestimated you.
Lynette: Hmm. I didn't expect you to be so earnest about the Guild. My apologies for the joke. I did not mean to doubt your adventurous spirit.
Lynette: If you've come here to take pictures, they must be of the Court of Fontaine.
Traveler: Sharp as always, Lynette.
Lynette: Many Steambird reporters come here to take panoramic shots of the Court, and sometimes they gossip on the side.
Lynette: All I need to do is keep a low profile and listen silently.
Traveler: We need a model more, really.
Traveler: If you don't mind Lynette, could you move into the frame?
Lynette: But having come so many times, I've picked up some photography skills along the way... So, do you require an assistant?
Lynette: Are you pulling my leg? Otherwise, you'd definitely have a Kamera with you. Unless... you forgot it?
