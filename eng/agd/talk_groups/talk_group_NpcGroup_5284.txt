## Talk

Lasselin: Now, listen here...
Lasselin: Huh? You're... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. Now, what would you like?

## Talk

Traveler: What have you heard?
Lasselin: You caught that, eh? Fine. It's nothing important anyway, just stuff you'd hear every day in this tavern.
Lasselin: Like, some people are willing to pay a lot of money to hire some help, while others want to sell certain goods quickly...
Lasselin: Of course, a big shot like you is often mentioned by the guests... But don't you worry! I'm not one to go around telling others your business.
Lasselin: After all, if you want the details from me, then you have to... Well, you know.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you work here?
Lasselin: That's right! I'm a waitre... Ahem, I mean the Chief Mate. Though it's kinda the same job as a waitress...
Lasselin: The reason for using titles like this is because Mr. Pitot said it would help with navigating the waves of the business world.
Lasselin: He said himself that a client from Liyue taught him how to pray for luck by giving auspicious names like this.
Lasselin: But I reckon... that he didn't quite grasp what they were trying to teach him.

## Talk

Traveler: Bye.
Lasselin: Bye! Hope... hope you have a nice day...

## Talk

Traveler: How much Mora?
Lasselin: Mora? Th—That's okay too.
Lasselin: But if you're using Mora, you'll need to buy more good wine. After all... the information I possess is very valuable. I could sell it for a small fortune.
Lasselin: However, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with the helmsman. I'll be in trouble if I handle Mora.

## Talk

Traveler: If your information is so valuable, why not work for yourself?
Lasselin: I... I'm afraid of trouble, and working in this tavern is great! Really great. It's safe, comfortable, and there are even free drinks!
Lasselin: But most importantly, as long as I'm here then no one will dare come bother me, and I won't be forced to go bother anyone else...
Lasselin: Anyway, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with the helmsman.

## Talk

Traveler: Wait, have you heard anything about me?
Lasselin: Oh, there have been plenty of stories about you — your adventures, the enemies you've defeated, the treasures you've obtained, and the titles you've earned.
Lasselin: Heck if I know how true they are. Perhaps they're nothing more than drunken ramblings.
Lasselin: However, if you're interested in these rumors, or if you want to hear some... other stories from me...
Lasselin: Well... you know.

## Talk

Lasselin: Duel

## Talk

Lasselin: What a pity, I seem to have won... But don't lose heart. Perhaps you'd like to take a look at some of our tavern's "good wine"?

## Talk

Lasselin: Oh no, I lost! But it was just a game of cards — it doesn't mean I can sell you our special "good wine."
