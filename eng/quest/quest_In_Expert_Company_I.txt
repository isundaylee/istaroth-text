# In Expert Company? (I)


## Talk 1

Ms. Qiu: Great! The Film Kamera is intact, and the film hasn't been destroyed...
Ms. Qiu: Thank the Archons. I thought we were gonna have to start shooting all over again.
Traveler: Why are you filming here?
Traveler: Seems you aren't from Fontaine either.
Ms. Qiu: It's a long story...
Ms. Qiu: Let's keep it brief. We three are from Qiaoying Village in Liyue.
Ms. Qiu: Most people there are in the tea business but we... don't have any interest in tea...
Ms. Qiu: So, we changed professions and started filming dokumentari films to help promote tea vendors in the village.
Yifeng: In truth, there are too many people in the tea business, and we just couldn't compete.
Xingye: The skilled helpers we had at the store left one by one to work elsewhere, so if we just stuck to making tea, we'd be starving.
Ms. Qiu: Can't you two... not make things sound so depressing!?
Ms. Qiu: We've made plenty of Mora shooting these tea dokumentaris in the village.
Yifeng: But recently, some others in the village have also started to shoot their own promotional films.
Xingye: Some of them are even performing an opera in them. They're making a real big show of it.
Ms. Qiu: So that's why we're in Fontaine. We're trying to seek advice from master filmmakers!
Traveler: So, you're here to learn about filmmaking in Fontaine?
Ms. Qiu: Yeah. We found this "lighting expert" called Geisert.
Ms. Qiu: He's real good at using lighting to film... what was it again?
Yifeng: "Narratives."
Ms. Qiu: Yeah! Applying lighting to his "narratives."
Ms. Qiu: With Mr. Geisert's advice, we can definitely shoot the best films in all of Qiaoying Village!
Xingye: Boss, last month you said we were going to shoot the best films in Liyue.
Ms. Qiu: You have to adjust your expectations realistically when doing business... What do you know?
Ms. Qiu: Anyway, thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, take this Mora.
Ms. Qiu: Xingye, Yifeng, pack that up quick! We gotta finish shooting our sample and show it to Mr. Geisert.
Ms. Qiu: Watch the lighting! The Kamera's gotta be angled toward the light source in this way. We gotta capture that... high-definition lighting!
Ms. Qiu: You all read that book, right? The lighting's gotta have a sense of texture? You get what I'm saying?
Xingye: Boss, we might've read Mr. Geisert's book...
Yifeng: But with what we got, we're not going to be able to capture that high-definition lighting tactility you want no matter how much we struggle...

## Talk 2

Ms. Qiu: Please, adventurer, please go get us our Film Kamera back.

## Talk 3

Xingye: *sigh* When will I get to go back to Qiaoying Village...

## Talk 4

Yifeng: This shoot has been nothing but disasters...
