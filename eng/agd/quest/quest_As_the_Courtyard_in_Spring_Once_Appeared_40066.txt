# As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, it's a new place!
Oz: As was the case last time, only Lord Kazuha is missing.
Xinyan: Don't worry, leave it to us!

## Talk 2

Kaedehara Kageharu: ...This will do. Ah, Kazuha, you've come just at the right moment. What do you think of this rock carving?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's very intricate.
Kaedehara Kageharu: I based it on a mountain scene I saw in a book. You know, there are nations in this world where the mountains reach all the way up into the clouds. If only I had the chance to see them with my own eyes...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Father, you can go anywhere whenever you want.
Kaedehara Kageharu: That's not true. Though the Kaedehara Clan is far from what it used to be, I still bear all the same responsibilities as the clan heads before me.
Kaedehara Kageharu: But then again... continuing in the way of our forefathers, sacrificing everything for our declining clan... is it really worth it?
Kaedehara Kazuha: But I... I don't understand.
Kaedehara Kageharu: ...Kazuha, there's one thing I want you to always remember.
Kaedehara Kageharu: Family ties are important, but you ought to not let them hold you back.
Kaedehara Kageharu: Family only exists because of the people in it. If we are unhappy, how can we hope to build a joyful one?
Kaedehara Kageharu: The events of the past have had a profound impact on our family, but they are not your burden to carry.
Kaedehara Kageharu: ...If you ever grow tired of this tedious life, just drop everything and go off on a journey, see the world. Remember, Kazuha, don't let yourself get tied down in life.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, father.

## Talk 3

Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm sorry, but I just don't understand!
Kaedehara Kageharu: Kazuha, have you forgotten our promise?
Kaedehara Kazuha: You really want to give it all up? But... but even if we're having a rough time, you still have me by your side! Can't I be of any help?
Kaedehara Kazuha: When you were my age, you were already helping grandfather out! Am I so incompetent that I'm a disappointment to you? Or...
Kaedehara Kageharu: Kazuha!
Kaedehara Kageharu: *sigh* ...Now you're blaming yourself for all of this... That's why I have failed you as a father.
Kaedehara Kageharu: The Kaedehara Clan has been paying the price for our past mistakes ever since your great-grandfather's generation. To this day, we have never fully recovered from it.
Kaedehara Kageharu: Though we are a family of bladesmiths, you don't have to devote your life to the family craft.
Kaedehara Kageharu: If a wounded animal wants to escape from a trap, it has to sacrifice the hind leg that was caught. You might think of this as a loss, but staying in the trap has far more deadly consequences.
Kaedehara Kageharu: Enough now, Kazuha. As the head of the family, I failed to revitalize our clan. You never blamed me for not giving you the life promised to you by our heritage, and I'm grateful enough for that.
Kaedehara Kageharu: All these generations of suffering... let's end them today. From now on, live your life with no burdens.
Kaedehara Kageharu: Don't worry, I'll carry the blame for abandoning our family business.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Father, please don't... You should not be to blame for not upholding our family name.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even if that day comes, let me share the burden with you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's just wait and see. Sooner or later, I will have to lead the Kaedehara Clan. When the time comes, I'll deal with all our problems.

## Talk 4

Paimon: But... why can't he hear us?
Paimon: Looks like it's just an illusion. This isn't the Kazuha who came here with us.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Thought we might find you trapped here again.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, yeah, it seems those are the rules.
Paimon: We entered that maze in the mirage again, but the scene was different this time.
Black Screen Text: You tell Kazuha what you saw...
Kaedehara Kazuha: The mood was more deflated, and the place more humbly furnished... yes, that makes sense.
Kaedehara Kazuha: What you saw was the Kaedehara Clan in decline.
Paimon: We saw you in the mirage too, but you looked a little different than now.
Fischl: Indeed, I most certainly agree.
Oz: Compared to the Lord Kazuha before us now, the mirage we saw appeared lost, with the burden of fate weighing heavily upon him.
Mona: I can confirm that. His fate was a heavy burden indeed.
Kaedehara Kazuha: That means I am older and wiser now. I am sorry you had to see my less mature former self.
Kaedehara Kazuha: For a long time after leaving Inazuma, I've lived the life of a drifter. But this is no bad thing, because I learned much from the experience.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I wish that I could've met my past self, too. If he saw me, I know that he would understand:
Kaedehara Kazuha: Life is a long journey, and that's why I must travel far and wide.

## Talk 6

Kaedehara Kazuha: Just as I thought, the bonsai is the key to entering the mirage.
Paimon: C'mon, let's continue looking for the rock garden.
