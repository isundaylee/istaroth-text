Traveler: What's the Ikuhara Art?
Ikuhara Gai: The Ikuhara Art is a newly-founded forging style. Our founder... Well, you're looking at him!
Ikuhara Gai: I used to be a swordsmith at Tatarasuna. Then an accident occurred at the Mikage Furnace. Many of my colleagues have since left.
Ikuhara Gai: I don't want to leave yet. That's why I joined the Shogun's Army stationed here. I can serve the Shogunate while observing the situation in Tatarasuna.
Ikuhara Gai: After all, the best sword-forging material, Jade Steel, is produced here in Tatarasuna... If you don't have good materials to use as a basis, then no amount of skill will make it easy for you to forge the finest blades.
