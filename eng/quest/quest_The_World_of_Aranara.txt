# The World of Aranara


## Talk 1

Arayash: Golden Nara...

## Talk 2

Araja: #Whoa, a Nara... I haven't seen one in so long. So tall and golden, just like {M#she}{F#he} said. Welcome to Vanarana.
Arama: #Yes, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon. They're amazing! They're not even scared of Vanagni.
Araja: Whoa! Amazing! Nara who used Arana's tune to get into Vanarana are definitely good Nara whom Arana trusts.
Paimon: That's strange. How do all of you know that it was Arana who guided us here?
Araja: Every Aranara has their own tune, and every tune is different. That's how we know who's home.
Araja: Arana has been making friends with Nara in Avidya Forest and Ardravi Valley, so I haven't seen her for a long time. We heard her tune and thought that it was her. We were very happy.
Araja: #But it was a Nara who entered Vanarana, and it scared us all. So I asked for Arama's help to tell everyone that Nara {NICKNAME} is a good Nara.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now! But according to Arama, the problems we solved were outside the dream. Was that even helpful? Helpful to Ma... Mahavana...
Paimon: Ugh! Aranara names are so difficult!
Traveler: "Mahavanaranapna"?
Traveler: The Vanarana in dreams...
Arama: The Vanarana in dreams is a shadow of the Vanarana outside. So, things will get better here now that you have dealt with the problems outside. Thank you.
Paimon: #Oooh... *cough* Let's get down to business! {NICKNAME}, about Rana...
Traveler: We need a Bija.
Traveler: Arana sent us.
Paimon: We need a Bija to help a very important friend of Arana... She's a very important friend of ours too...
Black Screen Text: You tell both people... well, both Aranara, the reason for your request...
Araja: Bija... The last time I prepared a Bija was a long time ago. I heard the Golden Nara and Aramuhukunda were still here then.
Araja: I had so many stories and so many dreams then. It was so long ago...
Paimon: (Looks like Araja is about to start telling a story!)
Traveler: (Let's see what Araja says.)
Traveler: It's urgent. We don't have time to waste.
Araja: Those stories aren't my memories anymore, and I shouldn't be the one to tell them. Let's put our focus back on the Bija.
Paimon: Rana has been seriously harmed by Marana. She needs a Bija as soon as possible...
Arama: Arana is a very, very old Aranara whose Ararakalari is very, very powerful! So, Narana's condition won't worsen. As for the Bija...
Araja: You're right, Narana's condition will be stable with Arana there. However, don't forget that Nara are not trees. They have less time, and it's easier for them to get hurt.
Arama: #Right! Since Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon are friends with Arana, and they all have the same wish, we should help them.
Traveler: We'll leave it to you.
Traveler: What do you need us to do?
Araja: #We'll do our best, but we also need Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon's help to form a Bija...
Araja: Yes, we need Nara's help to form a Bija.
Araja: We are going to hold Festival Utsava, but many Aranara are still lingering in the forest. Now that you have the scent of Vanarana, you'll be able to approach them. Tell them it's time to return.
Traveler: Can we really relax like this...
Traveler: But we don't have time for all that!
Traveler: Yay! Festival Utsava!
Paimon: Araja, you mentioned that Nara don't have much time, so shouldn't we get a Bija as soon as possible?
Paimon: Araja, you mentioned that Nara don't have much time, so shouldn't we get a Bija as soon as possible?
Paimon: No, no! That's completely wrong! We don't have time for festivals! Araja mentioned that Nara don't have much time, so shouldn't we get a Bija as soon as possible?
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon. According to the stories of the Bija, in order to form a Bija that's healthy, strong, and filled with energy, a Festival Utsava is absolutely necessary.
Arama: Regardless of the sorrow we carry, energy for the Bija can only be accumulated if the Nara friends of Aranara and the Aranara friends of Nara celebrate Festival Utsava together.
Paimon: Alright... It's not very convincing, but just like how unbelievable Ararakalari is, maybe it's an Ara-ceremony or Ara-festival.
Arama: Ah! If we're going to celebrate Festival Utsava, we must get everyone back. A little while ago, Arapandu and some others went to <color=#00E1FFFF>Apam Woods</color>. Besides that, Aranakin and some others should be around <color=#00E1FFFF>Gandha Hill</color>...
Araja: #Everyone, I'm sure you're not afraid of Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon anymore, so why don't you try becoming friends? I had a Nara friend once, and those memories are still very dear to me.
Araja: Besides that, you must <color=#00E1FFFF>get a few Vasoma Fruits</color> from the Vasara Trees in Ashvattha's Concourses. Three of them should be enough.
Paimon: Ashvattha... Vasara Tree... Vasoma...
Araja: #But I haven't been able to leave the dream for a long time, and I don't remember where Ashvattha's Concourses are. I'll leave the finding to Arama and Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arama: #An adventure with Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Paimon: An adventure with Arama!
Paimon: Speaking of which, the incident in Vimara Village is also very concerning. Can we ask other Aranara to find out who's trying to harm the children there?
Araja: Oh, my! It sounds like something only "Marana's Avatar" is capable of. They aren't stopping with Aranara and are even harming little Nara...
Arama: If it's around Vimara Village, I did see Ararycan near <color=#00E1FFFF>Devantaka Mountain</color> a few suns and moons ago. He was investigating something bad.
Arama: #It may be linked to the bad Nara that Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon are looking for!
Paimon: Ah, that's right. Aranara are very elusive, so they may have seen something suspicious! Besides that, we have many other questions...
Traveler: About the Vasoma Fruit...
Traveler: About "Marana's Avatar"...
Traveler: ...Let's talk about it later.
Arama: The Vasoma Fruit is a fruit filled with dreams and energy! It isn't as powerful as the Bija, but it's amazing too.
Araja: A Bija can be formed by feeding a Vasoma Fruit to the Ashvattha Tree. It's a great tree planted by the Lord of Verdure, and it's the origin of Aranara.
Traveler: About "Marana's Avatar"...
Traveler: ...Let's talk about it later.
Paimon: Yeah, it really caught Paimon's attention just now because Iotham mentioned something similar too...
Araja: It's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
Araja: Many returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
Paimon: Hmm... So that's when Marana came into existence?
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
Araja: On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
Araja: They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
Araja: Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
Paimon: So that's why Iotham was afraid of the Fatui... They are tall, and they wear black...
Araja: Of course. In my stories, Marana's Avatar takes many forms. Sometimes beasts, sometimes birds, sometimes Nara, sometimes blight...
Araja: But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Paimon: Yeah, it really caught Paimon's attention just now because Iotham mentioned something similar too...
Araja: It's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...

Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Paimon: #Hmm... Let Paimon think for a moment. {NICKNAME}. There's so much for us to do.
Traveler: I'm used to it.
Traveler: What a nuisance.
Traveler: As long as it helps Rana.
Paimon: We must find Ashvattha to... get a va-something? Then go to <color=#00E1FFFF>Devantaka Mountain</color> to look for Ara... Ararycan? Is that right? Then we have to find Arapandu in <color=#00E1FFFF>Apam Woods</color> and Aranakin in <color=#00E1FFFF>Gandha Hill</color>...
Paimon: Argh! Ugh! Aranara names are so difficult!
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, this is for you.
Arama: I've been observing. Nara must use this to remember. Otherwise, Nara memories will get messed up and won't be able to form a story.
Paimon: Is that... an old notebook?
Araja: #Oh, it belonged to Nara Varuna... Maybe it's destiny that it's going to another Golden Nara like Nara {NICKNAME}.
Araja: #{M#She}{F#He} called it the Aranyaka because it's the stories of {M#her}{F#his} adventures in the forest with us Aranara. But those stories are lost.
Araja: #Nara {NICKNAME}, I hope it'll be of help to you. I'm really looking forward to Festival Utsava.

## Talk 3

Paimon: But... Do we really have to sing? What if it attracts a Whopperflower?
Traveler: Well... I think using a musical instrument works too.
Paimon: Hmm, it's worth a try. Let's return to Vimara Village and see if Grandpa Amadhiah has one!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Grandpa Amadhiah...
Amadhiah: Oh, Rana's friends... Unfortunately, Rana should be patrolling the forest today.
Traveler: (I don't think he knows...)
Paimon: (Let's keep it from him...)
Paimon: Yeah, we know! We're here to ask if you have a musical instrument that you can lend us.
Amadhiah: A musical instrument... Give me a minute, I will go get it.
Black Screen Text: Amadhiah fetches an old musical instrument from inside.
Paimon: It looks like... a Mondstadt-style instrument! Grandpa Amadhiah, can you lend it to us?
Amadhiah: A very, very long time ago... I met a bard in the forest. She gave me this lyre as a keepsake.
Amadhiah: "Dreams of the garden, memories of the forest... The pomegranate sings, the apples clap..."
Amadhiah: What a beautiful tune...
Amadhiah: I'll lend it to you. Use it to light up the darkness in the forest, and perhaps it'll reach her ears...
Traveler: We'll take good care of it.
Paimon: Yeah! We'll return it to you, Grandpa Amadhiah! Thanks!
Traveler: We'll perform well.
Traveler: (We'll keep it a secret then...)

## Talk 5

Paimon: This place is like a village...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you remember the small stone houses we saw while camping with Rana?
Traveler: I don't.
Paimon: Those small round houses we saw.
Paimon: They're all over this place. It's like a kingdom for little people...
Paimon: If this is the "Vanarana" that Arana told us about, it should be the home of the Aranara...
Traveler: But there's no one here.
Paimon: Hmm... Are they hiding from us?
Traveler: Maybe Arana's tune will do the trick...
Paimon: Oh, right! Just like she said...
Paimon: Was it the Rhythm of the Great Dream? Paimon thinks so... "Enter our dreams, our world."
Traveler: *cough* I'll start now...
Paimon: Hmm... What if singing attracts a Whopperflower? Let's just play the musical instrument instead!
Paimon: #Oh! Paimon can't wait, for both {NICKNAME}'s performance and the world of Aranara.
Traveler: Let's play the instrument then...
Traveler: I can sense gazes...
Paimon: #Huh? Paimon doesn't sense anything! But you've always had a keen eye, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: So, maybe we should do as Arana said and sing the tune she taught you...
Traveler: Small and round...

## Talk 6

Arakara: Will need happy Viparyas, but Aranakula hasn't returned yet. Um...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Oh, an Aranara...
Arama: Eek! Don't capture me, I'll give Nara "tracer"...
Paimon: What's a "tracer"? Anyway, we won't capture you! Don't be afraid!
Paimon: #This is Paimon, and {M#he}{F#she} is {NICKNAME}. We're good Nara! What's your name?
Arama: Oh... You're good Nara, great. Hmm, it was Arana who taught you that tune, right?
Arama: I'm Arama. Arana may trust both of you, but everyone here is very scared seeing Nara in Vanarana.
Traveler: Aren't you afraid as well?
Arama: I was afraid. But the Golden Nara has been to many places. The tiny dandelions and spores with you are all saying that you are a very, very good Nara.
Paimon: Whoa, Aranara can communicate with plants, even spores?
Traveler: Spores aren't plants...
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME} understands, Paimon is wrong. If you say that loudly in the forest, plants will be sad, and spores will be angry and might even turn into Fungi.
Paimon: Ugh! Let's not fuss over the details, shall we?
Paimon: Anyway, is this Vanarana? It feels so similar to the place where we found the treasure, but it is slightly different. It does have a huge rock house, but...
Traveler: Feeling a little disappointed?
Paimon: It isn't what Paimon expected! Paimon thought Vanarana would be a lively Aranara village where everyone would be dancing Aranara dances, eating Aranara food, completing Aranara commissions...
Traveler: And an Aranara Katheryne?
Paimon: ...Paimon's thoughts didn't run that wild!
Arama: ?
Arama: #Everyone's in Vanarana, but because everyone's afraid, we still can't let both of you inside, even if Nara {NICKNAME} is golden.
Traveler: Golden...?
Paimon: What about silver? Is silver bad?
Arama: Silver, just like the moon. Very good, very good.
Paimon: Hee-hee... So here isn't Vanarana?
Arama: This isn't Vanarana. Ah, actually... This is Vanarana, but not the real Vanarana.
Traveler: So is it Vanarana or not...
Arama: If you help Aranara, everyone won't be afraid, and you can enter the real Vanarana. Come with me, help Aranara and get the "tracer."
Paimon: Paimon gets it now! You mean "treasure"! Sure, we'll help you!
Traveler: Golden? Is it rare?
Paimon: What about silver? Is silver rare?
Arama: Silver, just like the moon. Very good, very good.
Paimon: Hee-hee... So here isn't Vanarana?
Traveler: Isn't here Vanarana?
Traveler: And an Aranara souvenir shop?
Traveler: And an Aranara outrider...
Traveler: That's convenient!
Arama: How strange. Spores are not plants. If you say that loudly in the forest, plants will be sad, and spores will be angry and might even turn into Fungi.
Traveler: Is this Vanarana?
Paimon: Hmm... It feels so similar to the place where we found the treasure, but it is slightly different. It does have a huge rock house, but...

## Talk 8

Aramani: What's the expression in Nara language... "Honest price," no? I don't understand, totally don't understand.

## Talk 9

Arama: Look, Vanagni! Be careful... Even if you talk to them, their only response is rage and shooting flames.
Paimon: ...What? It's just a Whopperflower!
Arama: It's very dangerous! Very dangerous! Let's leave before the Vanagni notices us!
Traveler: Whoa! So scary!
Paimon: ...You aren't really afraid of a Whopperflower, right?
Paimon: #Anyway, don't worry, Arama. We'll help! Right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Alright...
Arama: #Oh, be careful, Nara {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: I guess we can...
Traveler: Since it's for Rana...
Paimon: Yeah, we have to get into Vanarana as soon as possible to help Rana.
Traveler: It's nothing...

## Talk 10

Arakanta: There is no doubt that Arakanta is the fastest Aranara. Arakanta, as fast as the Rishboland Tiger.
Arakanta: If I could run on the back of the Rishboland Tiger...

## Talk 11

Paimon: Alright, we've helped! So where's the treasure, Arama?
Arama: Isn't "treasure" the incantation to make Nara help?
Paimon: Why isn't Paimon surprised at all?
Traveler: *Gasp*! We were tricked!
Paimon: Did you really think Arama prepared treasure for us?
Paimon: Anyway, how did you learn to use the word "treasure" like that, Arama?
Arama: I've observed Nara, and I noticed that they become very good and very willing to help other Nara once they hear the word "treasure."
Traveler: Some Nara become bad for treasures.
Arama: #Hmm, I see. I've learned a lot. Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Arama: You're amazing! You're good Nara who help Aranara. Now, no one will be afraid to let you enter Vanarana.
Arama: You can enter Vanarana by playing Arana's tune in front of "Silapna."
Traveler: Nara who help for treasures may not be good either.
Traveler: Nara like Paimon would fall for it.
Paimon: Hey! Treasures are great! Don't look down on treasures!
Traveler: I thought...

## Talk 12

Aranaga: The Yajna Grass... Must get it.

## Talk 13

Aralila: Aranishat, you should admit defeat. Don't be like a stubborn twig that refuses to bend against strong gusts. You will break just like it.
Aranishat: Aralila, let's have another match after the moon sinks and the sun rises again!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Oh? This is Vanarana... So many Aranara...
Traveler: It seems like the same place, but...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it! It feels completely different!
Paimon: Since we've arrived in Vanarana, it's time to get a Bija and help Rana.
Arama: Bija? I've heard the stories about it.
Arama: Anyway, this is the real Vanarana, or to be more precise, it's "Mahavanaranapna"...
Paimon: Wh—What a long name! And there are so many "a's"!
Arama: Yes, but we usually don't use its full name because it's too long. If explained in Nara language...
Arama: Ah, I know. It's "the Aranara Forest of Dreams".
Paimon: "Dreams"... So you're saying...
Traveler: That the Vanarana we just saw exists in reality?
Arama: Hmm, it's a story from very, very long ago. I wasn't even a seed then, I was still in a slumber in Sarva. But after Vanarana was destroyed once, we started living in this dream.
Paimon: Huh, interesting past...
Arama: It's very scary! I heard even the sky turned black. Trees swayed like grass on a field under strong winds, and they fell to the ground. And then very, very scary monsters were everywhere.
Arama: Luckily, they are all stories, not memories. Anyway, if you wish to leave Vanarana's dream, sing the Rhythm of the Great Dream in front of Silapna, and it's the same to return here.
Arama: Come with me. Araja will find a way to get you a Bija.
Traveler: And we're in a dream now?
Traveler: We need a Bija.
Paimon: Hmm, according to Arana, we must get a Bija from Vanarana to help Rana.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Oh? This is Vanarana... So many Aranara...
Traveler: It seems like the same place, but...
Traveler: We need a Bija.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it! It feels completely different!
Paimon: Since we've arrived in Vanarana, it's time to get a Bija and help Rana.
Paimon: Hmm, according to Arana, we must get a Bija from Vanarana to help Rana.
Arama: Bija? I see.
Arama: Anyway, this is the real Vanarana, or to be more precise, it's "Mahavanaranapna"...
Paimon: Wh-What a long name! And there are so many "a's"!
Arama: ...But we usually don't use its full name because it's too long. If explained in Nara's language... Ah, I know. It's "Vanarana of Great Dreams".
Paimon: #"Dreams"... Speaking of which, we met an Aranara where the researcher was, and {NICKNAME} seems to have had a dream...
Traveler: So the Vanarana we just saw exists in reality?
Traveler: And we're in a dream now?
Arama: Hmm, it's a story from very, very long ago. I wasn't even a seed then, I was still in a slumber in Sarva. But after Vanarana was destroyed once, we started living in this dream.
Paimon: Huh, interesting past...
Arama: It's very scary! I heard even the sky turned black. Trees swayed like grass on a field under strong winds, and they fell to the ground. And then very, very scary monsters were everywhere.

Arama: Come with me. Araja will find a way to get you a Bija.

## Talk 16

Araja: #Whoa, a Nara... I haven't seen one in so long. So tall and golden, just like {M#she}{F#he} said. Welcome to Vanarana.
Arama: #Yes, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon. They're amazing! They're not even scared of Vanagni.
Araja: Whoa! Amazing! Nara who used Arana's tune to get into Vanarana are definitely good Nara whom Arana trusts.

Black Screen Text: You tell both people... well, both Aranara, the reason for your request...
Araja: Bija... The last time I prepared a Bija was a long time ago. I heard the Golden Nara and Aramuhukunda were still here then.

Araja: Besides that, you must <color=#00E1FFFF>get a few Vasoma Fruits</color> from the Vasara Trees in Ashvattha's Concourses. Three of them should be enough.
Paimon: Ashvattha... Vasara Tree... Vasoma...
Araja: #But I haven't been able to leave the dream for a long time, and I don't remember where Ashvattha's Concourses are. I'll leave the finding to Arama and Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arama: #An adventure with Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Paimon: An adventure with Arama!
Paimon: Speaking of which, the incident in Vimara Village is also very concerning. Can we ask other Aranara to find out who's trying to harm the children there?

Paimon: Hmm... So that's when Marana came into existence?
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
Araja: On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
Araja: They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
Araja: Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
Paimon: So that's why Iotham was afraid of the Fatui... They are tall, and they wear black...
Araja: Of course. In my stories, Marana's Avatar takes many forms. Sometimes beasts, sometimes birds, sometimes Nara, sometimes blight...
Araja: But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.
Paimon: #Hmm... Let Paimon think for a moment. {NICKNAME}. There's so much for us to do.
Traveler: I'm used to it.
Paimon: We must find Ashvattha to... get a va-something? Then go to <color=#00E1FFFF>Devantaka Mountain</color> to look for Ara... Ararycan? Is that right? Then we have to find Arapandu in <color=#00E1FFFF>Apam Woods</color> and Aranakin in <color=#00E1FFFF>Gandha Hill</color>...
Paimon: Argh! Ugh! Aranara names are so difficult!
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, this is for you.
Arama: I've been observing. Nara must use this to remember. Otherwise, Nara memories will get messed up and won't be able to form a story.
Paimon: Is that... an old notebook?
Araja: #Oh, it belonged to Nara Varuna... Maybe it's destiny that it's going to another Golden Nara like Nara {NICKNAME}.
Araja: #{M#She}{F#He} called it the Aranyaka because it's the stories of {M#her}{F#his} adventures in the forest with us Aranara. But those stories are lost.
Araja: #Nara {NICKNAME}, I hope it'll be of help to you. I'm really looking forward to Festival Utsava.
Traveler: What a nuisance.
Traveler: As long as it helps Rana.
Traveler: ...Let's talk about it later.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Traveler: About "Marana's Avatar"...
Paimon: Yeah, it really caught Paimon's attention just now because Iotham mentioned something similar too...
Araja: It's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
Araja: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata returned to Sarva, and Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
Paimon: Hmm... So that's when Marana came into existence?
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.

Araja: But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.
Traveler: About the Vasoma Fruit...
Arama: The Vasoma Fruit is a fruit filled with dreams and energy! It isn't as powerful as the Bija, but it's amazing too.
Araja: A Bija can be formed by feeding a Vasoma Fruit to the Ashvattha Tree. It's a great tree planted by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's the origin of Aranara.
Traveler: ...Let's talk about it later.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Traveler: ...Let's talk about it later.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll ask Araja later if we have more questions!
Traveler: But we don't have time for all that!
Paimon: Araja, you mentioned that Nara don't have much time, so shouldn't we get a Bija as soon as possible?
Traveler: Yay! Festival Utsava!
Paimon: No, no! That's completely wrong! We don't have time for festivals! Araja mentioned that Nara don't have much time, so shouldn't we get a Bija as soon as possible?
Traveler: What do you need us to do?
Araja: Yes, we need Nara's help to form a Bija.
Traveler: It's urgent. We don't have time to waste.
Traveler: Arana sent us.
Traveler: The Vanarana in dreams...

## Talk 17

Araesha: The unseen and uncatchable that slips past the moon's gaze and encourages the growth of sprouts... This is so simple that any Aranara can immediately get the answer... I need another riddle.

## Talk 18
