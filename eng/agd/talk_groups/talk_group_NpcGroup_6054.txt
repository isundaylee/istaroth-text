Traveler: Are you waiting for someone?
Aphila: No, I'm waiting for my Saurian! They are my trusty partner.
Aphila: We've known each other since we were very little, and pretty much grew up together. According to the elders in the tribe, our birthdays were separated by just one day.
Aphila: They learned everything a lot faster when we were little, too. At one point, I was worried that they'd leave me behind, since they learned how to fly so much faster than me.
Aphila: All was well, though, for I soon caught up! It wasn't long before we went on our first flight together, and I decided to name them "The Twilight of That Day."
Aphila: Sorry, I just started rambling...
Aphila: I just love them so much, I can never shut up when I start talking about them. It's my bad.
