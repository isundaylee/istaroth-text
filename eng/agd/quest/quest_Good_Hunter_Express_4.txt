# Good Hunter Express


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got some other things to do.
Sara: Oh, sure. I'll go get someone else to help. That said, it's been quite dangerous outside lately.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure, I'll deliver it.
Sara: Great! Thanks for helping.
Sara: Please remember to *avoid getting hit by any element* while you're on your way. Be careful now, and don't get hurt.

## Talk 3

Hardworking Silio: So... hungry...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Well, here's what happened. Silio ordered a serving of Mondstadt Hash Brown, and said that he'd like it delivered around this time.
Sara: This hash brown is particularly fragile. If you shake it too much, it might fall apart. *Please deliver it in time* so that it can maintain its crumbly mouthfeel.
Sara: If something happens to you out there, please bring that serving back, and I'll prepare a new one for you.
