# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Have you found anything of value?
Chalmet: A lot of it is old and out of date. Reports, memos, progress updates, things like that.
Chalmet: But I found also some data from projects which were halted before completion, and even some detailed descriptions of their work.
Chalmet: And those could be useful, as the Institute is planning to restart its research projects.
Chalmet: So overall, everything is moving in the right direction. How wonderful.
