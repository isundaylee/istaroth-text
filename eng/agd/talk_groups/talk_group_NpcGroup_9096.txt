## Talk

Arlecchino: It's my turn to play the guest, I see. A novel turn of events.
Arlecchino: I shall follow your lead, and play the good visitor.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Arlecchino: Thank you for inviting me to this realm. This has proved a fine vacation spot.
Arlecchino: Is a transfer of ownership on the cards, by any chance?
Traveler: ...Huh!?
Arlecchino: No need to startle. This is a quiet and secure location, shielded from outside disturbances. It would make for a good backup base.
Arlecchino: Any object that could solve many problems is worth paying a fair price for.
Traveler: Sorry to disappoint...
Arlecchino: An unfortunate answer, but not an unexpected one.
Arlecchino: This resembles a "home" more than it does a base. Let us keep it that way, then.
Traveler: Speaking of "home"...
Arlecchino: Is something the matter?
Traveler: Want to hold a "family barbecue"?
Arlecchino: A fine suggestion. This space is sufficiently large for a family gathering.
Arlecchino: The children will be glad to have the chance to visit and play at a friend's place. It is agreed, then... as for the costs of this gathering, simply leave it to me.
Traveler: All the children from the House of the Hearth would be welcome to come.
Traveler: But this isn't for sale.
Traveler: You want to buy the Serenitea Pot?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat?
Arlecchino: That seems agreeable. Is there anything you would like to discuss?
Traveler: Well...
Arlecchino: The children often say so too.
Arlecchino: "I'm not sure what to say to 'Father,' what sort of topic I should go with..." I hear such discussions often.
Arlecchino: In truth, talking to me is not very difficult. I can make conversation on most topics.
Traveler: (Discuss the aquabus's design principles.)
Arlecchino: This is quite a specific engineering question. Your interest is unexpected.
Arlecchino: The internal structure of an aquabus contains a number of intricate clockwork components, which allow it to be powered by different energy sources.
Arlecchino: I've also heard that during the aquabus's initial trial run, some passengers sent in feedback indicating that they would prefer a more unique look for the vessel.
Traveler: Wow, I would have never guessed...
Arlecchino: Some suggested that the vessels adopt an Angelic Sea Hare-like design, but this was rejected due to considerations for the vehicle's overall capabilities.
Arlecchino: If you would like to hear more about the history of the aquabus, I could arrange for a "friend" from the Fontaine Research Institute to explain it to you — during a boat ride, of course.
Arlecchino: Is there anything else you'd like to ask?
Traveler: Wow, you really can hold a conversation on just about anything!
Arlecchino: But of course. Finding common topics and ground are indispensable assets in building interpersonal relations.
Arlecchino: The work of intelligence gathering merits preparation, but it would be unwise to pin all one's hopes on intel. As such, I try to dabble in as many fields as I can to gain more knowledge.
Traveler: Doesn't that get dry after a while?
Arlecchino: Just the opposite. The more I learn, the more clearly I see how the world operates, and the easier it becomes to lead an elegant life.
Arlecchino: You must first take care of yourself before caring for others. Knowledge and skill broaden your options.
Arlecchino: If you have something you wish to share, feel free to come look for me. As long as nothing confidential is involved, I'm sure it will make for a wonderful chat.
Traveler: (Discuss the art of selecting desserts.)
Arlecchino: Ah. It appears you quite enjoyed my choice of desserts for Miss Furina's table.
Arlecchino: There are many tricks to choosing treats. The key is having a sufficient "understanding" of everything.
Arlecchino: The varieties of the treats, their stores of origin, the artisanship of their creators, as well as how they're plated and presented... Each of these factors builds upon the others. Still more intelligence is required if you are making this purchase on the behalf of another.
Arlecchino: Their personalities, relationships, current situations, and long-held preferences... There is no one-size-fits-all answer.
Traveler: That sounds... really complicated.
Arlecchino: A novice would find it difficult, yes, but experience is cumulative. Start at buying gifts for friends and go from there.
Traveler: (Chat about the latest opera production.)
Arlecchino: "The Unexpected Dream," you mean? I found it a mature production, a tale about love that blossomed through all manner of strange coincidences and circumstances.
Arlecchino: I watched the premiere. The actors were not sufficiently rehearsed, and incidents you'd expect from an unpolished production did occur, but the audience laughed and cheered them on all the same.
Traveler: I've heard that they've brought on a famous actress to the upcoming show.
Arlecchino: That is indeed the case. If you are familiar with opera, you should know her. She was the protagonist in "Romaritime Romance" as well — you could say that she's at the peak of her career right now.
Arlecchino: The fourth run of performances should start the day after tomorrow. If you're interested, I can invite you to come along.
Traveler: Actually, nothing's coming to mind...

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Arlecchino: The weather is good, as is the wind. Let us go for a walk.
Traveler: Where shall we go?
Arlecchino: There are two sights I enjoy more than most — the sea by day, and the skies by night.
Arlecchino: When I need to think, the former would be my choice. If I am in a good mood, then I will favor the latter.
Traveler: Why do you like the sea?
Arlecchino: I've rarely seen a Fontainian, native or adopted, not profess a fondness for the waves.
Arlecchino: It is full of mystery and peril, but also accepts all manner of wishes. Furthermore... the sea is vast, vast enough to serve as a repository for many kinds of frustrations.
Traveler: Hmm... so are you saying that gazing at the sea can improve your mood?
Arlecchino: No, I meant something more... literal than that. Namely, that the sea can make things that disgust you disappear, never to emerge again.
Arlecchino: It is good for secrets that should never see the light of day to sink to the forgotten depths.
Traveler: That sounds ominous...
Arlecchino: Only when your gaze can pierce through the sea's shimmering surface and look into its frigid depths, will you truly understand the truth of this world.
Traveler: Why do you like the night sky?
Arlecchino: Hmm... I suppose I could share a story from a long time ago.
Arlecchino: When I was young, I once had a dream. In it, I stood on a vast plain, with a red moon hanging in the sky.
Arlecchino: The moon rotated gradually, and as I stared at it, it, too, watched me silently.
Arlecchino: I cannot describe what it was like to be the object of its gaze, so filled with death and grief... Or was it fear and pity? It has been too long, and my memories of it have faded.
Traveler: ...Was that really a dream?
Arlecchino: I wish to know as well, but the truth will not simply present itself to me.
Arlecchino: Perhaps I shall one day witness that dreamscape once more, or perhaps I never will. Just as you and I may cross blades one day — or perhaps our relations will remain ever amiable.
Arlecchino: The allure of the future lies in its uncertainty. Regardless, let us lay our worries aside and enjoy this fine breeze.
Traveler: ...Was that really the moon?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Arlecchino.
Arlecchino: And to you. Ah, yes. Before turning in for the night, I noticed some corners of the realm that had not been cleaned for some time.
Arlecchino: You should see to that once the opportunity presents itself.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Arlecchino.
Arlecchino: Indeed. I was getting ready to retire myself.
Arlecchino: An early night is a balm for exhaustion, and presages a productive tomorrow.

## Talk

Arlecchino: Many see me as a solitary, mysterious person.
Arlecchino: In truth, I do not mind mingling with the crowd. People-watching is also one of my interests.
Arlecchino: Of course, whether those in the crowd would enjoy seeing me... is a completely different matter.

## Talk

Arlecchino: If the world could be likened to a stage, then everyone must find their own place.
Arlecchino: I believe myself better suited to the audience stands. What about you?
Arlecchino: Would you sit by my side, or would you prefer to take the stage?
