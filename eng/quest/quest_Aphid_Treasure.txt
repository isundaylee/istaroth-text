# Aphid Treasure


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, Xilonen! Didn't expect to see you here.
Xilonen: Hey there, Traveler, Paimon! What, is it so weird to see me at my own home?
Paimon: Well, no, but Paimon thought you'd have found a beautiful tree to get a few days' shut-eye in by now since we just solved such a big problem.
Xilonen: Haha, I'd love to, but everyone's been busy with the reconstruction. It'd feel wrong to slack off at a time like this.
Traveler: So this is where you've decided to contribute?
Xilonen: Here, let me show you something.
Paimon: Wow! What a pretty jewel!
Traveler: Looks very valuable.
Xilonen: Yes, but that's not all.
Xilonen: This is a Phlogiston Honey Pearl with peculiar patterning that's been making the rounds recently in the market. They're usually produced by Phlogiston Aphids. Pretty common, really.
Xilonen: But these oddly patterned ones are both novel and scarce, making them quite expensive.
Paimon: Paimon gets it! That's just like how we love treasure chests that have awesome-looking patterns on them too!
Xilonen: Hehe, so I bought a few for my collection, and guess what? After a few days, the potted plant I was raising nearby had withered.
Xilonen: I didn't think much of it at first. I mean, I don't know the first thing about growing plants anyway. Later, however, I heard Kachina say that some people got sick.
Xilonen: Most of them were customers of Cheven's gemstone shop. Even Cheven herself proved no exception.
Paimon: Huh? Wait... Did it all have something to do with this gem, then?
Xilonen: I thought so too, and so I smashed one open... and discovered that it contained some Abyssal energy.
Xilonen: Low-concentration, of course, and isolated by the outer shell of the honey pearl itself â€” which made it almost undetectable.
Traveler: What about the victims? How are they doing now?
Xilonen: No need to worry. The low concentration resulted in rather minor maladies, with most being sleepy or being prone to exhaustion.
Xilonen: It hasn't had any effect on the more fit, like myself or Kachina.
Paimon: Phew... And here Paimon thought this might be a sticky situation.
Xilonen: Sticky? Like the honey in Honey Pearls?
Traveler: I'd bet Paimon was thinking "sticky like Slimes" instead.
Paimon: Hehe, you know it! And fortunately for us, this problem's only a threat to ordinary people, just like Slimes!
Xilonen: Heh, you two really understand one another.
Paimon: We totally do! Still, we've met lots of people scared stiff by Slimes, so it's not like we can ignore it just because it isn't dangerous for us, right?
Xilonen: Exactly. I already explained the situation to our Chief, and asked him to collect and destroy all the strange Honey Pearls on the market.
Traveler: But we still need to attack this issue at the source.
Xilonen: My sentiments exactly. Like I said, Phlogiston Honey Pearls are produced by Phlogiston Aphids. If anything is the source of the problem, it'll be them.
Xilonen: I went to look for Kinich, since he's got the better head for investigating between us. Yesterday, he sent word that he found Aphids with Abyssal contamination.
Xilonen: There are also traces of their presence near the Scions of the Canopy and the People of the Springs. Right, and Kinich also notified Mualani.
Xilonen: However, they're not exactly gemstone enthusiasts, so the problem didn't affect them as much.
Paimon: Hmm... Looks like there are all sorts of lingering Abyss-related issues, huh? Guess we've gotta be patient.
Traveler: How do you plan to deal with the Aphids?
Xilonen: Catch 'em first. We can still purify this level of Abyssal contamination, we shouldn't need to harm the Aphids.
Xilonen: Kinich has marked out places where they gather, and I'm heading to a spot near our tribe.
Xilonen: Would you like to come along, by the way? A little bug-catching sounds like fun, doesn't it?
Xilonen: I'd have invited Kachina, but unfortunately, she's already occupied.
Traveler: Are we there so you can slack off?
Xilonen: Hah! Do I look like I'm going to lie down and watch you from a tree? We'll be working together.
Traveler: Just kidding. Let's go.
Xilonen: Glad to have you! Would've been a boring trip otherwise. Let's head off, then.
Traveler: I'm game.
Xilonen: Glad to have you! Would've been a boring trip otherwise. Let's head off, then.
Traveler: Nah, seems like a boring gig.
Xilonen: Ugh, guess it's crushing boredom for me, then... Sure you don't wanna come? I was planning on giving you a little something for your time, you know.
Paimon: Ooh! There's pay? What is it?
Xilonen: Shiny, shiny stuff. Pretty, too.
Paimon: #Mora! It's gotta be Mora! C'mon, Traveler, are we gonna pass up a chance to make some money?
Traveler: Alright, I was just kidding earlier. Let's go!
Xilonen: Haha, fine by me. Let's go.
Traveler: Well, guess we'll do it for the Mora.
Xilonen: Haha, fine by me. Let's go.
Traveler: Something looks off.
Xilonen: Hah, sharp as always.

## Talk 2

Xilonen: This is our spot.
Xilonen: See that? An Aphid, polluted with the power of the Abyss. Way larger than any normal one ever gets.
Paimon: Whoa, what a huge Aphid... Uh, is it dangerous?
Xilonen: Relax, even though it's been contaminated by the Abyss, its behavior doesn't seem to have changed at all.
Xilonen: Still, I've specially prepared an extra-large insect net to make sure everything goes smoothly. Here ya go. It'll come in handy for catching them in a moment.
Xilonen: Oh right! By the way, Kinich mentioned something rather unusual. He discovered that there's a special berry that always grows near areas where Abyssal Aphids are found.
Xilonen: The berry contains a toxin that can paralyze the Aphids, so if we spread them on the net, it'll stop the Aphids from struggling.
Paimon: Huh? Why are Aphids living around a berry that paralyzes them? Seems kinda strange to Paimon...
Xilonen: I think so too. First time I've heard of animals living alongside something that's dangerous to them.
Paimon: It's totally unnatural! Wait... Could someone be behind them getting infected with the Abyss!?
Traveler: Paimon's sure on high alert these days.
Paimon: Hey! Even the dumbest guides grow up! And Paimon was never dumb to start with anyway.
Xilonen: The only problem with that is that we searched everywhere, but didn't find any trace of human involvement.
Xilonen: So let's just chalk it up to some unknown natural Aphid behavior for now.
Paimon: Fine, but no matter what, we've got to catch them first! We don't want anything else that makes people sick running around.
Paimon: Bugbuster Squad, move out!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Phew! We did it! Though this bugger certainly looks big, it was pretty easy to catch.
Paimon: It's not dangerous at all, other than the fact it likes to run away. The insect net and numbing berries were really useful too!
Xilonen: Hehe, but seeing as that it's the Abyss these Aphids are contaminated with, they could attract monsters. Best to be on your guard.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right! And since these all-too-convenient berries just happen to be here... Well, if it was Paimon, she'd steer clear of any enemies!
Paimon: #Being around berries like this isn't normal or natural, Traveler! We should keep our eyes peeled. There's something real fishy going on for sure!
Traveler: You certainly look like an expert on suspicious goings-on.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon learned it from you!
Xilonen: Ha!
Xilonen: Anyway, thanks for coming out here with me. We've taken care of one area, so it's about time for a nice little break.
Xilonen: After all, I'll need your help over the next few days too.
