# The Causality of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Nahida: We don't have many more festivals to waste. Hurry and find the truth.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Paimon can't believe it's Dehya who wants to show us something this time. Two days ago, we were the ones taking her to see Dunyarzad...

## Talk 3

Traveler: The Moon, illusions, and lies... What do they all mean?
Traveler: What's happening right now seems to have happened before. This feeling has been getting stronger and stronger...
Traveler: The Grand Sage said, "Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content." Did he mean something more?
Traveler: Dehya sold her greatsword to raise additional funds, and she was injured because she wasn't used to her new weapon.
Traveler: My mind feels exhausted, even though I haven't done too much thinking. What is going on?
Traveler: We've already experienced the Sabzeruz Festival many times. And... the day of the festival seems to be in a perpetual samsara.
Traveler: People in Sumeru don't dream. What a strange phenomenon.
Traveler: Okay, Nahida said, "The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people."
Traveler: Mercenaries rely heavily on muscle memory, and Dehya was able to use her experiences to avoid injury in later samsara cycles.
Traveler: The beep is a prompt tone for Akasha operations. We still hear it every night, even though we removed our Akasha Terminals.
Traveler: All the bizarre spaces I saw outside the city had one thing in common: a lack of human presence.
Traveler: Those spaces remind me of... dreams. Like the one I had in the Avidya Forest, except these have no sign of human presence.
Traveler: Those spaces kept disappearing before my eyes, but as soon as that beep sounded, many more spaces materialized.
Traveler: Those dreamscapes kept vanishing, but as soon as that beep sounded, more new spaces appeared.
Traveler: ..Was that space actually the real world? But wouldn't a real space just randomly disappearing like that be catastrophic?
Traveler: My impression is that each day in this samsara only ends at the sound of that beep from the Akasha.
Traveler: That should be it... The flow of time is endlessly cycling within one single day.
Traveler: If all our memories of a day are erased at the end of that day, then we would unwittingly relive the same day again and again.
Traveler: We are all in a dream. It isn't that the people of Sumeru don't dream. Rather, the Akasha is taking their dreams from them.
Nahida: The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate.
Nahida: It is a manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power.
Nahida: It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace.
Nahida: And it grants knowledge to the people.
Traveler: They say that alchemical divination is the Dendro Archon's divine revelation. So then, if Nahida has referred to herself as the Moon...
Traveler: Now that I think about it, wasn't "illusions" a hint that we're all dreaming?
Traveler: Now that I think about it, wasn't "illusions" hinting at the Sages' deception of Sumeru's people?
Traveler: That doesn't sound right... I need to carefully think things through...
Traveler: Hmm... I can't seem to cohesively piece everything together.

## Talk 4

Dehya: This is it.
Paimon: Huh? This a wooden training dummy. What about it?
Dehya: See those marks on the dummy? Those are the result of several days' worth of practice.
Dehya: Let's say the sages didn't replace it every day. Shouldn't it be hacked to pieces by now?
Paimon: That's true, but what if they did?
Dehya: Then the sages would have had to reproduce every mark I left during previous training sessions.
Dehya: I'm a professional fighter. My martial school has always emphasized the importance of refined control.
Dehya: The force, angle, and entry point of each strike is calculated and deliberate. That's why I remember every mark on the dummy, as well as my state of mind as I made each strike.
Dehya: It's just as they say: Each swordsman has their own unique style, and even the same swordsman can't make the same cut twice. It would be impossible to copy these marks.
Paimon: Is it really impossible? What if they used some fancy machine to carve every single mark?
Dehya: People often say that a Kamera's photo can never replace an artist's painting because the former has no spirit to it.
Dehya: The same thing applies here. At a mere glance, I can differentiate carved marks from the results of combat training.
Traveler: ...That makes sense.
Dehya: Phew... I hope that cleared things up for you? Hey, is this that new Brainsercise game that's been super popular with the scholars lately? It's surprisingly fun.
Dehya: Anyway, it's getting late. I should escort Miss Dunyarzad to Nilou's stage. See ya later.
Paimon: Welp, back to square one. Is our memory deletion theory also wrong? *sigh*
Paimon: But at least we've reached some other conclusions in the meantime?
Traveler: We're not in a time loop.
Paimon: Yep, that's true. So... can we think of any new ideas right now?
Traveler: Let me think...
Paimon: Strange? Paimon feels like everything's been strange lately...
Traveler: How come... we've never thought about leaving the city?
Paimon: Huh? Leaving the city... You're right! It's really strange how we never thought of such a simple solution. Many things should become clear if we can confirm the flow of time outside of the city.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe it... Did we miss this because we're tunnel-visioning too hard on our other theories, or because we're just too tired?
Traveler: It is really strange.
Paimon: How about we go back and ask Nahida? Maybe we've forgotten something about leaving the city.
Traveler: We should've thought of this a long time ago.
Traveler: I suddenly realized that something is strange...
Traveler: We're not in the real world.
Traveler: It seems we'll have to abandon this theory...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Nahida, we're back!
Nahida: You're back early today. Did you find something new?
Paimon: Sort of. We're mostly sure now that we're not in a time loop, and we also aren't in the real world. But at the same time, we have a new question...
Traveler: What will happen if we try to leave the city?
Nahida: Leaving the city... As far as I remember, you've mentioned your plans to do that twice before...
Traveler: !?
Paimon: We did? But we don't remember anything! What happened after we talked about those plans? What did we say when we got back?
Nahida: Let me think... I don't think you ever actually told me what the outcome was. Oh â€” it's probably more accurate to say that both times, you never came back the whole night.
Nahida: But you two sometimes stay out the entire night anyway, so at the time, I didn't think too much about it.
Paimon: It is true that sometimes we lose track of time during our investigations. Before we know it, it'll already be the next day. But still... neither of us remember anything about leaving town.
Nahida: Really? That's kinda strange. In theory, I should've already awakened all your memories.
Traveler: Let's try again tomorrow.
Paimon: Yup! Something here's definitely fishy. Let's get to the bottom of this tomorrow!
Paimon (???): *beep*
Traveler: Maybe this is the key.
Traveler: Have we ever tried leaving the city?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nahida: Um...
Traveler: We aren't in a time loop...
Paimon: Ooh! Then the beep we hear every night could just be indicating the deletion of our memories.
Paimon: That's why when we wake up, everyone thinks the Sabzeruz Festival hasn't happened yet. It's already the next day, but everyone still thinks it's the day before.
Paimon: But muscle memory can't be erased. That's why Dehya has been getting better at using her greatsword! Now everything makes sense!
Nahida: ...Hm, a brilliant deduction.
Paimon: Nahida, tell us if we're right or wrong!
Nahida: To put it simply, it's as if you've mistaken a Pyro Crystalfly for a Firefly in the night. You lost sight of its true nature because you focused too much on your perception that it glows.
Paimon: That isn't simple at all!
Traveler: Still the wrong conclusion, huh...
Nahida: Why don't you go talk to Miss Dehya again? You might learn something new.
Paimon: Right... She did help us find our latest clue, after all. Let's go!
Traveler: Instead, our memories are being erased at the end of each day.
