Shenhe: I don't get it...
Ganyu: Is something wrong, Shenhe? Tell me. Perhaps I can help.
Shenhe: The color black doesn't get dirty easily, so I thought this outfit would be acceptable to wear to work. But Xiangling told me it was inappropriate.
Shenhe: But inappropriate... how?
Ganyu: ...She probably just meant the outfit isn't suitable for that particular environment and occasion.
Ganyu: But for a festival gathering with friends, a nighttime stroll, or an important banquet... your outfit is more than appropriate, Shenhe.
Shenhe: So you're saying it's only something I should wear in front of important people.
Ganyu: Hm... I suppose that's another way to think of it.
