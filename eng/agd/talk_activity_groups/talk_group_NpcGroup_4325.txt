Sudabeh: #Thanks, Traveler! I'm learning really hard! To become a distinguished lady sooner, I'm learning how to cook!
Sudabeh: #Traveler, have a taste of the curry I made! My father and brother all thought it was good after they tried it!
Sudabeh: They told me not to cook this too often because it's worth being cherished since it's too delicious, but I will surely keep cooking it!
