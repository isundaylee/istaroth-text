Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Zurvan: Thanks to you, the Sign of Apaosha has been entirely extinguished.
Zurvan: Although the power of the defilement can never be fully eradicated, should it wish to return and infest this place, then it may just take a little longer yet.
Zurvan: We Pari will also take this chance to rest and recuperate.
