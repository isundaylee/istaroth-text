Changshun: The Lantern Rite is really quite different this year...
Changshun: I'd heard that the Ministry of Civil Affairs was organizing a fireworks show, so I started pooling resources to make those fireworks through various channels.
Changshun: Then halfway through, the news that Lady Ningguang was rebuilding the Jade Chamber broke, and the remuneration was so tempting that I changed tacks...
Changshun: In the end, I failed to accomplish either project... I suppose there really is no room for indecisive dawdling in business.
Changshun: But although I didn't manage to seize this opportunity, I did still manage to prepare some material for Xiao Lanterns. Not for selling â€” just for sending them to my neighbors and friends.
Changshun: I hope that everyone will enjoy this year's Lantern Rite.

Traveler: I'll take all your Cor Lapis.
Changshun: You want ALL my Cor Lapis? Ahh, I've already agreed to several orders.
Changshun: That said, none are in writing. The buyers are being incredibly indecisive.
Traveler: Then let the Feiyun Commerce Guild take it off your hands.
Changshun: Oh, it's for the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Hmm, seems business trends are about to change in Liyue...
Changshun: Oh, ahh... nothing. Just talking to myself. Come, let us sign a contract.
Changshun: Don't worry about my prior client, he hadn't made any down payments or anything. Quite common in the industry.
Changshun: Thank you for your patronage, we hope the Feiyun Commerce Guild will continue to do business with us!

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Changshun: Liyue's economic boom could never have happened without the contributions of Rex Lapis. Even our coins, Mora, are named after him.
Changshun: There isn't a single businessperson in Liyue that doesn't worship him, and not a single transaction goes ahead that is not to his glory.
Changshun: So now that he has departed... It's going to be cataclysmic for the business world. Things might already be changing as we speak.

Traveler: You are...?
Changshun: I'm Changshun, a businesswoman and also a researcher in the field of Liyue Mercantilism.
Changshun: Is there anything I can do for you?
Traveler: Liyue Mercantilism...?
Changshun: That's right. Simply put, it's the philosophy of how to make as much Mora as possible, based on the accumulated wisdom of all the businesspeople in Liyue.
Changshun: It's not enough in today's business environment to just throw yourself into the pursuit of profit. You have to educate yourself and consolidate the best practices from across the board to develop a successful business strategy.

Traveler: How's business?
Changshun: It's been quite good. Feiyun Slope is prime commercial real estate, after all.
Changshun: If there was one snag, it would be that my store has never been graced with Rex Lapis' presence before...
Changshun: Uh, I mean, this new shop of mine has never had the honor of Rex Lapis' personal patronage.
Changshun: Those stores that have met with both his presence and his approval have all become incredibly popular household names.
Changshun: *sigh* Well, this is not something that would happen just because I wish for it. Man proposes, and the Archon disposes...
