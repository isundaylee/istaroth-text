# This Novel Seems... Problematic?


## Talk 1

Shigeru: Have you read the reader feedback? Our reviews have been plummeting lately!
Junkichi: Don't worry. This is just the calm before the grand climax!
Junkichi: When the key plot point gets revealed, we'll see a real turnaround in those reviews!
Shigeru: And what good is that if your novel gets axed long before you get there?
Traveler: What's going on?
Shigeru: Traveler, thank goodness you're here.
Shigeru: Junkichi has been adding a lot more wild abilities to the main character, in "Onibudou." It's just been one thing after another ever since that "inspiration trip" of his.
Shigeru: Yae Publishing House has received a lot of negative feedback from readers who say they don't understand why these abilities are appearing. They think that the author isn't taking the story seriously.
Junkichi: They don't know what they're talking about. I'll just keep writing, they'll get it at some point...
Shigeru: Like I was saying, your novel will get axed before you can get to that point!
Shigeru: Oh, whatever... From what I recall, there are a few readers of "Onibudou" around this area...
Shigeru: Why don't you go and ask them if your idea has legs or not?
Junkichi: Fine! I'm sure they'll get it, anyway. Traveler, come with me. I'll need a witness!
Shigeru: Yes, that sounds good. Bring the Traveler with you. That way, you can't deny what they say later.
Traveler: Let's do this.
Junkichi: Okay, let's get going. I'm sure my readers will understand me!
Traveler: How much feature creep is there, anyway?
Junkichi: Just... just a bit.
Shigeru: "A bit"? The main character will soon have more abilities than every other character in the story combined!
Junkichi: Ahem! Let's get going. I'm sure my readers get it!

## Talk 2

Shigeru: Traveler, I'm counting on you. Please record their opinions honestly!

## Talk 3

Yuzu: Hello, what is it?
Traveler: Hello there. Have you read "Onibudou," by any chance?
Yuzu: Huh? I have and I liked it, but... How should I put it? The plot seems a little strange lately.
Yuzu: The main character is constantly getting new abilities and can immediately defeat the enemy with them.
Yuzu: I liked "Onibudou" because of the clever methods the main character used to defeat his enemies, but now... it feels like the author is just being lazy.
Yuzu: Also, most of the abilities the main character gets are only used once. It makes the story seem so... flippant.
Yuzu: I really don't know what the author is thinking...
Junkichi: Ahem... well... let's ask a few more people, shall we? This has got to be an odd case...

## Talk 4

Hasegawa: Hello, is there anything I can help you with?
Traveler: Yes, there is. Have you ever read "Onibudou"?
Hasegawa: Yes, I have! It's a very interesting novel. The characters and the plot are wonderful.
Hasegawa: But... I feel like the author has been slacking off a bit lately.
Junkichi: Uh... Um...
Hasegawa: There are all these new powers that suddenly appear without having ever been referenced before.
Hasegawa: Although it's called an "awakening," it just seems cheap.
Hasegawa: I just think this kind of cheap plot makes the character look cheap too. I really hope the author reconsiders this course...
Junkichi: Traveler, let's... let's go ask someone else...

## Talk 5

Rie: Hi there, are you up for a chat?
Traveler: Indeed. Have you read "Onibudou," by any chance?
Rie: I have. I like the main character a lot, too.
Rie: But I've been having a hard time reading it lately...
Traveler: A hard time?
Rie: In the last few chapters, the main character was suddenly bestowed with all these new abilities.
Rie: The story spends a lot of time talking about how those abilities were awakened and how they can be used.
Rie: And the names of those abilities are getting harder and harder to follow. I can't remember any of them.
Rie: If I keep reading, I don't think I will be able to follow the story without understanding these abilities.
Rie: *sigh* I was thinking of giving the book a rest and switching to something a little easier to follow.
Junkichi: Uh... Let's...
Traveler: Let's head back...
Junkichi: Okay... I don't get why this is happening...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Shigeru: Alright then, how did it turn out? Did you get the readers'...
Shigeru: ...Wait, why does he look so depressed... what kind of feedback did you get?
Shigeru: *sigh*... So, Junkichi, will you accept the feedback now?
Junkichi: I can't believe it... How did this happen...
Junkichi: Are my ideas... and my writing... not interesting enough?
Shigeru: As I said, advancing the plot purely by giving the character new powers can be dangerous...
Shigeru: The new traits might be momentarily popular, but as soon as the novelty wears off, the readers will get bored.
Shigeru: This is years of experience talking, you know.
Junkichi: Iâ€”I know...
Shigeru: It's not too late to change it, though... We can't reverse the reviews of the previous chapters, but we can get the following chapters back on solid footing...
Shigeru: Thank you, Traveler. It's actually better to let him take a hit now. If he kept on writing like that, he would definitely be worse off overall.
Shigeru: So, thank you. This is your payment. Please take it.
