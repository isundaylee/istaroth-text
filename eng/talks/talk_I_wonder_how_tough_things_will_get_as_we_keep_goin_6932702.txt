Ganyu: I wonder how tough things will get as we keep going? Hmm. Funnily enough, that's a question I rarely ask myself.
Ganyu: I've always felt that so long as I focus on doing everything within my power to complete all of my duties, I'll take whatever troubles lie ahead in my stride.
Ganyu: And if that still doesn't solve the problem... Well, that just means I didn't work as hard as I should've, right?
