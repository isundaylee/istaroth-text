Traveler: Not afraid of scalding yourself?
Ipora: Hah, what are you talking about? I wouldn't be here if I was afraid of the heat!
Ipora: See those Koholasaurs? They should give you an idea of how hot these pools are.
Ipora: But really, I think it's great that you can soak in the pool and socialize with Koholasaurs while you're at it.
Ipora: Oh, and this guy from Inazuma taught me how to make hot spring eggs. So now, I've even got some snacks.

Traveler: See you.
Ipora: Bye-bye! Be careful not to get scalded by the hot water!

Traveler: Take care of yourself.
Ipora: Got it. I'll soak for a while longer then head back.
Ipora: Phew... This almost feels like I'm melting from the inside out.
