# Talk Dialog

Chevreuse: Miss Yoimiya... We haven't had the chance to talk, but please accept my thanks for everything you've done over the past few days.
Yoimiya: Oh? But I feel like I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
Chevreuse: I'm very grateful for your assistance during that special performance in the warehouse.
Chevreuse: It was always going to be somewhat risky. To engage and draw away Morris all on your own...
Chevreuse: You're only a civilian and have never been trained to act in such a dangerous situation...
Yoimiya: Don't say it like that! As the director's assistant, it was my duty to help out the crew however I could. It was an honor to help you solve the case.
Yoimiya: I have to admit though, my heart was thumping super hard the entire time I was laying on the ground. I was scared that everyone would notice, hehe.
Chevreuse: You did great.
Yoimiya: Oh, and before I forget! If you ever visit Inazuma, please come and pay a visit to Naganohara Fireworks. I'll make some fireworks for you â€” I even know what shape I'd make!
Chevreuse: I'm guessing... a musket?
Yoimiya: Hehe, telling you now would ruin the surprise! If you really want to see it, just come and visit me!
