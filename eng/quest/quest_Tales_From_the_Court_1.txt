# Tales From the Court


## Talk 1

Livre: I repeat...
Cornelia: Mr. Livre. I understand your request, and I'm willing to assist you to the best of my ability, but... Well, please look at this application...
Cornelia: The person in charge here is Mr. Clapiers. All the materials you previously submitted are his to sort and deal with. Apart from him, none of us are permitted to handle them.
Cornelia: He's presently out on business. His official stamp is needed before your materials can enter our expenses calculation system.
Livre: Yeah, yeah! You know what? I've been here three times already — are you going to handle my case, or aren't you?
Cornelia: Please calm down, Mr. Livre. There are only two people in Mr. Clapiers's office — the other is Mr. Monthois...
Cornelia: But he's getting on in years and is waiting to retire. In truth, he hasn't done any work in the office for a while now. He doesn't even draw a salary anymore.
Livre: Then I'll just go to the office and make the old man stamp my stuff. Archons, I'll stamp them myself if I must!
Cornelia: I'm very sorry, but that won't do. First, it contravenes the rules, and second, the key to the stamp is with Mr. Clapiers, and only he can access it.
Cornelia: As for me, I have other things to attend to as well... Please believe me when I say that Mr. Clapiers will return and help you settle this matter today.
Livre: ...Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Cornelia.
Cornelia: And you too, Mr. Livre.
Black Screen Text: Cornelia leaves in a hurry...
Livre: Looks like I'll have to go home empty-handed, huh... *sigh*
Traveler: What's happened?
Livre: Nothing, really. I just wasted my time — half a day, to be precise.
Livre: I've had it up to here with this Clapiers! The Palais Mermonia ordered a few clockwork meka from us, but they have yet to pay for them!
Livre: The first time I came to look for him, he told me that the office was doing an internal end-of-month audit, and could only dispense funds to external parties next month — as such, my application could not be processed.
Livre: The second time I came, he claimed that they were out of stamp pad ink, and their supplier's ink warehouse had caught fire, which meant that they needed to purchase some elsewhere. This in turn meant that my application could not be stamped.
Livre: The third time, he claimed that this External Assisting Personnel Registration Form had been updated and needed to be filled out again — and of course, they were out of forms, and new ones would only come in tomorrow.
Livre: I was going to come in today and get one, but now he isn't even in the office. Archons...
Rhemia: Hmm? Mr. Livre? Why do you look so upset? Can I help you with anything?
Livre: Officer Rhemia! It's so good to see you. This is what happened...
Black Screen Text: The story comes spilling out of Livre's rambling mouth...
Rhemia: Ah, Mr. Clapiers... He's not easy to get a hold of, for sure, but he really is on Erinnyes at the moment, and not in the Palais Mermonia.
Rhemia: Regardless, however, let's get the form for you first.
Livre: Eh? But Clapiers said that there weren't any more forms...
Rhemia: I have a way to help solve your problem. As I recall, some stores that have long-term arrangements with the Palais Mermonia have encountered the same issue you have.
Rhemia: Their solution is to regularly come to the Palais from time to time to collect forms and documents they might need.
Rhemia: This makes completing and submitting forms easier and quicker on the one hand, and keeps them abreast of changes made to said documents on the other... "It pays to be prepared," as they say.
Livre: Is... that how all the forms disappeared?
Rhemia: And that's why I'd say that these stores must have those extra forms, so let's pay them a visit.
Rhemia: Besides, I'm sure they'd be more than willing to help out once they've heard of your futile trips to the Palais.
Rhemia: Ah, yes. We'd best get the forms you need, fill them out, then bring them to Mr. Clapiers's office before office hours at the Palais end.
Rhemia: Would you be willing to help out, Traveler?
Livre: Traveler, please, help me! If I cannot get this done, I fear that another sleepless night awaits!
Traveler: Alright...
Rhemia: You just need to check out these two stores and try to borrow the newest version of the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form.
Rhemia: Let me see...
Rhemia: Please go to Estelle's smithy and Caron's clock shop.
Rhemia: Not long ago, the former helped the Palais repair street lamps, while the latter was involved in adjusting their clock.
Rhemia: They often take assignments from the Palais, so they're certain to have a form on them somewhere.
Rhemia: We'll be counting on your help regarding those locations, and in the meantime, Livre and I will split up and go to other shops.
Traveler: But what do I need to do?
Traveler: What have you encountered?

## Talk 2

Estelle: What a pain... It's only a bit of Mora...
Traveler: About the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form...
Black Screen Text: You describe Livre's experiences and desire to borrow the form...
Estelle: *sigh* Tough luck for Livre... I'm afraid I haven't any extras.
Estelle: I brought a staff member from the store to assist me when I was repairing street lights at the Palais Mermonia.
Estelle: Now, he was barely any help at all, so I didn't put his name down in the form.
Estelle: But when it came time to hand the form in, Clapiers insisted that I put every last name down...
Estelle: He even said that there would be "serious, unpredictable consequences" if I did not fill it out truthfully.
Estelle: Seriously, it's just one missing name. What serious consequences could that lead to? Preposterous.

## Talk 3

Caron: So tiring... *sigh*
Traveler: About the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form...
Black Screen Text: You describe Livre's experiences and desire to borrow the form...
Caron: This happens pretty often when you're dealing with the Palais Mermonia.
Caron: I do have an extra form, so you can pass it to him.
Caron: But I wouldn't let him get his hopes up about the Palais's work efficiency.
Caron: Even if the form is submitted, it will take some time for the formal allocation of funds. And there's no use pressing them for it either...

## Talk 4

Livre: No one has any surplus forms. What are we going to do...
Rhemia: Has the Palais Mermonia really been hiring contractors this often lately? Curious...
Traveler: The form's here.
Livre: Oh my, oh my! You truly are my savior! If I had worked in vain one more time, I would surely have cast myself into a river!
Rhemia: May I ask you to... refrain from any behavior that might affect your personal safety and the city's image?
Rhemia: Whatever the case, please fill the form out first. Once you've done so, I'll get Ms. Cornelia to pass this on to Mr. Clapiers.
Rhemia: No matter how busy he is, Mr. Clapiers couldn't possibly ignore a form already on his table.
Traveler: I got your form right here.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Livre: I don't know how I can thank you, Officer Rhemia. To be honest, I'd heard that you're still on vacation...
Rhemia: Helping the people of Fontaine is my duty as a police officer.
Rhemia: Alright, let's head out shortly. Any further delay, and we'll fall afoul of the Palais's punctuality with office hours.

### Additional Talk 2

Estelle: Seriously, it's just one missing name. What serious consequences could that lead to? Preposterous.

### Additional Talk 3

Caron: When will the allocation be done, seriously...
