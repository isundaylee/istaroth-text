Raiden Shogun: ...
Raiden Shogun: Since my physical form is here in this realm, I suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.

## Talk

Raiden Shogun (Ei): #Oh, it's you, Traveler.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Perhaps you have come just to see me?

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): It's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that I'm used to.
Traveler: Will it be difficult for you to get used to this place?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): No, not at all.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
Traveler: Okay, that's good.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Thank you for your concern.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Will you remain here a while longer?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): With you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Your companionship... This is one change that I shall not contest.
Traveler: Would you like to join in the action?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of Eternity. I'm afraid I'll have to consider it further.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Yes, I just so happen to have something that I would like to ask you.
Traveler: Oh really? What's that?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): *ahem* I mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
Traveler: The most important ingredient is patience.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I see... Though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): By making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...Is that what you mean?
Traveler: Exactly.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I see. I'll be sure to remember that.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Now that I've benefited from your experience, I'll try to follow your instructions the next time I'm attempting optimizations on the Shogun.
Traveler: Oh, so that's what this is all about...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Hmm? Haven't I already mentioned that I cannot make food?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): However, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): With a more powerful Shogun, I will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
Traveler: I have a feeling that it's not learning how to make desserts that you're after...
Traveler: The most important ingredient is hope.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Hope?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): But no... The more I think about it, it can't possibly be that simple.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Perhaps "hope" means the desire to satisfy the eater.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Yes. Unsheathe your weapon.
Traveler: Wait, you mean... now?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Hmph. Then I will come again once your preparation is complete. I have time.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I will use my blade to confirm whether you are out of practice or not.
Traveler: Wait, are you serious?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Naturally.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): The moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of Eternity. I shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): A simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. It even allows me to verify my own existence.
Traveler: Something seems a bit off...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Huh? So you could see through my guise? Oh. I thought my impression was accurate enough.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Never mind. I'll be honest with you then, I desire to spar with you.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): After all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. It would be a pleasure to train with you.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): However, I feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so I used the identity of the Shogun.
Traveler: There's no need to trick me into it...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Ah, you don't refuse. May I assume you accept then?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Hehe, you should prepare yourself. I certainly won't go easy on you.
Traveler: That's an odd request...
Traveler: Ei? Is that you?
Traveler: I'm not mentally prepared for this.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Ei.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): #Good morning, Traveler.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. Amazing...

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Ei.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Oh, has night fallen already? Then you'd best go have a rest.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): #Good night, Traveler. May your dreams be calm and peaceful.

## Talk

Raiden Shogun: This shrine looks somewhat familiar.
Raiden Shogun: Is this what it means... to reminisce?
Raiden Shogun: So be it. The sensation is not a disagreeable one.

## Talk

Raiden Shogun: A dojo...?
Raiden Shogun: So, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? Clearly, the Musou no Hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
Raiden Shogun: Those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
