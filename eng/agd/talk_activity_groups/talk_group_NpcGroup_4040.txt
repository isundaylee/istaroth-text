Dwarkanath: It seems like a lot of merchant ships have been coming and going lately. I wonder if any of them sell weapons...

Traveler: You want to buy a weapon?
Dwarkanath: I'm fine myself, I already have a handy one. It's just that my brother Iradj is always going on about how he wants a Claymore and he asked me to keep an eye out for one.
Dwarkanath: Strange, just where can I buy a sword that's not only fit for purpose, but also looks nice? I asked him why he wants it, but he just hemmed and hawed without giving me a clear answer...
Dwarkanath: Ah! Maybe he wants to buy it as a gift for a girl somewhere? But... which girl would want a greatsword as a gift?
