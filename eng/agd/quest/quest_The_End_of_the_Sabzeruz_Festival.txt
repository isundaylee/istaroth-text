# The End of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Good morning, Nahida! Wait... Now that Paimon remembers everything, should we instead say, "Good morning, Lesser Lord Kusanali"?
Nahida: ...
Paimon: Hey, what's wrong, Nahida? You don't look too good...
Traveler: ...Where is Dunyarzad?
Nahida: ...I'm afraid that what you're thinking right now is correct...
Paimon: Did Dunyarzad already disappear? No way! Are... Are we too late?
Nahida: The real Dunyarzad's consciousness has indeed disappeared. It can no longer endure the constant dream harvesting.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe it... Wait, so what about that other Dunyarzad? Just what is she? Is she also going to disappear?
Nahida: She's actually something like a puppet, but not completely.
Nahida: The real Dunyarzad's consciousness could no longer keep playing her role in this dream...
Nahida: So, another Dunyarzad appeared to replace her in the dream. Just like the grass and the trees, that Dunyarzad is just a building block of the dream that helps to keep it going.
Paimon: But personality-wise, she's nothing like the real Dunyarzad...
Nahida: Puppets are stiff and can't copy a living person's vitality. After all, they're just there as filler.
Nahida: You know, speaking of which... The old Dunyarzad might not have been too different from a puppet.
Paimon: Dunyarzad truly believed that she met you within her consciousness, and it was you who inspired her... So you do remember her after all!
Nahida: Yes. Back then, her family was overly protective of her. No one cared about her personality or thoughts. It was as if she only lived to stall her Eleazar.
Nahida: I just gave her a little wisdom so she could look at life in a new way... So that she could be her own person. But even so, she still...
Traveler: It still meant a lot to her.
Nahida: ...Far from it. I'm still a long way off from being a real archon.
Nahida: I couldn't even save her. If I were a competent archon, I wouldn't have let my most faithful follower die at the Sabzeruz Festival with so many regrets...
Paimon: Please don't beat yourself up over it, Nahida! It's the Sages' fault, and theirs alone!
Nahida: I... I'm not beating myself up. All I did was to rationally observe the distance between myself and a real archon.
Paimon: Don't be like that, Nahida. Even real archons are still allowed to be sad...
Nahida: ...
Nahida: To prevent more tragedies like this, we must end the samsara as soon as possible.
Paimon: Great! But how do we do that?
Nahida: Although this Sabzeruz Festival dream is under the Akasha's control, only humans can dream. Even the Akasha is unable to create them.
Nahida: That means this dream belongs to a host who created it.
Paimon: Huh... So how should we find that person?
Nahida: Well, if this is someone's dream, then everything here must come from deep within their consciousness ...
Nahida: ...Which means, with the power of imagination, they can change anything in this dream.
Paimon: Imagination? What do you mean by that?
Nahida: Imagination means breaking through what you perceive as normal.
Nahida: Like when a server at a tavern brings a plate to you, you'd naturally assume that food is on it.
Nahida: However, if you're the dream's host and you become aware that you're dreaming, when you imagine gold and Mora on the plate...
Nahida: ...The dream will respond in kind, and the server really will bring you gold and Mora.
Nahida: But right now, our host is unaware that this is a dream. No matter how many times they're served, it will always be food.
Traveler: So we find the host — then what?
Nahida: Find some way to make that person realize that they're dreaming. Usually, once that happens, the person will wake up and the dream's samsara will be broken.
Paimon: How are we going to find them, though? If it could be anyone, it'd be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
Paimon: And even if we did find them, how are we supposed to make them realize they're dreaming?
Paimon: After all, like you said... "Don't wake a sleepwalker."
Nahida: It's extremely difficult, yes. But the only ones who can do it are you two. Remember, everything you've achieved up to this point has all been for the sake of finding the host and ending the samsara.
Nahida: As for me... during this time, I'll be out of town.
Paimon: "Out of town"? Are you going to that place full of dreams where the Traveler went?
Nahida: Yes, I want to try something. There must still be a small wisp of possibility...
Nahida: Hurry and go. Dreams are supposed to be fantastical, romantic, and full of pleasant surprises. Unnecessary things like this samsara... need to end.
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon's still a little upset that we've come this far, only for Dunyarzad to...
Paimon: She was such a good person with such a simple wish, but fate was against her.
Traveler: I just feel so demoralized.
Paimon: Yeah... Saving Dunyarzad is what kept us going this whole time.
Paimon: But we mustn't lose hope, Traveler! Dunyarzad would definitely want to see us save everyone else. So let's break this samsara for her sake!
Paimon: Paimon's wondering... Do you think the sages would get one of their own to be the host of this dream? Feels like it would be easier to control it that way, no?
Traveler: Unlikely.
Traveler: Knowing the plan, they'd probably become aware that they were dreaming.
Paimon: Huh, that's true. Plus, the sages probably weren't counting on there being other factors beyond their control — like Nahida and us.
Paimon: So, who do you think the host of the dream is?
Traveler: Maybe Farris, the Knight of Flowers?
Paimon: Ooh! That would make sense! Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is a symbol of the whole Sabzeruz Festival, right? Pretty core character.
Paimon: Let's go ask him some questions, shall we?
Traveler: The one with the strange get-up?
Traveler: An unsuspecting host would be less likely to realize this is a dream.
Traveler: You are a kind archon.
Traveler: We were so close...
Traveler: She couldn't have...!?

## Talk 3

Vihar: Hm? You're back. You left in a hurry last time. Is everything okay?
Paimon: Everything's fine, just... Umm, it's a little hard to explain. Uh, would you mind taking part in a little experiment with us?
Vihar: An experiment? That came out of nowhere... I'm listening, though. What do you need me to do?
Paimon: Could you... make a wish?
Traveler: Imagine your wish coming true before your very eyes.
Vihar: You want me to make a wish? Is that a new Sabzeruz Festival tradition or something?
Paimon: Less questions, more wishing!
Vihar: Okay, okay...
Vihar: My wish, my wish... Um, okay, I'm a little nervous saying this out loud, but... I want Miss Dunyarzad to be happy.
Paimon: Oh...
Vihar: I noticed earlier that she looked a bit down, and she wasn't really talking to anyone.
Vihar: She just doesn't seem like herself. She's always so gentle and kind, and all the kids love her...
Vihar: I've also wondered if the reason she asked me to be Farris, Knight of Flowers is because I'm special to her, or something...
Paimon: So... you have a crush on Dunyarzad?
Vihar: Uh, heh... Haha... Is it that obvious? Hmm, after what I just said, I guess it is.
Vihar: When she placed the hat of the Knight of Flowers onto my head, she said to me, "I want everyone to have a happy Sabzeruz Festival."
Vihar: What she didn't realize was that I'm not that interested in how everyone else feels... In that moment, I just wanted to be her Knight of Flowers for the rest of my life. Fifty years, a hundred years... I'll serve her till the end of time.
Traveler: ...
Vihar: ...Okay, yeah, that was a bit much. Felt like the right moment to get it off my chest, but... ahem, that was pretty embarrassing.
Vihar: Okay, I'm ready to make my wish: I would like Miss Dunyarzad to appear in front of me right now, with a smile on her face... Here goes...
Paimon: Please come true...
Traveler: Please come true...
Vihar: I'm gonna open my eyes, ho-ho!
Vihar: Oh... You're...!
Paimon: What!?
Vihar: ...Phaki? Sorry, but only one portion of Yalda Candies per person. Back home you go.
Vihar: Hahaha... Nice try, you two. Anyway, never mind, I don't need to see her appear right in front of me. As long as she's happy, hahaha...
Paimon: *sigh* Guess he isn't the host of this dream after all. Should've expected it wouldn't be this easy.
Paimon: It seems like everyone who knows Dunyarzad loves her, but none of them has any idea that she...
Dehya: My lady, step back!
Paimon: That sounds like Dehya! Oh, right, this is when Dunyarzad bumps into the kidnappers.
Traveler: I'll teach them a lesson they won't forget.
Paimon: Huh? But Dehya can handle them... Hey, Traveler!

## Talk 4

Dehya: ...Oh? It's you. Great timing! Please take—
Traveler: Take Dunyarzad and leave.
Dehya: Hey, this is my job. The Homayanis pay me, not you.
Traveler: You're wasting your breath.
Dehya: You... Ugh, alright fine, knock yourself out. Why are you so worked up anyway? It's not like I don't trust your fighting skills...
Dehya: ...Anyway, watch yourself.
Badis: So you got yourself some back-up? Hmph, suit yourself! You're goin' down!
Traveler: Leave.
Traveler: Leave these guys to me.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Traveler... Were you just taking your anger out on those guys?
Traveler: I'm fine...
Paimon: *sigh* You and Nahida both... Dunyarzad wouldn't want to see you two like this.
Paimon: Oh, and speaking of her... Paimon just remembered something.
Paimon: Remember how during the first Sabzeruz Festival, before the samsara started, we came here with Dunyarzad because she wanted to pick something up?
Paimon: She said it was because she had forgotten something.
Traveler: Yes, I do remember that.
Paimon: Okay, so Paimon's memory is working so far... Anyway, Paimon also remembers that she's staying somewhere around here. She pointed it out to us the night before the Sabzeruz Festival.
Traveler: Should we check out what the item is?
Paimon: Yeah, even if it's only a tiny clue, it'll probably still help us more than this needle-in-a-haystack search...
Paimon: This is the place. It's rude to enter other people's spaces without permission, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
Paimon: Hey, the windows are unlocked. Okay, Paimon's gonna take a peek inside.
Black Screen Text: Paimon enters the room and returns a while later, carrying something...
Paimon: This was only a temporary residence, so there was pretty much nothing inside except this book on the table.
Paimon: Should we open it?
Paimon: Wow... Dunyarzad wrote all of this. Sounds like she was always thinking of us, even while we were away...
Paimon: Even though she was also busy preparing for the Sabzeruz Festival, and had all her health problems to worry about...
Paimon: She must have wanted to give this to us as a gift on the day of the Sabzeruz Festival, right?
Paimon: If we hadn't found this book, we never would have known...
Paimon: But now that we know, we can't even thank her...
Traveler: Dunyarzad...
Paimon: Hey, where are you off to now?
Traveler: Maybe it'll give us some clues.
Traveler: Ah yes. I'd forgotten all about that.
Traveler: I'm just angry at myself.

## Talk 6

Setaria: If you continue to resist, we will have to order an investigation into every single event organizer...
Setaria: The Grand Sage has already granted you much leniency. I advise that you exercise tact.
Nilou: How... How did things turn out like this...
Nilou: Ahh... Traveler? You don't have to get involved. He's a sage from the Akademiya. I don't want to drag you into this...
Azar: ...Traveler?
Paimon: Traveler, what the heck are you doing!? If you get arrested by the Akademiya, that's another day gone to waste!
Azar: ...
Setaria: ...
Paimon: Wait... They're not reacting! Have they been scared stiff...?
Traveler: Just like I thought...
Paimon: Oh, of course! If this is the sages' plan, they wouldn't put themselves through this...
Paimon: So they're just substitutes.
Nilou: What is this? What happened to the Grand Sage and his entourage?
Traveler: Hold on a moment...
Nilou: Hehe, like I said, they symbolize the Goddess of Flowers, after all. It's just a shame that all the real Padisarahs went extinct after her death.
Dunyarzad: Yes. The Greater Lord brought forth new Padisarahs in memory of the Goddess of Flowers, but she ultimately could never truly replicate that beautiful shade of purple.
Nilou: Ahh, "that beautiful shade of purple"... Aren't these flowers real Padisarahs, just like the ones from the legend? I didn't even notice! Dunyarzad, did you find these?
Paimon: But didn't you just say all the real flowers went extinct after the Goddess of Flowers passed away? So how...
Nilou: Yeah. What's going on here...?
Traveler: Nilou, close your eyes.
Nilou: Huh?
Traveler: Imagine that the Grand Sage and his entourage are not here in front of you.
Nilou: You guys are acting weird... But okay, I'll try.
Nilou: Mmm...
Nilou: Hey~
Paimon: Th—They disappeared! So Nilou's the host. What a surprise!
Paimon: Purple Padisarahs don't exist in the real world anymore, but in Nilou's subconscious, they can appear as decorations on the stage.
Paimon: It's just like the example Nahida told us. People assume there will be food on a plate, and Nilou assumed there would be real Padisarahs in the flower pots.
Paimon: So when you saw the flowers, you instantly knew it was Nilou?
Traveler: Correct.
Paimon: But if we want to end the samsara, we need the host to become aware that they're dreaming.
Paimon: How should we make Nilou realize that...
Nilou: Am I dreaming?
Paimon: Huh!?
Traveler: How did you come to that conclusion?
Nilou: Hehe, so I'm right? Is this Lesser Lord Kusanali responding to our celebration of the Sabzeruz Festival?
Paimon: Wrong guess, but you aren't completely wrong, either... The point is, what made you think this is a dream?
Paimon: As far as you know, people in Sumeru don't dream, right?
Nilou: Yeah, but have you heard the tale of the First Sage? To prevent a calamity, he went on a journey to find the Dendro Archon.
Paimon: Ooh, sounds familiar! Dunyarzad told us a story like that when we first arrived in Sumeru City. So it was about the First Sage, huh?
Nilou: Yep, but in the part you heard, he hadn't become the First Sage yet. There's more to the story...
Nilou: His piety and wisdom were acknowledged by the Dendro Archon, and she finally gave her blessing to him.
Nilou: All kinds of spectacular scenes appeared in front of the First Sage, as if all the knowledge in the world was being painted onto a canvas right before him. He was captivated.
Nilou: After who knows how long, he mastered all the knowledge he could comprehend.
Nilou: Afterward, he said to the Dendro Archon, "I miss my parents, my wife, and my children. I've been away from home for far too long. They must be worried."
Nilou: The Dendro Archon smiled. The next second, the sage found himself lying in his bed, as if he had just woken up from a dream.
Nilou: His wife, lying next to him, said: "You're off to search for the Dendro Archon today, aren't you? Have a safe journey, my love."
Nilou: In the end, the First Sage took care of many disasters in Sumeru City and founded the Akademiya. What a happy ending!
Paimon: So... The First Sage was dreaming ever since the beginning of the story? He never went on his journey?
Nilou: Yes, but his faith and determination were conveyed to the Dendro Archon, so she blessed him in the form of a dream.
Paimon: Paimon understands where you're coming from now. That's a really interesting connection... But we really gotta wake up soon, like the sage in the story.
Traveler: Now that Nilou is aware of it...
Nilou: I see. Well, it just so happens that today's Sabzeruz Festival is almost over, too.
Nilou: Since we're in a dream, let's make this final Dance of Sabzeruz as beautiful as we can!
Traveler: I've been waiting a long time for this.
Traveler: Please dance your heart out.
Traveler: This dream should be over soon.
Traveler: What's up with those flowers!?
Traveler: They're puppets.

## Talk 7

Katheryne (Katheryne?): Well done, Traveler and Paimon.
Katheryne (Katheryne?): And... Thank you, Dunyarzad, for organizing the Sabzeruz Festival for me.
Dunyarzad: I'm sorry, who are—
Paimon: Dunyarzad! *sniff* *sniff* You're okay! Oh, don't scare us like that...
Traveler: Dunyarzad...
Dunyarzad: Oh! Traveler, Paimon! I have something amazing to tell you!
Dunyarzad: I just had a dream... and I saw Nilou performing the Dance of Sabzeruz!

## Talk 8

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 9

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

## Talk 10

Paimon: *yawn* Good morning, Traveler. Paimon feels like she's been asleep for the longest time...
Traveler: Good morning, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Paimon's head feels super heavy. Did we oversleep? ...Do you even remember going to sleep last night?
Paimon: Paimon thinks it was... after the Sabzeruz Festival...
Paimon: *gasp* The Sabzeruz Festival!
Paimon: Have we finally escaped from the Sabzeruz samsara?
Traveler: I remember now!
Paimon: Quick, take off your Akasha Terminal!
Traveler: At the end of the Dance of Sabzeruz, I think I saw...
Paimon: She's not in her room. What happened?
Traveler: Let's go to the usual spot!
Paimon: Huh? What usual spot?
Traveler: Quick, let's go see Dunyarzad!
Traveler: My head hurts.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: It's Dunyarzad's puppet...
Traveler: (I guess...)
Traveler: Thank you.
Paimon: Traveler...
Paimon: You must be exhausted.
Paimon: Come to think of it, we've been stuck in this place for a really, really long time. Heck, even the last time we were chatting happily with Dunyarzad feels like an eternity ago...
Paimon: Paimon still remembers when we were sitting here, and the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz...
Traveler: ...I can barely recall it now.
Dunyarzad: ...There will always be frustrations in life, but I know that the point of living is to not leave behind any regrets.
Traveler: !?
Paimon: That was what the real Dunyarzad said, wasn't it? Does that mean...!?
Traveler: Dunyarzad...?
Dunyarzad: Yes, Traveler? What is it?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Oh... So she's still just a puppet. But just now... How come...
Traveler: Not leave behind any regrets...
Paimon: What? Where are we going this time?
Traveler: To watch the Dance of Sabzeruz.
Traveler: Let's go, Paimon.
Traveler: (I'll feel better if I say this out loud...)
