Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine.
Grosley: You may ride the lift at the side to the Court, and there you shall see the Palais Mermonia, the beating heart of Fontaine.
Grosley: If you've ridden one of our aquabuses, I'm sure you've heard a Melusine tour guide introduce Fontaine, yes?
Grosley: Well, now you'll get to experience it for yourself.
