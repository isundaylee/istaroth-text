Traveler: Are delivery timetables too tight?
Yougui: But we don't really have a say in this, and neither do our customers.
Yougui: Accidents on the job are very common, and we're often delayed by all kinds of things...
Yougui: Sometimes we're several days late, and if we were delivering precious ingredients, they'd be spoiled by then.
Yougui: We don't like to see it happen either, so we can only deliver as quickly as possible.
Yougui: But can you pin the blame on our fellow guards?
Yougui: No, you can't! Some jobs require traveling very long distances, across places that may not be safe.
