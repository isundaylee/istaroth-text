Wagner: Magical Crystal Chunks are very hard to mine, however... Hmm, how about this â€” I'll mark all the positions I know of on your map.
Wagner: If you can't find any Magical Crystal Chunks, Crystal Chunks should make a good compromise.
Wagner: Alright then, I've marked your map for you. If you need any ores, go mine them yourself. If you forget their positions, you can come and ask me again.
Wagner: That said, you'll probably learn them by heart after you go mining a few times.
