Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The sky is mighty indeed, to be able to accept all things, yet remain so majestic. I wish that one day, I could be as the sky.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Hah, the cusp of midsummer's night is as a fleeting dream. If only things could stay this way...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): But summer is brief, Traveler. Joyous times, the morning of youth, the past spent with one's friends, playing and chasing, they all shall pass in the blink of an eye...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): ...Shall you remember this summer, Traveler?
Traveler: Perhaps.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Haha, I hope you will, and that you will be gladdened whenever you do.
Traveler: I certainly will.
