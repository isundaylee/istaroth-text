Tribal Announcement: "The Children of Echoes has 19 mining teams, of which 12 have fixed tasks within the tribe. 7 teams are available to be hired for mining or excavation tasks outside the tribe..."
Tribal Announcement: "If you are interested in hiring a mining team, please prepare all the necessary documents before discussing the matter with Chief Pacal."
Tribal Announcement: "We don't really like handling documents, and aren't too fussed with the details of various commercial terms. We trust that you aren't going to be too petty, play dirty, or try to take advantage of us."
Tribal Announcement: "Otherwise, we'll see you at Chasca's mediation table. Deals that end in discord are no good for anyone!"
