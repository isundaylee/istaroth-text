Munaciello: Hello. I'm Munaciello the "Porter." Do you know the rules?

## Talk

Traveler: What rules?
Munaciello: Hehe, fresh fish, I see.
Munaciello: Don't worry, Munaciello the "Porter" never cheats his customers.
Munaciello: You have questions, I've got answers. We'll exchange what you know for what I know — in equivalent amounts, of course.
Munaciello: That's how Munaciello the "Porter" rolls.

## Talk

Traveler: A "porter"?
Munaciello: I transport information from one place to another, just like how sailors carry goods.
Munaciello: Information's like futures — no capital, no profit.
Munaciello: And trust me, I've got capital to spare — Munaciello the "Porter" won't run low on cargo to transport, believe you me.

Traveler: Y—Yeah, I'm good.
Munaciello: You can come back to me once you're done considering — if you live that long.
