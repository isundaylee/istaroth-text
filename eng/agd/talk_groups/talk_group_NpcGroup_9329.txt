Hu Tao: We're not in any hurry to get going, are we? Let's chill here for a bit.
Hu Tao: "When the cat's away, the mice will play." And so they should — 'cause it's only a matter of time before the cat gets back and gobbles all the mice up.
Hu Tao: So like I said — no need to hurry. The mice will be there for us when we're ready.

Hu Tao: The look on your face tells me you're ready to head deeper into the domain. Next stop, the belly of the beast, huh?
Hu Tao: Never fear, for Director Hu Tao is here, ready to face whatever comes at us, from the ordinary, to the abnormal, to the paranormal!
Hu Tao: So, without further ado — shall we? Let's not keep the monsters waiting.

Hu Tao: Once I was old enough, I started reading popular novels. Some of them would end by having the dead come back to life and living happily ever after.
Hu Tao: Tut-tut-tut... I know it's only make-believe, but still, it always ruined the story for me. If death isn't final, there are no stakes, so it kinda makes everything that happened up to that point meaningless.
Hu Tao: "To everything there is a season: Live in life, and die in death." That is the truth. You can't have a satisfactory ending if death isn't final.
