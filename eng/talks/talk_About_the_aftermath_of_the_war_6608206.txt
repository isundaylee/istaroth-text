Traveler: About the aftermath of the war...
Avilix: Oh! Thank you for your concern. The tribes have already recovered their previous vigor, and tales of our heroes are recounted with great pride.
Avilix: You may find that we're missing a few familiar faces, but there's no need to show sadness.
Avilix: They fought for the glory of Natlan. Victory is the greatest comfort we can give them.
