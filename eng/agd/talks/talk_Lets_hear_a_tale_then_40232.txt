Traveler: Let's hear a tale then.
Stanley: Haha, so you'd like to hear some more? Well then, then I'll make this an occasion, and tell you the real version.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...the monster created a vortex in the Ashen Sea, and I would have been sucked into it, if Stanley had not held tightly onto my hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Hey. Hey! Are you falling asleep? Wake up!
