Traveler: Will the heir to your family come?
Lixin: About that... I am not entirely sure! I've been working here at Feiyun Commerce Guild for some time now, yet I still haven't laid eyes on Master Xingqiu!
Lixin: I heard that the old grounds of the Guhua Clan are somewhere in Chenyu Vale. Perhaps someday Master Xingqiu will come and visit, should the mood strike him!
Lixin: I've heard that Master Xingqiu is experienced beyond his years and his knowledge is vast. Perhaps after coming to Chenyu Vale, he'll have a stroke of genius or three and give us some great new ideas!
