Traveler: Sell?
Tuman: Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a bit in the city.
Tuman: Seems like the Akademiya's always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind a nobody like me making a little money, right?
Tuman: Anyway, my plan to resell â€” I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect, but there's just one problem, The Withering.
Tuman: *sigh* How strong must my desire to sell mushrooms be in order to get a Vision?
Tuman: Dealing with The Withering will be a piece of cake once I have a Vision.
