Joliot: Oh Archons, please grant us a healthy and wise child!
Irimia: Hmm... Well, I wouldn't ask for intelligence or talent, but please, may our child live a peaceful life!
Joliot: Uh, honey, is it just me, or did you ask for more than I did, somehow?
Irimia: Shh, you'll jinx it! Also, what's so excessive about asking that our child grow up well?
Joliot: That's not what I'm saying, it's just, in light of that "prophecy"...
Irimia: Ah, right. That's true...
Irimia: But it's just a legend, and not something that will happen for sure, right?
