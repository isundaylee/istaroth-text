Traveler: Have you found that letter?
Yue Chuan: Um, not yet. At the moment, all I've found are these crabs.
Yue Chuan: Darn them, their pincers are plenty painful! And they'll pop right back up after a while even if you throw them to the shore.
Yue Chuan: I'm in a bind as to how to take care of them, so why don't you take them? Mind you don't get pinched, though.

Yue Chuan: Do you need something? I'm a little busy...

Traveler: What are you up to?
Yue Chuan: Can you not see that I'm looking for something?
Yue Chuan: By the way... I wonder if you've seen a girl I know?
Yue Chuan: She sometimes comes here for a stroll, always dressed beautifully â€” you can tell just by looking that she's from a well-to-do family.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it...
Yue Chuan: Bye-bye!
Yue Chuan: Ooh... What's that? It's so shiny...

## Talk

Traveler: I've never seen her.
Yue Chuan: Oh... Well, she's my good friend. I haven't seen her recently, though, because she hasn't come here in a long time.
Yue Chuan: I figure that she must miss me a lot, so she'll have definitely left a gift for me on the beach.

## Talk

Traveler: How can you be so sure?
Yue Chuan: How could I be wrong!?
Yue Chuan: I know I'm poor but honestly, me and her are soulmates! We have a connection!
Yue Chuan: I come here to the seaside every single day to see whether she has left a message or a gift for me. My efforts will not be in vain!
