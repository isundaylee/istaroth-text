# To Make a Cat Carving


## Talk 1

Ooshima Junpei: Huh, how did I run out of wood...
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, hey there, Traveler! You're just the person I was hoping to see. Do you mind doing me a favor?
Traveler: What's that?
Ooshima Junpei: I've been trying to make smaller-scale wood carvings of our provisional head priestess.
Ooshima Junpei: I've been thinking to bring a batch of these to Narukami Island to see if they'll sell...
Ooshima Junpei: If they do, they would make for a source of consistent income for me.
Traveler: Oh, I think they'll sell alright.
Ooshima Junpei: Hahaha. Thanks for your well-wishes.
Ooshima Junpei: That said, I think I've got faith in our Lady Neko's charisma.
Ooshima Junpei: Well, never mind that for now. Let's talk about the matter at hand...
Ooshima Junpei: So, the issue is that I'm running out of the wood I was using to practice.
Ooshima Junpei: Could you help me collect 10 blocks of Otogi Wood, Traveler?
Traveler: Sure.
Ooshima Junpei: I'll leave it to you, then. You're a really great help.
Ooshima Junpei: Bring those Otogi Wood blocks to me once you're done.
Traveler: Do you really need that many?
Ooshima Junpei: Well, I've only just started practicing, so it's best to be on the safe side and prepare more material.
Ooshima Junpei: Well, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: What's with the wood carvings all of a sudden?
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, well... Do you know what my payment from our head priestess has been so far?
Ooshima Junpei: They're generally these... bottles, cups, plates, and things like that.
Ooshima Junpei: They do look a bit old, but when I went to have them appraised, we found out that these things are in fact a bit "ancient"... and valuable, too.
Ooshima Junpei: But to tell the truth, it was pretty troublesome and tiring getting them sold every time.
Ooshima Junpei: Also, this really doesn't make for a particularly stable income... If the head priestess were to run out of these things one day, wouldn't that basically put me out of a job?
Ooshima Junpei: As such, I've decided to pursue a new business venture.
Traveler: What are you doing?

## Talk 2

Ooshima Junpei: Have you found those 10 blocks of Otogi Wood?

## Talk 3

Ooshima Junpei: Hmm, yes, these will do, I think. Sorry for asking you to help after you came all this way to reach the shrine... Please take these.
Ooshima Junpei: Once I've gotten my wood-carving act together, I'll also send you my best work!
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm, what pose should I carve for the provisional head priestess in this time...
