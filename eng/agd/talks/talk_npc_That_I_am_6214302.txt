Traveler: That I am.
Baiwen: As we expected, your aims correspond to the intelligence we have on hand.
Baiwen: If you are looking for Lady Ningguang, you have come to the right place. This the Jade Chamber, the foremost intelligence hub and the epicenter of all important decisions in Liyue.

Baiwen: I must reflect on the cause of this discrepancy. Was our source at fault, or did we make an error in our calculations?
