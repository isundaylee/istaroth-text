Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Jean: Perhaps you could join me for a walk?
Jean: I have taken what you said recently to heart and tried to make a few adjustments in my life.
Jean: Of course, I still push myself to complete my work when performing my official duties.
Jean: But when I'm with you, I'm now able to unwind.
Traveler: Sounds like you're making great progress.
Jean: This is all thanks to you...
Jean: This whole time, you have been a great companion to me. You are always so considerate of my circumstances.
Jean: It would be shameful if I didn't at least recognize this much.
Jean: So, thank you. Truly.
Traveler: You look beautiful when you smile.
Traveler: I should thank you, too.
Jean: ...
Jean: We... should walk while we talk.
Jean: I still have so much I want to say to you.
Traveler: I'm happy to hear that.
