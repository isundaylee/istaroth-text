Traveler: Hey boss lady.
Verr Goldet: Ugh... how many times do I have to tell you, it's not "boss lady."
Verr Goldet: I'm the boss here at Wangshu Inn.
Verr Goldet: Not boss lady. Just boss.
Traveler: I've heard the rumors...
Verr Goldet: Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
Verr Goldet: What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
Verr Goldet: All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
Verr Goldet: Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
Traveler: Whose is this kitty?
Verr Goldet: *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
Verr Goldet: Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
Verr Goldet: You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief â€” you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.
