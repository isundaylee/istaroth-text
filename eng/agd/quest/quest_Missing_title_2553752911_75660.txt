# Missing title (2553752911)

Xilonen: Phew... The weather sure is nice. This trip out was well worth it.
Xilonen: Hmm? Do my eyes deceive me, or do I spy our "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini"?
Traveler: What a coincidence, Xilonen.
Black Screen Text: You tell Xilonen about Irade and the exam stages...
Xilonen: Ah, I see... I almost forgot. I did lend her a hand earlier. In fact, our tribe's stage is nearby.
Xilonen: At first, she only got the "Calamity of Tetlahuitl," Nkunga, and the "Sand Dagger of Seit'aad," Amuru, to help her out.
Xilonen: But those two aren't big on "mobility," preferring head-on clashes, so the resulting feedback was skewed.
Xilonen: First thing Pacal did after hearing that was to ask me to give some suggestions.
Traveler: So the current stage is your work, then?
Xilonen: More or less. Pacal, Irade, and I made a few minor modifications after some discussion.
Xilonen: Now, the stages are more about getting yourself to advantageous ground quick and managing a shifting fulcrum in the heat of battle.
Traveler: Allow me to accept your trial, then!
Xilonen: Please, everyone in Natlan has witnessed your strength. I doubt there's a challenge out there that could trip you up.
Xilonen: Anyway, the stage is over there. Go try it out if you're interested.
Traveler: Let's hope you didn't make this too difficult...
Traveler: You... really make just about everything, don't you...
Xilonen: Eh, it's just a few simple devices. They weren't that hard to build.
Xilonen: A one-time effort on my part for a continuous pipeline of stronger warriors for our tribe? That's a good deal â€” especially since I can use that extra free time to work through my commission backlog...
Traveler: I took Irade's commission.
