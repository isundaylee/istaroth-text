Rafiq: If only we could find a way to increase the cabin capacity...
Qishan: Wouldn't that affect the ship's hull though?
Qishan: At least, simply changing the material wouldn't cut it.
Rafiq: But based on my calculations, if this cabin here could be opened up to the one next door...
Rafiq: But you said that wouldn't work, so maybe it really isn't possible...
Rafiq: Speaking of which, does everyone in Liyue know as much about ships as you do, Qishan?
Qishan: Ahem... Not necessarily.
Qishan: After all, we have people working in all sorts of industries in Liyue.
