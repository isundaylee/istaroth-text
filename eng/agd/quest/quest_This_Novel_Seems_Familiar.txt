# This Novel... Seems Familiar?


## Talk 1

Paimon: This one's called "The Sage Aetolia Will Die Tomorrow." A really impressive name. Long-winded, too...
Paimon: This one's "The Honest Cat's Little Lie"... Hmm, Paimon wonders what it's about?
Paimon: This one's name is "Literature Club." What a simple and short name...
Paimon: Paimon wonders which of these three novels Junkichi wants. Well, we might as well take them all to him.

## Talk 2

Junkichi: Traveler, could you get some novels for me? Shigeru and I need to have an important discussion.
Shigeru: Hmph. If I let him write however he pleases, he will ruin the novels for sure.

## Talk 3

Junkichi: Traveler, did you bring those novels? Let's have a look.

## Talk 4

Shigeru: I remember this one. This suspense novel was popular for a long time, wasn't it?
Shigeru: The reason for its success is because of the clever mysteries and plot structure.
Shigeru: Although many readers have said that part of the plot is impossible to follow, the author still stuck to their own principles.
Junkichi: That's why this novel stands out from other suspense novels.
Shigeru: But doesn't this novel also have a solid setting? A solid setting that isn't easily altered is the key to support the plot of this sort of suspense novel.
Junkichi: Uh... well... Traveler, do we have any other books here...

## Talk 5

Shigeru: I think this novel has the same fantasy background as "Onibudou"...
Junkichi: Yes. The setting in this novel is very popular. The author even wrote a book just about the details of the world, and that one sold like hotcakes!
Shigeru: However, the features of the setting are presented to the reader from the very beginning and more aren't added in halfway through. Plus, it's all relevant to the plot.
Junkichi: Uh... well... Traveler, do we have any other books here...

## Talk 6

Shigeru: How about this one, then? I remember its writing was excellent and its plot was well-designed. It was highly praised by the editors. Also, its sales were excellent.
Junkichi: ...Was it, though?
Junkichi: It was so caught up with the rigid plot and setting that it didn't have any room for expansion in the story. In the end, it just became repetitive.
Junkichi: It gradually lost readers because it lacked fresh stories. In the end, it lost all of its readers and fizzled out ignominiously.
Junkichi: Whether it's the setting or the plot, if you put yourself inside a box, all your stories will look the same. You'll stagnate.
Junkichi: I don't want my novel to be like that! The most important thing a story should have is life!
Junkichi: If... if the author himself is not interested in his own story, how can he make the reader feel that same passion?
Junkichi: Shigeru!
Shigeru: ...I see.
Shigeru: I didn't know that you thought so much about these things. No wonder you wrote a novel like "Onibudou."
Shigeru: I don't want to limit your creativity, but I've seen too many authors ruin their work because of their excessive imagination...
Shigeru: Junkichi, what do you think of creativity as a writer?
Junkichi: I believe that it's the desire to create. A writer who has no desire to create won't be able to write words that attract readers.
Shigeru: In my opinion, it's more important still for a writer to exercise restraint in expressing that creative desire.
Traveler: You two still can't reach a consensus...
Junkichi: Shigeru, I...
Shigeru: But I'm not the author of this novel. You are. I'm just an editor who needs to help you finish it.
Shigeru: If you insist on your ideas, then create them as you wish.
Shigeru: I can't say that I agree with you. But I will try to understand you.
Junkichi: Ah... thank you, Shigeru!
Shigeru: You're welcome. Of course, I get where you're coming from. But you need to understand my position, too. For example...
Junkichi: Uh, what is it?
Shigeru: For example, it's been another day, where is your manuscript!?
Traveler: I guess he is not convinced...
