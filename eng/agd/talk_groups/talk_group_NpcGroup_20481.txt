Date (???): Oh ho, are you here to try my latest, greatest work, too?
Paimon: What are you, Enkanomiya's celebrity chef?
Date: The name's Date. They used to call me Daedalus, son of Eurydates. I'm a labyrinth artisan! The puzzle you just went through is my work.
Paimon: Oh, so you're the guy who had fun stumping us, huh? Alright! Bye!
Date: Hey, wait, wait a moment! I'm not just some kid doodling on pieces of paper. I'm no mere labyrinth artisan either â€” I'm the second-best architect in the history of Byakuyakoku!
Paimon: And who's number one?
Date: Why, Aberaku no Mikoto, of course, bless his heart! If the Dainichi Mikoshi were to be second place, no other building could take first place.
Date: The fact that you've met me means that you've cleared my first "Neopathos"-style labyrinth.
Date: How did you find it? Any interest in trying my other "Heterodoxa"-style labyrinth? It's completely different from one made only from walls.
Traveler: No need. We've sampled your work enough as-is.
Date: Oh, come on now. This masterpiece was a result of abundant space, time, and funds!
Date: A significant portion of us have already gone to live on Watatsumi Island up there on the surface, so there's plenty of real estate around here.
Date: And that's why I borrowed "Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku." I meant to study the principles of load-bearing, the maximization of underground spaces, the avoidance of water leakage, and even some principles of geomancy!
Date: Well, and sorry, Ema, but I... might have left the book in the labyrinth's treasure vault...
Paimon: Sorry, what were you muttering about?
Date: Nothing! I mean to cordially invite you to challenge my grand masterpiece!
Date: Whatever the case may be, take this key. It can be used to open the puzzles.
Date: If you are successful, you can even obtain a medal of recognition that I made myself.
Paimon: That's not a very rare prize.
Date: I have also hidden my treasures in the vault ahead. If you obtain two medals, you can open the treasury!
Paimon: Oh... is that how it is? Well, we'll give it a try if we have time, then.
Date: Wonderful! I look forward to your feedback.
Date: Ah, yes! Since you've conquered the first labyrinth, here's your first medal.
Paimon: Oh, okay...
Date: So, any comments?
Paimon: How should we put it? It felt like...
Date: Felt like?
Paimon: It felt like it lacked a little boom-shaka-laka.
Date: Boom-shaka-laka? What's that?

Date: Did you clear the labyrinth over there as well? Good, very good. Very impressive.
Paimon: Oh, okay...
Date: What did you think of it?
Paimon: What we think? Well...
Date: Hehe, it was super intricate and super awesome, wasn't it?
Paimon: Heh... Hehe!
Date: What do you mean, "hehe"!?
Date: *cough* Regardless, since you now have both medals of recognition, the path to the secret chamber should now be open.
Date: Place the medals in there, and you should be able to open the treasury gate.

Date: So, have you challenged my Heterodoxa labyrinth yet?

Date: Honestly, these labyrinths are just a means, not the end. What I really wish to do is serve the people, like Aberaku did.
