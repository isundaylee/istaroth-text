## Talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, but I'm busy.
Chef Mao: Sure, go do what you have to. I'll get someone else...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Chef Mao: Thank you.
Chef Mao: Please be careful while you deliver the food, and *do not touch anything strange, or use your wind glider*.
Chef Mao: Otherwise, I fear that the Mora Meat might stop having any meat in it altogether...

## Talk 3

Curious Zi'rui: Why isn't the food here yet? It's been ages...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. A kid named Zi'rui ordered Mora Meat from us.
Chef Mao: He wanted us to deliver it to a place near Luhua Pool.
Chef Mao: Since I have my hands full manning the restaurant at the moment, could you help me with that delivery?
