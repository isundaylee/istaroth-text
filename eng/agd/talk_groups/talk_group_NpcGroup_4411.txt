Ayten: Dehya's so awesome when she swings her huge sword around like that â€” "whoosh"!
Ayten: If I could do such things, I'd go to the city, make Mora, and eat all the stuff I want!
Karima: Huh? Do you wanna leave this place, Ayten?
Ayten: Yeah! All the older kids are leaving one by one, so life out there has got to be better, right?
Karima: Umm...
Karima: But I'd rather become someone like Candace...
Karima: She's beautiful and strong, and she's gonna protect us forever!
Ayten: Well, that doesn't sound too bad either.
Ayten: Well, how about this, then? I'll move to the city and earn loads of Mora... and that'll give you the Mora to stay here and protect the village!
