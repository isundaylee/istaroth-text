Traveler: A habit you picked up at work?
Sedile: Yeah. I'm Sedile, an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom. My usual work involves site inspection and information collection â€” all to ensure the safety of Fontaine's citizens.
Sedile: So, well... Heh. When I see people I haven't seen before, I get a little nervous. Sorry about that.
