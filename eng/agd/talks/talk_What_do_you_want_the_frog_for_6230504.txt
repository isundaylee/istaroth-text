Traveler: What do you want the frog for?
Little Zuo: I wanna give him to my little sister to play with.
Little Zuo: My sister is that girl over there, the one who is always trying to catch her shadow... even though you can't catch your shadow. I don't get why she likes to do that...
Little Zuo: Maybe she just feels bored. At least if I catch her a frog, chasing him will be more fun than chasing her shadow.
Traveler: Why don't you play with her?
Little Zuo: I think she doesn't like me very much. She doesn't wanna listen to anything I say, let alone play with me.
Little Zuo: I don't get it, I'm always trying my bestest to find her things she wants, so why won't she be happy with me?
