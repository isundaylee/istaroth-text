# When the Curtains Close


## Talk 1

Kaveh: Twenty years ago, the Akademiya had just received Sachin's estate. To celebrate the huge investment, the Akademiya Extravaganza that year was grander than usual.
Kaveh: I was very young then, and I remember seeing posters for the Interdarshan Championship all over the city. I couldn't help but mention it to my father. I even told him that I really liked the look of the diadem — it was so unique.
Kaveh: So he said, "Why don't I win it, so I can let you play with it for a few days?"
Kaveh: That made me very happy, and I nodded enthusiastically. But to my surprise, he didn't win, and when he got back home, he seemed extremely depressed.
Kaveh: Later, he left home, saying that he wanted to do some investigating in the desert... The quicksand got him not long after that...
Kaveh: ...For many years, I couldn't face up to it at all. If I'd just kept my mouth shut, maybe none of it would have ever happened.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Your father may have seen Sachin that year.
Paimon: Wait... So the person we came across in our investigation, who went into the desert twenty years ago... it was...
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: ...Haha... Is that why Sachin thought I looked familiar? I can't believe it...
Kaveh: ...My father was always too kind for his own good. Sachin's research would have saddened him greatly — he must have gone into the desert when he heard about it to find those who were still suffering... It all makes sense now.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: I've tried telling myself so many times over the years that maybe his sudden depression wasn't because he didn't win the competition, maybe something else was going on that I wasn't aware of... But in the end, it all started with me mentioning the competition to him.
Paimon: Aw, Kaveh...
Kaveh: Don't worry. I... I destroyed the diadem. There will never be another tragedy like this again. Never again...

## Talk 3

Traveler: (Don't mention the results of the investigation.)
Kaveh: Sorry... My mind was still on the Championship. Look at me, rambling away.
Paimon: You look really upset... Are you sure you're okay?
Kaveh: I'm fine. What's past is past — we need to look towards the future.

## Talk 4

Kaveh: Where were you while the rest of us were eating together?
Alhaitham: I don't recall being obligated to report my whereabouts to you.
Kaveh: Did you go find another hidey-hole to read in? You need to change your ways, you know. You can't survive on books alone.
Alhaitham: Surviving on meals paid for by you would be harder still.
Kaveh: You...!
Kaveh: Hmph, whatever, it doesn't take a genius to guess what you've been up to... You were investigating Sachin, weren't you? It was obvious from your notes. However, I don't believe his research alone would've been enough to pique your interest.
Kaveh: His way of doing things is disturbing, while you... Well, to be fair, your philosophy disgusts me too, but you and Sachin are nothing alike. I don't imagine your views intersect at all. Egoism and nihilism are not the same thing.
Alhaitham: My personal interest aside, Sachin's legacy is not entirely meaningless — he conducted experiments on a great scale, and left his findings behind.
Alhaitham: Also, thanks for the compliment. But I'm actually just passing through — I didn't come here for the conversation. Well, not this one at least.
Kaveh: What do you mean? What topic of conversation could be more sacred among scholars than the exploration of differing philosophies?
Alhaitham: Well, based on what I've learned, Sachin and his "disturbing way of doing things" — as you put it — is very likely to have met your father twenty years ago.
Kaveh: ...What did you say?
Kaveh: ...Wait, so... No, surely that doesn't mean...
Kaveh: Hah. So that's why he thought I looked familiar. My father must've gone into the desert due to his influence...
Alhaitham: I'm afraid so.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: Good thing I shattered that diadem. From now on... nothing like that will ever have to happen again.
Alhaitham: The boundaries of knowledge are ever-expanding. Someone else will inevitably pick up the same line of research one day, and Vahumana regards it as a reasonable research direction.
Kaveh: Oh, not this again... Even if you're right, and people are bound to fall into the same intellectual traps, things won't necessarily go the same way again next time.
Kaveh: You have to admit that the actions of one individual don't always predict the behavior of the group, and vice-versa. Take Sachin, for instance. He's quite an anomaly.
Alhaitham: And so is the one who stopped him — you. Conflicts of this nature are indeed exceptional, but it will occur again in the future.
Alhaitham: You said it yourself — the actions of one individual cannot predict the behavior of a whole group. You know that not everyone would have chosen as you did.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: ...Even so, I stand by my views. You can forget about trying to convince me.
Alhaitham: That's fine. We've been arguing over this for years, and I don't hold any hope of you understanding. The issue we're debating has long since moved on from who's right and who's wrong.
Kaveh: ...Thanks for letting me know all this.
Alhaitham: What?
Kaveh: I said, thanks for letting me know. Hey! Stop acting like you didn't hear me! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!?
Alhaitham: They say that earnest thanks should be given thrice, so... One more time, please.
