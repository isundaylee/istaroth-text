Xi'er: Li cuisine?
Xi'er: Yep, one of the two big culinary traditions in Liyue!
Xi'er: Li-style cooking is all about rich, indulgent dishes packed with flavor. It uses a lot of ingredients from up in the mountains.
Xi'er: The place you should go to try it is Liuli Pavilion in Liyue Harbor. They have the best Li-trained chef working for them.
