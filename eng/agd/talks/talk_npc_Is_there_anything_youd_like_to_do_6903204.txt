Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Bennett: For us adventurers, what we want to do is adventure, naturally!
Bennett: To get the treasure at the end of the journey, or to take the first steps into the unknown...
Bennett: No, wait... What I want to say is that I want to become your helping hand!
Bennett: Look, I might not have any physical talents, but I don't fear pain and can adapt to long battles!
Bennett: I get injured a lot from accidents, so I'm really skilled at bandaging wounds!
Traveler: I'm aware of all this...
Bennett: Right... We've been traveling together for a while, haven't we...
Bennett: ...I've actually thought about this many times.
Bennett: Of course, I'll keep to my mission, but I've got other personal interests outside of that, too.
Bennett: I want to become someone you can trust and depend on.
Bennett: A companion through thick and thin, good times and bad...
Bennett: This time, I want to become your strength!
Traveler: You've always been an important companion of mine.
Bennett: Thâ€”Thank you...
Bennett: Oh... what's wrong with me? This is supposed to be a happy occasion.
Bennett: Thank you...
Traveler: I'll share some of my good luck with you.
Traveler: Why do you want to be my helping hand?
Bennett: Well... that's because you're the adventurer I admire the most!
