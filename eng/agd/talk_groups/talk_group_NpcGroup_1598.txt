Traveler: Having fun on the beach?
Will: Yep! The scenery is soooo different from Mondstadt.
Will: I even caught a fish! Fish skin is slippery, so they're super hard to catch... Well, harder than catching crabs anyway. That's what Jill does.
Will: But anyway, I don't have a bowl to put this fish in. So why don't you take it?

Will: D'you think he's one of those, y'know... bad men who... who... make little kids... learn to read and write, and give them too much homework?
Will: We were gonna go and play with Ms. Edith at Windrise, but now we're stuck here hiding...
