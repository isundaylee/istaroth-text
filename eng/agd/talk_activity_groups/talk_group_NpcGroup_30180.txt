## Talk

Kuronushi's Likeness: (Albedo's portrait of Kuronushi. There is no sign of any personage here. Only a backdrop adorns this image.)

Kuronushi's Likeness: (He used a special ink here to depict "Kunikuzushi," a secret that was only revealed when the canvas' surface touched water.)
Kuronushi's Likeness: (The way Ayato puts it, it seems that the person who tried to furtively search for the secret was a Fatui spy. But "who" would want to hide Kunikuzushi's past?)
Kuronushi's Likeness: (And what effect might this secret have on your own destiny?)
