# The Firework Girl's Strange Stories


## Talk 1

Matsuzaka: We're looking for the Great Mujina Youkai!
Saika: Do you know where it lives?
Paimon: "Great Mujina Youkai"? What's that?
Matsuzaka: Huh? You've never heard of it?
Matsuzaka: It's a sneaky monster that goes 'round playing tricks on people! It's got magic powers and can even shapeshift into anything it wants!
Iwao: One time, the Great Mujina Youkai stole some rice from our house. And this other time, it pushed my dad into the river.
Paimon: Sounds like a very naughty little monster!
Traveler: Why are you out looking for it?
Saika: 'Cause, we've finally found out how to chase it away!
Iwao: My dad said that the Great Mujina Youkai likes to play tricks on people who stay out all the time and don't come home when they're supposed to.
Iwao: So all we need to do is chase it away, then we can come out and play whenever we want!
Paimon: This monster sounds scary, though... Aren't you guys afraid?
Paimon: Surely your parents must be worried about you?
Iwao: Not really. I told my dad that I was going to find the Great Mujina Youkai with some friends, and he didn't even say anything.
Matsuzaka: So, we think it must be weak right now! It's probably hiding away so it can rest!
Saika: Yeah! So as long as we get home before it gets its strength back, we'll be safe.
Paimon: Hmm, something sounds very strange about all of this... But Paimon can't say exactly what it is...
Traveler: If a monster's coming for you, surely you won't be safe at home.
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon feels like the Great Mujina Youkai is one of those storybook monsters that doesn't exist in the real world.
Traveler: I think so too.
Paimon: We should tell them, so they don't waste all their time looking for it.
Paimon: Oh, children, listen up! There's no need to go looking for the Great Mujina Youkai, alright? Because it isn't real.
Matsuzaka: Huh!?
Saika: No way...
Iwao: That's impossible. My dad wouldn't lie to me!
Paimon: Your folks are just worried about you, is all. They don't want you wandering too far from home, because it's too dangerous.
Iwao: That's not true! The Great Mujina Youkai is definitely real!
Matsuzaka: Yeah! Yoimiya's even making some weapons for us! And then, she's gonna show us how to blow it up!
Paimon: Yoimiya, huh? Wait, as in... fireworks-prison-break Yoimiya?
Saika: We told her all about the Great Mujina Youkai. She said we shouldn't be scared of it — we should learn how to chase it away instead.
Matsuzaka: We've been waiting for ages now, and finally, Yoimiya said that today's the day!
Iwao: Uh-huh, uh-huh! Yoimiya plays with us and tells us stories all the time. She wouldn't tell a lie!
Paimon: But, but...
Iwao: Hmph! C'mon, let's get outta here and go find Yoimiya!
Paimon: Wait, hold on! Don't go!
Paimon: Huh, they didn't seem to take that very well... But Paimon was only trying to look out for them...
Paimon: Who knows what Yoimiya's got to do with this. Let's follow the kids and see what's going on.
Traveler: Guess the parents just don't want their kids staying out all the time.
Traveler: We've never seen a monster like this before.
Traveler: The dad's attitude doesn't quite add up...

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: #Cheer up guys, don't be so down. {F#She}{M#He} was only joking back there. How could the Great Mujina Youkai not exist, huh?
Matsuzaka: B—But, we've never seen it for ourselves...
Yoimiya: That's because the Great Mujina Youkai is extra powerful! And that's exactly why I need your help, isn't it?
Matsuzaka: Ummmm...
Yoimiya: It's okay, don't be discouraged. Hey, remember, if you wanna be a hero, you gotta have patience — and wisdom, too.
Yoimiya: Even if you can't find it right now, it'll definitely show up before the fireworks show starts. So remember to come and pick up your weapons from me before then, okay?
Yoimiya: No matter how powerful the Great Mujina Youkai might be, it's no match for my specially made fireworks! Just light 'em up and you'll scare it off, no problem.
Yoimiya: It's up to you guys to protect your homes, your crops, and your folks!
Matsuzaka: Got it! Thanks, Miss Yoimiya, we'll try and be more patient!
Yoimiya: Oh yeah, hold up a sec. I have a few slips of paper for you guys — one each. Remember to give it to your parents and tell them to keep it safe.
Yoimiya: Just tell them it's from Yoimiya. They'll know what it's about.
Iwao: Okay! Thank you, Yoimiya! We're gonna go back now.
Saika: Thanks, Yoimiya! Come play with us soon!
Yoimiya: Sure thing, will do! Take care on the way back, and I'll see you later!
Paimon: Uhh... so...
Traveler: It's been a while.
Yoimiya: Ah, so it WAS you guys. I guessed as much from the way the kids described you. No worries, though, I'm not blaming you.
Yoimiya: The Great Mujina Youkai is pretty popular with the kids, so of course they're gonna get upset if someone tries to tell them it doesn't exist.
Paimon: Okay... but it definitely doesn't exist... right?
Yoimiya: Yeah, the first time I heard about it, I knew straight away that it was probably something the parents had come up with to stop the kids from running off all the time.
Yoimiya: But when the kids asked me about it, I didn't wanna break it to them. I just told them that it looks cute, likes to play pranks, and doesn't hurt people.
Yoimiya: So I guess now, the kids' impression of the Great Mujina Youkai is mostly influenced by me.
Paimon: Huh... So in a way, this monster is all a product of your creativity...
Traveler: Surely it's a bad idea to keep the lie going like that?
Yoimiya: Maybe so. In any case, I'm not gonna be the one who exposes it.
Yoimiya: Sure, it's likely that the parents just wanted to stop the kids from staying out all the time. But they could have easily had other reasons, too.
Yoimiya: If I just go ahead and tell them that the Great Mujina Youkai doesn't exist without knowing the full story, then who knows — I may be doing more harm than good.
Yoimiya: Besides, they're just kids. They should be allowed to believe it if it makes them happy. That's more important to them than questioning what's real and what isn't.
Yoimiya: Heck, I entertain my fair share of fantasies too... The Fire Diamond that spins around and shoots out lights that are all the colors of the rainbow... Ooh — the Mist Spirits that live far off in the mountains and guide you to fairyland if you can find them...
Yoimiya: I know that they don't really exist, but I still enjoy believing in them. If someone came up to me and starting telling me to "stop being so stupid, they don't exist, nyah nyah nyah"...
Yoimiya: I'd give them the evil eyes and tell them to get the heck out of my face! Because... grr, it's just so annoying!
Traveler: I kind of get what you are saying.
Yoimiya: Right!? So what if it's made up — it's also really awesome and kinda magical. So it's not up to anyone else to tell me what's what!
Yoimiya: The things we believed and the experiences we had when we were young turn into our priceless treasures as we grow up.
Yoimiya: When you were kids, surely you guys believed in things like heroes who slayed dragons, and sacred swords that cut through darkness? It's the same thing.
Yoimiya: If we tear apart these kids' fairy tales now, what else do we have to tell them? That Inazuma is locked down? All the grim tales of the Vision Hunt Decree? I think it's a bit too early for all of that.
Paimon: Uh... Yeah! Oh, way too early. For sure!
Traveler: You didn't follow that at all, did you?
Yoimiya: Haha, whether you understood me or not, don't you worry. I'll take care of the kids, and make sure they stay safe.
Yoimiya: Ahh! Okay, it's about time I headed back. The Naganohara Fireworks Show is just around the corner, and there's still a lot of things to get ready.
Paimon: Naganohara Fireworks Show? Is that hosted by your family or something?
Yoimiya: Well, yeah, I mean, that's why our name is on the event. It's well-known throughout Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Oh, on the subject — are you busy these days? If not, then you should totally come along. I'll prepare an extra-pretty firework, just for you!
Traveler: We've been looking forward to it for ages!
Yoimiya: Hee-hee, in that case, come with me to Naganohara, we'll go see my pops! There're still a few fireworks to finish off before the show.
Traveler: I'll gladly take you up on that offer.
Traveler: No need to pretend to agree if you didn't understand.
Traveler: Why be so childish about it?
Yoimiya: Because maybe it doesn't matter so much if something's real or not. Maybe magic and awesomeness are what make something worth believing. Why should someone else get to take that away from you?
Traveler: We meet again.

## Talk 3

Yoimiya: Hey, Pops, I'm back!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The fireworks show is almost upon us, and the fireworks for each family are almost ready.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, new faces? Who are these two? Friends, or customers?
Yoimiya: A bit of both, actually. They arrived in Inazuma just recently. Can't let them miss out on a fireworks show after coming all this way, can we?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Hahaha, well, either way, come on in and have a seat and I, Naganohara Ryuunosuke, will tell you all about the long history of the Naganoharas.
Yoimiya: That can wait. Pops, I need to ask you about something.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: A long, long time ago...
Yoimiya: *sigh* Pops has started telling his stories again...
Yoimiya: Sorry about this — ever since Pops had his accident, his ears don't work too well.
Paimon: Really? But for a moment there, it almost seemed like you were having a coherent conversation...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Much, much later, people eventually realized that if you grind certain minerals into dust, they burn with many beautiful colors.
Yoimiya: Pops — Pops wait!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Eh? What is it?
Yoimiya: Did they deliver those firework materials that we ordered yet?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, yesterday's fireworks have all been delivered. So have the ones from the day before yesterday, and the ones from the day before that.
Yoimiya: No, Pops. I meant the materials. The materials that we ordered. They should have arrived today.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Today's fireworks are almost ready, too, don't you worry! Hehe, your old man's skills are still as sharp as ever.
Yoimiya: No— Pops, the materials! The raw materials for making fireworks.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Sorry?
Yoimiya: Ma-te-ri-als!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh... Ohh, the materials?
Paimon: Yes, yes! The materials!
Paimon: Sorry, sorry... Paimon got all excited because you finally got the message across, hehe...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The materials aren't here yet. The couriers did come over to explain why, but... Well, I think they did, but I couldn't quite hear what they were saying...
Yoimiya: No worries, as long as we know, that's fine. We can just make them later. Oh, uh — don't forget to take the goods in when they deliver them, okay, Pops?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Of course, leave it to me.
Yoimiya: Oh, sorry if we were a little loud. It's always the way, though — it's like that every time I need to ask pops something.
Traveler: Still, he seems like a warm and friendly person.
Yoimiya: Uh-huh, that's my pops! He's a good person, alright. Everyone around here respects him.
Yoimiya: Because my pops is deaf, he never argues with anyone, and never contradicts them. He just listens cheerfully.
Yoimiya: When I was little, I thought it was because he really understood me, and agreed with whatever I had to say. So, I'd tell my pops everything.
Yoimiya: Eventually, I realized that the reason he was like that was that he's deaf. But I still tell him stories every day.
Paimon: Huh? Why would you do that?
Yoimiya: It just makes me happy to see him smile. And it keeps him from being lonely, right?
Yoimiya: Anyway. More importantly right now, the fireworks show is right around the corner and the materials still haven't arrived. We need to think of an alternative...
Sakujirou: Um, Yoimiya, is that you?
Yoimiya: Wah! Oh, you scared me there! I thought I told you to be more careful before you speak?
Sakujirou: S—Sorry...
Yoimiya: Hold on, I'm coming over.
Traveler: I think the two of you are quite similar.
Yoimiya: Hehe, I get told that a lot.

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: No one's looking. Okay, you can come out now. Uh, come around the side.
Yoimiya: *sigh* We're lucky that no one from the Tenryou Commission was around, otherwise, we'd all be in big trouble.
Sakujirou: Sorry, I guess I was a little rash. But when I heard you come back, I just...
Yoimiya: Don't worry, Sakujirou. So far, at least, everything is going according to plan.
Yoimiya: We're going to look for firework materials shortly. While we're out, we'll sort out the boat situation for you, as promised.
Sakujirou: Thank you for all your help.
Traveler: Who is this?
Yoimiya: He's one of our old customers. He came back to Inazuma from the outside world not long ago. While he was smuggling himself in, the Tenryou Commission found him and put out a warrant for his arrest...
Paimon: An arrest warrant!?
Yoimiya: Shhhh, keep it down! We don't want to draw any unwanted attention.
Yoimiya: If Sakujirou is caught, there's no knowing what crimes they could charge him with. All we can do is find him a boat and send him out of Inazuma again.
Traveler: But isn't there a thunderstorm out in the ocean?
Yoimiya: Yeah, we know it's going to be dangerous, but there aren't many other options left.
Paimon: What if the boat capsizes? Uhh! Drowning is really scary!
Paimon: If things are this bad, couldn't you have just not come back in the first place?
Sakujirou: Well... There is something I felt I had to do...
Sakujirou: But as soon as I got back, I started hearing about all these unbelievable changes. I had made my mind up, originally, but now I'm not sure anymore...
Sakujirou: I didn't want to cause any trouble for Yoimiya or Mr. Ryuunosuke, but I'm very grateful to them for taking me in.
Yoimiya: Hey, no worries, you're more than welcome. Remember what I said? As long as you've got that little piece of paper, you'll always be a valued customer of the Naganoharas.
Paimon: Little piece of paper...?
Traveler: I remember something about that.
Yoimiya: Yep, the same paper slips as the ones I gave to the kids earlier. Whenever a customer orders fireworks for a commemorative event, we always include a little paper slip with the goods.
Yoimiya: Only people from inside my family can understand what's written on it. It's the recipe for the fireworks they ordered.
Yoimiya: If someone shows a Naganohara that paper slip, we guarantee we can make the exact same firework as the original one they purchased, whether it's ten or even a hundred years later.
Paimon: Wow, that is so awesome!
Yoimiya: It's a family tradition. All our regular customers know about this.
Sakujirou: The slip I have is from back when my parents ordered fireworks from Mr. Ryuunosuke. Now I think about it, it must be nearly 20 years ago.
Sakujirou: *sigh* Who would have thought that things would turn out the way they have...
Yoimiya: It'll be fine. Escaping in a boat is just a last resort for if there's no other way. I'll still try and come up with a different solution, because it'd be much better if you could stay in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Whatever their reasons might be, if our customers come to us looking for help, we're not about to leave them high and dry.
Sakujirou: Thank you... This way, I'll still have some time to consider my options...
Yoimiya: Alright, well, let's not stay out here in the open for too long. Hurry up and get back inside. I'll let you know as soon as I have an update for you.
Sakujirou: Thank you, I—I'll leave it to you, then, I guess.
Yoimiya: *sigh* It's a shame, they still wouldn't give him a permit, even though he was born and raised in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Speaking of, you guys only got here recently, how did you manage to get a permit?
Traveler: We went through a long bureaucratic process on Ritou.
Paimon: Even then, we only got through thanks to some help from Miss Hiiragi Chisato of the Kanjou Commission.
Yoimiya: I see, so you had big shots helping you. I guess that won't be of much help to Sakujirou.
Yoimiya: *sigh* I just wish the commissions could be a little more flexible.
Yoimiya: I bet nowhere else you've been is quite like Inazuma, huh?
Traveler: It's true.
Yoimiya: *sigh* Well, no matter what, I have to find a way to help him.
Yoimiya: I'm sorry, I invited you to come and watch the fireworks, but now I have to run a few errands.
Yoimiya: You don't have to join me if you don't want to. I can go sort out the firework materials and the boat by myself, and then you can come and meet me back at the house later.
Traveler: I don't mind coming along.
Yoimiya: Oh, cool! Then let's start with Sakujirou's boat. We can chat along the way!
Traveler: I'm interested to learn how fireworks are made.
Traveler: Each archon has their own idea on how to run things.
Traveler: Like the paper slips you gave to the kids?
Traveler: And why is he hiding in your home?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, don't worry about me, go take care of business first. There'll always be time for my stories later.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I have a lot of time, and a lot of stories to tell, too.
