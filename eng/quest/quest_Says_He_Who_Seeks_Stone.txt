# Says He Who Seeks Stone


## Talk 1

Muning: Archaic Stone... *sigh* In all the years I've worked in The Chasm, I've barely seen even one. What are the big shots at Huishan Hall thinking...
Muning: Let them do the job and they'll know how impossible the task is.
Paimon: Muning—!
Muning: Oh, it's you. Why are you still wandering on the upper levels of The Chasm?
Muning: Um... Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't welcome you here. I just wonder... Uh, don't you have other important matters to attend to?
Paimon: Hmph, we were just kindly dropping by to check up on you, since you looked so troubled...
Traveler: What happened?
Muning: *sigh*... Do you know about Archaic Stone?
Muning: It's a rare ore — so rare that you won't even necessarily find one in the mines. I've only seen two or three such stones for all my years here at The Chasm. It's such a gorgeous gemstone with beauty beyond imagination.
Muning: They say that if you look inside the finest Archaic Stones, you'll see shimmering light rays as thin as hair, and that the stones' color reminds you of the sea horizon in the twilight...
Traveler: Do you mean a stone like this?
Muning: Ah, you... you actually have one! And it's of the highest quality that I've ever seen, too!
Muning: #Traveler, how about you sell this stone to me?
Traveler: No way.
Paimon: Yep! It's a gift from a friend...
Paimon: Besides, Paimon seriously doubts if your pocket is thick enough to afford the hole this stone is gonna burn through.
Muning: Well... I've got a buyer behind me, so finances aren't exactly the problem.
Paimon: A buyer?
Muning: Yes. Somehow, the big shots at Huishan Hall got interested in the stone and wanted to analyze it, so they sent me to The Chasm to look for a few samples.
Muning: But I'm busy getting my job over with... ahem... I mean, doing my job.
Muning: #How about we make a deal, Traveler? If you find any Archaic Stones, bring them to me. In exchange, the reward promised by Huishan Hall will be yours.
Muning: They don't have to match the quality of yours, as long as they are Archaic Stones.
Paimon: Rewards from Huishan Hall!
Muning: Normally, I would handle the job myself, but my hands have been tied by various affairs here in The Chasm lately, so please help me with this.
Muning: *sigh* ...That said, I'm not sure how many they want. How about you bring me three for starters?
Paimon: Alright, alright, we got it.
Traveler: Dream on.
Traveler: Is anything bothering you?

Muning: They say that if you look inside the finest Archaic Stones, you'll see shimmering light rays as thin as hair, and that the stones' color reminds you of the profound beauty of the sea horizon in the twilight...
Paimon: So what you're trying to say is that you are looking for some stones of beautiful colors?
Muning: Not all stones of beautiful colors will do. It has to be THE stone.
Muning: #Speaking of which... How about this, Traveler? You help me look out for stones that fit my description.
Muning: Bring them to me, and I will purchase them.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon seriously doubts if your pocket is thick enough to afford this stone.
Muning: Well... I've got a buyer behind me, so finances aren't exactly the problem.
Paimon: A buyer?
Muning: Yes. Somehow, the big shots at Huishan Hall got interested in the stone and wanted to analyze it, so they sent me to The Chasm to look for a few samples.

## Talk 3

Muning: Have you found the Archaic Stones?
Traveler: Here they are.

## Talk 4

Muning: These are indeed Archaic Stones. You have my thanks.
Muning: I was right to come to you. I bet it would've taken much longer if it'd been the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Hmm... who knows. Perhaps, the Adventurers' Guild might even...
Traveler: Send us the commission.
Muning: That's quite likely.
Muning: Adventurers... Hmm... I used to be envious of them. The way they ventured into high mountains and deep dungeons... There seemed to be nowhere they dared not go.
Muning: I'm quite the opposite though — I've been working here for years but haven't once visited Cinnabar Cliff on the very top of The Chasm.
Paimon: What? You haven't been there even once?
Muning: Well, Cinnabar Cliff is one of those famous tourist spots that locals seldom go to.
Muning: Maybe it's so close that I always think that I can visit it later when I've got time — but well, I've never "got time."
Paimon: Then, why don't we go now?
Paimon: It's important to act spontaneously.
Muning: I think I'll pass. I'm still in the middle of something.
Muning: What's more, such errand-running is best left to adventurers.
Muning: Dangerous places are their bread and butter, after all. I'd probably get injured if I did the same, and that's something I'd like to avoid.
Paimon: Makes sense. Getting injured could be a big deal.
Muning: If I'm injured, no one's gonna supervise the exploration team down there and ensure the safety of the miners.
Muning: Should anything happen, it will escalate into a grievous matter.
Paimon: That's what you're worried about... Paimon thought you were just scared of getting injured!
Muning: The formidably high cliffs near The Chasm, the bottomless caves... and the ancient battlefield left behind by Rex Lapis are all full of danger...
Muning: I don't have the slightest interest in venturing into those places.
Muning: Here, the rewards for the three Archaic Stones. Huishan Hall wants quite a lot of them, so bring me more if you can find any.
Muning: Of course, there will be rewards for those, too. Just remember to come to me once you find more Archaic Stones.
Paimon: You can count on us!

## Talk 5

Muning: Have you found the Archaic Stones?
Traveler: Here they are.

## Talk 6

Muning: Three more.
Muning: I shall gratefully take the Archaic Stones submitted by our two "civic-minded citizens."
Muning: I didn't expect you to find two of them so quickly. And they are much better in quality than the ones I've previously seen.
Muning: *sigh*... They remind me of the one that I used to have.
Paimon: You have an Archaic Stone?
Traveler: Then why send us to look for it?
Muning: I mean I USED to have one.
Muning: My old man once handled a batch of ores at Shenglu Hall. That stone was just a leftover remnant and its quality was poor, so he gave it to me as a toy.
Muning: We had been arguing all the time back then. I never had a job. And to make it worse, I spent most of my time at Yanshang Teahouse. As such, I ended up in heavy debt — and in distress too...
Paimon: Huh...
Traveler: That feels a bit wrong...
Muning: Well, who hasn't done a stupid thing or two when they were young? Anyway, when I was helpless...
Muning: Someone recognized my Archaic Stone and offered a good price. To me, it was no big deal — a stone in exchange for some Mora to get me out of my immediate predicament. A fair trade I'd say.
Muning: Yet my father brought this up the other day and asked, "Muning, where did you put the stone that I gave you?"
Muning: All I could tell him was, "It's just a stone. I've long lost it."
Muning: Though I said so, I couldn't help wondering what if I hadn't sold the stone — then I could show it to Father when he mentioned it...
Muning: ...Forget it. It's no use wondering about the what-if now.
Paimon: At least the prodigal son has returned.
Muning: You are right... It's just that I still have a long way to go before I can clear my debt.
Muning: I've digressed. Do bring me the stones if you find more.
Traveler: Aren't these enough?
Muning: Hmm... Bring me three more. Three more would be enough.
Muning: Archaic Stone is a rare ore. If Huishan Hall wants more, I seriously doubt if I can find any here in The Chasm.
Traveler: Just how many do you need?
Traveler: C'mon, hand in yours first.

## Talk 7

Muning: Have you found the Archaic Stones?
Traveler: Here they are.

## Talk 8

Muning: With these three included, it's nine in total. They should be enough.
Muning: You managed to gather what Huishan Hall needs so quickly. No wonder they speak so highly of you!
Paimon: Eh, it was easy! Easy-peasy, lemon-breezy!
Traveler: I'm sure it's "lemon-squeezy," Paimon...
Paimon: Eh? Uh, well, lemons can be breezy too!
Traveler: Oh, look at you, forcing your logic through. Most impressive.
Muning: Haha... We've all witnessed your heroic deeds of fighting the sea monster. I believe it was no challenge for you to accomplish such a feat.
Traveler: No challenge at all indeed.
Muning: Well, so much for being a Ministry staff member. They still ask you to do things like "look for Archaic Stone in The Chasm"...
Paimon: Speaking of which, you said you often argued with your father back then and didn't have a job.
Paimon: Then how did you make it into the Ministry later?
Muning: You know how I owed a big sum at the time? I could turn to no one, nor was I willing to go home.
Muning: In the end, the debt collectors came looking for my old man at the Shenglu Hall... I thought he'd come find me to break my legs upon hearing the news.
Paimon: But your legs look fine.
Muning: Yes... It's embarrassing to say, but he cleared my debt and came looking for me. By the time he found me, I was almost like a beaten-up dog on the street. He said, "I have all your IOUs, so now you're indebted to me."
Muning: With that, he forced me to work — to pay my debt.
Paimon: So your father is your creditor now.
Muning: You can say that...
Muning: Back then, with the debt collectors after me, I couldn't even fall asleep at night. So, I swore that I'd mend my ways if I was given a second chance.
Muning: But I didn't expect the chance to come from my father, who always disapproved of my behaviors...
Muning: He didn't lash out at me as usual. Instead, we had a talk — an honest and sincere one. How I wish we could've talked this way earlier.
Muning: But even if he'd been open for a talk, I wouldn't have been willing to listen.
Paimon: Looks like your father treats you well.
Muning: Yeah.
Muning: So I have to get my job done well under whatever circumstances.
Muning: Whether it's the incident in The Chasm or looking for Archaic Stones for Huishan Hall.
Traveler: I believe I'm the one who did the job for you this time...
Muning: Having people get the job done also counts.
Muning: But still, it's all thanks to you that we moved swimmingly — I'd say it was way more quickly than I expected.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon finally senses a touch of gratitude there.
Traveler: It's actually a bit of a challenge...
