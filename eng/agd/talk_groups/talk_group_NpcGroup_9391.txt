Mavuika: It seems like everything that happens here gets recorded in the form of a play.
Mavuika: But who is behind all of this? Someone passionate about records and legacy, I guess?
Mavuika: Anyway, I like the fact that the records are available to view any time. It'll be interesting to look back on them in the future, and see what hindsight brings to the equation.
