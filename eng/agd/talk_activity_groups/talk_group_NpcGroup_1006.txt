## Talk

Jean: Thank you for accepting our invitation, traveler.
Traveler: How do we fight Stormterror?
Jean: Its change in size and power really is suspicious.
Jean: But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
Jean: The Grand Master entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I cannot let him or the people of Mondstadt down.
Jean: I must get to the bottom of this...
Traveler: Are all the knights as... "strict" as Amber?
Jean: I heard you and Outrider Amber had a misunderstanding.
Jean: Please forgive her. She was just doing her job.
Jean: Talk to Amber sometime. I'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: #Thanks again for your help, Traveler.

Jean: About Stormterror, there must be something we are still not aware of...
Traveler: How do we fight Stormterror?
Jean: Its change in size and power really is suspicious.
Jean: But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
Jean: The Grand Master entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I cannot let him or the people of Mondstadt down.
Jean: I must get to the bottom of this...
Traveler: Tell me about the Fatui.
Jean: Those people in strange uniforms... are Fatui.
Jean: They're here as delegates from Snezhnaya.
Jean: Stay away from them. Having contact with them is dangerous, even for innocent travelers.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: May the Wind guide you.

## Talk

Jean: I know I'm not here on official business, so why did I sound so stern just now? It seems I struggle to break out of work mode.
Traveler: Tell me about the Knights.
Jean: The Knights of Favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. I'm a bit ashamed of myself for it...
Jean: If only I was a stronger leader...
Jean: Or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our Grand Master does...
Jean: No, I cannot feel sorry for myself. We need to solve our problems first. Right?
Traveler: Tell me about the Holy Lyre.
Jean: Barbatos' sacred relic, Mondstadt's treasure... The Holy Lyre.
Jean: No wonder it has the power to purify evil...
Jean: I hope it will help us save Dvalin, like Venti says.
Jean: If it can, then it truly is a blessing bestowed upon us by Lord Barbatos.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: May the wind guide us in saving Dvalin.
