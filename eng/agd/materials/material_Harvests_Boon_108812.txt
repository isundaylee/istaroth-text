# Harvest's Boon

A rich and comforting meal held together by the humble Grainfruit. Minced meat is stir-fried and placed in a baking pan with larger chunks of meat and eggs. The whole thing is then covered with a layer of mashed Grainfruit and baked until a tantalizing golden brown. This hearty dish can often be found on the tables of the Collective of Plenty during harvest festivals.
