Traveler: Who are you?
Yi Zhu: I'm Yi Zhu. You probably know my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: With the house so empty these days, I'm worried Yi Xian'll get lonely. So I thought I'd buy her a new toy, see if it takes her mind off things.
Yi Zhu: Changshun was so understanding, she said I could pick one toy to take back home for free. Everyone's been so good to me and my sister... *sniff*
Yi Zhu: ...
Yi Zhu: *sniff* ...No, I can't cry...I can't let Yi Xian see me unhappy.
