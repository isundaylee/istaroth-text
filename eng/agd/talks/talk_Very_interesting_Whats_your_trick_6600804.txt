Traveler: Very interesting. What's your trick?
Acat: Of course, it's down to talent.
Acat: Just like how some people won't get lost even when they're in a totally new place, I'm a natural when it comes to color.
Acat: As I see it, there's no such thing as ugly colors, just ugly combinations. Even the hue of rotten fruit will shine in the right context.
Acat: Speaking of which, your eyes are a lovely color... In fact, I'm going to try mixing it later.
