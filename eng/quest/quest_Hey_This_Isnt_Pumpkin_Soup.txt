# "Hey, This Isn't Pumpkin Soup..."


## Talk 1

Verenata: Hmm... A Tidalga slurry, the crushed innards of Lumitoile, and a little... Wait, how much is a "little" exactly?
Paimon: Hey, are you making some soup? ... Urgh, that smells really weird...!
Verenata: Hmm? It smells weird? That can't be. I followed the formula Carabosse gave me exactly, so it should smell normal...
Traveler: It smells like someone fermented a sea bass for three years in a vat of dead frogs...
Paimon: Urp, did you have to say that? Now Paimon has that image in her head...
Paimon: A—Anyway, what are you doing? Do you, uh, need help?
Verenata: It's a potion! I'm formulating a potion... one that'll help lots of people.
Paimon: So you're a potioneer, then?
Verenata: Not yet! I'm just an assistant to a Master Potioneer. Her name is Carabosse, and I, Verenata, still have much to learn from her.
Paimon: Hehe, well, an assistant to a great doctor must be a great assistant, right?
Verenata: Hehe... Ye— W—Wait, no! Not at all!
Verenata: I'm... There are so many things I still don't know. I'm just working as hard as I can to help her make potions.
Verenata: Also... U—Um, I've told you my name, but I don't know yours yet.
Paimon: #Paimon's Paimon, and he's Traveler.
Verenata: "Paimon." What a nice name. Reminds me of a noisy white jellyfish.
Verenata: #Traveler. That's a slightly strange name, and it gleams like gold, but it's very friendly. Pleased to meet you!
Verenata: And, well, you just asked if I need help, and I do... But I don't know if you'd be willing to help...
Traveler: Ask away.
Paimon: Exactly! If you need help, you should just say so!
Verenata: I'd like you to... try my new potions.
Paimon: Eh?
Verenata: I know potions smell and taste bad... but they can help lots of people and cure many illnesses. They're very useful things.
Verenata: But we can't get sick, and we don't like drinking strange things. Over time, people stopped helping me taste my potions — and that's been a big problem for me.
Paimon: Uh... You're the one who said this stuff is weird! It isn't dangerous, is it?
Verenata: It's fine. We don't get poisoned by them. Um... so you shouldn't either... Well, at least in theory, anyway.
Verenata: There are a total of three potions that need testing. One will help people fight better! The other will keep people feeling warm. And the last one, um...
Verenata: I'm not sure how to put this, but Carabosse says that it can help people understand the truth. That's what she said, anyway... I'm still not sure what it means...
Paimon: That does sound dangerous...
Verenata: No, no, it's not dangerous... Anyway, would you like to help? If you would, I'll take you to the test site now!
Traveler: If you calm down a bit, you can smell the fragrance of Sweet Flowers...
Paimon: Hey, that's not right either!

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll help you. Let's go.
Verenata: Just don't go drinking yourself into danger!

## Talk 3

Verenata: You're back! Wanna help me test the potions?

## Talk 4

Verenata: Thank you! Let's try the first type, then!
Paimon: #Don't drink too much of it, Traveler! Just spit it out if something feels off, okay?
Traveler: Don't worry, Paimon, I'll be fine.
Paimon: Hmph. Paimon's just worried, you know...
Traveler: I'm ready. Pass me the potion.
Verenata: This one's called the Super-Duper Potion, and it'll make you super strong! Well... in theory, at least.
Black Screen Text: You take the potion from Verenata and drink it in one go.
It has a pungent odor that's hard to bear, but it tastes sweet and sticky, and isn't hard to swallow.
Otherwise, however, your body has no reaction to it.
Black Screen Text: At her direction, you then wait until some Breacher Primuses become active.

## Talk 5

Verenata: U—Um, so, did you defeat those creatures so easily because of the Super-Duper Potion?
Traveler: Exactly! You could even say it gave me Super-Duper Powers!
Paimon: What kind of awful advertising slogan is that...
Verenata: Ah, thank you, thank you! So it was due to the potion's effects, then. I guess that's a Master Potioneer's recipe for you!
Verenata: Alright then. Let's bring the Super-Duper Potion testing to a close first. Next, let's test this Coasty-Toasty Potion!
Paimon: Did you, uh, come up with these names yourself?
Verenata: No, I'm no good at making up names, so I just let others help me come up with much better ones...
Paimon: Well, don't say that... Really, and for something like potions, the name should let you know what it does right away anyway, right?
Verenata: Hmm. I've never heard that before... But you're right! That's what a Master Potioneer should be like!
Verenata: #*cough* A—Anyway, are you ready to test this potion, Traveler?
Traveler: Sure, let's start.
Paimon: Oh boy, this one smells like a disaster too...
Verenata: Theoretically, this Coasty-Toasty Potion will spare you from the effects of the cold and keep you warm! Yeah. Probably.
Black Screen Text: You take the potion from Verenata. It smells like dusty, musty old leather...
You hesitate for a moment before drinking it all in one gulp. It's not a bad tasting drink, being spicy with hints of cinnamon and ginger... It reminds you of a crackling fireplace on a rainy day.
Otherwise, however, your body has no reaction to it.
Black Screen Text: Afterwards, you rest for a while at her instruction.
Traveler: I didn't feel much, but it was pretty sweet.
Paimon: Eh? But it smelled terrible...
Verenata: Huh... Is that so? Did I get something wrong?
Paimon: Don't be so down. At least it wasn't poisonous... We can take that as a win, right?

## Talk 6

Verenata: #Are you alright, Traveler? Are you okay!?
Verenata: Sorry, sorry... I didn't know that the medicine would attract strange things like that...
Traveler: That happened because the potion made me all coasty and toasty, you know?
Paimon: Uh, is that even how things work? Can you be coasty?
Verenata: Wow... Right! Aquatic animals do mistake warm things for the sun, which will attract them. That means... the potion worked! Thank you both, truly!
Paimon: Paimon really doesn't think that's how it works...
Traveler: Aquatic animals...? Weren't those Pyro Slimes?
Verenata: I see... Hmm, hallucinogenic side effects... Alright, I've written it down. Well, at least it wasn't completely ineffective, but...
Paimon: But its effects were terrible! It made huge crabs look like Pyro Slimes this time, but what if a more dangerous monster comes along next time!? What then?
Verenata: True... I've already bothered you so much already, but there's one final potion that needs testing... Are you still okay with that?
Traveler: As long as it's not poisonous, let's do it.
Paimon: Though we'll only find out if it's poisonous when we test it...
Verenata: Yes! Thank you so much! Well, next up is... the Truesight Potion!
Paimon: Eh? W—Wait just a minute!
Paimon: The first one was the Super-Duper Potion, the next was the Coasty-Toasty Potion, and this one's called...
Verenata: The Truesight Potion, which means it can "let people see the truth"... What's wrong with that?
Paimon: Um... It's nothing... Paimon just thinks that this one's name is completely different compared to the others! It's like a 360 degree turn!
Traveler: Doesn't that mean it's no different?
Paimon: Huh...? Uh... Paimon doesn't have that many fingers! You know what Paimon meant anyway!
Verenata: Hehe, that's because the Master Potioneer named the first two for me, and I named this one...
Verenata: I'm no good at names though, so it's definitely not as good as the names she came up with.
Paimon: Really? Paimon thought it was the other way around... Either way, have some more confidence! In fact, that's a proper name for a potion...
Verenata: Mm, thanks. Anyway... This potion's different from the previous two, so it might be very dangerous... So please, come to my workshop.
Verenata: If we're in the sea, the environment should help moderate the potion's effects, and my workshop has tools to deal with the dangers, so...
Paimon: Wow, this one sounds like a real doozy...
Traveler: Let's begin, then.
Verenata: Alright. Follow me!
Traveler: You mean 180 degrees, right?
Traveler: Well, we've gotten this far...
Paimon: Exactly! What would the point of all this be if we gave up halfway? That said... It's not like Paimon's not worried or anything, but...
Traveler: Don't worry, Pyro Slimes are weak.
Paimon: Heh... Wait, no, it's just that you're too strong!
Verenata: Hmmm. Wait... Did you just say "Pyro Slimes"?
Paimon: Oh! That's right... We actually only saw a bunch of huge crabs!
Traveler: Crabs? Yes, it's normal to see crabs near the coast.
Paimon: But you really weren't normal just now!
Traveler: But the burning sensation was very real. I could even feel the heat waves coming from them...
Verenata: I see... Um, hallucinogenic effects... Alright, I've written it down. Well, at least it wasn't completely ineffective, but... *sigh*
Verenata: Regardless, it's great that you're alright! It's just that... Sorry, the potion didn't work again...
Paimon: #It's fine! Anyway... Even though it smells terrible, it's at least half successful. You see, Traveler was totally fine even after drinking it!

## Talk 7

Verenata: Here! This is my workshop, where I conduct my experiments!
Verenata: Okay, now for the next experiment, we'll be testing the Truesight Potion! Are you ready?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Paimon: Oooh... Please be careful...
Black Screen Text: You take the potion from Verenata, and the rank odor of masses of dead Seagrass left to rot under the tropical sun assaults your nostrils, causing you to gag involuntarily...
You hesitate for a moment, and then drain it in a single gulp. The taste of the potion itself isn't nearly so awful, and in fact, it really lacks any kind of distinct taste...
Otherwise, however, your body has no reaction to it.
Black Screen Text: Afterwards, you rest for a while at her instruction. Absolutely nothing changes during that time.
Black Screen Text: But not long after...
Paimon: It looks like nothing has changed... Phew, Paimon can stop worrying now...
Verenata: #Yes, but... Traveler, you look like you were stunned for a moment. What's wrong? Did you see something?
Traveler: I saw... half of a semi-transparent boat?
Verenata: Really? Fascinating! But... um... can you provide a more detailed description?
Traveler: It was too far away, I couldn't see clearly.
Verenata: How very interesting, yes indeed! ...But it cannot serve as concrete proof of the potion's effects... You can't prove that you didn't mistake some reef or shipwreck for a "ghost ship," after all...
Verenata: So... *sigh* The results of this experiment are inconclusive.
Verenata: Thanks to you both, I've collected a great many awesome notes this time! I'll definitely be able to use them for the next batch of potions!
Verenata: Hmm... "Though I've heard something very familiar..." Yes, "But there's still so much to observe, to see if others can see the same phenomenon"...
Paimon: Uh? Does that mean that you still need to find other people to help you test your potions?
Verenata: Yes, that's correct. Because... um... I must have two or more reliable witnesses who see the same thing in order to prove that the potion really can allow people to see the "truth," right?
Verenata: The "truth" will not be limited or constrained by the eyes and perspectives of the viewer, and won't be distorted by what is in their heart... It objectively exists there, and it just is.
Paimon: Hmmm... like... like gods that live for thousands of years?
Verenata: ...
Verenata: No. Like the white sand, like the bones of seastars, like the waves that crash and pound... those are "truth."
Verenata: But the Master Potioneer has also said... that "truth" can also be created through dreams and memories. I don't quite get it, and it seems like a contradiction to me... but I'm trying my best to understand.
Paimon: Wow... The topic got so deep so quickly...
Verenata: Haha, then let's not talk about such things for now! Anyway, I'd like to thank you for your help! Please, take these!
Verenata: Hmm... Also, be sure to come back again next time I make a new potion!
Traveler: It looked like it had been cut in half by something huge...
Verenata: ...
Verenata: Ah! Sorry! I... must have drifted off for a second there. But... but I've already written it all down. Thank you very much!
