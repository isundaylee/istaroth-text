# A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Energy Storage


## Talk 1

Paimon: Bertrand!
Bertrand: #Ah, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Splendiferous timing.
Bertrand: My one and only Great Machine has finished processing the materials you collected.
Traveler: And how did that go?
Bertrand: Well, come now, this is a machine that I created! Of course there were no issues at all! My techniques were, after all, forged in the fires of Fontaine!
Bertrand: And of course, none know the operation and workings of such devices better than we, the people of Fontaine.
Bertrand: I blame the previous, ah, explosive nature of the product on rushed preparation and a lack of helping hands to help hoover up the necessary materials. Things will be different this time!
Paimon: So you say...
Bertrand: If it still explodes... Well, then my final deposit and the rest of my life will go up in smoke too.
Bertrand: So even if you don't believe in me, you can have faith in my resolution to put my life on the line for this!
Paimon: Y'know, Paimon never thought that this toymaking thingamajig was supposed to require that much resolve...
Bertrand: Well, regardless, we need to begin on the next step of our work.
Bertrand: For safety's sake, let me just ask you this first: of the three processes, the one we have completed is "Source Material Collection."
Bertrand: Now then, is the next step "Core Collection" or "Charge Collection"?
Traveler: Core Collection...
Bertrand: Congratulations... on being wrong. If you really did go out and do that, then you'd have a part in the collapse of my fortunes.
Bertrand: The correct answer is Elemental Charge.
Bertrand: Well, all in all... This Elemental Charge is essentially performed by being affected by the elements while carrying the Material Collector.
Bertrand: For example, I could stand in a river while carrying the Collector to collect Hydro. If I wanted to collect Electro...
Paimon: You'd need to be struck by lightning?
Bertrand: Well, you know, you *are* adventurers...
Bertrand: I believe that you have an adventurer's constitution.
Traveler: Oh, so it's our constitution you believe in...
Bertrand: To be honest, coming into contact with elemental life forms is probably our best bet. During my previous travels in Inazuma, I marked out three different locations frequented by elemental beings...
Bertrand: I'd actually wanted to sneak over there by boat and make contact with those creatures myself, if no help came...
Paimon: That's way too risky...
Bertrand: Well, now that you're here, why don't you go and try your luck in those places?
Bertrand: Yes, indeed, I believe I shall leave this to you!
Traveler: It's Charge Collection...
Bertrand: Well, it would seem so... But in truth, the answer isn't "Charge Collection" but rather, "Elemental Charge." Didn't expect me to give you two wrong options, eh?
Paimon: This guy's laughter is pretty annoying...

## Talk 2

Bertrand: Hmm... The elements within the Collector will have to be transferred into the Machine after each collection, so one production cycle will require three collection trips... This seems like a bit too much busywork.
Bertrand: Let me see if I can find some way to optimize this...

## Talk 3

Bertrand: How are things going with the Material Collector? Operations are smooth, I trust?
Traveler: Quite so.
Bertrand: The Collector, too, is my pride and joy. Whether it be the collection of source materials as we did before or the storage of elemental energies as it presently does, it can do them all.
Bertrand: To tell the truth, I've been having some thoughts about changing the Material Collector's name...
Paimon: Eh, Paimon thinks it's fine the way it is.
Traveler: Same here.
Bertrand: Really? I thought that it might be understating the device's capabilities a little, honestly.
Bertrand: Well, whatever the case, pass me the Material Collector. Just as before, the trial production run will require some observation, especially with regard to the use of elemental energy.
Bertrand: We'll most likely be able to proceed only after the elemental reactions within the Great Machine stabilize.
Bertrand: Well, I'll be counting on you once that happens.
Traveler: Well, if the shoe fits...
