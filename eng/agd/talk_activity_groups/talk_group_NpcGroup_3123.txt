Genzou: Who are you? What is your business here?
Genzou: If you're a commoner, you should leave now. If my superior comes in and finds you here, you'll be in deep trouble.

## Talk

Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Genzou: I'm just a soldier of the Shogunate. I am here on a mission with my superior.
Genzou: I'm just a nobody compared to my superior, Sir Terada. No one really not worth mentioning, haha.

## Talk

Traveler: See you...
Genzou: Leave now, and stay out of trouble.

## Talk

Traveler: Uh, so, about your boss...
Genzou: What's with the suspicious tone? You think we're impostors?
Genzou: I am a Shogunate officer, and this is my identification! Don't you dare be so rude!
Genzou: As for Lord Terada, his status exceeds mine. How can the likes of you question his authority?
Genzou: He is a humble man with many accomplishments, and he treats his subordinates with care and respect.
Genzou: Ever since I started serving Lord Terada, I've never spent another day maintaining order, risking my life amidst the horrors of war, or going hungry.
Genzou: There's no boss in the world who's better than him, so don't you dare make any trouble for him, you hear me?
