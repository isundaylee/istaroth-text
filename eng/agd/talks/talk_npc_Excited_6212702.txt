# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Excited?
Xiling: I'm talking about my buddy over here, blabbering on even though he only met her gaze briefly.
Xiling: ...I'm her childhood friend, so by his logic, shouldn't I be over the moon every single day? Talk about exaggerating...
Traveler: You're her childhood friend?
Xiling: Yup, we actually grew up together. I even taught her fishing songs.
Xiling: Still, when I found out that she was the Beidou people call the Lord of the Ocean, even I was shocked.
Xiling: ...Now, I haven't seen her in a good long time. But I've practically heard enough tales about her to make my ears bleed.
