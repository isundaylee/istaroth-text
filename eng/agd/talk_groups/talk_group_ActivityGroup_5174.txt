Ulman: Yo! You're back so soon! Did you find the treasure?
Traveler: Show me what you've got.
Ulman: Sure, have a look!
Traveler: Why did you come to Fontaine?
Ulman: Of course I'm here to... Uh... do business! A few of my business partners came here, so of course I came as well.
Paimon: Hey, aren't those business partners of yours... Treasure Hoarders or something of the sort?
Ulman: No way! I'd never work with people like that! It'd be way too risky...
Ulman: Uh... Or at least I wouldn't work with them directly. If for some reason I had to work with them, I'd need to find a middleman.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Ulman: Goodbye! I leave retrieving the Ancient Iron Coins to you, remember to bring any you find to me! I'll definitely buy them for a good price.

Ulman: What to do, what to do... *sigh* Maybe I should just go straight back to Mondstadt...
Ulman: It's been so long that I've forgotten even the taste of Dandelion Wine...
Traveler: Show me what you've got.
Ulman: Sure, have a look!
Traveler: See you.
Ulman: See you next time! I've got a feeling we'll be working together again in the future. I'll be counting on you when the time comes!
