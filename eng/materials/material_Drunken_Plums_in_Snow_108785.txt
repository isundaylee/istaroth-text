# Drunken Plums in Snow

An elegant-looking Liyue dish. Once the crab is steamed, its roe and meat are carefully removed, stir-fried, then returned to the shell. Egg whites are whipped into a frothy coating to seal the crab shell, topped with finely chopped ham for a touch of color, then the whole thing is baked. Together, the succulent crab meat and fluffy egg whites make a combination that's sure to impress.
