Jami: *sigh* I should really decide on a budget before starting an experiment next time... Managing a project is so much harder than working on the experiment itself...
Jami: #How was it, Traveler? Did the experiment go smoothly?
Traveler: About the "Fayz Potion"...
Jami: The Fayz Potion is pretty amazing, huh? It's a shame that it only works in specific environments.
Jami: If I could improve the versatility of the Fayz Potion, it would definitely become a popular research topic. Hmm, improving its versatility...
Jami: Curses, why didn't I think of that earlier? I could've just researched that instead!
Jami: Ugh, the more I think about it, the more I regret choosing my current topic...
Traveler: About your research topic...
Jami: Yeah, sorry for not explaining clearly... But why would you be interested in this?
Jami: Anyway, the project I'm currently working on is called "A Study on the Defense Deficiencies of Biological Structures in Response to Hostile Stressors."
Jami: Simply put, I'm researching the weaknesses revealed by creatures during combat and defense behaviors in dangerous environments.
Jami: It's like when a Rishboland Tiger comes leaping at you and you quickly slip under its tummy to dodge its attack... Weird analogy, I know, but that's basically how it is.
Jami: I wanted to study creatures active across larger areas, and many of those creatures are native to Liyue. That's why I chose to set up my experimental site here.
Traveler: I'm still working on it.
Jami: Ah, okay then. I hope everything goes smoothly... Please stay safe!
