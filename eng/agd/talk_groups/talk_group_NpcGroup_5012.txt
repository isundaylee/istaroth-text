Remande: Er... Does "the aquabus repairman might've been put in a bad mood by my many questions" count?
Remande: I'm kidding! The repairman's great. He told me that there was a place nearby that produces Condessence Crystals, which I can use to make models.
Remande: That said, I don't think I'd be any good at excavation by hand — might be better to just buy the ore pre-processed. But if you have need of them, you can check the place out.

Traveler: Boat-tos?
Remande: Boat-tos! Photos of boats. Boats, photos — by which I mean pictures of the aquabuses.
Remande: I absolutely adore the aquabus network — really, I'd take a picture of every last detail if I could.
Remande: My dream is to someday recreate a scale clockwork model of an aquabus without needing to refer to the real object, or even pictures of it.
Remande: At this moment, I've reached the phase where I'm taking photos daily, and familiarizing myself with them. Wish me well, friend!
