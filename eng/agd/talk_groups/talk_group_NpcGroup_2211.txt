Traveler: How are your travels through Liyue going?
Soraya: Great! The ruins and history are fascinating, as are the local customs.
Soraya: I mean, a lot of local customs are also derived from history. I've learned a lot just from studying them.
Soraya: Take, for example, this particular record of Liyue wedding customs, which was written about in Customs of Liyue: Flower Ball by a scholar from Sumeru.
Soraya: If it interests you, do take it and have a look. It's very fascinating indeed.

## Talk 1

Soraya: ...How many secrets does Liyue truly hold?

Traveler: Secrets?
Soraya: Oh, Traveler, it's you. The secrets I'm referring to are a set of inscriptions.

Traveler: Do you mean buried treasure?
Soraya: Haha, who knows? It's always possible. Talk of secrets waiting to be uncovered does tend to make one think of buried treasure.

## Talk 2

Soraya: This place we are in is called the Guili Assembly. According to Liyue folklore, it was once inhabited by people — in fact, it was rather prosperous.
Soraya: But for various reasons, the whole place was wiped out. All that remains now is the countless ruins scattered across the landscape.
Soraya: Some stories put it down to the conflict between the gods, other people say it was a war between humans. And some sources talk of a sudden, catastrophic natural disaster...
Soraya: Whatever the reason was, ruins are all that remain here now. The only ones who come here are the hilichurls, the Treasure Hoarders...
Soraya: ...And masochistic scholars, like me, who in spite of all the risks just can't resist the idea of how much research value these ruins have to offer.
Soraya: In practice though, scholars like me aren't actually cut out for this kind of field work! I've hardly covered any ground yet, and I already need a rest...
Soraya: The actual ruin-exploring seems more your area of expertise. What do you say, fancy helping me out?

Traveler: Sure.
Soraya: Great. Hmm, but I should give you an idea of what to look for... Yes, keep your eyes peeled for stone pillars and stone tablets.
Soraya: Given how ancient these ruins are, any text we can hope to find will be written on stone, not paper.
Soraya: After all, stone is the oldest and most durable medium for written communication.

Traveler: What am I looking for?
Soraya: Hmm... Text, essentially. Written messages from the past.
Soraya: And if you're looking for text in ruins as ancient as these, that means looking for stone pillars and stone tablets.
Soraya: Stone is the oldest, most durable medium for written communication. All the more so in the domain of the Geo Archon.
Soraya: The stones here have borne witness to all of history. I am sure they will not disappoint.

Traveler: Only if there's treasure...
Soraya: Whatever treasure you find, you can keep. Material wealth isn't what appeals to me.
Soraya: In Liyue there's a saying that goes: "Money belongs to the world outside your head." I'm more interested in acquiring knowledge than money.
Soraya: So while you're hunting for treasure, please also keep your eyes peeled for stone pillars and stone tablets.
Soraya: Given how ancient these ruins are, any knowledge we can hope to find will be most likely be written on stone.
