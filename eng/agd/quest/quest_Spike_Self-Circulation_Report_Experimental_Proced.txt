# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Experimental Procedure


## Talk 1

Hosseini: *cough*
Paimon: Hosseini, are you alright?
Hosseini: I think I must be feeling the effects myself. Must've stayed here too long while thinking about how to move the Pursina's Spike towards the Ley Line rupture.
Hosseini: It's not a big deal though. I've had some rest and I'm much better already.
Hosseini: At the same time, I've also thought of a solution, it's just that... well, I must say that finding a way to move the Pursina's Spike around is actually not as hard as finding excuses to extend report submission dates.
Hosseini: Since the mud covers the ground, we can make it float just a little by using hot air balloons and transport the Spike that way.
Paimon: Ooh, that sounds like a pretty good idea.
Hosseini: Of course, this will help us solve our dark mud problem to some extent, but in areas where it has blocked up the tunnel, we might still have trouble getting the hot air balloon through.
Hosseini: And this is without speaking of the monsters that the mud will attract...
Hosseini: I'm afraid that we'll have to leave such things to you.
Paimon: #Don't worry! Between Paimon and Traveler, all these monsters won't even know what hit 'em!
Traveler: Guess you're the star of the show, Paimon.
Paimon: Eh? W—Well, Paimon's mostly just cheering you on from the sides, y'know...
Hosseini: Hahaha—hurk *cough* *cough*
Hosseini: Ugh, to think that laughing just a little would make me cough this much... Whatever the case, Tu and Hao are packaging the Pursina's Spike and getting the balloon ready.
Hosseini: I'd have packaged the Pursina's Spike myself, but the mere effort of standing up for a while was enough to send me into coughing fits.
Hosseini: How embarrassing... Looks like I'll have to train my body as well as my academic mind in the future.
Hosseini: Go and look for them.
Traveler: I'll lend you my sword for a while.

## Talk 2

Tu: #Hey, Traveler, you're just in time. We're done wrapping this thing up.
Tu: Guess that dude from Sumeru's explained how we're going to use this hot air balloon?
Hao: Come on, Hosseini's not some "dude from Sumeru," he's here to help us with the dark mud. Couldn't you have a bit more respect?
Tu: H—Hey, this is just a friendly form of address!
Hao: Right, whatever. The balloon can be used, and the purification device has also been prepared...
Tu: #Traveler, if you need the help of the Mining Superstar... *cough* Actually, never mind, I can't really help right now.
Hao: At least you've got some self-awareness. Go get some rest!
Tu: *sigh* Whatever the case, if you want to start moving the device, just start the hot air balloon right up.
