Traveler: Why would you even think that...
Muli: I love fishing, especially when it's with Qiongjiu!
Muli: But father says that someone must take over our family's jade business...
Muli: So it would be perfect if I could fish up some jadeware! Don't you think so too!?
Muli: Or maybe I'll ask Little Mao to learn how to make jadeware while I go fishing with Qiongjiu! That would be great too!
