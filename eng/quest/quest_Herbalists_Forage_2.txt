# Herbalist's Forage


## Talk 1

Traveler: About those Sweet Flowers...
Herbalist Gui: Oh yes, the commission I posted. Have you already collected ten Sweet Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Herbalist Gui: Bring the Sweet Flowers straight to me as soon as you've gathered them. I'm afraid the kids can't wait any longer.

## Talk 2

Herbalist Gui: Let me have a look at what you brought. Hmm... Yes, these will do just fine.
Herbalist Gui: These are for you. Thanks for your help.
Herbalist Gui: Let's just hope those kids stay out of trouble from now on.
