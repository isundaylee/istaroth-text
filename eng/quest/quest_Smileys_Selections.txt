# Smiley's Selections


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Bacon...
Smiley Yanxiao: Yes, that's my commission. Have you already prepared two strips of Bacon?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Smiley Yanxiao: Let me know as soon as you've got the Bacon ready. That cheapskate is waiting for me to deliver him some food.

## Talk 2

Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, this Bacon should be enough. The cheapskate won't be able to eat much anyway...
Smiley Yanxiao: Oh, before I forget... Here's your payment.
