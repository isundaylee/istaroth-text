# Crash Course


## Talk 1

Kaeya: Let me show you how the Knights of Favonius conquer our adversaries!

## Talk 2

Kaeya: You've arrived.
Kaeya: Come closer. Can you smell that?
Traveler: ...I can't smell anything.
Kaeya: Something must have happened in the <color=#00E1FFFF>temple</color>.
Kaeya: I imagine there will be slimes, hilichurls, and... whatever is giving Stormterror extra power.
Kaeya: Oh yes, it is going to be lively in there indeed!
Traveler: Will it be dangerous?
Kaeya: As bustling as it may be â€” no, I can't imagine it will be dangerous at all.
Kaeya: It's a pity that the Temple of the Wolf has been disturbed by such an atrocity.
Kaeya: #Let's head in, {NICKNAME}.
Kaeya: No one makes offerings to The Four Winds anymore, yet the old winds never vanish...
Kaeya: We need to clear out the temples, for The Four Winds.
Traveler: No doubt nothing more than a disorderly mob of creatures.
Kaeya: Oh, ho-ho! You're quite the brave one, aren't you!
Traveler: It's the smell of burnt Pyro Slimes.

## Talk 3

Kaeya: You're not bad with that wind glider. Your gliding style seems familiar...
Traveler: How'd you get your eye patch?
Kaeya: My eye patch? Wanna hear my story, eh?
Kaeya: I didn't have time to introduce myself properly... Well, it wasn't on my mind to begin with.
Kaeya: Ehe... My apologies. I'm Kaeya, Cavalry Captain for the Knights of Favonius.
Kaeya: We can talk more after we get things sorted.
Kaeya: I know a great place more fit for a chat.
Traveler: Why is Jean the Acting Grand Master?
Kaeya: The Grand Master is currently off leading an expedition, so the Master, Jean, has stepped in to oversee the Knights while he's gone.
Kaeya: Hence, you'll hear many refer to her as the Acting Grand Master.
Kaeya: When the Grand Master left, he took the vast majority of our knights with him, leaving the Acting Grand Master with far more responsibility and stress.
Kaeya: Come to think of it, it must have been difficult for Jean.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Kaeya: See you later then.

## Talk 4

Kaeya: Bravo! What a performance!
Kaeya: You are, to my surprise, a well-trained knight.
Kaeya: The battles you just fought were sights to behold.
Traveler: Thanks, that's nice of you to say...
Kaeya: Haha, I see you already have the knightly virtue of modesty.
Kaeya: Stories of your heroic deeds to save Mondstadt from destruction shall be known throughout the City of Freedom, well into the future.
Kaeya: Please do visit me at our headquarters when you have the time.
Kaeya: I also know a lovely tavern, if that's more your thing.
Traveler: Not worth complimenting really...
