Traveler: New life?
Gulabgir: I used to be a snake handler in the rain forest. I recently moved to the harbor and make my living as a busker.
Gulabgir: I thought life at the port would be more convenient than wandering in the wild. Only after coming here did I find out that it's not easy for the locals here, too.
Gulabgir: In the rain forest, we were awakened by Dusk Birds early in the morning and searched for food. At the port, people get up to work alongside the sound of trumpets of the fleet.
Gulabgir: I'll never return to the simple life in the rainforest, but I shall always remember the time spent singing stories under the moon with my companions.
Gulabgir: Colorful mushrooms and fruits roasting on the fire. A rainbow-like tapestry before our eyes... Ah, good times.

Traveler: About Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Gulabgir: Isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best proof of hope?
Gulabgir: She sacrificed herself to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
Gulabgir: She may have passed away, but other lives continue to thrive on the land and in the sea.
Gulabgir: Ah... The songs that had been sung among Vanara are popping into my mind again.
Gulabgir: I should replay them next time. I'm sure to make more money with that. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Greater Lord?

Traveler: The Forest Watchers might have a problem with that.
Gulabgir: Th—They can't know it, for sure!
Gulabgir: I bumped into a long-tailed Forest Watcher once and got my noggin beaten. It really hurt!
Gulabgir: But if you think about it, it's actually quite some memory, to be dragged by rescue dogs all the way to Gandharva Ville. You should try it sometime.
Gulabgir: Just kidding! It's important to listen to the Forest Watchers for your own safety.
Gulabgir: After all, the rainforest is full of both safe ingredients that can make a delicious meal and inedible stuff one should avoid.

Traveler: Tell me more about the Dendro Archon...
Gulabgir: Ah, and isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best evidence for hope?
Gulabgir: She sacrificed her power to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
Gulabgir: She did this so that other life, whether on land or sea, might continue to thrive.
Gulabgir: Ah... The songs that had been sung among Vanara are popping into my mind again.
Gulabgir: I should perform them again next time — that'll fetch me a good sum of Mora for sure. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Dendro Archon?
