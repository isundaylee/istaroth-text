Xiangling: Hmm, there's gotta be some wild herbs around here...
Traveler: Xiangling, this gift envelope is for you.
Xiangling: #Traveler, it's you! Wow, thank you so much! It's beautiful!
Xiangling: By the way, sounds like you and Hu Tao were up to something on the night of Lantern Rite... She didn't go into detail, but it must have been big.
Xiangling: I thought we were gonna grab dinner together that night. I set up a whole table of food and everything.
Xiangling: I waited until midnight, but nobody came! So, my dad offered to wait outside while I went to bed.
Xiangling: I tried to keep watch with him, but it was late, and at that point, I couldn't keep my eyes open...
Xiangling: Then, I had a dream that Hu Tao was standing in front of me, brushing my hair with the branch of a peach blossom tree and singing some kind of weird song.
Xiangling: I wanted to grab her and ask her what was going on... But, I couldn't move or make a sound...
Xiangling: In the end, I shouted "don't you scare me, Hu Tao!", nearly flung myself off the bed, and scared my dad all at once.
Traveler: Sorry for making you worry.
Xiangling: Hah, so you admit it! Luckily, Xingqiu filled me in later. He said you were working on some kind of array.
Xiangling: That's not exactly my... thing, but it sounds complicated. By the end, you were probably so hungry you couldn't see straight!
Xiangling: Honestly, you need to start taking care of yourself! I could've at least packed you some rice buns for the road!
Xiangling: Hm... Your punishment is to eat at my place for the rest of the festival!
Traveler: See you.
Xiangling: Okay, see you around!

## Talk 1

Xiangling: Hmm, there should be some wild herbs around here...
Xiangling: #Don't forget to come eat at my place, Traveler! I need to test out some new recipes! The flavors will blow your mind — that's a promise!

## Talk 2

Lan Yan: Phew... Thank goodness everything worked out...
Traveler: Lan Yan, this gift envelope is for you.
Lan Yan: #For me? Thank you, Traveler, it's beautiful!
Traveler: Wishing you all the best in the new year.
Lan Yan: Likewise! I hope this year treats you well!
Lan Yan: Although... I'm sure you're someone who can take that into your own hands.
Lan Yan: I have no doubt that you can turn any bad situation on its head.
Traveler: I try my best.
Lan Yan: As expected of the great hero of Liyue and the esteemed guest of the Tianquan — your words exude confidence.
Lan Yan: Anyway, you and Hu Tao solved the problem with the border, and now my grandpa doesn't need to worry about getting yelled at because of his fortunes.
Lan Yan: In that sense, I guess this year's Lantern Rite was a huge success!
Lan Yan: I wish you health, success, and happiness in the new year!
Traveler: If I set my mind to it, of course.
Traveler: See you.
Lan Yan: Bye! Happy Lantern Rite!

## Talk 3

Lan Yan: Wishing you all the best for the new year!

## Talk 4

Chongyun: Maybe... I should attend an advanced cultivation session...
Traveler: Chongyun, this gift envelope is for you.
Chongyun: A gift envelope? Thank you, I'll take good care of it.
Chongyun: Apologies... I've been busy recently, so I don't have one for you in return... All I can do is offer you my wishes in person.
Traveler: I wish you all the best, as well.
Chongyun: Yes... Considering my family, I have some understanding of exorcisms and demons. But, I'm ashamed to say I never anticipated the connection between Xingqiu's great-grandfather and the problem with the boundary of life and death.
Chongyun: If I had more knowledge, or noticed something earlier, maybe you and Hu Tao wouldn't have needed to take those risks.
Chongyun: I should attend an advanced cultivation session soon...
Traveler: But, don't worry. It's been a busy time...
Traveler: See you.
Chongyun: Bye! I wish you all the best in the coming year.

## Talk 5

Chongyun: If I want to do an advanced cultivation session, I need a mentor... But who...?

## Talk 6

Xingqiu: #Traveler, perfect timing. I was just about to go look for you.
Traveler: Xingqiu, this gift envelope is for you.
Xingqiu: Thank you! Wow, your penmanship is beautiful! Much better than mine...
Xingqiu: Every Lantern Rite, the Feiyun Commerce Guild sends gift envelopes to our business partners...
Xingqiu: Great-grandpa always writes them by hand as a sign of respect. His calligraphy is a sight to behold — so sharp and elegant.
Xingqiu: In the eyes of our business partners, his envelopes are more valuable than any gift. They even frame them and put them on display.
Xingqiu: I suppose, in this case, the pen might even be mightier than gold.
Traveler: How's he feeling? Any better?
Xingqiu: Much better, thanks to you. He has enough energy to scold me for my lack of penmanship, that's for sure.
Xingqiu: He also said I should follow your example, strive to become a young hero like you...
Xingqiu: Eventually, my brother came over and distracted him so I could slip away. Otherwise, he might have nagged me until the end of time...
Traveler: You're already a young hero.
Xingqiu: Hahaha, I appreciate that, but there's no need to be so polite. It's too old-fashioned for my taste.
Xingqiu: I'll give you my gift envelope in a few days. I just need to wrap up a few things at home, and then we can grab a meal with Xiangling to celebrate.
Traveler: We can learn from each other.
Traveler: See you.
Xingqiu: See you around. The mountain roads can be dangerous, so be careful!

## Talk 7

Xingqiu: #I'll be in touch soon, Traveler! Once I finish my gift, I'll come find you.

## Talk 8

Keqing: Phew... After some fresh air, I feel a lot more awake.
Traveler: Keqing, this gift envelope is for you.
Keqing: Thank you! I was actually in the middle of making one for you!
Keqing: But, uh... As soon as I sat down, work started to pile up. In the end, I only got a few words down...
Traveler: It's the thought that counts.
Keqing: Well, you deserve something substantial, too. I'll finish it soon.
Keqing: The matter with the boundary has been resolved, and Ningguang managed to cover it up in the name of a ritual, so we don't have to worry about mass panic...
Keqing: But, we still made quite the commotion that night, enough for some nearby hunters and mountain-dwellers to take notice.
Keqing: If anyone who caught a glimpse of fetor or the array start spreading senseless rumors, we could be in trouble...
Keqing: *sigh*... Look at me, talking about all this during the holiday season. You must be tired. Here, have some dim sum — it's fresh from Xinyue Kiosk.
Keqing: I have things to discuss with Ganyu soon, but once I'm done with my envelope, I'll make sure to get it to you.
Traveler: Still occupied with work?
Traveler: See you.
Keqing: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. Goodbye!

## Talk 9

Keqing: ...How many files do I need to review? I should do a recount.

## Talk 10

Ganyu: Thank goodness Liyue is still safe and sound...
Traveler: Ganyu, this gift envelope is for you.
Ganyu: #It's lovely! Thank you, Traveler!
Ganyu: It's all thanks to you that we managed to get through this crisis.
Traveler: It was a group effort.
Ganyu: Phew... In any case, I'm glad everyone is safe.
Ganyu: Speaking of which, how are you holding up? Any tiredness or pain?
Traveler: I'm doing fine, thank you.
Ganyu: I'm glad... When Keqing and I heard that Director Hu had to carry you to Bubu Pharmacy — that you were unconscious — we rushed over there immediately.
Ganyu: Thankfully, Baizhu reassured us it was just exhaustion. It was a huge relief.
Ganyu: Still, you should be careful. If you feel unwell over the next few days, come find me, and I'll take you to see Cloud Retainer.
Ganyu: She may not be known for her skill in medicine, but the adepti are knowledgeable and resourceful in all kinds of fields, so I'm sure she can help!
Traveler: See you.
Ganyu: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. See you later!

## Talk 11

Ganyu: #If you feel unwell over the next few days, Traveler, come find me, and I'll ask Cloud Retainer to take a look at you.

## Talk 12

Ningguang: The worst is over, and now... I can relax.
Traveler: Ningguang, this gift envelope is for you.
Ningguang: Thank you. Ah, just as expected — it's exquisite!
Ningguang: The fetor problem could have had grave consequences. But, thanks to you and Director Hu, we were able to resolve it without issue.
Ningguang: Allow me to thank you again on behalf of all Liyue Harbor.
Ningguang: Many in this world claim to be heroic, but it takes a true hero to step forward in times of crisis.
Ningguang: Liyue Harbor is truly fortunate to have received the help of so many heroes.
Ningguang: ...Anyway, I won't force you to listen to my compliments any longer. I want you to actually enjoy the festivities — that includes the food, too.
Ningguang: The crisis is over, so take it easy and make the most of the festival.
Traveler: See you.
Ningguang: Goodbye. I hope you a have a relaxing Lantern Rite.

## Talk 13

Ningguang: Now, to deal with the aftermath...

## Talk 14

Beidou: Phew... It's almost time to head back to the ship.
Traveler: Beidou, this gift envelope is for you.
Beidou: Haha, not too shabby! I like the style, and nice penmanship!
Beidou: #Looks like your skill with a pen is just as good as your skill with a blade, Traveler!
Traveler: I'm just glad that everyone is safe.
Beidou: Haha, with your help, that's practically a guarantee!
Beidou: I'm not the only one impressed by your feats. My crew is dying to have a drink with you.
Traveler: My tolerance isn't that high, I fear...
Beidou: Don't worry — I already got 'em off your back.
Beidou: You're fierce on the battlefield. But, when it comes to alcohol, my crew would drink you under the table.
Beidou: Still, you should join us for a meal when you're free — I'll host.
Beidou: In the meantime... I've gotta get back to the ship. I just received payment from the Tianquan, so it's time to divide it among the crew.
Beidou: Once I do that, I'll start prepping our feast! I'll be in touch.
Beidou: No backing out, you hear?
Traveler: See you around.
Beidou: See ya! I'll get everything ready for the feast, so no backing out!

## Talk 15

Beidou: Hm, I've kept the crew waiting too long... I should get back.

## Talk 16

Baizhu: This medicine is all set... I'll have Herbalist Gui deliver it in a bit.
Traveler: Baizhu, this gift envelope is for you.
Baizhu: That's very considerate, thank you. How have you been feeling the past few days?
Traveler: All good, thanks to your miraculous skills.
Baizhu: There was nothing miraculous about it — simple medical treatment, nothing more.
Baizhu: Your constitution is strong. You were covered in fetor, but your cardiovascular system remained unaffected.
Baizhu: The real miracle is the fact that you walked away from the array with no lasting damage... *cough* *cough*
Traveler: Are you okay? Please have some water.
Baizhu: *cough*... *cough*... Don't worry, it's just exhaustion — I stayed up all night writing prescriptions.
Baizhu (Changsheng): *sigh* Which is exactly why you need a break. Relax, or your body will pay the price.
Baizhu: Hehe, there's no need to worry. I know what I'm doing.
Baizhu: Come find me if you begin to feel unwell. I can provide you with some restorative medicine.
Baizhu: Never forget — even minor symptoms can be important warning signs.
Baizhu (Changsheng): How about taking your own advice? Staying up all night — you need some restorative medicine of your own.
Baizhu: It's alright, Changsheng. I know what I'm doing.
Traveler: Did you use Changsheng's secret art again?
Traveler: I'm feeling just fine!
Baizhu: That's good to hear. Standard medical texts offer little information on the treatment of fetor. I had to rely on ordinary methods.
Traveler: See you.
Baizhu: Take care! Now that the crisis is over, you should get some rest and enjoy the festivities.

## Talk 17

Baizhu: Come find me if you begin to feel unwell. I can provide you with some restorative medicine.
Baizhu: Even minor symptoms can be important warning signs. Remember that.

## Talk 18

Xiao: You're here.
Traveler: Xiao, this gift envelope is for you.
Xiao: ...Thank you.
Xiao: Your breathing is steady, and your footsteps are light — looks like you made a full recovery.
Xiao: Still, your actions were too reckless. You should reflect on your lack of regard for your safety...
Traveler: Well, it was an emergency...
Xiao: I wasn't there in the moment, but through the witness sigil, I was able to sense your actions.
Xiao: I could tell you entered the array and took on the force of the blast on behalf of the young girl from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Xiao: ...
Traveler: I got through just fine.
Xiao: In any case, I'm glad you were unharmed.
Xiao: ...Now, I can put my worries to rest.
Xiao: Monsters driven mad by fetor could still attack, so I should patrol the area.
Xiao: If you run into trouble...
Traveler: I'll call your name.
Xiao: Alright, take care.
Traveler: I'll leave the patrolling to you.
Traveler: Baizhu's medicine is quite effective.
Traveler: Ah, so you found out...
Traveler: See you.
Xiao: Take care.

## Talk 19

Xiao: If anything happens, remember to call my name.

## Talk 20

Zhongli: What fine tea...
Traveler: Zhongli, this gift envelope is for you.
Zhongli: Thank you. You're here at the perfect time — Director Hu brought me a pack of premium, aged "Iron Vermillion." It just finished steeping.
Traveler: Thank you for the hint earlier.
Zhongli: Hah, your thanks are unnecessary — it was your sharpness of mind that put it to good use.
Zhongli: Many deserve thanks on this occasion — Director Hu for her steadfastness, the Ministry of Civil Affairs for their leadership...
Zhongli: As a consultant, all I did was help Director Hu prepare a few gift envelopes and fortune coins.
Zhongli: Not to mention, we have you to thank for Director Hu's safe return. So, if anyone is to offer thanks, that person should be me.
Traveler: Huh? Is that how it is?
Zhongli: #The tea is ready, Traveler. Please, have the first cup and indulge me with stories about your recent endeavors.
Traveler: How did you... make this about me?
Traveler: See you.
Zhongli: May you have a blessed Lantern Rite. Take care!

## Talk 21

Zhongli: Care for some tea? I'm quite curious about your recent endeavors.

## Talk 22

Amber: Ooh, where should I go next? This whole place is so lively...
Traveler: Amber, this gift envelope is for you.
Amber: Wow, a gift envelope! Thank you! I heard the people of Liyue exchange them during Lantern Rite as blessings.
Amber: It's beautiful! I'll take good care of it.
Traveler: Are you here for the festival, specifically?
Amber: Sure am! Jean said we worked really hard this year. She thinks we all deserve a break, so she set up a rotating calendar for us to take time off.
Amber: Eula and I got our turn the last couple of days, so we came to Liyue Harbor as soon as we heard about the festivities.
Traveler: No lack of hustle and bustle — or fun things to do — on the streets, huh?
Amber: Yep! We spent a lot of time roaming around the city. We just split up so we could go get souvenirs for everyone at the Knights of Favonius.
Amber: I bought a ton of stuff! A fan for Jean, a teacup for Lisa, a kite for Klee...
Amber: Oh and, this is for you! Grilled Tiger Fish — it's super delicious. Here, try some! I just bought it, so it's still warm!
Amber: Hurry, before it gets cold! I'm gonna keep shopping, okay?
Amber: Fan, teacup, kite... What am I missing? Oh, right! Jewelry...
Traveler: See you.
Amber: See ya! Come find me the next time you're in Mondstadt!

## Talk 23

Amber: Hey... you know what? We could just glide to Mondstadt right now...

## Talk 24

Eula: This should be enough...
Traveler: Eula, this gift envelope is for you.
Eula: #This is... for me? Thank you, Traveler! This is the first time I've received something like this.
Eula: I didn't expect to run into you here. Amber and I just split up to go shopping. We're bringing back gifts for everyone at the Knights of Favonius.
Traveler: What did you get?
Eula: Some small trinkets and toys. Oh, and some tea for Jean. It's from Qiaoying Village.
Eula: I heard that tea also has an energizing effect, so I thought it might be a nice change of pace for her.
Eula: Still, the brewing process for this kind of tea is pretty complicated. The vendor had to spend a lot of time explaining it to me.
Eula: Thankfully, I already knew a bit about tea etiquette, so I caught on relatively quick.
Eula: Here, this tea cake is for you — it's from Qiaoying Village. Amber really liked it, so I decided to buy some.
Eula: We're going to check out the Mingxiao Lantern later. Maybe we'll ask someone to take a picture for us.
Eula: I would do it myself, but unfortunately, neither of us brought a Kamera.
Traveler: See you.
Eula: Goodbye! Happy Lantern Rite!

## Talk 25

Eula: Too bad we didn't bring a Kamera...

## Talk 26

Yoimiya: This lantern is so pretty...
Traveler: Yoimiya, this gift envelope is for you.
Yoimiya: Wow, so this is a gift envelope... So pretty! Thank you, it's going straight into my collection!
Yoimiya: Seeing you here, getting this gift... Guess it was worth the trip after all!
Traveler: Huh. Was this not a good enough time for you?
Yoimiya: No no, it's not that! The food is delicious, and there are so many fun things to do. It's just...
Yoimiya: *sigh* I heard, during previous Lantern Rites, there were huge firework shows or tons of Xiao Lanterns.
Yoimiya: But, not this time. I thought that huge tree-like lantern might shoot out fireworks at any moment...
Yoimiya: Still, Lady Tianquan's ritual was super impressive, and the lights were beautiful.
Yoimiya: Hehe, at the next festival in Inazuma, I'm gonna put on a giant light show, too!
Yoimiya: I'll let you know ahead of time and save you the best seat in the house, so don't miss out!
Traveler: See you.
Yoimiya: Yep, see ya!

## Talk 27

Yoimiya: These lanterns are so pretty. I wonder how they're made...

## Talk 28

Cyno: Gift envelopes, hmm... gift envelopes...
Traveler: Cyno, this gift envelope is for you.
Cyno: Thank you. Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Uhh... Same to you?
Cyno: Hm.
Cyno: What's with the look on your face?
Traveler: You seem... quiet today.
Cyno: No, not at all.
Cyno: I'm just following local customs.
Traveler: ...Huh?
Cyno: Well, considering your gift...
Cyno: I thought it best not to... "push the envelope"...
Traveler: Wh—What local customs?
Traveler: Did you have a bad time?
Traveler: See you....
Cyno: Take care.

## Talk 29

Cyno: I hear, the more envelopes you receive, the more luck you have in the new year. Do you know why?
Traveler: I—I'm not sure I really want to ask...
Cyno: Well, because when that happens...
Cyno: The cards are really stacked in your favor.
Traveler: Well... I hope the cards are stacked in your favor this year, Cyno.
Cyno: #Thank you, Traveler. With the way I play? Always.
Traveler: But okay... why?

## Talk 30

Tighnari: What should I get...?
Traveler: Tighnari, this gift envelope is for you.
Tighnari: #Ah, I didn't expect to see you here, Traveler. Thank you for the envelope — it's lovely.
Traveler: Enjoying the festival?
Tighnari: Cyno and I have had a great time. We ate a lot of delicious food and bought quite a few gifts.
Tighnari: Unfortunately, the Harbor is a little too busy this time of year. If I stay around the commotion for too long, my ears start to hurt.
Tighnari: So, I came over here for a break.
Tighnari: Cyno said he needed to be alone for a while to think about something.
Traveler: Oh... a case of some sort?
Tighnari: No, I don't think so...
Tighnari: He kept mumbling about "gift envelopes," so odds are, he's trying to come up with a new joke...
Tighnari: How do you even make a joke out of something like that...?
Traveler: Something to do with work?
Traveler: See you later, then.
Tighnari: Bye! I'm going to look for Cyno. *sigh* Let's hope he's not feeling too inspired today...

## Talk 31

Tighnari: Thanks for the envelope — it's lovely. I'll take good care of it.

## Talk 32

Tighnari: What should I get...?
Traveler: Tighnari, this gift envelope is for you.
Tighnari: #Ah, I didn't expect to see you here, Traveler. Thank you for the envelope — it's lovely.
Traveler: Enjoying the festival?
Tighnari: Cyno and I have had a great time. We ate a lot of delicious food and bought quite a few gifts.
Tighnari: Unfortunately, the Harbor is a little too busy this time of year. If I stay around the commotion for too long, my ears start to hurt.
Tighnari: So, I came over here for a break.
Tighnari: Cyno said he needed to be alone for a while to think about something.
Traveler: He... came up with another joke...
Black Screen Text: You tell Tighnari all about Cyno's envelope joke...
Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: *sigh* No surprise there...
Tighnari: #Thanks for the warning, Traveler. At least I can mentally prepare myself this time...
Tighnari: Thanks again for the envelope — it's lovely. I'll take good care of it.
Traveler: See you.
Tighnari: Bye! I'm going to look for Cyno. *sigh* Let's hope he's not feeling too inspired today...

## Talk 33

Chiori: The design of this lantern is exquisite... Definitely worth the trip.
Traveler: Chiori, this gift envelope is for you.
Chiori: Oh, for me? Thank you.
Chiori: Ah... Lovely detail around the border. Looks like you put a lot of care into this — thank you, I'll take good care of it.
Chiori: By the way, do you know who designed this lantern?
Chiori: It's beautiful, and the way the light shines through is so imaginative.
Chiori: I wonder if the design took inspiration from some of Liyue's ancient legends... I feel like I've seen similar patterns in a book before.
Chiori: I'd love to speak with the person who made it. I might even get some ideas for a new collection along the way...
Chiori: Alright, I'm going to ask around.
Traveler: See you.
Chiori: Take care.

## Talk 34

Chiori: Huh... Which ancient legend is referenced in this design?

## Talk 35

Charlotte: Weird... Why can't I find any clues?
Traveler: Charlotte, this gift envelope is—
Charlotte: Huh? OH! Great Hero of Liyue! Perfect timing!
Charlotte: C'mon, I have so much to ask you! Don't worry — completely off the record...
Traveler: I—I'm just here to give you a gift envelope!
Charlotte: Ah, thank you for this — it's beautiful. Now, onto the real business at hand.
Charlotte: You know about the ritual Lady Tianquan conducted, right?
Charlotte: I've asked around, and everyone says it's one of this land's traditional ceremonies. But, I also heard it hasn't been performed in a long time.
Charlotte: Not to mention, as the ritual was starting, I saw a flock of birds scatter in the mountains near the harbor, and a strange light coming from the forest...
Traveler: How did you see that?
Charlotte: Ah, it's all thanks to my Kamera. I bought an ultra-telephoto lens not too long ago — definitely came in handy just now!
Charlotte: Unfortunately, it was super dark, so the photos are too blurry to make out anything...
Charlotte: #That's why I was hoping you could fill me in, Traveler. Is there anything you can tell me? Doesn't have to be right now — you can write me a letter if you remember something...
Charlotte: Here, take this. Think of it as... an advance.
Charlotte: I'll treat you to a meal back in Fontaine, too! How does that sound?
Traveler: Did you walk over there?
Traveler: D—Don't smile at me like that!
Traveler: Yeah. I'll, ah, see you around, I guess?
Charlotte: Bye! I'm going to ask around some more...

## Talk 36

Charlotte: Next time you're in Fontaine, I'll treat you to a meal!

## Talk 37

Nervous An: Hmm... What should I write on this gift envelope...
Nervous An: Ugh, what is this? When I'm up to my eyebrows in work, bright ideas cling to me like dead skin, but now that the festive season's upon us, they've all sloughed off and fled for the hills!
Nervous An: I was going to ask some Linling for some special ideas, but... You know what, I'd rather find a book of this year's popular festive phrases and just copy that.
Nervous An: Forget it, there's still some time. I can just... find some work for which I can apply overtime. Maybe that'll bring the inspiration rushing right back.

## Talk 38

Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask him for some fortune coins?
Changchang: My friends and I have already done some fortune coin swaps. Seems like there are only ten or so varieties...
Changchang: Daddy's gone off to a far away place, so there's gotta be some different ones over there, right?
Changchang: Of course, I shan't be writing him just some ordinary letter either. It's gotta be a gift, uh... Ugh, what did they call it again...
Changchang: Anyway, it'll be a letter full of words that bring blessings!

### Talk 38 related talk 0

Traveler: About Silk Flowers...
Changchang: Huh? Did you see that thing I wrote? Wow, that worked better than I thought...
Changchang: So did you already finish gathering three Silk Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Changchang: Okay... But remember to bring them right back to me as soon as you've got 'em. I'm going to make a pretty garland.

## Talk 39

Musheng: Heh, doubtless, the city is more festive.
Musheng: The heroes we commemorate during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: If you have heard the new opera that's out this year, you should know about the "Sanctification of Tao Dou."
Musheng: I was just thinking... Since Rex Lapis is both a god and The Prime of Adepti, isn't it possible that there'd be other gods amongst the adepti...?
Musheng: Of course, the "Eight Adepts" this time have more mortals amongst them than adepti, hah.
Musheng: Still, no matter who you are, good heroes from all walks of life, please watch over us here in Liyue, and grant us your blessings!

## Talk 40

Vlad: Um... Have you figured it out yet?
Nadia: Hmm... I'm afraid not.
Nadia: I've been working here for a long time, but Liyue's local sayings are still a mystery to me.
Vlad: That's true. Makes you wonder, doesn't it — why would you sometimes use "wealth" as part of will-wishes, and sometimes as an invective...?
Nadia: ...I'd say we'd be better off not dwelling on that.
Nadia: I mean, something like "love" is expressed in many different languages, but the meaning that we mean to convey is the same, isn't it?
Vlad: Yes, you're right, of course. You know what? That's a good line — wouldn't look out of place on a gift envelope at all, I'd say!

## Talk 41

Kun: Ah, Liyue Harbor sure is livelier now that the ceremony's over.
Kun: I heard some gossip that the start of this year was an unlucky time, which had something to do with many people falling ill. Even had me feeling nervous back there.
Kun: But as it turns out, it wasn't a big deal after all, eh?
Kun: I've heard that the ceremony this time was a most important one, requiring in-person attention from skilled adepts of many different specialties. So forget a normal year, the one to come's going to be a blast for sure!

## Talk 42

Hongyu: Hah, would you look at all this newness around us? So long as enough people participate in any activity, even those who weren't interested to start with will get sucked in, like moths to a flame.
Hongyu: I mean, just look at the gift envelopes at the fair.
Hongyu: In previous years, people would just buy them ready-made for exchange with family and friends, but now that there's a stand at which you can make 'em yourself, even those of us least fond of books are getting in on the action.
Hongyu: Of course, watching them scratching their heads trying to figure out some nice words to pen down is pretty funny. But I reckon that you can write anything you want, as long as it comes from the heart.

## Talk 43

Clerk Zhao: Phew. Lantern Rite sure is a tiring time. Best I go get some rest...
Clerk Zhao: But a strange anxiety seems to take me whenever I stop...
Clerk Zhao: I had to prepare so many extra ritual supplies this year on top of last years' items... My workflow is getting real stretched here.
Clerk Zhao: The longer my list of tasks, the more stressed I get, so I've got to hurry and shorten it as soon as possible...

## Talk 44

Yong'an: Hello. I... you... cat... ATCHOO!
Yong'an: I'm sorry... For some reason, every cat and dog in Liyue Harbor got all antsy over the last few days, running around and yelping from morning till night...
Yong'an: It's gotten better most recently, but my allergy is still... ATCHOO! Sorry... ATCHOO!

## Talk 45

Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't an old friend. Did you come all this way just to see me?
Ying'er: Oh, I kid. But really, you do look so lovely each time we meet.
Ying'er: I heard about the ceremony. I meant to ask if things went well, were we to meet, but your mood tells me they did.
Ying'er: The danger is past, blessings lie ahead. Of course, things may not turn out smoothly throughout the year, but the best is yet to be, wouldn't you say?

Minglan: #Would you like to participate in a martial arts demonstration, Traveler?
Traveler: I'd love to give it a try!
Minglan: Great. In that case, please, follow me.
Traveler: Let me think it over first...
Minglan: That's alright. Just let me know when you want to give it a whirl. I'm sure the Sergeant would be more than happy to have you.

Yaolu: Sorry! "Immortal Combat" isn't quite ready yet, so please come back later.

## Talk 48

Weijin: Oh wow... Is it just me, or are there a lot more guests arriving to enjoy Lantern Rite than last year...?
Traveler: And what exactly is this stall?
Weijin: Hello there! This is the "Gift Envelope Consultancy" specially set up by the Ministry of Civil Affairs!
Weijin: Do you know about gift envelopes? They are a tradition here in Liyue.
Weijin: We make them every Lantern Rite and give them to our family and friends, sending them our best wishes.
Weijin: I'm sure you've seen that lots of tourists from other nations have arrived for this year's Lantern Rite, yes?
Weijin: They're interested in gift envelopes, and they all want to give the tradition a try themselves... But understandably, they don't know the first thing about making them.
Weijin: In response, the Ministry has sent me here to set up the Consultancy... on account of my penmanship, I guess?
Weijin: Whether you want to make a gift envelope to send good wishes to kith and kin, or if you'd like to leave a commemorative envelope for yourself, you can come seek me out for help.
Weijin: I can even help add Guyan Sigils to your envelope, or perhaps draw some patterns onto it... In these things and more, I shall help you as far as I am able.
Traveler: Do many people come to you for help?
Weijin: Oh, lots. So many foreign guests have come in to have envelopes written up that I've had to get a new notepad just to record all their names.
Weijin: But there are just way too many clients. Apart from those who request that I write everything for them, there are also many who ask for suggestions for their well-wishes...
Weijin: I'd love to have someone to help me out here, but I am well aware the Ministry has no spare manpower during Lantern Rite.
Weijin: If you don't mind, could you help me look at the requests that I recorded on my pad? If you could help me settle some of these commissions, that would be better still...
Traveler: Let me see...
Weijin: Wonderful! Thank you for your help. Please, have a look at these commissions.
Traveler: I've got other things going on right now...
Weijin: That's fine. If you're willing, you can swing by later as well. I'll be here manning the counter in the meantime.

## Talk 49

Yaolu: Hey there! Would you like to try your hand at "Immortal Combat"?
Traveler: Let's do it!
Traveler: What's "Immortal Combat"?
Yaolu: Simply put, this is a game where rattan figures will engage in combat under our command. This is a game with quite the long history on our end.
Yaolu: In the past, we would fashion our own little rattan figures, control them, and pit them in combat against one another.
Yaolu: Some veteran players could even have them perform real swordplay.
Yaolu: But later... Well, everyone found more fun things to play with, so this game fell to the wayside, with the rattan figures becoming purely commemorative items.
Yaolu: But when I was little, I loved these little rattan figures. I would pester my family members to play with me, or help me make more figures.
Yaolu: The ones my grandma made? Those were fantastic — she taught me everything I know about making them.
Yaolu: Grandpa was skilled in crafts, and he'd use wood to carve all sorts of awesome weapons, arming my rattan figures to the teeth with them.
Yaolu: My parents, too, would always find time to play with me no matter how busy they were...
Yaolu: And who knows? Perhaps the rattan figures I'd always put on my desk came to the Ministry of Civil Affairs's notice eventually...
Yaolu: And that might be why they opened up a booth related to the figures... which is, of course, "Immortal Combat."
Yaolu: You can be sure that I volunteered myself to take charge of it the moment I heard the news — and they agreed.
Yaolu: So, would you like to give it a try? Trust me, it's great fun! Not to mention how each of them was fashioned by Lan Yan herself, and she's a real pro!
Traveler: I don't have time at the moment...
Yaolu: Don't worry. Just go ahead and take care of whatever you need to, and come down to the booth whenever you feel like playing.
