# When the West Wind Arises


## Talk 1

Traveler: Is something wrong, Sara?
Traveler: Sorry, I already ate.
Sara: Ah, finally, I caught you!
Sara: Oh, I'm not after your patronage.
Sara: I have something I'd like the Knights of Favonius to do for me, and I want you to pass on my request to the Acting Grand Master.
Paimon: Oh, so it's Jean you were really hoping to see.
Traveler: We're like peas in a pod.
Traveler: We've met.
Traveler: I'm her loyal slave.
Sara: You are close with her?
Sara: Really? It must be a good feeling knowing Jean's got your back.
Sara: Well, I heard she has a lot of respect for you.
Sara: Slave!? I never knew that such antiquated and aristocratic practices existed in the Knights of Favonius!
Paimon: #Ahem, sorry, Traveler just has a weird sense of humor.
Paimon: ...Anyway, what was it you wanted us to tell Jean?
Sara: Oh yes... I must apologize for being unable to visit the Knights in person, but the restaurant has been so busy lately.
Sara: Unfortunately, it's right in this busy season that the route between here and Springvale, which is used for the delivery of our ingredients, seems to have been occupied by the hilichurls.
Traveler: So you want the Knights to clear the road.
Traveler: So you want someone to teach those hunters a lesson.
Sara: The problem is that the suppliers in Springvale say that deliveries have nothing to do with them, they're just responsible for selling us the ingredients.
Sara: That would be great.
Paimon: What? No! How is that going to help!?
Traveler: Sure.
Sara: Please *ask Master Jean* to send a party to clear out the hilichurls from the road to Springvale.
Sara: Phew, help at last. With Jean on the case, this'll be solved in no time. Thank you.
Paimon: Seems like everyone really trusts Jean.
Sara: Oh, I nearly forgot. *Charles the bartender* said he's been having some trouble, too.
Sara: Why don't you stop by and see him on the way?
Paimon: Fine. In for a penny, in for a pound is the Paimon way... but this is really stretching the definition of "on the way" in my opinion.

## Talk 2

Charles: What do you think this is, kiddo, a fruit juice store?
Paimon: Hmph. How rude! Especially since we're here to HELP!
Charles: Help? Oh yes, you're the Acting Grand Master's new hotshot helper, aren't you?
Paimon: Uh... That's one way of putting it, but—
Charles: Great. Tell Jean I need my quarterly tax return forms then.
Charles: It's time to get Elzer onto doing the accounts again... I must say though, the tax rate on alcohol in Mondstadt is pretty steep.
Traveler: Do you really need to get Jean involved with stuff like this?
Traveler: And yet the Dawn Winery is somehow so very rich.
Charles: That's mostly down to Master Diluc's successful business model.
Paimon: Why are the accounts with Jean? Does she do bookkeeping now too?
Charles: Acting Grand Master Jean personally goes over all the accounts.
Charles: After all, the wine industry is Mondstadt's main source of income. Jean takes great pains to make sure no detail is overlooked.
Paimon: Paimon never knew that. Jean's job is even harder than it seems.
Charles: The Acting Grand Master's hard work indeed makes our lives a whole lot easier.
Charles: We're certainly very lucky, but... to put it bluntly, we just take it for granted that that's the norm now.
Paimon: Wow... How do you sleep at night knowing how much pressure you put Jean under?
Charles: *sigh* When you put it like that I do feel quite ashamed... I suppose I should give her one on the house next time she's here.
Charles: Although... I doubt the Acting Grand Master even has the time to spare for that.
Paimon: Sounds like a poor excuse to deny Jean a free drink...
Paimon: #Come on Traveler, let's *go and see Jean*.

## Talk 3

Margaret: Hey, you two!
Paimon: Margaret! What are you doing here?
Margaret: My cat's gone missing. Have you seen it?
Traveler: No.
Traveler: You mean... Diona?
Margaret: No, not her. I imagine Diona's probably still in the tavern.
Margaret: I mean little Princey. Prince was just home, now he's gone.
Paimon: Did you seriously think Diona was a house cat!?
Margaret: This is a bit worrying. What if Prince can't find his way home?
Traveler: I would love to help, but...
Paimon: But we are on our way to an urgent meeting with Jean. Sorry.
Traveler: I guess we can have a look for your cat.
Paimon: #Naw, Traveler. You're always such a big softie. But aren't we in the middle of something?
Paimon: Sara and Charles need our help urgently, too. Let's go and see Jean first.
Margaret: You're on the way to see Jean? What a coincidence.
Paimon: Paimon thought you were looking for a cat?
Margaret: Yes, I wanted to see if Jean could help look for my cat.
Paimon: Seriously? You want Jean... to help you look for your cat?
Margaret: What's wrong with that?
Margaret: Jean's a really nice person.
Traveler: Such a solid line of reasoning...
Traveler: I feel like this is a classic case of "good people finish last."
Margaret: Please mention it to Jean for me. I'll treat you to a brew at Cat's Tail later.
Paimon: Hey, HEY!
Paimon: Ugh, unbelievable! Guess the case of Prince the missing cat is now added to the agenda for our meeting with Jean.

## Talk 4

Jean: *cough*...
Paimon: Acting Grand Master—
Jean: ...
Paimon: Oh, ahh— Master Jean?
Jean: ...
Traveler: ...Master Jean?
Traveler: Hey, Jean? Jeany Jean-Jean?
Traveler: ...Behold, the Dandelion Knight herself?
Jean: Oh! It's our Honorary Knight. Sorry, I must have been daydreaming.
Jean: How can I assist?
Paimon: Actually, it's not us who need your help. It's a bunch of other people...
Jean: I see. Well, thank you for your service to the people of Mondstadt. *cough*
Jean: I have made a note of these commissions in my files and I will... make arrangements...
Jean: ...accordingly.
Paimon: Great.
Paimon: We didn't miss out anyone's commissions, did we?
Paimon: Sara's hilichurls, Charles' tax return, Margaret's cat... Seems that's everything.
Paimon: We'll be on our way then, Jean— Jean?
Paimon: Jean! Are you okay!?

## Talk 5

Paimon: How's Jean holding up? Is it serious?
Barbara: It's just burnout from work stress. She'll be fine after a good old rest.
Barbara: Thanks for bringing her here — she may have tried to keep soldiering on otherwise.
Paimon: It's not a surprise though, she does have a lot to get through every day.
Barbara: Poor Jean. She has always been one to push herself too hard while overlooking her own needs.
Barbara: This isn't the first time something like this has happened.
Traveler: She really has it tough doesn't she. Poor Jean.
Traveler: Seems like you really care about Jean.
Barbara: Oh, ah... You think so? I—I mean, she's the Acting Grand Master and all, we can't have her collapsing all the time now can we...
Barbara: S—So y'know, it's not like this is a personal... thing, it's just out of love for— concern for... the greater good! Yes, that's it!
Paimon: What's up with Barbara... Weird~
Barbara: #...Anyway, you're an honorary knight, aren't you Traveler?
Barbara: While the Master is down, the knights should share her burden, no?
Paimon: That's a very good point, but... Shouldn't one of the fully-qualified knights do that?
Barbara: Jean has so much to do, an extra pair of hands can't hurt.
Barbara: You should go and check in at the *headquarters*. Jean will be fine with just me here.
Paimon: Paimon feels like she's trying to get rid of us...
Barbara: Hmm?
Paimon: #Nothing! We'll leave you to it — come on Traveler, let's go.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Oh, it's Kaeya.
Kaeya: I've been waiting for you.
Kaeya: I have been informed about Jean falling ill. On behalf of all of the Knights of Favonius, allow me to express my sincere gratitude for your assistance.
Paimon: So courteous and polite. This isn't the Kaeya Paimon knows.
Kaeya: Haha... Well, the circumstances warrant it. This is the Acting Grand Master herself we're talking about.
Kaeya: Now, in addition to that thank-you message, there was one other thing...
Traveler: You have a job for us?
Kaeya: It's like you read my mind! We have quite a connection, don't you think?
Traveler: Is this the part where you give us our reward?
Kaeya: Hahaha. I must say I like your style.
Kaeya: But before we can discuss a reward, there are some things I hope you can assist the Knights with.
Paimon: Things like helping to fill in for Jean?
Kaeya: Right. Although the commissions you reported to Jean have already been handed off to someone else...
Kaeya: ...I am concerned that they will not be handled with due care without Jean's personal touch.
Kaeya: So I am hoping that you can help out where you see fit.
Kaeya: I will feel much more at ease knowing that the Honorary Knight is personally overseeing these cases.
Paimon: #You can flatter Traveler all you want, but answer me this — why don't YOU do it!?
Kaeya: Haha... Oh, I have far more important matters to attend to. There are so many things to... to prepare.
Paimon: Hmph. Fine then. So it's *Sara, Charles and Margaret's* stuff you want us to help with, right?
Kaeya: Those are the ones. I appreciate the help. See you later!

## Talk 7

Sara: The customers are getting hungry. Please be quick.

## Talk 8

Charles: Jean's overworked? Yes, relatively speaking you guys have a lot more time on your hands.

## Talk 9

Margaret: Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. It's a black cat you're looking for.

## Talk 10

Barbara: I already told you, I can take care of Jean on my own. Please help Jean out by completing her tasks.
