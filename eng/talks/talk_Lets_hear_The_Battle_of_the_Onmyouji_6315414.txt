Traveler: Let's hear "The Battle of the Onmyouji."
Saimon Eri: The mischievous tanuki are a part of this story as well.
Saimon Eri: The nosy tanuki are always out and about with their pranks. But one day, they finally messed with someone they shouldn't have.

Saimon Eri: The poor little tanuki were no match for the great Onmyouji... In the end, all the tanuki were sealed inside Chinju Forest.
Saimon Eri: So if you ever hear strange voices in the forest, it might be the tanuki saying "Help me~ Heeeelp me~~"...
