# Hurdle


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's a storm *barrier*!
Paimon: It looks so dangerous...
Venti: Let me at it.
Venti: Although this wooden lyre is all I have...
Venti: I don't need the lyre to break through this kind of storm barriâ€” Ah, wait, what is that?
Jean: Enemy attack! Prepare yourselves!

## Talk 2

Venti: Ahh...
Venti: The hilichurls usually do not venture into areas with high elemental concentrations.
Venti: It puts a heavy burden on their bodies.
Diluc: The Abyss Order must be manipulating them behind the scenes, yet they shouldn't have been able to determine that we would come.
Diluc: They're presumably spreading their forces to halt our plans.
Venti: Without further ado...
Venti: I suppose I can play faster if my only audience is the wind.

## Talk 3

Paimon: It actually opened! You're not entirely useless, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Jean: This is it. We are now entering *Stormterror's Lair*.
Jean: Watch yourselves. Let's move.
