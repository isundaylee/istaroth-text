Traveler: How do you like it here?
Shenhe: To be honest, I had originally expected this place to be like an adeptus's abode...
Shenhe: I never suspected that your design would differ so greatly from what I had imagined.
Traveler: If you had to pick, would you prefer an adeptus's abode or here?
Shenhe: Hmm, most adepti spend their years wandering the outside world. Though their abodes can be uniquely picturesque, they also feel like a lonely and remote paradise.
Shenhe: But here feels very warm and cozy, and I have a nice person like you to keep me company. I've truly never experienced anything like this.
Shenhe: What I mean is... I like it here. I will cherish this place and learn to adapt to life here.
Traveler: Alright, that's good to hear.
Shenhe: However... there are many pieces of decoration and furniture here that I've never seen before. I'm uncertain of their use or purpose.
Shenhe: So please take a moment to explain everything to me when you could spare the time.
