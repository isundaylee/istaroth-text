# Food Delivery


## Talk 1

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Traveler! Perfect timing...
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry, but could you do something for me?
Sara: There's been a steady increase in volume of delivery orders recently. I tend to divide them up by region and then label each dish with the name of the person who ordered it.
Sara: But I've lost the label for this *Calla Lily Seafood Soup*. All I know is that it's for someone in Springvale.
Sara: Could you take this *Calla Lily Seafood Soup* over to Springvale for me and find out who ordered it?
Traveler: I guess, but...
Sara: Rest assured there'll be a hearty meal waiting for you on your return!
Sara: I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

## Talk 2

Sara: Deliver meal fee
Sara: You're back! Did you manage to deliver it?
Traveler: Here's the fee.
Sara: Let me check... Perfect! Thanks!
Sara: Here, this *Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake* is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Excuse me, did you order takeout?
Terrified Schuster: Wow, that was fast. I thought it would take longer.
Terrified Schuster: Here's what I owe you. Mmm, smells gooood!
Terrified Schuster: I mustn't go adventuring on an empty stomach. Now, I'm going to savor every last bite of this...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Sorry to bother you â€” did you order takeout?
Terrified Schuster: I did! ...Oh, but this one isn't mine.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Hello there. Is this your food?
Timid Morrow: Um... is it Calla Lily Seafood Soup?
Timid Morrow: Yay, it is mine then. But I'm not sure what took you so long...
Timid Morrow: Any later and Draff would have dragged me out on a hunt by now.
Timid Morrow: Ugh, whatever. Here's your money. Now get outta here, let me eat my food in peace.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Hello, did you order food?
Timid Morrow: Um... Not this, this one isn't mine.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Excuse me, did you order some takeout?
Reckless Pallad: Yes, a long time ago! Took you long enough! There'll be no treasure left if I wait much longer.
Reckless Pallad: Mmm, this does smell delicious though...
Reckless Pallad: Well, I guess good food is also a treasure worth waiting for. I'm sure I've got time to eat before treasure hunting.
Reckless Pallad: Thank you. Here's the cash.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Takeout, get your takeout here...
Reckless Pallad: Takeout? Not mine.

## Talk 9
