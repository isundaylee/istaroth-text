# The Art of Cooking


## Talk 1

Lynn: What should I cook next...?
Lynn: Oh, are you travelers from around here as well?
Paimon: No, we just happen to be passing by. *sniff* *sniff* What are you cooking? Smells good!
Lynn: I see. Welcome, travelers!
Lynn: I'm Lynn, the survival expert of the Adventurers' Guild. As you can see, I'm experimenting with some new recipes.
Lynn: "Eat before you go" â€” The first rule in the "Wilderness Survival Guide."
Paimon: A picnic! Oh, Paimon just loves picnics!
Paimon: My travel partner here is good at cooking as well!
Traveler: I can only cook a few simple dishes...
Lynn: That's okay. Let's see what you can do!
Lynn: You won't get a lot of chances like this to learn from a survival expert!
Lynn: There are some Mushrooms and meat in the barrel over there. Try making a <color=#00E1FFFF>Chicken-Mushroom Skewer</color> for me.
Traveler: That's right, I love cooking too.
Lynn: Oh, there's a cooking pot right here. Show me what you got!
Lynn: It's good to have someone to practice with.

## Talk 2

Lynn: Have you got all the ingredients?
Lynn: You can use my <color=#00E1FFFF>pot</color> right here. Use it all you want.

## Talk 3

Lynn: Is it done? Mmm... Smells good!
Lynn: Let me try...
Lynn: Hmm...
Lynn: *nom nom*
Lynn: Wow...
Paimon: Ahh... Uh oh...
Lynn: The taste is... hard to describe. A borderline pass!
Paimon: #What? {NICKNAME} can do better. That doesn't count!
Lynn: You have great potential. All you need is more practice.
Lynn: Oh. I've got some raw ingredients in my bag. Have them in return for this meal.
Paimon: Can we really have them? Won't you run out of ingredients?
Lynn: That's okay. You should be able to find lots of ingredients when <color=#00E1FFFF>exploring the wilderness</color>. Don't forget to look carefully.
Lynn: There's also a restaurant in Mondstadt known as <color=#00E1FFFF>Good Hunter</color> that sells food and ingredients. Go have a look when you've got the time.
Paimon: Okay, thank you for the info. *gasp* Hey! Leave some Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for Paimon!
