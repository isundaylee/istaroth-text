Traveler: How's work coming along?
Jiangzhou: My father's been getting on in years lately, so I asked for a transfer. Now that I'm in a more leisurely department, I finally have time to spend with my family after work.
Jiangzhou: Now that I have some room to breathe, I can't even recall how I managed to take on so many tasks... Many of them weren't even my responsibilities, but I just couldn't help putting my nose in there.
Jiangzhou: Hahaha. I was so strong back then, eh?

Traveler: See you around.
Jiangzhou: See you. I guess I've got to learn to fret a little less and do a little less...

Traveler: The "past" you?
Jiangzhou: *sigh* Did you ever spend Lantern Rite here in Liyue? I was the previous planner of the event.
Jiangzhou: Of course, Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
Jiangzhou: But Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
Jiangzhou: Like the lack of guardrails at the wharf, the crowding at food stalls in Chihu Rock, the cats and dogs and running around all over the place... There's so much to consider!
Jiangzhou: ...No, no, I'm starting to think like a planner again. That's not my job anymore — I should just get off work and go take care of my father.

## Talk 4

Jiangzhou: They should put up more railings around the docks. What if someone falls into the sea during the festive period?

Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: ...And there's the fire hazards. Feiyun Slope should be okay, but here at Chihu Rock it's difficult to have eyes everywhere once the place gets crowded...
Jiangzhou: More people means more torches... I need to write a report to warn them about this...
Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: ...We also can't have too much restaurant seating spilling out into the streets, it would be a total disaster if someone were to get trampled...
Jiangzhou: But how do we explain that to the restaurants? Ugh, there's so many things to juggle...
Traveler: Excuse me, can you hear me?
Jiangzhou: Oh! Goodness! I almost forgot... All those cats and dogs around the harbor need somewhere to stay...
Jiangzhou: There's a thought; Yong'an is always on duty here, and he loves cats and dogs. So does Manager Xiao. I wonder if they'd be happy to help...

Traveler: I'll leave you alone...
Jiangzhou: Hmm... What if people can't see the lantern? How will we manage the flow of pedestrians...

## Talk 7

Jiangzhou: Any pickpockets loitering around will simply disappear into the crowd, where even the Millelith will be powerless to track them down...

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: We've got to think carefully about where we station our police officers too... Oh, are you talking to me?
Jiangzhou: ...Hi. I'm Jiangzhou, planner for the Lantern Rite festival... Well, one of them.
Traveler: One of them?
Jiangzhou: Yes... Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
Jiangzhou: Even then, Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
Jiangzhou: And of course, the number one priority of this job is to not end up creating any new problems...
Traveler: New problems?
Jiangzhou: Yes... Sometimes due to lack of communication, one planner ends up reversing a decision made by another planner, which wastes time and resources.
Jiangzhou: For instance, I had to repeatedly stress the other day that we need to add a street light here... Huh? Where's the street light?
Jiangzhou: This is no good, I'll definitely be writing a report about this!
