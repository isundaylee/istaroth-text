Traveler: Freedom...
Tingting: Yeah, if you don't have a desire for freedom, then no matter how long you've been journeying for, you still won't be able to see things with an open mind.
Tingting: From the looks of things, you are also a Traveler, right? These are for you.
Tingting: After you go to more places, I think you'll be able to understand the value of freedom more.
