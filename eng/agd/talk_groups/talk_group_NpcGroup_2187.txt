Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Memo): "The 'Mountainator' cannon within the main mining area seems to remain undamaged. We should be able to use this to open up a path and save ourselves significant amounts of time exploring this place."
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Memo): "However, we need to first clear the area of roving bandits. Fortunately, there's good news: the Millelith are already on the move cutting off their links with Treasure Hoarders on the surface."
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Memo): "If their connection to the surface is cut, the Treasure Hoarders underground will likely fall back of their own accord..."

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Old Notice): "The mines are a sprawling, complex place. Ensure that you carry a finch cage with you at all times while navigating any narrow spaces within in case of any leakage of poisonous or flammable gasses! Do not forget what our comrade Erge taught us!"

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Incomplete Note): (The edges of this incomplete sheet of paper have been charred a deep brown. It seems that someone read this under torchlight without keeping a safe distance...)

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Miner's Message): "As for all those who have gone too near to the 'crystal fragment,' please report to the medical team immediately, regardless of whether you had a negative reaction or not, and leave The Chasm as soon as possible!"

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Covered Message): (This announcement and the messages written under it have been partially covered by newer notices. This might have been put up not long after the mines were sealed.)

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Battered Namelist): (This old namelist seems to have been left here by the very first exploration team sent after the mine was sealed.)
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard (Battered Namelist): "We would like to invite the following professional staff to set up camp here to take samples, do research and learn how we might appropriately utilize Lumenstone:"
