Chiori: I see a lot of people training in the art of the sword to pursue martial excellence. But that's not my goal.
Chiori: I'm only interested in capturing the aesthetics of the sword, especially the interplay between light and shadow. Combat, for me, is a chance to get a wealth of inspiration in the bag.
Chiori: But don't worry. Even if I lose focus mid-battle, Tamoto will help you out.

Chiori: I like the decor here. Seems like working in a different environment once in a while can be a good mood-booster.
Chiori: Only thing is, once I get into work mode, I'm so focused on what I'm doing that I don't pay much attention to what's going on in the outside world.
Chiori: So if you need me for anything, you'll have get up close and personal to get my attention. Got it?
