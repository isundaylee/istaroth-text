Tiger Li: Ah, now that's a face I've never seen before. Are you with those masked people?

## Talk

Traveler: A face you've never seen before?
Tiger Li: I know everyone on this island. I've never seen you before. So, you must have come here after my arrival.
Tiger Li: According to our customs, that makes you my junior!
Tiger Li: If you ever run into any troubles, just come and find me!

## Talk

Traveler: Masked people?
Tiger Li: Uh huh, Mr. Guard over there told me that we can't leave this island yet.
Tiger Li: However, I saw all those masked people heading towards Narukami Island with my own eyes.
Tiger Li: Inazuma is such a weird place!

Tiger Li: Goodbye!

## Talk

Traveler: Why did you come to Ritou?
Tiger Li: Because of my big brother! He's a great businessman!
Tiger Li: I heard from my parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
Tiger Li: He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I also left home and snuck in here with him.
Tiger Li: I really miss my mom, but my brother's still here, so I've gotta stick it out here!

## Talk

Tiger Li: Ah, now that's a face I've never seen before. Are you one of those people who traveled back to Liyue on those big ships?

## Talk

Traveler: A face you've never seen before?
Tiger Li: I was on the first big ship that returned to Liyue together with my brother, so I know everyone who was on that ship.
Tiger Li: But I've never seen you before, and that means you must've been on one of the later ships.
Tiger Li: According to our customs, that makes you my junior!
Tiger Li: So if you ever run into any troubles, just come and find me!

## Talk

Traveler: Your brother?
Tiger Li: That's right! He's a great businessman!
Tiger Li: I heard from our parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
Tiger Li: He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I followed him out to sea in secret!
Tiger Li: But since he misses Mom, I decided to come back together with him.
Tiger Li: I'm not sure when we'll be able to go out together again...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Tiger Li: Seeya!
