# Radiant Sakura


## Talk 1

Yae Miko: Someone's not in the best of moods... Let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
Yae Miko: I hope you realize how lucky you are. If it was anyone else, I don't think I'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
Paimon: ...But you're always smiling!
Yae Miko: That was a figure of speech, do you understand? Nitpicking my turns of phrase, the sheer audacity.
Traveler: Paimon, get to the point...
Paimon: Oh, yeah, yeah! Something really big's happened! It's Ei, she... she...
Black Screen Text: You tell Yae Miko about everything that has happened...
Yae Miko: Oh, okay, I see. So Ei's decided to palm Inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date...
Yae Miko: Impossibly stubborn, jumps straight to the most extreme course of action imaginable, presumes her sheer will can see her through, despite a near-impossible goal that requires nothing short of the very peak of her abilities... Yes, that sounds like Ei, alright.
Yae Miko: You know as well as I do that she's always been like this. Why start fretting about it now?
Traveler: This duel is more serious than anything up till now.
Yae Miko: Rushed into it without thinking... Hehe, well put. Ah, she acts like such a child sometimes.
Yae Miko: So, you seem to be under the impression that I am able to offer some sort of help? Who gave you that idea?
Paimon: Is she playing dumb? She's doing this on purpose for sure!
Yae Miko: Aha, you're learning, little one. But really, the truth of the matter is that I don't know much more about Raiden Makoto's realm of consciousness than you do.
Yae Miko: All I know is that it's the foundation of the Sacred Sakura, and from what I have heard it's a little different from Ei's "Plane of Euthymia."
Paimon: Because Raiden Makoto is no longer alive?
Yae Miko: Not just because of that. The nature of the space itself is different in some way... But I can only speculate. You're the ones who have actually been there, so you tell me — what was it like?
Traveler: I didn't notice any differences.
Yae Miko: Anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much — it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
Yae Miko: First things first. Follow me to the entrance.
Traveler: I wasn't paying attention.
Traveler: She rushed into it without thinking.

## Talk 2

Yae Miko: Now then, I always have my ways. It's just a question of how crafty I need to be...
Yae Miko: To the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. Luckily, I'm Ei's familiar, so I can sense her rough whereabouts.
Yae Miko: In other words, even though I can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, I can still send you to where Ei is.
Paimon: So it's abstract, but has a location, but you don't know where it is, but you can still send us there... what?
Yae Miko: Yes, no need to try and understand it. Let me put this simply: Right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
Yae Miko: Everything is turbulent and disordered... If you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
Yae Miko: This is precisely why when entering the Plane of Euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
Paimon: What? Alright, well Paimon's staying here, then. You two can go in!
Traveler: In your dreams.
Yae Miko: Suit yourself. Worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is Ei, so what's the big deal?
Paimon: You... Ugh! Paimon's had it up to here with both of you! Fine, Paimon's coming too...
Yae Miko: Oh? Well if you're quite sure, then of course. Now, I shall send you on your way.
Yae Miko: ...
Yae Miko: Hmm? I say...
Traveler: What is it?
Yae Miko: Oh, nothing. It just seems extraordinarily chaotic, that's all. My suspicions have been confirmed.
Yae Miko: By the way... Remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
Yae Miko: Only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. Only if you are strong enough can I deliver you to the right destination.
Traveler: Okay.
Yae Miko: Well then. The door is open. Hop on in.
Yae Miko: I'll stay outside and provide what stability I can. I'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
Yae Miko: #...I'm placing my god in your capable hands, {NICKNAME}.
Yae Miko: For my sake, and for Inazuma's, please... bring her back.
Paimon: Miko, you'd better know what you're doing...
Traveler: We will not fail.
Yae Miko: That's enough chatter. Get to work!
Traveler: Paimon, you're not gonna abandon me, are you?

## Talk 3

Raiden Shogun: ...
Raiden Shogun: How can this be?
Raiden Shogun: You have returned... But how were you able to get back in? And... how come you have not changed at all in all these years...
Traveler: All these years? ...What?
Raiden Shogun: This is a duel to remember.
Raiden Shogun: It is as if we have returned to the moment when the laws of eternity were first established. Your will today is as strong as it was back then.
Raiden Shogun: Over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
Raiden Shogun: Had I made all enemies of eternity stand against you, you still would not have wavered.
Raiden Shogun: For your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
Raiden Shogun: You bring honor to the title of "Guardian of Eternity."
Raiden Shogun: Now these two return once more to this space. An inevitability of fate, perhaps.
Raiden Shogun: Then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began 500 years ago.
Raiden Shogun: Final duel? So you're finally willing to...
Raiden Shogun: Stand back, Traveler.
Traveler: Are you going to put an end to all this?
Raiden Shogun: I'm going to be the start of something new.

## Talk 4

Raiden Shogun: This is the end. You have won.
Raiden Shogun: I believed you were incapable of transcending the past. But it seems my belief was baseless and I underestimated your spirit.
Raiden Shogun: But a will that cannot be eroded has no way to embrace the future.
Raiden Shogun: You need not worry about the future, and you aren't alone.
Raiden Shogun: I know your power more than anyone else. Had I relied upon my strength alone, I would have lost this duel for sure.
Raiden Shogun: Yet my reason for fighting redefined my martial prowess and redrew my limits. I now carry the gaze of the myriad of expectant eyes that look to the light in the heavens.
Raiden Shogun: And whenever I think of this, I feel something stirring within Musou Isshin.
Raiden Shogun: The blade that I inherited from Makoto seems to be trying to guide me... to encourage me.
Raiden Shogun: I noticed it also. Just now, in the heat of battle, it seemed to unleash a new and unfamiliar power.
Raiden Shogun: This power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
Raiden Shogun: This blade belonged to Mak{RUBY#[S]the previous Shogun}oto. Perhaps it can only respond to me with its full power when I truly understand and believe in her.
Raiden Shogun: When I clasped Musou Isshin in my hands, I had the feeling that she was by my side once again.
Raiden Shogun: It was at once a familiar feeling and a strange one... Makoto barely wielded a blade in her life, and yet her blade brings me closer to her.
Raiden Shogun: You have my approval.
Raiden Shogun: Your present will is not the product of erosion. I shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
Raiden Shogun: From this day forth, this body will remain your assistant.
Raiden Shogun: I won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
Raiden Shogun: You used to represent my past, but from today onward, you are me.
Raiden Shogun: Makoto never saw me as a fearless weapon. Likewise, I should not regard you as a mere tool.
Raiden Shogun: ...Heh, you truly have changed. I suppose this is what humans call "growth."
Raiden Shogun: I understand. I shall become your shadow, just as you were once Makoto's shadow.
Raiden Shogun: The duties I perform will not change.
Raiden Shogun: But as a warrior, I look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
Raiden Shogun: Do you say this because you have not yet reconciled yourself with your defeat?
Raiden Shogun: It was simply a new experience for me. One that is worth reliving.
Paimon: Have you finished fighting, then? Like, for real this time?
Raiden Shogun: Hmm?
Traveler: Musou Isshin is glowing?
Makoto: Hello Ei, and greetings, those who have come to bear witness.
Makoto: I am Raiden Makoto, the previous Electro Archon, who failed in my duties and left you all to pick up the pieces.
Raiden Shogun: Makoto...?
Makoto: I'm so happy. You've come so far. I always knew you would make it here in the end.
Makoto: I left a faint fragment of my will in Musou Isshin, so that in the moment that you unleashed its full power, I too would be released.
Makoto: A convoluted way to reach you, but... Well, you held such deeply entrenched views at the time that you wouldn't have listened to a word I said.
Makoto: There was no time to wait for you to have a change of heart. Please forgive me... All I could do was find some way to wait until you came to me.
Raiden Shogun: But you never mentioned this to me...
Makoto: Everything happened so suddenly... I'm sorry.
Makoto: I've always felt terrible for having to entrust Inazuma to you all of a sudden.
Makoto: I should have been the one to impart these ideas to you a little at a time, to dissuade you from your pursuit of stillness.
Raiden Shogun: Did you know what was about to happen in Khaenri'ah?
Makoto: I had some sense of it. That place... was not somewhere that any archon could afford to ignore.
Makoto: In my present form, I can no longer perceive time. I don't know how long we have been separated before this reunion, and I don't know what Inazuma has experienced in the meantime.
Makoto: But I know that this must have been an extremely arduous journey for you... and I'm sure you must have wanted to shed tears many times along the way.
Raiden Shogun: ...Don't look down on me.
Makoto: See, you admit it.
Makoto: It was with this possibility in mind that I left a parting gift for you... something to soothe Inazuma's pain.
Makoto: Here, take it. Before my last shred of consciousness fades away.
Makoto: But it is you who must take the most important step...

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: After leaving the realm of consciousness and returning to the shrine, you relay everything to Yae Miko...
Yae Miko: So the Ei of the present planted the Sacred Sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the Inazuma of the past...
Yae Miko: No matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
Raiden Shogun: All of this is thanks to Makoto's power. Her understanding of eternity is much more profound than mine.
Raiden Shogun: Eternity is a concept intimately connected with time. When you begin to touch on eternity, the concept of time becomes murky.
Traveler: I saw wonderful things inside that place.
Traveler: Time was moving forward and backward at the same time.
Yae Miko: A place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic... So, that was the "turbulence" I was sensing.
Yae Miko: Perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
Yae Miko: And yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
Raiden Shogun: I don't fully understand yet. But my intuition tells me that the reason for everything... it's that seed.
Yae Miko: Hmm, well I'm not convinced that it was Makoto's power alone...
Raiden Shogun: I know what you mean. Perhaps a higher{RUBY#[S]Istaroth} power really was involved in all of this. But whatever the explanation, her solution is what saved us all.
Raiden Shogun: Without the Sacred Sakura, Inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
Yae Miko: I know you've always perceived there was something special about the Sacred Sakura. But to me, it has always been there.
Yae Miko: You've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the Sacred Sakura and Makoto's consciousness. But unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
Raiden Shogun: No, but I understand why now. It was because the Sacred Sakura hadn't even been planted then.
Paimon: Umm, but don't you think that tree looked a lot different than how it does now?
Yae Miko: The Sacred Sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously I get to prune it exactly how I like it.
Paimon: Ugh... Now we see who's pulling the strings...
Yae Miko: I'm joking. That tree has been through a lot since it first sprouted. We have the loving care of kitsune over the ages to thank for how it appears today.
Yae Miko: And obviously I played my part, too.
Yae Miko: It's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. But in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
Yae Miko: Traveler, if I'm guessing correctly... You were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
Traveler: Yes, I was.
Yae Miko: At that time, I could sense Ei's whereabouts, but I also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
Yae Miko: Suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. Simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
Yae Miko: Fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
Yae Miko: The flow of turbulence may well have been influenced by Makoto. But it took everyone's efforts combined to ultimately help Ei. So this time, it looks like thanks are due to you.
Paimon: Does that mean... it wasn't by chance that we ended up at the final duel? We were always meant to be there to witness what was going to happen?
Traveler: Perhaps this is what the Shogun meant by...
Raiden Shogun: I thought that the flow of time was the same on the inside and the outside. So it was a great shock to me when the Traveler re-appeared.
Raiden Shogun: My first thought was, "Has a great disaster befallen Inazuma?"
Raiden Shogun: But it turned out you had come to rescue me... You came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
Raiden Shogun: You two have my thanks. You have done much for me, and I will never forget it.
Yae Miko: Ei, how are you feeling now?
Raiden Shogun: My body has fully recovered, and the Shogun's will no longer fights against me.
Yae Miko: Always thrilled to hear you're in good health. But I was really asking about your emotions. Have you managed to calm down?
Yae Miko: After all, you saw Makoto in there, didn't you?
Raiden Shogun: I only heard her voice. I wouldn't say I saw her...
Raiden Shogun: I'll be fine. It brought a few things back, of course. But I've made my decision to move forward.
Raiden Shogun: I have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant Makoto was. She predicted all the ways in which Inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
Raiden Shogun: She even factored my immaturity into her plan.
Raiden Shogun: It's all thanks to her that Inazuma lived to see this day.
Traveler: Makoto was brilliant.
Raiden Shogun: I just planted a seed.
Traveler: Your will and hers were both indispensable.
Paimon: Yeah! It was thanks to everything you did that you got to see her again. That's amazing!
Traveler: The final act might be a simple one.
Traveler: Just because the cause and effect ended up a bit back-to-front...
Raiden Shogun: #...Thank you, {NICKNAME}.
Yae Miko: Today, at long last, you and Inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
Yae Miko: Makoto and you are Inazuma's past and future, and both are indispensable.
Raiden Shogun: It's rare to hear such comforting words from you. I graciously accept them.
Yae Miko: Oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word I say.
Paimon: Makoto said the exact same thing.
Yae Miko: Great minds think alike, hmm? I wonder, does that qualify me to, maybe, take the position of Shogun for a couple of days?
Yae Miko: Actually, no — forget that. Far more trouble than it's worth.
Raiden Shogun: We will have to end the frivolities there. There is much work to be done.
Raiden Shogun: The Shogun and I will closely review the Inazuma of today to find out where things currently stand. Then, we will give careful consideration to the future.
Raiden Shogun: After that... I will abolish the Sakoku Decree.
Paimon: Really? That's huge news!
Raiden Shogun: I am no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis. In which case, there is no further need to keep the nation under lock and key.
Raiden Shogun: I don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for Inazuma...
Traveler: But out of those challenges will be born new opportunities.
Raiden Shogun: I'm looking forward to it.
Traveler: ...doesn't mean you should undervalue the part you played.
Traveler: But getting there was the result of countless efforts coming together.
Traveler: But Ei, you made a crucial contribution, too.
Traveler: ..."an inevitability of fate."
Traveler: Is that significant?
