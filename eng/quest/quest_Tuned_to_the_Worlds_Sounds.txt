# Tuned to the World's Sounds


## Talk 1

Juza: Hey, hey, Traveler! Long time no see, you been keeping well?
Traveler: Have we met?
Juza: Oh, uh... So, you've completely forgotten who I am, huh?
Juza: I'm Juza, chief mate of The Alcor! You hitched a ride with us to Inazuma, in case you'd forgotten.
Paimon: #Nah, {F#she's}{M#he's} just kidding with you, Juza! Of course we remember you, hehe.
Juza: Ah... I was gonna say! This is The Alcor we're talking about here, and I'm the chief mate to boot...
Traveler: Yes, heh, so... you need a hand with anything?
Juza: Not me, actually. It's Kaedehara Kid, a temporary crew member of ours.
Juza: You know him, right? He came back with us on the return trip from Inazuma.
Juza: I don't know what's been going on with him, but he was in really high spirits the whole way back. He kept trying to get everyone to join him for some poetry and song.
Juza: Unfortunately, no one on board from Captain Beidou to Little Yue has that kind of um... Kind of, y'know, uh...
Traveler: Sophistication!
Juza: Sophistication! Yes! Not an ounce of the stuff between us.
Juza: So, once we got to Liyue, he disembarked and disappeared off into mother nature. I'm gonna say he probably couldn't bear being around a bunch of uncouth sailors a second longer.
Juza: Then, not long after that, we got a message from him telling us to keep an eye out for you.
Traveler: Is he in trouble?
Juza: Didn't give the specifics. He just said that if we saw you, we should tell you he wants to chat with you.
Juza: From the tone of the message, it didn't sound all that serious — but then again, who'd be asking for the likes of you unless it was some sort of major crisis?
Paimon: #Actually, we deal with little things all the time, don't we, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Yep, feeding pigeons and whatnot.
Juza: Oh... Huh, never would've guessed. So you do everyone's odd jobs, too.
Juza: No wonder the captain's so fond of you. She's got a soft spot for the honest, hard-working folks of this world, you know?
Juza: Ahem! Getting sidetracked. Please go check up on Kaedehara Kid when you get the chance. Last I heard, he was hanging around the north of Liyue.
Juza: I've got some things to do on the boat — see you 'round, and safe travels!
Traveler: Yep, delivering food and so on.
Traveler: Yep, spring cleaning and the like.
Traveler: Quirkiness!
Juza: No, no! I mean sophistication! We don't have an ounce of the stuff between the whole crew.

## Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: While the bridge slowly withers, the strings gently whisper / A twilight melody from the solitary zither...
Paimon: Hey, hey! Kaedehara Kid! So what are you up to here? We've come to help!
Kaedehara Kazuha: You made it. Good to see you again.
Kaedehara Kazuha: This appellation, "Kaedehara Kid"... When uttered by Paimon, it takes on a whole new tone.
Paimon: Hee-hee, Paimon learned it from Chief Mate Juza.
Traveler: You seem to be enjoying yourself.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, what makes you say that? Do I usually mope around as if perpetually hounded by adverse fate?
Paimon: It's 'cause Juza said that you needed us for something! We didn't expect to find you admiring the scenery and reciting poetry without a care in the whole world!
Kaedehara Kazuha: The events of Inazuma are behind me, and no longer linger on my mind. Now, I return to Liyue. It is the natural time to explore all the verses and melodies that arise from this land.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As to the matter requiring your assistance — there was none to begin with. Unfortunately, you are too late for that, because now, there is.
Paimon: Huh? That was really confusing... There was none to begin with, but somehow now there still is...? What!?
Paimon: Have you been eating those wild plants that you're not supposed to? 'Cause you're talking total baloney!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Shh... Listen.
Kaedehara Kazuha: What do you think?
Paimon: Wow... Well, Paimon thinks you play just like another bard we know, who plays for loose change.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, you're friends with a professional bard? I hope I have the chance to meet them some day. Traveler, what do you think?
Traveler: I think your instrument is broken.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very good, you're right. More to the point, however, it has a certain special ability.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I acquired this anonymous Ancient Zither from an abandoned cave dwelling as I was exploring the mountains.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When I first found it, it was old, but intact. The sight of it inspired me, and suddenly, I found myself strumming.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To my surprise, as soon as the melody began, my mind began to drift, and I could hear the sound of someone playing along with me... somehow, it all felt so familiar...
Paimon: Just to circle back for a second — are you sure you haven't been eating anything suspicious? That makes you see things that aren't there?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I don't believe so, because when the melody ended, my mind became completely clear again. That's when I finally started to inspect my surroundings properly: As expected, it was a place full of mystery.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The cave was overrun with weeds, so I imagine the owner left a long time ago. But the table and chair were spotless, and gave off a fine and delicate fragrance.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the ever-present sound of the wind fell silent in that place. It was quite miraculous. I can only assume that it must have been the treasure trove of a fabled Liyue adeptus.
Paimon: Whoa! So this instrument is an adeptus's treasure!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, who can say? Regardless, it was a wondrous experience, and after it was over, I thought to myself — I simply must share this with a friend.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But in Liyue, besides Captain Beidou, you are the only friend I have.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I doubt this would interest Beidou in the least, so I decided to invite you to share this experience.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I asked Chief Mate Juza to be on the lookout for you. But unfortunately, the Ancient Zither broke before you arrived.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The fault is my own. I've been taking it everywhere with me, and playing it too often.
Paimon: Oh... So even adepti treasures break in the end?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If Eternity lies out of reach even for the mighty Electro Archon herself... then it is all the more elusive for everything else.
Paimon: #Uh-oh, well... P—Please be super-duper careful with our Serenitea Pot, {NICKNAME}!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Luckily, in this case, the breakage is fixable. It is more akin to hibernation than anything else — the energy within the instrument has dissipated with the passage of time.
Kaedehara Kazuha: All we need to do is find the right material, and we can awaken it once again.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If I heard correctly, the material in question should be... the Glaze Lily.
Traveler: Where did you hear that?
Kaedehara Kazuha: As I've mentioned before, the wind carries with it the whispers of everything that resides in the world, and I am attuned to some of what they say.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So, I am privy to a few fragments of this Ancient Zither's history.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Go on. I'll wait here for you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You are the savior of Liyue Harbor. I'm sure this should be well within your ability to handle?
Traveler: That instrument looks quite valuable.
Traveler: You seem rather relaxed.

## Talk 3

Kaedehara Kazuha: You've returned, even before the wind could bring tidings of your progress. This is quite astonishing... How did you achieve it?
Paimon: #Hehe, maybe {F#she's}{M#he's} got a few more tricks up {F#her}{M#his} sleeve than you thought!
Traveler: Ahem. Will these be enough?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let me see.

## Talk 4

Kaedehara Kazuha: Good, these are fine specimens. They will be plenty. If we extract the juices and apply them to the body of the instrument, it should awaken from its present slumber.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, there it is, that familiar feeling. It's awoken.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Come, try it for yourself, {NICKNAME}. It's all yours.
Traveler: When you say "it's all yours"...?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, can a poet not be forthright in expression? Then, let me rephrase. This instrument is my gift unto you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I came back to Liyue to listen to what this region of the world has to say. In these vast and ancient lands watched over by the Geo Archon, there are countless soft voices to be heard... This gives me all the satisfaction I desire.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Of course, should there come a day when you wish to part with this instrument, I will come to collect it. But... I hope that day will never come.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Well, my onward journey beckons. What is the customary Liyue saying at moments like this? Ah, yes.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #"We will meet again," {NICKNAME}.
