# Will of Stone


## Talk 1

Jiayi: Ah, it's been a long time since I was last at Qingce Village. Little Liu, Daddy misses you so much...
Traveler: Is everything alright?
Jiayi: Oh, it's you, traveler. Thanks for your concern. Nothing's wrong. I just... miss my daughter.
Jiayi: I told her that once this shift ended, I'd take leave to spend some time with her for a few days at Qingce Village.
Jiayi: But who knew that such a huge thing would suddenly happen in Liyue Harbor. Not only was every soldier on leave recalled, but everyone at their post has also had their leave canceled.
Jiayi: Now we have to man our stations all day. Forget taking leave, I need to find someone who can take over my post even if I want to get a sip of water.
Jiayi: I'd prepared my gifts, too — a huge bag of toys... But what shall I do with it now?
Jiayi: That's right! Traveler, could I ask you to bring these toys to my daughter, Little Liu? She stays at Qingce Village. If you ask Granny Ruoxin, you're sure to find her.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Lay it on me.
Jiayi: Oh, thank you, thank you so much!

## Talk 3

Traveler: I've got other matters to attend to.
Jiayi: Alright. Qingce Village is such a long way off, anyway. I should think of another solution rather than trouble you...

## Talk 4

Jiayi: *sigh* I was counting down the days before I'd be able to go back. Just two or three days more...
Jiayi: With all the leave I've saved up until this point, I could have spent over a week together with Little Liu.
Jiayi: But with but one order, all our leaves were canceled. Even the people on leave were recalled.
Jiayi: In my experience, this means at least another month without any hope of returning to Qingce Village. What terrible luck...

## Talk 5

Granny Ruoxin: Oh, where has that child run off to...
Traveler: Can I ask about Little Liu?
Granny Ruoxin: Are you looking for her? *sigh* What perfectly terrible timing. I don't know where's she's gone.
Granny Ruoxin: She received a letter that her father asked someone to send over from Liyue Harbor that stated that he'd be back soon.
Granny Ruoxin: Little Liu was so happy. She said she wanted to prepare a gift for her father, and roped some other children into picking fruits and flowers...
Granny Ruoxin: But a few days afterward, he sent word, saying that he had a last-minute assignment and wouldn't be able to return.
Granny Ruoxin: She threw a tantrum, and nothing we said could dissuade her from insisting that she would go to Liyue Harbor herself, since her father wasn't coming.
Granny Ruoxin: We thought it a joke for a while. But this morning, she was gone.
Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* We've already sent people out to look for her, but if you're willing, you can join in as well.
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Granny Ruoxin: I apologize for the trouble. *sigh* This child...
Traveler: Where do you think she's headed?
Granny Ruoxin: I doubt she could go far. She's probably still close by, but the wilds are a dangerous place... Please, find her quickly.

## Talk 6

Granny Ruoxin: That Jiayi, too. How could he just cancel on his daughter like that...
Granny Ruoxin: She doesn't see him any more than a few times a year. Is this how a father should behave?
Traveler: He's doing this for Liyue Harbor...
Granny Ruoxin: That's what he says every year. I've lost count of the number of times he's said that...
Traveler: He's just doing his job...
Granny Ruoxin: Well, it's also his job to take care of his daughter. Little Liu is growing up day by day.
Granny Ruoxin: If he's not careful, she'll be the one going out to work by the time he returns.
Granny Ruoxin: This father and his daughter just can't get together, can they?

## Talk 7

Little Liu: Are you here to catch me and take me back to Qingce Village?
Traveler: Granny Ruoxin is worried sick about you.
Little Liu: Hmph. So you are here to catch me. Well, I'm not going back.
Little Liu: Go back and tell the villagers that I'm going to Liyue Harbor to look for Daddy.
Little Liu: They don't have to worry. Once I find him, I'll just talk to him for a while, then I'll come back.
Traveler: I have something for you...
Little Liu: I don't need anything from you. You're just trying to bribe me.

## Talk 8

Little Liu: What are you following me for, anyway? I said, I'm going to Liyue Harbor!
Little Liu: I'll get around these monsters myself. They won't find me.
Little Liu: Don't treat me like a kid! I'm a grown-up now!
Traveler: This is from your father...
Little Liu: From Daddy? Did he ask you to send it over...
Little Liu: I'm sure it's more things for children to play with... if it's not kites, it's dolls.
Traveler: You don't like them?
Little Liu: ...I do. It's something Daddy gave me. How could I not like it?
Little Liu: But if I always like these things, doesn't that mean that I'll always be a kid?
Little Liu: If I keep playing with them, when will I become an adventurer, or get my own Vision?
Traveler: What did you want a Vision for, again?
Little Liu: If I had a Vision, I'd be able to do so many things, whether it be making money or something else...
Little Liu: Then, Daddy wouldn't have to work in Liyue Harbor all the time. He could come back and spend time with me.
Little Liu: Right now, I can't even go to Liyue Harbor myself without a Vision...
Little Liu: But since Daddy has already sent you here with his presents, I might just be giving him more trouble by going to look for him.
Little Liu: *I had presents ready for him too*. I wanted to give him a surprise... But I can't take them to him now.
Little Liu: *If only someone could help me do that*... It's alright. I'm going back. There's no need to follow me, I know the way home.

## Talk 9

Little Liu: Dolls... kites... pinwheels. Daddy sent these again, just like I thought.
Little Liu: *sigh* It's just a shame that I wasn't able to send him my gifts too.
Traveler: I'll take them to your father.
Little Liu: You'll help me? Well... Even though you don't have a Vision either, it looked like those monsters didn't give you a hard time at all.
Little Liu: I guess we'll have to do it this way, then. Thank you.
Little Liu: *sigh* If only I could be as strong as you...

## Talk 10

Granny Ruoxin: You've returned. Thank you for your help. Little Liu has already returned, and with quite the bag of things, too.
Traveler: Jiayi sent them to her.
Granny Ruoxin: Did he, now... But still, what Little Liu really wants is for him to come back in person.
Granny Ruoxin: That child really has grown up like the bamboo around the village. Blink, and you'll miss just how much she's grown.
Granny Ruoxin: The days when your child is young will never return again once you miss them...

## Talk 11

Jiayi: Have you handed the presents to Little Liu yet?
Traveler: I have.
Jiayi: That's good. Those toys are her favorite. Thank you — please take these as a token of my thanks.
Traveler: She'd prefer it if you were home.
Jiayi: I want to go back too. But with Liyue Harbor in this state, I don't think that's possible for the time being.
Jiayi: Still, thank you so much. I hope those presents will improve her mood a bit — they are her favorites, after all.
Jiayi: Please, take this as thanks.

### Additional Talk 1

Jiayi: Have you handed the presents to Little Liu yet?
Traveler: Well, this is from Little Liu.
Jiayi: This... is from Little Liu, for me? So many... How much work did she have to put in...
Jiayi: I want nothing more than to drop everything and run back to Qingce Village right now. But the Ministry of Civil Affairs would...
Jiayi: Thank you once again. Take these as thanks, please.
Jiayi: *sigh* I have no idea when this whole affair will be over, or when the Ministry will approve my leave, either...

### Additional Talk 2

Little Liu: If only I had a Vision! With it, I could do so many things, whether it's making money or whatever...
Little Liu: At least, I would have no trouble making it to Liyue on my own.
Little Liu: But, how do I get my hands on one...
