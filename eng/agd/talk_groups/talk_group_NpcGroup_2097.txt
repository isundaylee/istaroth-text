Chunshui: Thank you, and mine to you... If you don't mind, please take this.
Chunshui: This is called a Windwheel Aster. I asked a friend to bring one back from Mondstadt for me.
Chunshui: There, this plant symbolizes the "visible winds." I hope it can keep my husband safe at sea.
Chunshui: You are a good person. I hope that you, too, may be blessed be the wind.

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Chunshui: Oh, so that's what you were talking about...
Chunshui: It may be because I pray to the Anemo Archon regularly... But I sensed bad tidings on the winds a long time ago.
Chunshui: Maybe it was selfish of me only to pray for my husband's safety...
Chunshui: Because now, all of Liyue's people need divine protection.

Chunshui: You worship the Anemo Archon?
Chunshui: ...I suppose you rarely meet locals of Liyue who worship the Anemo Archon?
Chunshui: ...The reason I do is because my husband is a sailor.
Chunshui: Although it is tradition in Liyue to worship the Geo Archon, it's the wind that ultimately decides whether a ship at sea will return home safely or not. Wouldn't you say?
Chunshui: ...Also, I don't care if he makes any money or not. All I want is to have him back safe and sound.

Chunshui: *sigh* Anemo or not... any god will do as long as they can keep my husband safe...
