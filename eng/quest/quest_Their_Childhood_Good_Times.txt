# Their Childhood: Good Times


## Talk 1

Verut: You can't find me... You can't find me...

## Talk 2

Lovi: That Aurele, honestly...

## Talk 3

Aurele: No... This logical sequence doesn't line up. I need to come at this from a different angle...
Aurele: How about... No, no...
Aurele: Huh? Oh. You found me. I'll head back to the meeting point, then.
Aurele: Is this point of view correct? No, it... Actually, is it right or wrong...

## Talk 4

Lovi: I wonder if Aurele will be able to put his thoughts together...
Lovi: Uh, what? You actually found this place? Seriously, how many times have you played hide-and-seek?
Lovi: Well, I'll head back to the meeting point. I'll hide myself better next time!

## Talk 5

Aurele: No, no... The argument is insufficiently rigorous here...
Lovi: Oh well, looks like Aurele's in his own world again. Anyway, thanks for playing with us again!
Traveler: Will he... be okay?
Lovi: As long as he doesn't start drinking coffee like water, as my dad did, he should be fine.
Verut: Leave that one to me! I won't let my brother drink too much coffee... If it really comes down to it, I'll hide all of his coffee from him.
Lovi: *sigh* I was planning to hide my dad's coffee here... But I guess that's a bust.
Verut: It sure is tough being a reviewer...
Traveler: Won't he... be exhausted?
