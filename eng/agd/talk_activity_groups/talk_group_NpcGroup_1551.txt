## Talk

Wyatt: Hi, haâ€”have you seen a coin pouch anywhere?

## Talk

Traveler: What kind of coin pouch?
Wyatt: It's made of cloth and has a thousand Mora in it.
Wyatt: That was my wage that I just received. I was on my way to give the money to my wife.
Wyatt: It will be a disaster if I can't find it...

## Talk

Traveler: Do you remember where you lost it?
Wyatt: Honestly? Not a clue. I just know that I came past here in the middle of the night.
Wyatt: I was so happy the day I received my wage that I went for a few drinks. I was stumbling home drunk by the end of the night, and when I woke up the next day I couldn't find my coin pouch anywhere.
Wyatt: I think finding it's gonna be a bit of a long shot. I don't care about the pouch itself, it's just... Eek!
Traveler: What's wrong?
Wyatt: Sorry, I was imagining my wife when she gets angry and let out an involuntary yelp...
Wyatt: She's going to think I spent the lot on buying a gift for some other lover...
Wyatt: But that's ridiculous, I give my wages to my wife each time I receive them... I wouldn't have the Mora to afford another lover even if I wanted one!
Wyatt: What to do, what to do... I can't stand being made to kneel and grovel, and I also can't stand it when she grabs me by the ear...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye... and good luck.
Wyatt: Please, if you do find it, please return it to me... I promise there'll be a reward in it for you.
