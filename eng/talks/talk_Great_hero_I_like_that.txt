# Talk Dialog

Traveler: "Great" hero... I like that.
Paimon: Calm down! It got a little dangerous, but all we did was defeat a remnant group of the Fatui.
Paimon: If this is enough to be crowned as "Great" heroes...
Paimon: Then we should be referred to as "The Greatest, Mightiest, Most Awesome, Coolest, Super, Amazing" heroes by now!
Balfour: I find it to be a fitting title! After all, of all the staff members, I'm most knowledgeable about what went on.
Balfour: Elchingen is a very cautious person. If the two of you didn't put yourselves in danger to force his hand, I would still be living in his lie!
Balfour: The reason for the limited number of Fungi that the competitors are allowed to keep after the competition was to blindside the Akademiya and was a part of Elchingen's marketing! Not only that, the Fungi that are returned after the competition will go directly to him as well.
Balfour: He even told me that if the competition were to be successful, we'd be increasing the number of qualifications needed to retain the Fungi after the competition up to one hundred and twenty-eight people!
Balfour: If his plan were to take effect, it wouldn't even be a year before he accumulated a massive number of Fungi. I can't imagine what would happen if he was allowed to carry out his plan.
Paimon: Yeah, but Cyno wouldn't have allowed Elchingen to do as he wished, right?
Paimon: Whatever the case, it's better to be safe than sorry. Thank you for your compliments, Mr. Balfour!
