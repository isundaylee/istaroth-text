Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If you're looking to hire a courier, please head over to the Courier's Longhouse and find the manager, Michica. We only accept commissions on a per-delivery basis, and do not currently offer our services for fixed periods."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Please also note: Couriers should not be entrusted with the delivery of extremely valuable, fragile, or dangerous items."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Though our couriers are highly skilled professionals, and you can rest assured that the vast majority of deliveries will arrive safely, we cannot guarantee against unforeseen accidents that may occur along the way..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "In the past, certain customers have asked our couriers to deliver packages with the speed of a falcon, across distances exceeding the deserts of Sumeru, with no damage to the packaging whatsoever..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Among today's Scions of the Canopy, only Kinich might be capable of such a task, but sadly he doesn't work as a courier... Anyway, your understanding is greatly appreciated!"
