Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (Is that it...?)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (...!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Hyah!
Traveler: (So fast!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (When did this dagger get here?)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Heh...
Traveler: (Hold on, I know this feeling... I've felt it several times before...!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Hyah!
Traveler: (I'm in a dream!!!)
Paimon: #...Traveler! Hey! Are you alright!?
Traveler: ...What just happened?
Paimon: Well, you fought that strange person and made them disappear. But then, all of a sudden, you started backing up like you were super afraid of something...
Traveler: ...I'm fine now, don't worry.
Paimon: Phew... You nearly gave Paimon a heart attack...
Traveler: (I saw a dagger, but it was Tricolor Dango the whole time... So, it was all just a nightmare?)
Traveler: (Luckily, I heard the sound of thunder in the dream. Otherwise, it probably would have taken me a lot longer to break out of the nightmare...)
Paimon: Also, what was with that thunder just now? It came out of nowhere, and it's not even raining!
Traveler: Huh...?
Paimon: What's wrong?
Traveler: (So the thunder... wasn't part of the dream?)
Traveler: (Who was that person...?)
Ei: ...Has a "Nightmare" returned to Inazuma once again?
Asari: Hey, Komura! Time to go. The stalls are closed, so let's head home for the night!
Komura: ...
Asari: Hey! Did you hear me? No more gaming tonight. We can come back tomorrow!
Asari: ...Komura, Komura!
Komura: ...
Asari: Um... Komura?
Komura (???): What's with the yelling? I can hear you just fine. Let's go.
Asari: ...Huh?
Komura: ...What? You're not coming? Why are you giving me that look?
Asari: Komura, weren't you...
Asari: Over there... just now?
