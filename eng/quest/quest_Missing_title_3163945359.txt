## Talk 1

Neuvillette: Oh, it's you two. Did Miss Navia invite you to come pay your respects to her father?
Paimon: Mhm! We ran into Navia on the streets today, so we just followed her here.
Neuvillette: I see, I see. Then, is there something that I can help you with?
Paimon: Ah... Um... Well, it's pretty hard to run into you like this, since you're usually super busy, so we figured we could try to ask you a few questions, if that's okay...
Neuvillette: Please feel free. Though outsiders, you helped us solve one of the greatest mysteries in Fontaine, and it would be my pleasure to return the favor.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Um... Paimon's really sorry, Navia, but Paimon did something pretty disrespectful just now...
Navia: Uh... What're you saying, Paimon? I don't think I get it...
Paimon: Well... Aren't you not supposed to fly around someone's grave?
Navia: Huh? Hehe, who told you that...
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}! Why did you mess with Paimon again!?
