Traveler: Who are you?
Ishikawa: Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. However, I was born into a samurai family, so the choice wasn't mine to make. It's my duty to join the military and go to war for the sake of my family's honor.
Ishikawa: What's annoying is that this war keeps dragging on... The battlefield is not like training... It's a place of life or death.
