Traveler: Tell me about the Golden House...
Youxu: *sigh* I'm still frustrated... When the adepti paid us a visit, our forces were mustered and redeployed throughout the city to strengthen the guard...
Youxu: We only found out later via reports that the Golden House had been attacked. I knew such a day would come.
Youxu: I was just following orders, so I wasn't blamed, but... but this was an opportunity of a lifetime, and I let it slip away just like that...
Youxu: Now it feels like I've been guarding this place for this long, but all for naught... With my skills, I could surely have stopped the person who broke in.
Youxu: Hmm, you look skeptical. Don't you believe me?
