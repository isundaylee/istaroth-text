# Talk Dialog

Jifang: Now then, didn't you say you wanted to publish a book?
Hu Tao: Yes, I do.
Jifang: ...So where's the book?
Hu Tao: It's in the works! Just waiting on the poems!
Jifang: ...And where are the poems?
Hu Tao: They're on the way.
Jifang: ...Look, I'm sorry Director Hu, but how do you expect me to talk business with you when you don't even have the poems yet?
Hu Tao: I just figured while we're waiting, we could discuss terms in advance.
Jifang: Well, I need to see the content to decide if I even want to sell it, let alone how much to sell it for.
Hu Tao: Oh, come on, I showed you a sample already, and it was some of my finest work! Besides, you only need a few highlights to sell an anthology!
Jifang: ...You think your poem, "Fifteen Tenderloin Steaks" will carry the whole book, do you?
Hu Tao: That and "Square Meals In the Basement"! My consultant, the erudite Mr. Zhongli, described it as a meticulous masterpiece! Ooh â€” quote that on the cover! It'll practically sell itself!
Jifang: ...Director, we're a small business. If we invest money in printing and nobody buys it, it's my bottom line that's affected.
Hu Tao: Don't you worry! I guarantee you, when this anthology comes out, it will take the world by storm! Gods and ghosts alike will weep!
Hu Tao: As a matter of fact, I heard a ghost crying on the way here. If you don't believe me, I can bring it over?
Jifang: ...There'll be no need for that.
