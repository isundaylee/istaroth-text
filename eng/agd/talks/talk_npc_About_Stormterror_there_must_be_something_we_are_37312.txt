Jean: About Stormterror, there must be something we are still not aware of...
Traveler: How do we fight Stormterror?
Jean: Its change in size and power really is suspicious.
Jean: But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
Jean: The Grand Master entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I cannot let him or the people of Mondstadt down.
Jean: I must get to the bottom of this...
Traveler: Tell me about the Fatui.
Jean: Those people in strange uniforms... are Fatui.
Jean: They're here as delegates from Snezhnaya.
Jean: Stay away from them. Having contact with them is dangerous, even for innocent travelers.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: May the Wind guide you.
