Traveler: The Lord of Verdure's story.
Arakarman: All Aranara are children of the Dendro Archon, even Aramuhukunda.
Arakarman: The Dendro Archon loves all living things in Vana equally, whether they are Aranara, Nara, Mushrooms, or Rishboland Tigers... To her, all of them are green leaves on the same tree. Whether they are from the crown of the tree, or from the lowest branches, the leaves plucked from the tree all have the same shape.
Arakarman: So all living things return the same love to her.
Arakarman: But one day, the sky turned black and the streams became as acrid as blood... Big iron chunks and large ink-black monsters were everywhere. The forest started burning too, and Marana flowed out like spring water.
Arakarman: The Dendro Archon went to a land far, far away to cure the world. By the time she returned, many children had already returned to Sarva. The king of the forest, who once blessed the Aranara alongside her, had also returned to Sarva by then.
Arakarman: Many Aranara only knew what the taste of sadness was like for the first time when that happened.
