## Talk

Draff: We can't afford to lose any more people... Ever since the meteorites struck, it's become increasingly difficult to provide enough meat to fulfill the Good Hunter's orders...
Draff: I do wish that some of the younger hunters could learn to not let their curiosity get the better of them... *sigh*

## Talk

Draff: Hello there, Traveler! When the hunt is over, it's time to drink to your heart's content!
Draff: ...The meteorites? What about them? Pfft, it'd take more than a few new stones around town to get my attention! Now, bottom's up!

## Talk

Traveler: How's the haul?
Draff: Envious? Well, it's fine. I'm in a good mood right now. There's some leftover meat from our daytime delivery. Take it, take it!
Draff: It's on me, don't worry — but remember, the best meat has to go with the best wine!

## Talk

Draff: Traveler? What do you want?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Draff: I am Draff, you can think of me as the head of the hunters. The best hunter in the town.
Draff: Most of meat from our hunts goes straight to the Good Hunter, a restaurant in the city.
Draff: If you're here to make a bulk order of meat, I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to take it on.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Draff: Stay away from my daughter, Diona.
Draff: She will learn the hunting trade from me and take over as leader of this town.
Draff: But right now she's at that rebellious age, and she's gone off to work in the city as a bartender or something...
Draff: *sigh* Never mind, I just need to be patient. She's my daughter after all, and if she's got her heart set on doing something she'll not go back on it easily.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Draff: Bye.

## Talk

Draff: Aha, traveler!
Draff: When the hunt is over, it's time to drink to your heart's content! Here, come on...

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Draff: Put it like this — every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
Draff: And I am the head of those hunters!
Draff: You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...

## Talk

Traveler: You seem like you've drunk a lot...
Draff: No good hunting session is complete without a good drinking session afterwards!
Draff: What's more, my daughter Diona is one of the top bartenders in Mondstadt...
Draff: That hasn't changed how much she nags me about my drinking, mind you...
Traveler: How long is the hunt over for?
Draff: Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?

## Talk

Traveler: Uh, bye
Draff: Goodbye! Come early enough next time and there might still be a few drinks left for you! Hahaha!

## Talk

Traveler: Could you sell me some game you hunted?
Draff: Depends on how much you want... I can sell some of it to you. Anything you get from us directly is going to be fresher than anything you find in the shops.

## Talk

Draff: Traveler, I remember you. I see you've been getting more familiar with our town here.

## Talk

Traveler: How are things lately?
Draff: Well, what can I say? The last Springvale Cookoff was crowded with nearly the whole town discussing every topic under the sun. The better the conversations, the more meat they eat, you know.
Draff: As head of all the hunters in this town, I guess you could say I'm also the brains behind 'em all too, haha.
Draff: As for my great ancestor, Olaf, his relatives have all succumbed to the grip of time. What a pity...
Draff: When hunting season's over, I should show my respect for my ancestors by going out and drinking with him. It always feels kind of weird to say that...

## Talk

Draff: Aha, traveler!
Draff: When the hunt is over, it's time to drink to your heart's content! Here, come on...

## Talk

Traveler: You seem to be very happy.
Draff: Of course! Let me put it this way — every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
Draff: And I am the head of those hunters!
Draff: You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
Draff: Huh, now where's that great ancestor of mine gone to? Things get a bit fuzzy after drinking so much...

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Draff: To a hunter, nothing is more worth noting than the prey. I can't say if anything has made an impression on me otherwise.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?
Draff: With such fine wine before me, what would I care about what's nearby or anything...
Draff: Oh, don't look so uptight. How about joining me for a mug or two?
