# Selva Salad

An Aranara-style salad that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. Fresh and crispy Zaytun Peach slices are mixed with gently-squeezed Sumeru Roses, which adds a touch of distinctive flavor. Mint is used instead of sugar to avoid getting a sickening sweetness. A refreshing dish that pleases both the eyes and the nose.
