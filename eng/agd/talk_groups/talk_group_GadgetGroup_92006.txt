Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "A week before the incident, Master Takatsukasa Isamu caught a cold and lost his appetite. Rice was all he could eat and he had been taking some special cold medicine."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "The night before the incident, he had yet to recover and was still busy with his work, so I was worried about his health. When Dr. Shiroyama came to deliver the medicine, I consulted him about a health supplement."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "Dr. Shiroyama said fish-liver paste could help boost his immune system, so I went to the forensic office to retrieve some and gave it to Master Takatsukasa..."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "But by the next day... Really, Master Takatsukasa was so kind to me, I swear I wouldn't ever do that to him!"
Paimon: Hmm, come to think of it, Shiroyama was a forensic doctor... He could easily pull off something like this.
