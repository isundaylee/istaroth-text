Traveler: Tell me about "rocks"...
Avilix: The Tepetlisaurs are great at digging, so by living alongside them, we're basically living alongside rocks and ore.
Avilix: Oh, and besides those, we've also got solid phlogiston! You know what phlogiston is, right? You're already been here a while, after all.
Avilix: That's especially true for the Children of Echoes. Gems are really important to us â€” we see them almost like a second layer of our skin.
Avilix: If you want to live and work in Natlan, know this: the more gems someone is wearing, the harder they are to deal with.
