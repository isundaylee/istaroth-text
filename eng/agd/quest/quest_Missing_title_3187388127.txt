## Talk 1

Quenin: These inhuman creatures are truly tough adversaries... inhuman monsters, I should say. Greetings, brave warrior... I am Quenin, a member of this adventure team. My duty is...
Quenin: My duty... is to eliminate these monsters. Yes, I am a warrior of the adventure team. Be careful, brave warrior...
Quenin: These monsters... they are extremely cunning â€” capable of disguising themselves in different forms.
Quenin: Every night, before I fall asleep, I hear... the sounds they make from their hiding spots in these ancient ruins. This... is why I cannot sleep at the encampment.
Quenin: This place is filled with these monsters. You... must be careful, too.

## Talk 2

Quenin: Ah, this place really is cursed...
Quenin: Do not tarry here too long. You must leave, and quickly... Yes, you must leave before the coming of the pitch-black tide.
Quenin: Yes, the pitch-black tide. Its vast shadow is almost upon us. We must... Must ensure that everyone gets to safety. That everyone... is safely evacuated.

## Talk 3

Quenin: Why do you linger here still...?
Quenin: Our adventure team's leader, the hero who wore a falcon's mask, is already... We cannot hold out against them any longer...
Quenin: You must leave as soon as possible. This place is cursed, brave warrior. It is not somewhere that people should stay.

## Talk 4

Quenin: So you are still here, brave warrior.
Quenin: Once upon a time, so the scholars say, the ancient and tyrannical Lord of this Cinder City knew... a way to prevent Abyssal corrosion. So we...
Quenin: But there really is something ominous about this place, brave warrior. Lately, I too have begun to feel a little... strange.
Quenin: Sometimes, after waking, you'll find that a road that was perfectly intact just the day before has now become broken and dilapidated... And were those stone houses like that there to begin with? It feels like they should be more... complete.
Quenin: But sometimes, when I wake, I see friends who should not be here anymore... Are they monsters? That must be it... They're monsters that have taken the form of my friends.
Quenin: My... My duty here is to eliminate those monsters, but... why? Why do I have to do that?
Quenin: Anyway, all things said and done, this is a very strange place. You should leave... as soon as possible.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Quenin: You'd better leave at once. If you stay any longer, it'll be too late...
Quenin: Why will it be too late, you ask? Because... because our entire adventure team has been wiped out. That giant, pitch-black beast... They were all...
Quenin: They tasked me with protecting the evacuees, and at the very least, to ensure that they left the city. As we speak, a rescue team from the Flower-Feather Clan is on their way...
Quenin: I must eliminate these evil monsters, so that the survivors can return to a land upon which the sun shines... Huh, but... Why am I here again?
Quenin: That sound in my ears... Ahh, it's getting louder and louder. I... I have to go back to the waterfall. Yes, I must... return to the waterfall.
Quenin: Brave warrior, you too should leave... as soon as possible.
