# Talk Dialog

Xingqiu: #Traveler, perfect timing. I was just about to go look for you.
Traveler: Xingqiu, this gift envelope is for you.
Xingqiu: Thank you! Wow, your penmanship is beautiful! Much better than mine...
Xingqiu: Every Lantern Rite, the Feiyun Commerce Guild sends gift envelopes to our business partners...
Xingqiu: Great-grandpa always writes them by hand as a sign of respect. His calligraphy is a sight to behold â€” so sharp and elegant.
Xingqiu: In the eyes of our business partners, his envelopes are more valuable than any gift. They even frame them and put them on display.
Xingqiu: I suppose, in this case, the pen might even be mightier than gold.
Traveler: How's he feeling? Any better?
Xingqiu: Much better, thanks to you. He has enough energy to scold me for my lack of penmanship, that's for sure.
Xingqiu: He also said I should follow your example, strive to become a young hero like you...
Xingqiu: Eventually, my brother came over and distracted him so I could slip away. Otherwise, he might have nagged me until the end of time...
Traveler: You're already a young hero.
Xingqiu: Hahaha, I appreciate that, but there's no need to be so polite. It's too old-fashioned for my taste.
Xingqiu: I'll give you my gift envelope in a few days. I just need to wrap up a few things at home, and then we can grab a meal with Xiangling to celebrate.
Traveler: We can learn from each other.
Traveler: See you.
Xingqiu: See you around. The mountain roads can be dangerous, so be careful!
