Traveler: About the "Owl Musician"...
Alof: Ah, interested in this story as well? Allow me to give you a quick summary, then.
Alof: This story tells of a kingdom locked in battle against strange monsters.
Alof: ...Do forgive me for skipping over most of the combat abilities, magical effects, and so on.
Alof: The first third of the story is all about describing the special abilities of each guard in some detail... which, come to think of it, is probably why it was so popular among the troops.
Alof: In the second half, the monsters use their last resort, corroding the kingdom using a "dark night," before attacking through that darkness.
Alof: The guards were forced back to their final bastion â€” the palace interior. But the world outside was being eroded by the devouring darkness. Even the palace lamps were gradually extinguished.
Alof: As the final light went out, everyone readied themselves for the final battle, resolving to fight to the end, come what may.
