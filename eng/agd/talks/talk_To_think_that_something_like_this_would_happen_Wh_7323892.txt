Pyrrho: To think that something like this would happen. What a disgrace...
Pyrrho: As I thought, stuff regarding knowledge doesn't really suit me all that much. Too complicated.
Traveler: Tell me about the Order of Skeptics...
Pyrrho: Our top priority is choosing a new Vijnanapati, but as you can see, we do not have anyone who can currently fill that role.
Pyrrho: However, we have already asked Elder Aryadeva to invite an exceptional researcher to come over from the city.
Pyrrho: We have stood sentinel here these hundreds of years, and we have seen many a crisis through in our time. This is but a small problem. Don't worry about us!
Traveler: Not going over to the camp?
Pyrrho: All the more I should stand guard here at a time like this. If some ill-intentioned villains sneak in, things might really get bad.
Pyrrho: Even Miss Sosi told me not to go running around. She must rely on me quite a bit, I think.
Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Pyrrho: Haha, see you, then.
