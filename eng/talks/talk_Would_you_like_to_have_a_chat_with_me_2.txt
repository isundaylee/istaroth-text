# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yelan: I would be delighted.
Yelan: We should make some tea, too. Sipping tea, chatting, and just enjoying the time off, it's a great way to recharge.
Yelan: Hey, you're friendly with "Rain Calmer," aren't you? I hear she's a tea drinker, too. Why don't you treat me to some choice tea from her personal collection?
Traveler: Don't be mean to Tubby.
Yelan: Heh, I'm just pulling your leg. She let me try some of her tea already, and we had a lovely chat.
Yelan: The key to making sure a conversation goes well is choosing the right topic.
Yelan: For chatting with you... let's go with tracking techniques, ambush essentials, expanding your network of contacts, and setting up lookouts.
Traveler: So specialized...
Yelan: Hehe. Well, if you were just looking to shoot the breeze with me, I can get on board with that, too.
Yelan: You know me â€” role-playing's one of my biggest strengths.
Yelan: ...Seriously, though, I think the topics I mentioned are the ones really worth sharing with you.
Yelan: The things I've learned come from a mix of secret techniques taught by the Millelith Scouts, real-life cases of competition in the business world, and the experience of various overseas organizations.
Yelan: For someone like you, this knowledge is going to come in handy sooner or later.
Yelan: Once you've mastered it, you'll be able to avoid being pushed around by those in the know.
Yelan: Anyway, just remember to come to me if you ever want to improve in these areas. I'll teach you everything I know.
Traveler: So formal...
Traveler: You should go earn her trust yourself.
