Traveler: Why do you want to join up?
Thirona: Well, if I had to mention something, I don't really want to... That's more Granna's line of thought.
Thirona: She's a bit impulsive and rough around the edges when doing stuff, and she's very competitive â€” but that's what's cute about her, you know?
Thirona: I'd be quite worried for her if she really did manage to join, though.
Thirona: As such, if she wants in, then I want in along with her.
