# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Conclusion

Hosseini: #Traveler, you're finally back.
Traveler: How are your investigations going?
Hosseini: The Spike's adjustments have been completed. I'm still a little worried, but we can only leave it there in the tunnels.
Hosseini: I've asked Khedive to make some medicine for Tu and Hao as well.
Hosseini: #It's all up to you now, Traveler... initialize the Spike and seal the openings through which the dark mud is gushing out.
Hosseini: Honestly, when Khedive first came to me for help, I thought to myself that I'd just pack the Spike up and head to Sumeru if things didn't work out.
Hosseini: In any case, we had done enough experiments on the Pursina's Spikes already, more than enough to have data that could support a full report.
Hosseini: But Tu and Hao... If I just left them here, they would have to deal with this dangerous dark mud for the rest of their lives.
Hosseini: I decided that if my research could not help them, and was only good for publishing reports, then it would not be worth very much at all.
Hosseini: That's why I decided to find some way to stop the Ley Lines from spewing this mud. I must admit... that coming into contact with this dark mud was something of a wake-up call for me as well...
Hosseini: #I believe in your strength, but the areas where the mud flows freely are still very dangerous, so be careful, Traveler.
Traveler: Got it.
Hosseini: Hahahaâ€”hurk *cough* *cough*
Hosseini: I was talking about you. The Spike can indeed decrease the effect the mud has on the monsters if deployed at the Ley Line ruptures.
Hosseini: But the monsters that have been attracted thereto are just too numerous...
Hosseini: So please, you have to take care of yourself.
Traveler: I'll take care of the Spike.
