# Ever-Surging Memories


## Talk 1

Boileau: Monsieur Neuvillette?

## Talk 2

Corneille: I must keep the Melusines safe.
Herbier: I just can't sit back and watch...

## Talk 3

Corneille: I probably shouldn't disturb them...

## Talk 4

Thibert: Turn the murderer in!

## Talk 5

Suavegothe: Melusines can't be trusted! That goes for Neuvillette too!

## Talk 6

Clotaire: Peaceful coexistence? What a joke. Get out of the Court of Fontaine and don't ever come back!

## Talk 7

Carole: Hello, can I help with anything?
Baderico: Thanks, but no need.
Carole: Oh...
Carole: Hello! I'm Carole, a Melusine! Is there anything you need help with?
Simone: Get away from here! I'm calling the Gardes!
Carole: Please calm down... I don't mean to cause any harm.
Simone: Hmph, hard to say.
Clotaire: Yeah, we should probably stay away from these monsters. Haven't you realized? Strange incidents have been increasing ever since they came.
Simone: Why should we trust this species from who-knows-where anyway? I can't believe Neuvillette allowed them into the Court of Fontaine just like that.
Clodomir: Exactly! That so-called Chief Justice even granted them official positions. Not only that, but they're now responsible for investigating cases as well! I swear there's some hidden agenda at play here.
Clotaire: Go away! Quit acting innocent!
Carole: I'm not leaving! I won't let you say bad stuff about him!
Carole: We joined the Marechaussee Phantom and solved lots and lots of cases... We've never done anything wrong!
Clotaire: Solving cases? With Neuvillette in cahoots with you! You could've fabricated it all, and no one would know!
Clotaire: So tell me, how can you guarantee that you Melusines aren't involved in anything that occurred recently?
Carole: I...
Vautrin: Didn't I tell you before? Don't go advertising if you're not a good talker.
Carole: Vautrin?
Vautrin: Aside from spreading unjustified rumors, if you continue insulting members of the Marechaussee Phantom, the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol has every right to subject you to interrogation.
Vautrin: There have indeed been an increase in cases recently — perhaps due to the shifting currents of conspiracy, and I understand your concern. However, there has been no evidence pointing towards Melusines being involved.
Clotaire: Tsk, even the Captain of the Security Patrol is on their side. Neuvillette's newly "reformed" police force is already corrupt to the core...
Simone: How can two completely different species possibly coexist?
Carole: ...
Vautrin: You heard that?
Carole: Yeah.
Carole: I don't understand... Why won't anyone believe us?
Vautrin: There have been rumors saying that you were born from calamity... and that you inherently bring danger to those around you.
Vautrin: There are countless negative rumors about you floating around in Fontaine. It's near impossible for you to become a part of this society... best if you give up before it's too late.
Carole: Monsieur Neuvillette said that we needed to put both time and effort in. I don't know how long it'll take, but I can at least try making my best effort.
Carole: I still want to try a little harder. Thank you for bailing me out earlier.
Vautrin: *sigh*
Carole: Okay, I won't be taking any more of your time. I painted a lot of flyers last night, so I have to stay and hand them out to everyone...
Vautrin: Give them to me.
Carole: Y—You're not gonna take them away... right?
Vautrin: We'll hand them out together. The faster we get this done, the sooner we can head back.

## Talk 8

Carole: Monsieur Neuvillette, what's this?
Neuvillette: Medals of Peace, awarded to you and Vautrin.
Neuvillette: Thank you for your continuous dedication in the past five years. You've taken one small step forward in helping Melusines gain the trust of humans.
Vautrin: I think I'll pass...
Carole: Hey, don't say that. We wouldn't have made it this far without you!
Carole: It won't be long before Melusines begin living peacefully with the humans... Just the thought of it makes me happy.
Vautrin: Don't keep your hopes up. We've barely scratched the surface. There's still a long way to go before that dream of yours comes true.
Carole: Ugh, you blockhead! Don't ruin the mood!
Neuvillette: Vautrin brings up a good point. The trust humans have placed in you is still very fragile. Any small incident could undermine the hard work you've put in.
Neuvillette: Please be on your guard for the next few days.
Vautrin: Yes, Sir.
Carole: ...Okay, got it.
Thibert: Medal of Peace? Ha, "peace" isn't going to give us back what's rightfully ours.
Suavegothe: Are you sure we should do this? We're no match for Neuvillette, even with all our powers combined. What if...
Thibert: Nah, not gonna happen. As long as he remains in his position, there's no chance he'd take us out personally.
Thibert: There are rules even he must comply with in the political sphere... unless he wants to become an enemy of Fontaine.
Thibert: So quit worrying and just go ahead with it. I've already planned out the murder. Once we lay the blame on the Melusines, as the person who brought them to the Court of Fontaine, Neuvillette will be left with no excuse.
Suavegothe: I guess you're right. Ugh, if he'd just left things the way they were, it never would've had to come to this... But he's forced our hand. Time to teach him a lesson.

## Talk 9

Rastignac: The results of the investigation are in, Captain Vautrin.
Vautrin: Go on.
Rastignac: There is no direct evidence, but reasonable inference indicates that the ones controlling the situation are supporters of the old regime whose interests have been undermined by the reform.
Rastignac: They tricked Miss Carole into going to the crime scene and pressed charges against her. After that, they incited panic among the people in order to make Monsieur Neuvillette confess to his mistakes and yield up power.
Rastignac: The Gardes were stopped by the enraged mob and couldn't intervene in time. Miss Carole... chose to sacrifice herself to pacify the situation.
Vautrin: ...
Vautrin: And she called ME a blockhead...!
Vautrin: A little investigation would've cleared things up! Why didn't she wait until we'd established the truth? She didn't have to prove her innocence like that...
Rastignac: The situation had rapidly escalated to a physical altercation between infuriated citizens and the Gardes. Miss Carole might've thought there was no better plan...
Vautrin: *sigh* That is indeed something she'd do.
Rastignac: Captain Vautrin, should I present these results to Monsieur Neuvillette right away?
Vautrin: There's no need. Notify the Gardes to restrict public access to all information.
Rastignac: Restrict access to... Wait, are you planning to—
Vautrin: There's something I've never told Carole — I had a little sister named Illaria who passed away when I was very young.
Vautrin: She's just like Carole in every possible way. Innocent, kind... always believing the best of people. People like her are the most vulnerable to deception and betrayal.
Vautrin: From the moment I met Carole, I knew that she'd be easily manipulated by others. I kept a cold demeanor and tried lecturing her into giving up...
Rastignac: ...Looks like she was unfazed by that.
Vautrin: Yes. In fact, some of her spirit must've rubbed off on me instead... because I too began working towards that pie-in-the-sky dream of hers.
Vautrin: I should've known. Those cowards don't have the guts to confront Neuvillette — they even avoided causing trouble for me... They were after Carole all along.
Vautrin: Can you understand how I feel? Right now, there's only one thought on my mind: Only through bloodshed can their debt be repaid.
Rastignac: I understand, but I'm certain Monsieur Neuvillette wouldn't accept that as a solution.
Vautrin: That's exactly why we need to keep this a secret. Give me the list of suspects. What happens after this has nothing to do with any of you.
Vautrin: I will take responsibility for everything.

## Talk 10

Baderico: Did you know? They're hearing a major case today, and the criminal is Captain Vautrin of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol!
Baderico: Apparently, he resorted to personal measures to seek revenge for Carole and settled the score with the group that framed his friend... Hey, why aren't you saying anything?
Lothaire: I'm thinking... We should try our best to bail him out when the trial commences.
Baderico: Bail him out? Why?
Lothaire: Shh, keep it down. Haven't you realized? Both Vautrin and Carole are Neuvillette's most trusted subordinates. After everything that happened to Carole, Neuvillette's guaranteed to do everything he can to keep Vautrin around.
Lothaire: Besides, now that the old regime has been uprooted, Neuvillette's status is secure as can be. As long as we redirect public opinion, Neuvillette will be able to give Vautrin a reprieve. The benefits are endless...
Black Screen Text: A raucous commotion gradually began to rise in the opera house...
Baderico: Vautrin sought vengeance for his friend for a valid cause. This represents the justice he upholds!
Baderico: Please think about it. If the same thing had happened to you, wouldn't you feel the same way as he did?
Prume: Yeah, that's right!
Lothaire: This whole thing started because of those despicable cowards who levied false accusations against Carole! How could Vautrin be declared guilty for seeking revenge?
Vautrin: Monsieur Neuvillette...
Baderico: Mr. Vautrin is innocent!
Lothaire: He's innocent!
Neuvillette: Order.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: I acknowlege your arguments. Vautrin, your revenge could be seen as a form of justice.
Neuvillette: I understand your decision. Which is why I cannot help but feel regret... and even grief about the judgment I must now impose.
Neuvillette: However, personal justice does not equate to justice as defined by the law. To execute your plan for revenge, you abused your authority and conducted informal executions. Your actions have thus violated the law.
Neuvillette: Therefore, you will be declared... guilty.
Baderico: What!?
Lothaire: That can't be... Monsieur Neuvillette, please give this a little more thought. He has done so much for Fontaine!
Neuvillette: Vautrin... my friend. Is there anything else you want to say?
Vautrin: Neuvillette...
Vautrin: What have I done to deserve this? I've closely followed every one of your orders! Can't you see? Everyone in this room believes that I'm innocent... why can't you just let me off!?
Vautrin: Is this what justice means to you? Answer me, Neuvillette!!
Neuvillette: ...Order.
Neuvillette: Since there have been no further objections, the Oratrice will now deliver the final verdict regarding the charges against Mr. Vautrin.
Neuvillette: According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Mr. Vautrin will be declared... guilty.
Black Screen Text: "Goodbye, Monsieur Neuvillette."
Black Screen Text: "This all happened because of Carole's naive ideas..."
Black Screen Text: "How can different species peacefully coexist anyway?"

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey, stop spacing out!
Paimon: #Traveler, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
Traveler: What was that...
Neuvillette: Apologies, it seems like my memories got the better of me.
Neuvillette: I tried my best to suppress the power of Hydro within myself, but it seems like it still caused the emotions within the Fountain of Lucine to boil over.
Neuvillette: Due to my negligence, the overflow of emotions and memories must have affected you as well. Are you alright?
Traveler: I'm fine.
Paimon: Wow! The Hydro Dragon is more powerful than Paimon thought...
Paimon: #Anyway, the last time we came here, Traveler only heard voices from the Fountain of Lucine... No "emotions boiling over" or anything.
Neuvillette: It is as you said. This might be because I'm different.
Neuvillette: It is not only the Fountain. I can sense emotions from all waters in Fontaine. Rivers, lakes... and even the rain.
Paimon: That sounds awesome!
Neuvillette: But I rarely ever do anything like this. Emotions carried by water are always chaotic and disconnected. As an outsider, having my mind occupied with irrelevant memories isn't exactly a pleasant experience.
Traveler: The memories I saw were related to you.
Neuvillette: Which ones?
Traveler: From when you brought Carole to the Court of Fontaine...
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: It's fine. I prefer not to speak of those memories, but that does not mean I am deliberately hiding them.
Neuvillette: It was a coincidence, but perhaps it is a good thing that you saw everything in that form.
Neuvillette: You should now understand why I believe there to be a conspiracy behind all this... These two cases are much too similar. I felt like I needed to do something.
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon's starting to lose track of what you're saying...
Paimon: Don't leave Paimon out of the conversation! Paimon wants to help too!
Neuvillette: Then let us get back to the point. While I was investigating the Fountain, I discovered something strange.
Neuvillette: I did not sense too much hatred towards me within its accumulated emotions.
Neuvillette: I don't know what caused this to happen, but it seems like there won't be a shortcut to finding the organization that may be pulling the strings here.
Neuvillette: However, I did find some resentment directed towards Kiara. If I remember correctly, it seemed to be related to a smuggling case.
Paimon: Oh! Didn't we read about that in one of those documents?
Neuvillette: You've read about it? In that case, the resentment should've come from that incident—
Navia: Huh, what are you doing here? I was just about to look for you at the Palais Mermonia.
Paimon: Navia! Nice to see you again! Is there something we can help with?
Navia: I've heard some things... But I'm not purposely asking around or anything, don't worry!
Navia: Rumors are abroad that someone's scheming against Melusines, and that you're investigating the case.
Navia: So I told the Spina di Rosula to keep an eye out for leads. We've had unfamiliar faces showing themselves at the Fleuve Cendre lately. Maybe you'll find the suspects among them.
Neuvillette: Thank you.
Neuvillette: ...Where did you hear about all this?
Navia: #The Chief Justice out on investigation, accompanied by Traveler from afar... No matter how you conceal your whereabouts, there will be countless eyes watching you.
Navia: You talked to Kiara, but didn't ask her to keep things secret. People curious to know asked around for information. Then, it was only a matter of time before word of the threatening letter spread all across Fontaine.
Paimon: So that's what Charlotte meant...
Neuvillette: Indeed. I did not expect that this could be kept hidden for too long, but the rumors still spread faster than I imagined.
Navia: Hmm... You know, it could be because... you attract more attention than you think.
Navia: Anyway, any progress with the investigation?
Neuvillette: The suspects who threatened Kiara might have to do with a certain smuggling case, but it is still uncertain if there is, in fact, another party behind all this.
Neuvillette: We are planning to return to the Palais Mermonia to revisit some details and identify the senders of that threatening letter.
Navia: Alright, then I'll round up the Spina di Rosula and follow up on their progress.
Navia: Wait for my word. Ta-ta!
Paimon: Neuvillette, do you think there will be any problems now that the word is out?
Neuvillette: I have already considered that possibility, and I do not think there will be any. As a matter of fact, once the word gets out, no one would dare to harm Kiara in broad daylight.
Neuvillette: What is more important is how the case is perceived by the public. Four hundred years ago, they chose to side with the old regime and direct their resentment towards the Melusines.
Neuvillette: ...I hope the same won't happen again. Let us head back to the Palais.
Paimon: Strange... What are these people doing out on the streets so late at night?
Paimon: Did something happen? Let's take a look around!
Corneille: Have you heard? Someone's plotting against a Melusine! This is one hundred percent the truth — even the Chief Justice is investigating in person!
Serrurier: WHAT? That's it! Who's been threatening Melusines? Show yourself!
Herbier: Our enemies are lurking in the shadows and won't easily reveal themselves, but no amount of hiding will keep us from finding them!
Corneille: That's exactly what I wanted to say! The Gardes have already begun to take action... We can't just stand by and watch.
Corneille: Think about how much we owe them! Now that they're in danger, how can we sit back and do nothing?
Herbier: Everyone, please stay alert to your surroundings from now on. If you see any suspicious persons, report them to the Gardes immediately.
Veleda: It feels like you've been following me this whole time. Did something happen?
Delphine: We were informed that...
Lori: Ahem! Nope, we just finished our shifts and happened to be strolling by.
Veleda: Have you had dinner yet? Why don't we check out the new items at the dessert shop together?
Delphine: This isn't a good time to be out and about.
Lori: C'mon, don't act tough. I bet you're hungry too.
Delphine: *sigh* Alright, let's go buy a cake or something.
Veleda: You shouldn't ever skip meals, especially if you have another shift scheduled for later.
Cooper: I heard even Neuvillette's keeping an eye on the situation. Haha, this is the perfect chance to get promoted. We gotta make sure we give it all we've got!
Bruno: Seriously? Were you planning to shirk your duties if Neuvillette wasn't involved?
Cooper: Relax, I was just playing. We've worked together for years now. If something happened to them, I'd be haunted by regret for the rest of my life.
Bruno: That's more like it. We should stand guard until the criminal has been caught.
Serrurier: Come and fight me instead, you cowards!
Corneille: Have you heard? Even the Special Patrol came to help...
Cooper: Shh, look! Isn't that Neuvillette? I think he's looking at us!
Paimon: Looks like there's nothing to worry about.
Neuvillette: Mm.
Neuvillette: ...This is truly wonderful.
Paimon: Sooo... Wanna go over and say hi?
Neuvillette: No, I should stay where I am. My appearance could give rise to unnecessary commotion.
Neuvillette: Let us stick to our plan and return to the Palais Mermonia. The faster we uncover the truth, the better.
Traveler: To when you declared Vautrin guilty.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Serrurier: Hmph, no one can stay hidden on my watch.

### Additional Talk 2

Cooper: *sigh* All this reminds me of a rumor I've heard.
Bruno: What rumor?
Cooper: I've heard that the emblem on our hats didn't always look like this.
Cooper: A long time ago, Melusines weren't a part of the design. The police emblem only included the scales symbolizing the law.
Cooper: The emblem was redesigned later on to commemorate a Melusine's sacrifice.
Bruno: That must've been a long time ago...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, Navia, we're here!
Paimon: Whoa, check out all these people... Hey there, are you Navia's friends too?
Navia: These are the people who have had recent dealings with the Marechaussee Phantom. They're usually hidden in the Fleuve Cendre, but I sent for someone to invite them over.
Neuvillette: Invite them over?
Navia: Exactly. Now, I heard there's great coffee here, and so I asked them if they'd like to come and have some.
Oudinot: Y—Yeah, it's our pleasure to be guests of the Spina di Rosula...
Massena: Haha, I've wanted to have a meet-up like this for ages!
Paimon: Uh, something feels off...
Paimon: But oh well. Let's get back to business. Is there anyone called Esseim here?
Esseim: Yes, that's me.
Neuvillette: You're Esseim?
Esseim: Y—Yes, Monsieur Neuvillette...
Neuvillette: Did you write that threatening letter to Kiara?
Esseim: Um...
Navia: Ahem.
Esseim: I—I did. But I was just following orders...
Neuvillette: Orders from whom?
Esseim: ...Domenico. He was my boss... I couldn't disobey his orders...
Navia: Domenico? Where is he now?
Neuvillette: The Fortress of Meropide.
Navia: Well, ah, I'm afraid even the Spina would have trouble looking into that place.
Navia: Looks like you'll have to make the trip yourselves. This was as much as I could do.
Neuvillette: You've done more than enough. I am extremely grateful for your help.
Navia: Leave the formalities for later. You should find Domenico first.
Navia: If he really is the one setting up the conspiracy, it'd be best if he's exposed as soon as possible.
Paimon: Alright then, let's head to the Fortress right now!

### Additional Talk 4

Arouet: Neuvillette made an appearance in person! This is the perfect chance to make a name for myself.
Arouet: Hmm... But how should I make the most of this and get the word out...
