Traveler: Hello there, Uncle Anpu.
Uncle Anpu: Ah, it's you! How have you been?
Uncle Anpu: Isak mentioned you to me earlier. Said that he wanted to thank you properly.
Uncle Anpu: That kid's fond of you â€” I can tell. You're quite the example to him.
Uncle Anpu: A good thing, of course. Always good to see children be enthusiastic and hardworking. Always glad to see that.
Uncle Anpu: If you aren't going to be too busy in the next couple of days, perhaps you might want to rest your feet here. Aaru Village will always welcome you.
