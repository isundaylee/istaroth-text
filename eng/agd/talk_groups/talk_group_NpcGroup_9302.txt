Kaeya: #Do you wanna know the trick to drinking hard liquor, Traveler? It's all about pacing yourself.
Kaeya: Take a small sip, then give your tastebuds some time to rest. The burning sensation spreads to your lips, then the aftertaste kicks in. Once you can take a breath in without tasting anything, then you can take your next sip.

Kaeya: #Heh. Alright, don't worry, Traveler. I'll start taking this seriously.
