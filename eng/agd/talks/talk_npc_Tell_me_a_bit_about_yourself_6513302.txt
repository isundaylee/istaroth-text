Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Augereau: I'm a member of the Gardes in charge of keeping Romaritime Harbor safe. Feel free to call for me if you encounter any trouble.
Augereau: I've got a good pair of eyes and a quick pair of legs, so any suspect who wishes to escape outside our borders will have to pass me first.
Augereau: Haha, just kidding. I exaggerate, somewhat.
Augereau: People come and go all around this place, but most of the work is done by machines â€” everything's pretty well organized.
