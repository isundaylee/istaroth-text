# Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon


## Talk 1

Ningguang: Beidou is salvaging some of my Jade Chamber collection out of the sea around Guyun Stone Forest. If that sounds like your idea of fun, you should go pay her a visit.

## Talk 2

Ningguang: A great many things are still unaccounted for...
Traveler: Things like what?
Ningguang: The new Jade Chamber is missing many of the contents held by its predecessor.
Ningguang: All the literature, furniture, and ornaments I had collected followed the original Jade Chamber to its watery grave...
Ningguang: Most of it was destroyed in the process, and the small handful of items that survived intact are strewn across the water's surface. Reclaiming them is taxing work.
Ningguang: It takes someone with sturdy sea legs to handle this job, but even then... I just can't tell whether Beidou will be able to fish out everything herself.
Traveler: "Fish out"?
Paimon: Wait, so you made Beidou go and fish your stuff out of the sea for you?
Ningguang: To claim that I "made" her do anything would be imprecise. We reached a mutually beneficial agreement, as is always the case in our dealings.
Traveler: You pay Beidou to run errands for you?
Ningguang: Payment is one aspect of it. But I also compensate her in other ways... Hehe, let's just say it's a little complicated.
Ningguang: Anyway, Beidou is currently in the Guyun Stone Forest area.
Ningguang: If you're interested, go pay her a visit. You may be just the help she needs.

## Talk 3

Beidou: Ugh, Ningguang... you're really trying my patience...
Beidou: I'm sorry, but if the Jade Chamber smashed into smithereens when it hit the sea, then so did everything inside it. Just because I know the ocean doesn't mean I have the power to fish up the past...
Traveler: ...The salvaging is going pretty smoothly, then?
Beidou: Oh, Traveler. What're you doing out this way?
Traveler: I'm here to help out.
Beidou: Great! You couldn't have picked a better time. The whole fleet's caught up with other things right now, so I'll take all the help I can get.
Beidou: Look, I even had to rope Xinyan into this.
Traveler: Whoa, Xinyan's here!
Paimon: Yeah, what's the occasion? Did you come all the way out here to do a performance?
Xinyan: You bet I did! Nothing official, mind you. Beidou wanted to hold a feast onboard and I agreed to come play a couple o' tunes.
Xinyan: But all that went out the window when someone showed up saying they were one of Ningguang's secretaries. They called Beidou away.
Beidou: I think it was Baiwen, or Baixiao...? Ugh, well it was Bai-something.
Beidou: Anyway. Ningguang apparently came up with the bright idea of me going out on the sea and salvaging a bunch of her old valuables. She seems pretty willing to shell out for it, too.
Beidou: Hmph... Well, at the end of the day, the price was right. So yeah, we took the work.
Beidou: Now, if we're gonna go trawling for trinkets, we're gonna need a smaller vessel.
Beidou: All the available boats have been dispatched already. But by the looks of it, we're still one short...
Traveler: I have my own boat.
Beidou: So you have your own vessel do ya? Hah! Great, let's take yours, then.
Beidou: The more people we have on this job the better. 'Cause the sooner we get this wrapped up, the sooner we can get that feast going and actually enjoy the festival!

## Talk 4

Xinyan: Seems like the Treasure Hoarders are more of a mixed bag than I thought...

## Talk 5

Xinyan: Huh? Why're they heading back to shore?
Beidou: To reconvene with their posse, I'll bet.
Beidou: Speed it up a notch, Traveler. This is a chase now.

## Talk 6

Carmen: Stop! All of you!
Carmen: Are you blind? Can't you see this is Captain Beidou!?
Carmen: Hehe... Cap'n Beidou, it's been a while. Still fighting fit, I see.
Beidou: I guess it has been a while, Carmen. You're looking a little worse for wear.
Beidou: Maybe if you did your own dirty work rather than dispatching your minions, you wouldn't be so out of breath right now.
Carmen: Ah, how you jest, Beidou, very amusing... Hahaha...
Beidou: To get serious for a second, though — I'm gonna be needing all of this. So put everything down and I won't cause you any more trouble.
Carmen: Of course, of course, whatever Cap'n Beidou wants... You heard her, people. Drop the goods!
Carmen: Here you are, it's all here. So, uh... w—we'll take our leave now.
Black Screen Text: Carmen dashes away with the Treasure Hoarders...
Paimon: Wow, he did what we asked without a second thought...
Traveler: He couldn't surrender quickly enough.
Xinyan: Couldn't run off quickly enough, either...
Beidou: Don't waste any more time on them. We've still got salvaging to do.
Beidou: Ah, but we should load this stash onto the boat first... C'mon, Traveler, help me out here.

## Talk 7

Beidou: I wonder what's taking Sea Drake so long... Could he have run into the Treasure Hoarders, too?

## Talk 8

Liuliu: C'mon, we gotta wrap this up soon! Leave the junk, take anything and everything of value!
Liuliu: And I need a few of you to go and load the boat up, move it!
Beidou: Whatever you're about to do — don't. And whatever goods you're holding — they're mine now.
Liuliu: B—Beidou!? Wh—What are you doing here!?
Beidou: I might ask you the same question.
Liuliu: I mean, what does it look like? We got lucky. Found some treasure floating around in the ocean.
Liuliu: If you see anything you like, it's yours for the taking! A token of our esteem for the mighty Captain Beidou, hahaha!
Beidou: Is that right? Well, good. I'll take it all.
Liuliu: I... But... C'mon, heh, be reasonable here...
Liuliu: Me and the guys have been busting a gut gathering all this up... you gotta leave us a little something-something, surely?
Beidou: Lemme make this crystal clear: These things do not belong to you, and they never will. So you're gonna put them down, and then you're gonna get as far away from me as is physically possible.
Liuliu: That's a little, uh... Heh, why don't we start over, huh? You see, we—
Beidou: Huh... sounds a lot like you're stalling to me.
Beidou: Talk is cheap. Let's settle this the old-fashioned way!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Boy, they sure ran off quickly...
Beidou: Eh, who cares. They didn't take anything with them.
Beidou: The bigger problem here is, there's no way all of this is going to fit onto your boat.
Beidou: Hmm... Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Unload the boat and put everything here, in one place.
Beidou: Based on the original plan, Sea Drake's boat should be coming past here at some point. When they get here, we'll hitch a ride with them.
Beidou: In the meantime, Traveler, head back to the Jade Chamber and deliver a message to Ningguang for me.
Beidou: Just tell her we're almost done fishing for trinkets here, so she should start getting my compensation ready.
Traveler: Got it.
Beidou: Alright. Thanks, Traveler.
Beidou: If both Carmen and Liuliu were here... Then I wonder if that other "boss" of theirs, Big Sis, is snooping around?
Beidou: I've gotta tell Sea Drake and the rest of the crew to stay on high alert...

## Talk 10

Ningguang: Welcome back. I trust Beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
Traveler: Let me fill you in...
Black Screen Text: You bring Ningguang up to speed on the events so far...
Ningguang: Treasure Hoarders, I see... Yes, I can imagine that must have been rather irksome.
Ningguang: It sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. But it won't end there. They are not the type to forgive and forget.
Ningguang: You needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. Leave them to Beidou — she is well versed in handling Treasure Hoarders. I will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
Ningguang: I also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver Beidou's message. Here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
Ningguang: Now, please excuse me, I have other business that demands my attention. I wish you a fun-filled festival.
