# Bantan Sango Case File: Misdirection


## Talk 1

Ryuuji: Traveler, we meet again. Thanks to your help last time, Sango is now sure of our culprit's identity.
Ryuuji: But if we want that culprit to go down for real, we still need some preparation.
Ryuuji: While she's dealing with other things. Let's continue the work that we started previously.
Traveler: Looking for trouble with the Treasure Hoarders?
Ryuuji: That's right. Though that culprit has nothing to do with those Treasure Hoarders...
Ryuuji: Those Treasure Hoarders are up to no good anyway, so we may as well have them "help" us.
Ryuuji: Sango has marked out their specific location. It's not far from the city.
Ryuuji: As for matters within the city... Sango has secretly instructed Amano and Mr. Andou to assist us in this operation.
Ryuuji: She has also promised that the credit for solving this case will all go to them, so they'll gladly work with us.
Ryuuji: Leave the thinking and planning to her. Let's just keep up our "correspondence" with those Treasure Hoarders.
Ryuuji: I have also marked the location on your map. Let's get going now.
Traveler: Deceiving our culprit?
Ryuuji: That's right. We must make him continue to believe that our target is the Treasure Hoarders.
Ryuuji: This way, Sango will have more time to complete her plan.
Ryuuji: *chuckles*... Not that those Treasure Hoarders were up to any good anyway...
Ryuuji: So we may as well enlist their "help."

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: Yeah, we made quite a big ruckus this time too. Amano and Mr. Andou will assist us in letting that thief learn about this in town.
Traveler: How much longer will this take?
Ryuuji: Not long now. Once Sango is ready, we can close this case.
Ryuuji: Here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Ryuuji: This is the amount assigned by Sango herself, so I believe it should be commensurate. Please take them. We may yet have more work for you in the future.
