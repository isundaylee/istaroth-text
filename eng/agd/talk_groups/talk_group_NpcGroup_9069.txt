Traveler: How do you like it here?
Tighnari: Hmm, this place has a peaceful environment and a wonderful view. Very pleasant.
Tighnari: ...Perhaps a little too pleasant.
Tighnari: Look, I've already mapped out an itinerary of my stay.
Traveler: You're planning on doing some forest-watching here?
Tighnari: Haha, that would be going too far. This place was constructed by magic, right? I don't sense any dangers.
Tighnari: And I'm guessing that the only ones who can get in here are those you have specifically invited.
Tighnari: If they're your friends, I'm sure they won't cause any major disturbances.
Tighnari: ...Right? They wouldn't, would they?
Traveler: Are you conducting research?
Tighnari: Erm... half and half.
Tighnari: I'm just wandering around here and there, observing various flora as I always do.
Tighnari: This is equal parts research and normal life.
Tighnari: But I should probably take a more relaxed approach while I'm here. I'll only plan 60% of my typical itinerary.
Tighnari: Should you need me, come find me any time.

Traveler: Want to chat?
Tighnari: Of course. Anything you want to talk about?
Tighnari: If you let me start the conversation, it would definitely be about plants.
Traveler: It's fine. I was expecting that, anyway.
Tighnari: Oh? So you're ready for class?
Tighnari: Then let us begin with the basics. Botany is a branch of biology that focuses on the morphology, taxonomy, ecology, genetics, and evolution of plants.
Tighnari: The basic taxonomical classification of plants is as follows:
Traveler: Zzz... zzz...
Tighnari: No daydreaming, sleepyhead! This is what you asked for.
Tighnari: ...Heh, alright, I'm only teasing. People who don't work in this field don't have to bash their heads against the books.
Tighnari: However, you spend a considerable amount of time traveling and traipsing through the outdoors. It would behoove you to learn a thing or two about common plants.
Tighnari: For instance, discerning a plant's growth patterns to orient position, how to use stems and leaves to acquire potable water...
Tighnari: Which fruits are edible and palatable, which herbs are suitable for cooking with meat...
Traveler: Oh no, I'm starting to drool...
Tighnari: Hey, what's the matter with you!? Is this what happens when you hear anything remotely about food?
Traveler: It's mostly Paimon's fault...
Tighnari: Ah yes, your little partner...
Tighnari: She doesn't seem the most... intellectual sort, but she cares deeply about you.
Tighnari: Even if it's only for the sake of protecting your companion, you should learn more about the natural sciences.
Tighnari: Ah... Sorry, I slipped into training mode there for a second, look at me, talking to you like you're a rookie Forest Ranger. ...Please forgive me.
Tighnari: Anyway, you're smart enough to understand what I meant.
Tighnari: If you ever wish to learn more about flora, my door is open any time.
Traveler: Professor, I'm hungry.
Traveler: *yawn*
Traveler: Teach me something, Professor.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Tighnari: Me? Just thinking about some recent tasks that need to be completed.
Tighnari: This week, I have to observe some experiments and record their results at Pardis Dhyai. It's also about time to draw up the next patrol schedule for the rangers...
Tighnari: Nothing especially urgent, though, so this can all wait.
Tighnari: So? Anything in particular you want to do?
Traveler: Hmm... Nope.
Tighnari: Oh? So then, why did you ask?
Tighnari: Alright, I'll go ahead. Please answer one question for me.
Tighnari: Yes or no: Do you want to rub my ears?
Traveler: Wha... You're turning this back to me!?
Tighnari: Don't blame me, I gave you the opportunity to go first.
Tighnari: Actually, uh... I don't really mind if someone I'm close to rubs my ears, you know?
Tighnari: I'm not sure why, but everyone always seems to think that it would make me angry.
Tighnari: Over time, "Do not discuss ears or tails in Tighnari's presence" became something of an unspoken rule.
Tighnari: It can sometimes be quite amusing to watch people's faces as they stumble over their words.
Tighnari: It's probably for the best, anyway. It might get irritating if people I barely knew started coming up to me and getting all touchy-feely.
Traveler: So you're saying that I can...?
Tighnari: Of course.
Tighnari: They might not feel as nice as you're imagining, though. They honestly just feel like anything you'd find on a regular cat or dog.
Traveler: Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Tighnari: I give you an inch, so you take a mile?
Tighnari: ... *sigh* Okay, fine.
Tighnari: As long as you're happy.
Tighnari: I'd be willing to take hundreds of group photos with you, so a pat or three is nothing.
Traveler: Hehe, so about your tail...
Traveler: Ah! I'm busted!
Tighnari: Your gaze seems to have been wandering slowly earwards the whole time we've been talking.

Traveler: Good morning, Tighnari.
Tighnari: Morning. The day's plans are best made at dawn. The early bird catches the worm.
Tighnari: Early-rising worms might object to this, of course, but that's just how the food chain works.
Tighnari: See, no matter how early they rise, a tree's leaves will still get eaten by insects. You don't hear them complaining, do you?

## Talk 9

Tighnari: This cabin looks very familiar indeed. I see you've been treating our excursions as an opportunity to admire the scenery in quite some detail...
Tighnari: Just being here makes me want to start planning my schedule... Force of habit, I suppose.
Tighnari: Well, there's plenty of space — would you like to sit with me and try your hand at writing something yourself?

## Talk 10

Tighnari: Very diverse range of plants you have here. Clearly, you have a keen interest in botany.
Tighnari: Excellent. If nurtured, a budding interest can become a fruitful source of knowledge. In fact — why don't you tell me about each of these species? Their growth habits, preferences, et cetera?
Tighnari: Don't worry, I'm here to fill in anything you leave out. I have a feeling it'll stick in your memory this time.
