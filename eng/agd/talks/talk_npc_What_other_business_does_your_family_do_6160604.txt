Traveler: What other business does your family do?
Goth: Apart from the hotel, we also offer rental accommodation. It's more cost-effective for longer-term visitors.
Goth: But we don't have any vacancies right now. Since the Fatui booked out the whole hotel, demand for rented accommodation has soared.
Goth: Speaking of vacancies... Technically, we do have one place still available. But someone went and locked the door with some kind of seal, and now it won't open. We can't exactly rent it out when the tenant won't be able to get inside...
Goth: All this is to say that if you're looking to rent, the best I can offer is to put a word in with the folks who deal with that side of things, ask them to keep an eye out for you.
