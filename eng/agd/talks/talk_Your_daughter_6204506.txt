Chef Mao: Your daughter?
Chef Mao: That's right — Xiangling! My dear daughter, and my best apprentice ever.
Chef Mao: I only taught Xiangling how to cook so that she could inherit the Wanmin Restaurant from me one day. I had no idea she'd turn out to be such a pro. Her abilities far exceed my own.
Chef Mao: But she's more than just an excellent chef. She has a real gift for innovation — she's constantly creating all these wonderful new dishes. That really sets her apart from what the time-honored brands do. And it makes her dishes all the more special for people who are used to traditional cuisine.
Chef Mao: I started to worry that the restaurant might be too constricting for her. So I sent her off for a while to do some exploring and perfect her art.
Chef Mao: If anyone is going to revolutionize Liyue cuisine in the future, it'll be her. No doubt about it!
