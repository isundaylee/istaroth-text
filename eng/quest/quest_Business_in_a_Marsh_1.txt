# Business in a Marsh


## Talk 1

Huai'an: *sigh* It's just one thing after another...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Huai'an: This location... It's a real challenge to run an inn here.
Huai'an: It could just be me, but I feel like we're seeing more and more monsters around these parts recently.
Huai'an: They wouldn't dare come anywhere near the inn itself, but guests need to get in and out and the Millelith can't be here all the time.
Huai'an: If you're free, do you think you could take a look around and clear out any monsters nearby?
Traveler: Okay.
Huai'an: Haha... Ah, I must say I do find your forthrightness refreshing...
Huai'an: Speaking of tiring jobs... I do feel bad making you do this.
Huai'an: But I promise I will make it worth your time.
Huai'an: Best of luck, and thank you.
Traveler: This issue seems self-inflicted...
Huai'an: Yes, we should have known what we were getting into when we chose the location.
Huai'an: But then, where would passing travelers stay if it weren't for us?
Huai'an: It's a tiring job, but a necessary one.

## Talk 2

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: Not yet.
Huai'an: Okay. Well, take your time. These monsters may be no end of trouble to people coming and going, but they wouldn't dare set foot in the inn itself.
Huai'an: And in the highly unlikely event that a few of the gutsier ones did venture inside... I'm sure I could, ahem, persuade them to leave. My guests' safety would not be at risk.
Huai'an: No one runs an inn this far out of town unless they know a bit of self-defense!

## Talk 3

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: All clear.
Huai'an: Great. Thanks a lot.
Huai'an: Here's your payment.
Huai'an: These days, honestly... If I hadn't done martial arts since I was a kid, I wouldn't dream about working in the hospitality sector.
