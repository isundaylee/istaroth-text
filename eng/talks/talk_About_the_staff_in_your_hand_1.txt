Traveler: About the staff in your hand...
Aravinay: Aravinay's staff is a precious staff that has heard many stories.
Aravinay: The pattern on the staff grows continuously, like the annual rings of a tree. The more stories it hears, the stronger the staff becomes.
Aravinay: One day, it will grow into a big tree full of stories.
Aravinay: If Nara friend were Aranara, you would surely understand.
