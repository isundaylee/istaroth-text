# Kageuchi Handguard

A handguard mounded upon a sword of some distinction.
Inazuma has a long tradition of sword-making. When making swords, smiths will often make several different weapons at once, before choosing from among them the "shinuchi," or the best weapon, while the others are known as "kageuchi."
