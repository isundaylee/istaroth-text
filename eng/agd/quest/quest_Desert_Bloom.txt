# Desert Bloom


## Talk 1

Nermin: Whew... Loosening the soil like this should work...
Traveler: Are you still looking after this flower?
Nermin: Yep. Granny Kulsoom gave me a lot of tips on taking care of flowers.
Nermin: Things like loosening soil, regularly trimming leaves, getting rid of bugs using various methods...
Nermin: Oh, and you shouldn't water them too often, or else the roots will rot.
Nermin: *sigh* And I thought watering them every day was the way to go... To keep the soil moist and stuff...
Nermin: But it's a good thing, because I don't have to fetch water everyday anymore. The stepwell's really far away.
Nermin: I have to continue trimming the leaves. In the meantime, could you fetch a small can of water for me?
Nermin: I've talked to Kazan. He said I could water the flowers today.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Nermin: The watering can is over there. Be careful when drawing water. Don't let too much mud get into the can!
Traveler: Granny Kulsoom taught you all that?
Nermin: Mm... Kinda. Granny Kulsoom knows everything. I always go to her when I have questions.
Nermin: I'm counting on you! One small can of water will do.

## Talk 2

Nermin: Oh no... There's more bitten leaves...
Traveler: What happened?
Nermin: Traveler, look! That kitten is chewing on my flowers again!
Nermin: Look at this leaf over here... That one too! They all have large chunks bitten off!
Traveler: Perhaps the kitten is hungry.
Nermin: That's also what Raef said. He even went around to feed the kitten...
Nermin: But the next day, the kitten came back to nibble on my flowers.
Nermin: The kitten just munches on leaves for now. What if it starts biting the stems? ...That would be a disaster.
Nermin: But I don't want to chase it away either. If it leaves the village, it'll have nowhere to go but to the desert...
Nermin: Traveler, could you help me feed the kitten again? I hope it doesn't come nibbling at my flower leaves again. They're not even tasty to begin with...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Nermin: Anyway, thanks for agreeing to help. I'll mark the kitten's favorite spot on your map...
Nermin: Meanwhile, I'm gonna stay here and watch my flowers in case another little cat comes along and takes a chunk off the leaves...
Traveler: I'm somewhat of a cat expert.
Nermin: That would be great! Whenever I see cat paws, I'm worried that the cat'll pounce at me with its claws out...
Traveler: Perhaps the kitten... enjoys chewing on plants?
Nermin: I'm not sure what it likes...

## Talk 3

Nermin: Traveler, perfect timing! Come have a taste of the Minty Bean Soup I made.
Traveler: The ingredients in your soup...
Nermin: I asked someone to buy most of the ingredients for me, but as for Mint... I grew them myself.
Nermin: Raef gave me a set of gardening tools and some fertilizer.
Nermin: I thought it would be a waste to use them on one single pot of flowers... So I asked Azalai to buy some Mint seeds for me.
Nermin: After planting the Mint seeds, I took care of them just like how I take care of the flowers.
Nermin: As time went on, the Mint grew and matured...
Nermin: So I picked some and made this Minty Bean Soup. What do you think? Tastes pretty good, huh?
Nermin: Um... Since you ate my Minty Bean Soup, you have to do me a favor.
Traveler: Uh, I'm not done eating yet...
Nermin: Hey, I was just joking! I'll give you a nice reward for your help.
Nermin: I just need you to pick three Zaytun Peaches for me. They're Raef's favorite fruit.
Nermin: I wanna add them to my Minty Bean Soup and bring it to him.
Nermin: Now that I know how to make Minty Bean Soup, I just need someone to get the Zaytun Peaches for me.
Traveler: Got it...
Nermin: Thanks! I'll treat you to another bowl of Minty Bean Soup when you get back.
Nermin: I'm counting on you, Traveler. Find some Zaytun Peaches and bring them back to me.
Traveler: Is he allowed to eat soup while at work?
Nermin: It's not gonna take up that much of his time. Besides, he's not too busy with work.
Traveler: You can take this bowl back!

## Talk 4

Nermin: Did you fetch the water?
Traveler: If this counts...
Nermin: Great! I'm gonna start watering the flowers. Please wait a second...
Black Screen Text: Nermin starts watering the flowers...
Nermin: Whew. This should do it...
Nermin: Granny Kulsoom says that when you're watering plants, you should stop when the water starts seeping out from below the flower pot.
Nermin: Because that means the soil has been "soaked through." You need to water them once every three days...
Nermin: Ah! Sorry, I got carried away... Here's the reward I promised. Thank you for helping out, Traveler.
Nermin: Which tool should I use for trimming leaves...

## Talk 5

Raef: Huh, why is there another batch of goods coming in all of a sudden...

## Talk 6

Nermin: Ugh... Why are there so many bugs on the leaves?

## Talk 7

Nermin: Why does the kitten like nibbling on leaves...? I wonder what they taste like...

## Talk 8

Lazy Cat: Meow? Meow meow meow!
Paimon: Whoa! We aren't bad guys! Don't get so worked up!
Paimon: This should be the cat Nermin was talking about. Let's give it some food.
Black Screen Text: You place the food in front of the wary cat.
Paimon: It really likes the food. Paimon guesses this will do. Let's report back to Nermin.

## Talk 9

Nermin: Traveler, did you find the kitten?
Traveler: I gave it some food.
Nermin: Great! I hope it doesn't mess up my flowers again... Cat food is supposed to taste better than flower leaves, after all.
Nermin: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, this is your reward.
Nermin: *sigh* I hope the kitten doesn't get hungry too soon...
Traveler: I think the kitten's full now.

## Talk 10

Nermin: Thank you. I need to cut them into pieces, then put them in my Minty Bean Soup...
Black Screen Text: Nermin starts making her special Minty Bean Soup...
Nermin: Done! Hmm... It doesn't look any different than the regular Minty Bean Soup...
Nermin: But I'm sure it's gonna taste different!
Nermin: Traveler, please bring this bowl of Minty Bean Soup to Raef.
Nermin: I have to make a few more servings for Granny Kulsoom. Ebeid and Hilmi said they wanted to try some too...
Traveler: Don't overexert yourself.
Nermin: I won't! It's just a few bowls of Minty Bowl Soup, not a big deal at all!
Nermin: Anyway, please bring this Minty Bean Soup to Raef.
Nermin: I have to prepare some for Nawaz and Ramiz as well...
Traveler: You seem so energetic...
Nermin: Well... Since I'm finally able to actually do something meaningful, I have to make the most out of it.

## Talk 11

Raef: Minty Bean Soup... Did Nermin make this herself?
Raef: So that's why she's been acting all mysterious lately. I heard that she bought a few flower pots, too... I wondered what she planted in them.
Raef: Not that it's a bad thing. At least she won't be spending all her time worrying about her health.
Raef: There's still another batch of goods I need to take care of. Once I bring them back into the village, I'll try her soup.
Raef: Oh, and here's a little something for you. Thank you for coming all the way here.

## Talk 12

Nermin: I have to prepare some for Nawaz and Ramiz as well...

## Talk 13

Raef: Hey Traveler! Didn't expect to see you here. Do you need any help from me?
Traveler: Nermin wants to give you this.
