# Night-Wind Letter


## Talk 1

Paimon: Guess we just keep following this path...?
Paimon: Ororon seemed pretty confident that Citlali's traps won't harm us, but still, it can't hurt to be careful.

## Talk 2

Ororon: ...Huh?
Paimon: What's the matter?
Ororon: It's Granny... She's gone.
Ororon: She was standing there at the cave entrance to stop me from going in. Standing right in my way.
Paimon: Oh, you meant literally standing in your way... This whole time, Paimon thought you were being metaphorical.
Ororon: Granny says it's tacky when light novels use contrived metaphors. I don't wanna be tacky.
Paimon: Wait, but aren't you comparing yourself to a light novel? Isn't that kinda contrived...?
Ororon: What? Oh... darn it...
Traveler: Anyway, looks like your path ahead has been cleared.
Paimon: Yeah, Citlali probably figured there was no point standing in your way anymore. Ororon, whatever it is you so desperately need to do, you're now free to do it.
Ororon: I don't think it'll be that simple... Granny wouldn't release me from her grasp so easily.
Ororon: She might have laid a trap for me. Or maybe when I get inside, I'll get caught by one of her surveillance spells...
Traveler: But why would she want to stop you?
Paimon: Yeah, let alone lay a trap for you! Unless... You haven't been up to no good again, have you?
Ororon: I just want to rescue someone... and Granny won't let me.
Paimon: Rescue someone!? Oh no, what happened?
Ororon: Could I ask you to go inside and take a look at him? I think he should be safe for now, but he'll be at greater and greater risk as time goes by.
Paimon: But then... What are you going to do?
Ororon: I'll have to wait outside, or I might fall into one of Granny's traps.
Paimon: ...You mean, you want us to fall into her traps instead?
Ororon: #No, you'll be fine. Granny's traps will recognize it's Traveler, so they'll leave you alone.
Traveler: Really? That's a thing?
Ororon: Sure it is — I mean, I've told my aphids all about your heroic deeds, so I assume Granny's told her traps, too.
Paimon: You... You can't just assume that!
Ororon: #Either way... I'm counting on you, Gramps.
Paimon: #Well, Traveler, sounds like someone's life is at stake so we should probably head in and check things out.

## Talk 3

Ororon: #You are the best, Gramps. Please, can you go inside and take a look?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Oh! The woven scroll is ready! This looks like a person... Who is it?
Citlali: ...
Ororon: ...
Citlali: It's Sanhaj Kompore...
Paimon: Huh? You mean, THAT Sanhaj? Ororon's ancient name hero guy?
Citlali: That's right. He was not only one of the six heroes, but also a legendary Border Master of our tribe. Five hundred years on, and the remains of his spirit is still so strong...
Ororon: "Border Master" is a honorable title, by the way. It's only given to powerful figures, like Granny Citlali.
Citlali: No, not like me. The most powerful Border Masters can expand the borders of the Night Kingdom, and temporarily manifest part of it in the real world.
Citlali: I'm no amateur with border spells, but Sanhaj is in a league of his own.
Citlali: They say his border mastery was what turned the tide in the Battle of the Mare Jivari five hundred years ago. Legend has it that Sanhaj summoned a miniature Night Kingdom and exploded it to defeat the encroaching dark calamity.
Paimon: Whoa! He must have been really strong!
Citlali: Of course, it came at a great price. As far as I understand, both Sanhaj and Tenoch, the leader of the tribal coalition forces, gave their lives to activate this spell.
Citlali: I don't know what Leyla was thinking... Even I'd think twice before seeking out Sanhaj Kompore during clairvoyance, so what sort of spirit-duffer in their right mind would... Hmph, I guess folly is the greater part of bravery.
Citlali: I'm starting to feel like something else is at play here. I think I'll pay a visit to his house and see if I can find any clues.
Traveler: What about the other approach? Shall we keep that up while you're gone?
Citlali: Yep, you can keep gathering the roaming spirits, that won't be affected. Hopefully you do find Leyla that way, because it'll save us an awful lot of trouble...
Citlali: But before that, it looks like we now have another problem on our hands. Connecting with the spirit of Sanhaj Kompore has caused quite a stir... I think we may have just spooked all the monsters in the area.
Citlali: #Traveler, if you've got some time, could you go and get them to pipe down a bit? We don't want them to start attacking innocent bystanders.
Ororon: It's fine, I can handle that.
Citlali: #Oh no — you're staying right here, mister! Traveler has enough to do already without coming to your rescue.
Ororon: #Alright then... Sorry, Traveler. Over to you, I guess.
Traveler: No problem, it'll be a piece of cake.
Paimon: Yeah, don't sweat it. The most important thing right now is getting Leyla's spirit back.
Citlali: Alright, I'm heading out. See you guys later.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Phew, we made it in without a hitch! Maybe Citlali's traps can recognize us after all!
Paimon: Wait, look! There's someone there!
Paimon: Hi! Are you okay? Can you hear us?
Traveler: He's not responding.
Paimon: Is he asleep? Or sick? ...Do you think this is the guy Ororon was talking about?
Paimon: Also, what the heck's been going on here? Lots of strange and mysterious stuff around...
Traveler: Looks like some kind of ritual.
Paimon: Hmm, could be... Let's get Ororon in here. He'll know what this is all about.
Ororon: Sorry, Granny.
Citlali: All grown up now, are we?
Ororon: ...I'm truly sorry.
Citlali: Now that you're one of the six heroes, you think you can do as you please, do you? Hmm?
Citlali: Well? Explain yourself, you dummy! How exactly were you thinking of helping that spirit-duffer?
Paimon: Ororon! And, uhh... hey, Citlali.
Citlali: Huh? HUH??? When did you guys...
Citlali: #(Drat, I wasn't expecting them. And now Traveler probably caught me yelling at Ororon... Aah, this is not a good look for me!)
Citlali: Haha... Hello there, you two. We were just, um... Ororon and I, we were, uh... play acting...
Citlali: You know, acting out some scenes from a light novel, quoting the lines... I didn't actually mean what I was saying. Right, Ororon?
Ororon: Huh? Uh... Yes, that's right.
Ororon: #I owe you an apology too, Traveler. I asked you for help, but I forgot to watch my back, and Granny caught me... And now we're play-acting.
Traveler: There's no need to apologize.
Paimon: So, what are you two up to, exactly? Did something happen to this poor guy?
Citlali: Yeah — Leyla's his name. He got into some trouble during a clairvoyance session.
Traveler: Clairvoyance?
Citlali: It's a kind of spell that lets your spirit leave your body, so you can access secret knowledge. You know what a medium is, right? You've probably come across them in novels. Anyway, it's similar to that.
Citlali: Leyla's problem is, his spirit has gotten lost and can't find its way back to his body.
Paimon: So, in other words, his body's here, but his soul's gone!
Citlali: Well, technically the soul and the spirit aren't quite the same thing... but yes, in a nutshell, that's basically it.
Ororon: I just wanted to help bring Leyla's spirit back...
Citlali: Hmph, and I wouldn't have stopped him if it was anyone else. But the issue is, Mr. Leyla here is what we call a "spirit-duffer."
Paimon: What's a spirit-duffer?
Citlali: Someone with no spiritual sensitivity whatsoever. Spirit-duffers can't sense or control spirits, much less use spells on them.
Citlali: Now, there are certain methods that can force even spirit-duffers into a clairvoyant state, but... well, I mean, look what happened to Mr. Leyla.
Citlali: The spells of the Masters of the Night-Wind are all based on dealing with spirits, and so are all our problem-solving methods. So for spirit-duffers, even our healing methods don't work on them.
Citlali: So if they get into trouble trying to use a spell, there's basically nothing we can do.
Ororon: Yes, there is. As long as the soul is involved, I should be able to help...
Citlali: You hear that? No prizes for guessing what Ororon's bright idea was.
Paimon: Oh! Because of your special constitution, right? But isn't that kinda risky for you?
Ororon: I'll be fine — Granny's just worrying too much. I'm feeling fine now, so I should be able to do it safely. Besides, it's probably our only hope of bringing Leyla back.
Citlali: Don't kid yourself. What happens if it's not as safe as you're hoping, hmm? We both know you'll risk it all to try and rescue him anyway. Honestly, you're such an idiot sometimes.
Paimon: Um... This is a tricky one. It's true that Ororon can be self-sacrificing to a fault, but it's also true that Citlali tends to worry too much...
Traveler: I'm with Citlali on this. Ororon is being an idiot.
Ororon: Call me an idiot all you want — I know I can bring his spirit back. I just need your support.
Citlali: Hey! That's enough, you little squirt. Since when does the grandkid call the shots? Granny obviously knows how to handle this.
Paimon: Huh? You do?
Ororon: Wait, really? You actually know a way to save him?
Citlali: Yes! I mean, it's a crude solution... but that's beside the point! The point being, don't interfere when Granny's already got things under control!
Citlali: #Anyway. Traveler, I was actually going to ask for your help on this. My plan will take quite a lot of work, and it's a little too much for one person.
Paimon: Oh, great! Well, it's a good thing Ororon brought us here then!
Traveler: Sure, how can I help?
Citlali: I intend to use a two-pronged approach. The first is the crude method — basically, it's looking for a needle in a haystack.
Citlali: See the thing I've drawn around Leyla's body? That's a gateway to the Night Kingdom.
Citlali: Once the gateway is activated, all roaming spirits in the area will be drawn to it. If we're lucky, we'll find the one that belongs to Leyla.
Citlali: I'll lend you some of my power like last time, so you can use my clairvoyance. It only works if you use this projection censer first though, so don't forget that step.
Citlali: Don't worry, this time nothing can go wrong! You'll just feel like you're in the Night Kingdom, and you'll see a lot of roaming spirits around you. All you need to do is gather them up.
Citlali: You can leave Ororon to sift through them and find Leyla. Since he wants to help so bad, he can take the hardest job.
Traveler: What's the other approach?
Citlali: Draw him back, using what I know about the instincts of spirits. As we all know, clairvoyance is usually conducted with the goal of unraveling mysteries.
Citlali: If we can find out what mystery Leyla wanted to learn the truth of, we can use that to draw his lost spirit back here.
Citlali: I'll do some clairvoyance of my own, and channel it through Leyla's body. That should give me some idea of what he was thinking.
Paimon: Oh! Paimon thinks she gets it now. The first approach is like fishing with a net, and the second is like fishing with bait. Just like how Ororon wanted us to lure you away with the promise of light novels!
Ororon: Um... Your point would have been just as clear without the example, Paimon.
Citlali: What!? ...Don't think I won't revisit this later.
Ororon: But Granny, it's amazing that you can use a person as a clairvoyance medium. I always thought you had to use inanimate objects.
Citlali: Hmph, you can't flatter your way out of this one! But you're not wrong. A person without a spirit is just a physical shell — which, for our purposes, makes them an inanimate object.
Citlali: #Traveler, just over there is my spiritloom, which will record the fragments I see during clairvoyance. Once I begin, please arrange them on a woven scroll for me.
Citlali: Let me know when you're ready. We should get to work.
Traveler: I'm with Ororon. Citlali's the one being an idiot.
Citlali: Hey! That's Granny Itztli to you! Who do you take me for? I obviously know how to handle this.
Traveler: I bet you've got a plan, huh, Citlali?
Citlali: Hehe, you're darn right Granny Itztli's got a plan! Why else do you think I'd be here?
Traveler: Just watch your back next time.
Traveler: Play acting, huh? Can I join in?
Paimon: Come on. Now's not the time for games.

## Talk 6

Ororon: #Traveler, could I trouble you to keep gathering the roaming spirits over the next few days? Just make sure to use this censer — Granny already applied her spell to it.
Traveler: About the spiritloom...
Ororon: Oh, you liked playing with that, huh? Feel free to try it again whenever you want. There should be some other clairvoyance records you can arrange on a woven scroll. It's pretty fun.
Ororon: Don't worry about Granny. I'm sure she only left it here so you can get some practice.
Traveler: About the Mare Jivari...
Ororon: The Mare Jivari? Terrible place to grow vegetables, for one thing.
Ororon: And if you're wondering how I would know that — well, it's because Granny told me. If you want to know more, you should probably ask her when she gets back.
Ororon: She has some scrolls on the subject in her house, but my rule is: If you can't grow vegetables there, I'm not interested. So I've never given them a second look. Truly sorry.

## Talk 7

Ororon: #You can do it, Traveler! Together, we'll bring Leyla back for sure.

## Talk 8

Citlali: Are you ready? Don't worry, the spiritloom is very easy to use.
Traveler: Alright, I'll give it a try.
Citlali: I know this is your first time working with it, but I have a feeling you'll do great.
Traveler: I need a little more time.
Citlali: Sure.
