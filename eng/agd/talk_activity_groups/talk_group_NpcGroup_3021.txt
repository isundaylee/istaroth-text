Traveler: You mean the Sakoku Decree?
Hasegawa: Exactly! After the ban of foreign cargo ships, many imported high-end goods have become a thing of the past.
Hasegawa: I haven't been able to taste the Dandelion Wine from Mondstadt. And it has been a long time since I got any custom-made silks from Liyue, either...
Hasegawa: If I can't buy anything, what use do I have for this much money? Don't you agree?

Traveler: You mean the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hasegawa: The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that doesn't really bother me anyway.

Traveler: You mean the abolition of the Sakoku Decree?
Hasegawa: Exactly! While it was still in force, foreign cargo ships were banned and many imported high-end goods became things of the past.
Hasegawa: But now... now, I can taste Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine, and I can order custom-made silks from Liyue...
Hasegawa: Now that's the good life, wouldn't you say?
