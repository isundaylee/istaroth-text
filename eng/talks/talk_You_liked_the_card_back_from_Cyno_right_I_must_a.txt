Albedo: You liked the card back from Cyno, right? I must admit, I also spent a good amount of effort coming up with the design.
Albedo: His request was quite interesting. He wanted a dragon, a cool pose, and a design that would stand out and awe his opponents.
Albedo: Although the commission was for himself, he wanted the back to be flashy enough to draw the attention of the opposing player. Perhaps, there's something that can be said about how when it comes to Genius Invokation TCG, friendship is more important than competition.
Albedo: He also said that such an impressive card back should be shared with friends. Since he gave it to you, this must mean he considers you to be a close friend.
Albedo: Oh, and speaking of, to repay my efforts, he also gifted me the card back as well. Hmm... maybe I'll also give the game a try.
