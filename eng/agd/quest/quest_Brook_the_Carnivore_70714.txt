# Brook the Carnivore


## Talk 1

Traveler: Do you need some Fowl?
Brook: I guess you saw my commission, huh? Well, you're just in time.
Brook: Do you have those six servings of Fowl?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Brook: Well, I'll be making some food, so do bring them me once you've got them all.

## Talk 2

Brook: The quality of these meats is quite good...
Brook: Thank you. Here, take these.
Brook: Come on over when I'm done with my research â€” you'll be the first to try my new dish, I promise.
