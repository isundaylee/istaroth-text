Hung Fan: Two boxes of tea leaves, and a bunch of crates of jade items and other miscellaneous goods? Business is booming lately, heh...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you a merchant?
Hung Fan: You gotta be joking! I'm just a lowly laborer shifting goods who moonlights as a guard now and then.
Hung Fan: Business and all that's way too complicated for me, ha! I'd rather work my body than work my brain.

## Talk

Traveler: See you later.
Hung Fan: See you, come talk to me again after I finish moving the tea leaves!

## Talk

Traveler: Hired guards can be part-timers?
Hung Fan: *cough* Well, since I'm new to the biz, and I taught myself martial arts, I don't get a whole lotta commissions. Not like those pros from the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency...
Hung Fan: So, I'm just doin' simple transport work for now, gonna save up some cash for maybe a few years.
Hung Fan: Once I've got enough Mora in the bank, I'm gonna sign up for classes and study martial arts seriously, get myself real fists of fury and killer kung-fu kicks.
Hung Fan: And then I'll go pro, and escort with the best! I won't even have to fear getting eaten by Xuanwen Beasts...

## Talk

Traveler: Are Xuanwen Beasts that scary?
Hung Fan: #I've seem 'em with my own eyes! You may be a tough young hero, but don't get cocky!
Hung Fan: The things are practically invulnerable! I've seen my betters using real-deal Iron Points against one...
Hung Fan: They were ruthlessly trying to stick it, but it looked like it was enjoying being tickled.
Hung Fan: If it were me, I wouldn't last half a second before I ended up as a Xuanwen snack!
Hung Fan: If you run into one of those terrible monsters, I'd recommend just taking a detour!
