# Sweeping Down


## Talk 1

Traveler: How do you know my name?
Little Nine: People talk about you all the time! And I keep seeing you everywhere...
Little Nine: #Everyone says that Traveler is a very good person and can do anything! Can you help me find my book? Pleeeease?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Who's Big Nine?
Little Nine: He lives next door to me. We're both ninth in our family so our names both have nine in them. That's why we'd be the perfect match... Wait! Argh, no, don't tell Big Nine I said that...
Little Nine: The book was a present from him. He's gonna get it published, but he let me have a sneaky look at it first.

## Talk 3

Little Nine: Did you find the book? It's a really special book to Big Nine...
Little Nine: If it's gone, he will be sooo sad...
Little Nine: ...And if he knows that I lost it, he'll be really mad at me...

## Talk 4

Traveler: But... where do I start?

## Talk 5

Traveler: But... how am I gonna find it?

## Talk 6

Little Nine: Hmm, let's see... The river carried me a long way, I know that. The water was really cold, it froze my hands stiff...
Little Nine: But I definitely didn't open it! I held it as tight as I could, because Big Nine told me how special it is...
Little Nine: Finally, I crawled onto the river bank. The first thing I did was find somewhere to dry the book out in the sun.
Little Nine: Then I was so exhausted that I lay down and fell asleep for a while. When I woke up, the book was gone.
Little Nine: It was in the woods over there that I dried the book out. You can have a look in there.
