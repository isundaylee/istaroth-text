# Tianqiu Treasure Trail


## Talk 1

Lan: So, did you find anything?
Traveler: I found this.
Lan: What's this...? I've never seen anything like it, where did you find it?
Traveler: Near Dunyu Ruins...
Lan: Dunyu Ruins? What would such an item be doing there?
Lan: Thank you for getting to the bottom of this for us. As per the adventurers' code, this item is all yours now. Along with your reward, of course.
Lan: I'll arrange for someone to head over to Dunyu Ruins to conduct a more thorough search.
Lan: So strange... The Dunyu Ruins area has been combed countless times... How did we miss this?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Is this a piece of paper? What's written on it? Let's have a look!
Paimon: Huh... seems like this is saying that...
Paimon: We have to look for treasure beneath an especially large tree, in the middle of a path, and... below a flight of stairs...

## Talk 3

Lan: I believe that for adventurers, experience is more important than wealth.
Lan: Don't forget that for most of the problems you encounter when adventuring, money is useless!
