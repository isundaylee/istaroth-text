A meeting room that was based on the one in the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. A rumor spread among the citizenry, judging from the number of chairs present, that "six shall be present at any key decision the Knights make."
The truth is that only six members of the Knights' leadership enjoy sitting down for meetings. The number of attendees has never been fixed.
