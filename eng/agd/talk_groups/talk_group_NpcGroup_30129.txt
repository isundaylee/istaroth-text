Chongyun: Hmm... With everything that's happened on the way here, I feel like we're forgetting something...
Xingqiu: Chongyun, just look at the stunning scenery of Qingce Village. If I could sum it up in one word... Would you say "exquisite" does it justice? I think thatâ€”
Chongyun: Ah, I remember now! What about the demons?
Chongyun: Quick, Xingqiu, get the ancient texts out. There isn't a moment to lose.
Xingqiu: Careful now, Chongyun, let's not rush into this. Just as tea is to be imbibed one sip at a time, these things must be done step by step. If we are too hasty and end up with enemies on all sides, even we, with our level of martial prowess, may find ourselves overpowered.
Chongyun: Hmm... You do have a point. Alright then. I'll take you at your word, again.
Xingqiu: Excellent. Now then, what was I talking about? Huh, now I've lost my train of thought. Help me, Chongyun, what was I saying?
Chongyun: Uh... I've forgotten too.
