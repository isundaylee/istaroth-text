# Stairway to Wangshu


## Talk 1

Huai'an: Looks like this is going to need repairing...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Huai'an: Ah, it's you. See for yourself â€” the staircase is broken...
Huai'an: It's in pretty bad shape. Someone is definitely going to have an accident if it isn't repaired.
Huai'an: How it broke, you ask? Well, a group of monsters tried to get inside, so I came out to fight them off.
Huai'an: I should have pulled my punches... I sent one of the big heavy ones flying and he landed right on the staircase. It smashed on impact.
Huai'an: I promised myself I'd fix it but I just haven't found the time. Reason being, the inn is just getting busier and busier at the moment. All the more reason why this repair is getting urgent...
Huai'an: It's not a difficult job. I can easily repair this myself.
Huai'an: If you have the time, could you fetch some Wooden Planks for me? I need to stay here in case someone else misses their step...
Traveler: Okay.
Huai'an: Great. I actually bought the Wooden Planks already, they're currently stored just outside the inn.
Huai'an: See if you can find them and bring a few back here.
Traveler: Won't it just get smashed again?
Huai'an: That won't happen. I'm getting old anyway... and I'll make sure I restrain myself next time.
Huai'an: In any case, it needs fixing whatever happens. I actually bought the Wooden Planks already, they're currently stored just outside the inn.
Huai'an: Please bring a few of them here for me.

## Talk 2

Huai'an: Found them?
Traveler: Not yet.
Huai'an: They're just outside, they can't be that hard to find.
Huai'an: Go and take a look. I need to stay here in case someone else comes rushing past and has an accident...

## Talk 3

Huai'an: Found them?
Traveler: Yes.
Huai'an: Let's see... Yes, that should be enough. Thanks.
Huai'an: Right, I should get to work. I need to repair this as quickly as I can...

## Talk 4

Huai'an: There, that should do it. I don't think anyone's going to fall on this.
Traveler: It doesn't match the style though...
Huai'an: Not much I can do about that. I'm not some sort of master craftsman, you know.
Huai'an: Wait... That was only one of them. There's another hole I still need to fix...
Huai'an: Oh well, that will have to do for today. The inn is still open and I need to go back to serving the guests.
Huai'an: No matter how badly it needs fixing, business is business... Thanks for your help. Take this for your trouble.
