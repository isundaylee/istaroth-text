Paimon: Hello, are you here to compete in The Crux Clash?
Uncle Yun: You bet I am, have you put your names down yet?
Traveler: Not yet.
Uncle Yun: Well, I'd have a look at the entrance criteria if I were you. They don't allow just anyone to take part.
Uncle Yun: The Clash is a comprehensive test of fighting ability. Anyone who turns up for show over skill is gonna get their butt handed to them.
Uncle Yun: Tsk, nobody wants to see that, right?
Paimon: Yeah, we heard a rule about that. So Paimon's wondering... are you a renowned fighter?
Uncle Yun: Hahaha, me? Only a former runner-up in the Chihu Rock Freestyle Combat Summit! Oh yeah...
Traveler: Former...
Paimon: Uh-huh... Also, that doesn't sound like the most official tournament out there...
Uncle Yun: What!? You... Nonsense! Have you been living under a rock? It's been going on for years! There were plenty of competitors when I took part!
Uncle Yun: Not to mention, I've helped the Millelith catch Treasure Hoarders before! There were two of them trying to escape — I soon sorted them out.
Uncle Yun: They tried to sneak past me under the cover of darkness... Ha! They didn't know what hit 'em.
Uncle Yun: I planted a left hook on the skinnier one's face and sent him flying. Then, the big guy pulled out a knife!
Uncle Yun: I stood my ground, of course. A roundhouse kick sent the blade hurtling into a beam above us.
Traveler: Sounds, uh... impressive.
Uncle Yun: Hahaha, I told you! Unarmed, outnumbered two to one, but I still got the upper hand!
Uncle Yun: I'm not saying I came out completely unscathed of course, but the fact remains that I did manage to subdue the both of them... AND hand them over to the Millelith. I received quite the commendation! Oh yeah...
Paimon: Uh-huh... But for us, even four or five Treasure Hoarders at a time is all in a day's work...
Traveler: Thanks for letting us know...
Paimon: Mm-hmm... Alright, we're gonna keep looking around.
Uncle Yun: I'll see you in the arena. Tsk, but I don't plan on losing to a pair of children any time soon!
Traveler: Sounds, um... dangerous.
Traveler: Runner-up...
Traveler: We just wanted to take a look around first.

Uncle Yun: See you in the arena, kid!
Uncle Yun: Watch out for my signature roundhouse!

## Talk

Uncle Yun: Ah, it's you, haha! I watched your match. What a stunning performance!
Uncle Yun: I myself was eliminated in the third round. *sigh* Shame... If only I could have advanced one more round...
Paimon: Ah, maybe next time, huh? By the way, do you happen to know who else advanced to the final round?
Uncle Yun: Why, yes. He's the same one who defeated me. He is a formidable opponent, quick on his feet and swift to take advantage of his opponent's missteps.
Uncle Yun: I faltered for but a brief moment, but before I knew it, he had me on the floor.
Uncle Yun: Given my stature, I have no fear of squaring off with physically strong opponents. But faced with a nimble, agile opponent such as him... I found myself completely out of my league...
Uncle Yun: Still — I'm sure he'll be no match for you, haha!

Uncle Yun: You've got nothing to worry about. Nobody here can stack up against the likes of you! No way...

## Talk

Uncle Yun: Seeing this tournament has taught me that no matter how good I think I might be, there will always be someone better out there...
Uncle Yun: But anyway, good luck to you out there. I'll be rooting for ya!

Uncle Yun: The Vision was stolen? And in broad daylight, too... How could that possibly happen?
