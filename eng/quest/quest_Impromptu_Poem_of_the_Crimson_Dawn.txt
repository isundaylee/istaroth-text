# Impromptu Poem of the Crimson Dawn


## Talk 1

Havisham: #Hi, {M#bro}{F#girl}.
Jingle: Today just isn't our day, eh?
Havisham: Tough luck for us both.
Jingle: I see that you're out for a stroll with your pet, but you walked right into our camp.
Havisham: You'll pay for that.
Jingle: We were about to call it a day, but thanks to you, we've got more work to do!
Havisham: Just our luck.
Traveler: Paimon, what are we gonna do? We're being robbed!
Paimon: You're missing the point! First of all, Paimon is not a pet that needs to be taken for a walk!
Paimon: Whatever... You think you're the boss? Paimon'll show you how wrong you are. It's show time!
Paimon: #We're the legendary {NICKNAME} and Paimon! It's your last chance, outlaws! Surrender now, or prepare to meet your end!
Jingle: Well, ain't that somethin'? A pet that talks! That could fetch a handsome sum on the market.
Havisham: A handsome sum indeed.
Paimon: Ehhhh!?
Traveler: Enough talk. Let's do this!
Seemingly Craven Redhead: W—Wait!
Seemingly Craven Redhead: Monsieur Havisham, Monsieur Jingle, I thought we had a deal! I promised to give you my goods, and in return, you wouldn't hurt any innocent people or animals in the interim.
Jingle: Hmm. Well, I suppose we've just met, so you probably haven't heard about our story. We used to be apprentices in the Court of Fontaine, but then we got kicked out. Do you know why?
Havisham: They said we didn't work hard enough.
Jingle: But no matter what comes our way, my brother and I always learn from our failures. So we lost our job because we didn't work hard enough? Then we'll be sure to work harder than anyone else at our next gig!
Traveler: I also work harder than most when it comes to fighting crime.
Jingle: #Hah, {M#bro}{F#girl}, I'll admit that you don't look like the typical hero, but you've got guts. If a fight's what you want, that's what you'll get!
Havisham: I'll have you know that this isn't our first rodeo.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: Please! Would you all just hold your horses and listen to me? What good will it bring to fight each other?
Seemingly Craven Redhead: I would hate to see any of you get hurt.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: You know what? I've got enough money for all of us. I'm not sure if it's sufficient for your services, but I'm willing to pay double the ransom if you lay down your weapons.
Paimon: Are you okay?
Seemingly Craven Redhead: Thank you for asking. I do miss my usual freedom, but apart from that, I'm fine.
Paimon: I thought they were the ones who locked you up! Then why don't you accept our help? Why are you offering them an even bigger ransom?
Seemingly Craven Redhead: My dear friend, sometimes you may encounter difficulties in life that you cannot overcome by yourself. I believe Monsieur Havisham and Monsieur Jingle have found themselves in such a pickle.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: I have the choice to save the lives of two people, or even four, all for the cost of a nigh nugatory sum of gold. Wouldn't you call that a fair deal?
Seemingly Craven Redhead: And you needn't worry about me. I have reached an agreement with them.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: In exchange for my freedom, I have offered to provide them with a batch of goods. This way, they will be furnished with a sufficient amount of capital to start a living that does not involve harming innocent people and animals.
Jingle: That's indeed what you said.
Havisham: That's indeed what we heard.
Jingle: All that for someone you had never met... You have a heart of gold, my friend! I'm so touched.
Havisham: #We are men of our word. We'll let you walk free today, lucky {M#bro}{F#girl} — and don't forget to take your pet with you!
Seemingly Craven Redhead: #That's good! Alright, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you can both go home now!
Seemingly Craven Redhead: No need to worry about me. I'll take Monsieurs Havisham and Jingle to retrieve the goods they have been promised — an easy task if I ever saw one.
Black Screen Text: The Treasure Hoarders free the redhead from his cage, and the three of them head east together.
Paimon: #They're gone... {NICKNAME}, do you really think the Treasure Hoarders are gonna let him go? He doesn't seem like the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Traveler: He could have paid me to fix the problem...
Paimon: He might be the sort of person who wouldn't even harm a fly. Paimon thought that lot only existed in fairy tales.
Paimon: Ah! Paimon's dying to know what's going on! They just headed east. Why don't we follow them?
Traveler: Maybe the three of them were putting on an act?
Paimon: What? Are you saying they're in this together? But they're already long gone at this point! If they did that to trick us...

## Talk 2

Paimon: There they are! Let's find a place to hide and observe.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: Here are the goods that we agreed upon. It's not much, but it should be enough to help you muddle through for a while.
Jingle: Lemme check... Heh, the exact amount you promised. No more, no less.
Havisham: You're not one for flim-flam. We respect that.
Jingle: Anyway, I'm sure this is just a drop in the ocean for you, and you wouldn't mind if we took a little more, right?
Havisham: I mean, you've got so much Mora that you don't think twice about parting with it. We'll do a better job looking after your fortune.
Seemingly Craven Redhead: *sigh* I was holding out hope that things would be different this time, but it always ends the same, doesn't it?
Havisham: Old tricks are what they are for a reason. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Jingle: I wonder, are you just as generous when begging for mercy?
Paimon: #What do you say, {NICKNAME}? Should we help him out?
Traveler: (Let's keep watching for a while.)
Paimon: (Huh? But... Well, you're the boss.)
Black Screen Text: The redhead whistles, and two men leap out from a hidden spot in the woods.
Redhead: I'm afraid not. You see, we, too, have a few tried-and-true methods to get back everything you've filched from innocent people.
Blanc: This is your last chance. Give yourselves up, and you'll save us the trouble of having to go through this whole song and dance.
Bleu: If you ever want a lesson taught, I'm always ready.
Jingle: Ha? Where did you two come from? And you... When did you get changed!?
Havisham: Hah, you're the real circus, aren't you? Get ready to be clowned on!

## Talk 3

Jingle: You're ganging up on us!
Havisham: This ain't hardly fair.
Bleu: Boss, what should we do with them?
Redhead: Why not ask our friends over there?
Traveler: Are you guys robbers as well?
Redhead: Oh, that's a toughie. Yes and no.
Blanc: We only target bad guys, like these two here.
Paimon: Paimon's not sure Paimon entirely follows, but what Paimon does know is that these two are bad guys. They tried to rob us earlier!
Paimon: After that, you said that you'd give them valuable cargo for free, and lured the bad guys here into an ambush!
Paimon: That means you and the other two must be...
Traveler: Undercover law enforcement officers.
Jingle: Lapdogs of the Maison Gardiennage? Pfft. You make me sick.
Redhead: Unfortunately for me, that's not the case. I don't agree with the things they do in pursuit of justice... but at least it is justice that they're after.
Redhead: That's something you lying good-for-nothings could never understand.
Redhead: Anyway, we're just a bunch of nobodies, but even nobodies have the right to believe in a cause, especially when it concerns matters of justice. There's no way we'd turn a blind eye to transgressions happening right in front of us.
Redhead: They have committed terrible crimes here. And even though they promised to let you walk free, they never intended to actually let that happen.
Paimon: How do you know what they're actually thinking?
Redhead: You must listen carefully, not only with your ears, but with your head, too.
Traveler: (Speaking of which, Penny did say...)
Black Screen Text: You take a few deep breaths to cast aside a few unwanted thoughts and clear your head.
Redhead: Try to recall what they said.
Redhead: "All that for some{RUBY#[D]What an idiot!}one you've never met... You have a heart {RUBY#[D]If your heart was real gold, then we'd be in business.}of gold, my friend! I'm so {RUBY#[D]Gold or not, I'm gonna rip it right out.}touched."
Redhead: #"We are men {RUBY#[D]As if verbal agreements amount to anything.}of our word. We'll let you walk free today, {M#bro}{F#girl}{RUBY#[D]We'll be back to finish you once we're done with this moron.}, and take your pet with you!"
Traveler: Whoa, that's scary.
Paimon: You, scared? Paimon's not buying it for a second.
Paimon: Paimon's seen this all before. Bad guys never change, and words take on different meanings once you process them.
Jingle: What do you mean "what we a{RUBY#[D]They must be bluffing.}ctually think"... We say what{RUBY#[D]I'm not gonna fall for this.} we mean! It's {RUBY#[D]Nope!}true!
Havisham: We just got carried away, that's all. {RUBY#[D]Well, maybe once or twice. Three times?} This has never happened before. We've learned {RUBY#[D]We've got to get backup.}our lesson!
Jingle: Here, take our loot{RUBY#[D]Most of our stuff is back at camp.}. It's all yours. Life has not {RUBY#[D](bad luck running into this lot)}been kind to us, or else we would never have{RUBY#[D]We'd better warn the others.} stooped as low as robbing.
Havisham: Please give us another chance! We'll {RUBY#[D]Once we're back at camp, we'll get the others. You're gonna pay!}make an honest living in Lumidouce Harbor.
Jingle: Of co{RUBY#[D]As if...}urse.
Havisham: As we {RUBY#[D]They sound delusional}have said, so have {RUBY#[D]But that makes things easier}you heard.
Redhead: Okay, then. We'll believe you once more. Bleu, Blanc, let them go.
Blanc: Alright.
Jingle: We promise to {RUBY#[D]Call for backup}become better men.
Havisham: And we will thank you {RUBY#[D]with some broken ribs}properly in the future!
Black Screen Text: Having said their piece, the two Treasure Hoarders hurriedly head south.
Paimon: How could you let them go? Paimon's sure you heard their thoughts as clearly as we did.
Redhead: What's the hurry? Since you heard their thoughts, you must be aware that not only do they plan to continue with their crimes, but that they also have plenty of accomplices.
Traveler: So you're playing the long game.
Redhead: Bingo. This is the perfect opportunity for all the fish to swim into our net. I'd be an idiot to let this slip by.
Paimon: #But what if there are too many of them? Can we come with you? {NICKNAME} knows a few moves.
Traveler: If you hadn't led them away in the first place...
Paimon: If you had saved this guy, their master plan would have been foiled!
Redhead: Since you're willing to help, I'll give Bleu and Blanc a day off.
Blanc: Hmm?
Bleu: Fine with me. The boss calls the shots.
Redhead: Those two lying weasels have returned to their camp to rally their brethren. Let's give them some time, then pay a visit tomorrow evening.
Paimon: No problem. By the way, we still don't know your name.
Redhead: Name? It's just a codename, but you may call me Rouge.
Paimon: Rouge... We've heard that name before, from Penny! Now that Paimon thinks of it, it did sound oddly familiar when you were going on about listening with your head.
Redhead: You know Penny? She's spoken to you about me? What a coincidence.
Redhead: Small world we live in...
Traveler: Robbing bad guys every now and then is a hobby of mine as well.
Paimon: Paimon's sure you meant to say "punishing," right?
Traveler: It's no surprise to me.
Traveler: Someone even worse than the bad guys!
Redhead: Haha! If you want to teach unsavory characters a lesson, you must become yet more unsavory. Looks like you already know that.

## Talk 4

Redhead: There's some cargo here. It looks like the gang has been busy... but I think they'll take the hint this time around.
Redhead: Since you've done your part, you should have some of these as well.
Traveler: It feels weird... I'll pass.
Redhead: Suit yourself. Thank you anyway! I fear I don't have anything else to offer you except my gratitude.
Traveler: What are you gonna do with the loot?
Redhead: Give to those in need, of course.
Redhead: Oh, I get it now. You thought I was gonna keep this all to myself. If I were to do that, I'd be no different from them.
Paimon: So, like, what do you really plan to do?
Redhead: I meant what I said to Havisham and Jingle. I'm sure you know that by now.
Redhead: The world is full of extreme inequity, poverty, and greed.
Redhead: Some people resort to a life of crime only because they have encountered difficulties that they believe are insurmountable. I would love to lend those people a hand.
Redhead: Havisham and Jingle, on the other hand, belong to the other group: those marred by insatiable greed, who resort to violence to rob the weak and seize what doesn't belong to them.
Redhead: If the laws of Fontaine cannot ensure that they receive the punishment they deserve, then I will. Whatever your opinion, I will continue doing what I believe to be the right thing.
Traveler: I'm sure you have your reasons.
Redhead: You could call this arrogance, which in turn could be construed as another form of greed.
Redhead: Fortunately, I'm not alone on this path, and there are like-minded people by my side. Even if we can make just a tiny difference in the world...
Redhead: Thanks all the same! Farewell!
