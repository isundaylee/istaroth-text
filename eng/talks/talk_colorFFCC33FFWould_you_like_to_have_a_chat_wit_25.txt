# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Sucrose: Uh... I'm... not very good at making conversation.
Sucrose: Most of my time I spend alone in the laboratory, researching for many hours at a time.
Sucrose: If an experiment doesn't quite go to plan, it can even end up being several days.
Sucrose: I don't know much about what goes on in the outside world... or the kinds of things that people like to talk about...
Sucrose: And, um... I don't really like to go out and socialize much, even on my days off.
Traveler: What about socializing with me?
Sucrose: Oh... If it's with you, then...
Sucrose: No, no... I still don't know what would be appropriate to talk about.
Traveler: You can just talk about whatever comes to mind.
Sucrose: Hmm...
Sucrose: Hearing you say this makes me feel more at ease.
Sucrose: I guess... I can try.
Traveler: It's okay to have nothing particular to talk about, you know...
Traveler: What about chatting with me?
