Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Rosaria: There's no like or dislike. I'm not particular with my residences.
Rosaria: But it is certainly more comfortable here than at the cathedral...
Rosaria: At least no one's going to wake me up for morning prayer and prevent me from catching up on my sleep.
Traveler: You're still sleeping late?
Rosaria: Haha... thanks for your concern. I just have a few things to take care of.
Rosaria: I've lived this way for such a long time, it'd be strange to change.
Rosaria: Perhaps I'm more comfortable here than I thought I was...
Rosaria: Hmm... I'm getting soft. That won't do.
Traveler: Thanks for your hard work.
Rosaria: ...There's nothing to thank me for.
Rosaria: ...Never mind, I know you mean well.
