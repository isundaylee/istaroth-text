Traveler: About kites...
Linlang: They carry peoples' thoughts into the skies. Don't you think that's quite similar to how Xiao Lanterns work?
Linlang: This year's theme is kites, which connects with the idea of those lanterns in interesting ways.
Linlang: I wonder if there're any legends that also link the two... Should there be any link to ancient relics, that would make for a most captivating story.
