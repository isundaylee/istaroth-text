Traveler: That's wonderful. What do you plan to do next?
Kumar: To be honest, I'm not quite used to my body being this healthy.
Kumar: Well, have I got lots of things I want to do! I'd like to train and hunt with my elder brother, and I'd like to go outside Vimara Village and explore the outside world!
Kumar: That said, he's still quite worried about me, and has suggested that I stay in the village for a while more to observe my condition â€” and that I should read a couple more books in the meantime.
Kumar: Well, I don't think that's a bad idea. If I learn more stuff and go to the Akademiya to study, I'll have a chance to take part in the Sabzeruz Festival, now won't I?
