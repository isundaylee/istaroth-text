# Slow-Cooked Bamboo Shoot Soup

Zhongli's specialty. The ham is a butt end selected according to Yuehai Pavilion's gourmet standards. The fresh meat is pork belly, freshly hunted in Springvale, while the bamboo shoots are the densest you'll find in Qingce Village. It is then heated, slowly, gently, and with the utmost care and technique... Such a "particular" taste may only be shared with those who know how to appreciate it.
