Traveler: Tell me more about the Anahitian Blessing...
Jahan: Hmmm? Have you never heard of the Anahitian Blessing?
Jahan: It's practically essential to growing crops, and it's not an overstatement to say that it's been our savior.
Jahan: Oh wait, I should say that the Dendro Archon is our savior, since the Blessing is her gift to us.
Jahan: Oh great Dendro Archon, may our upcoming harvests be bountiful ones also?
