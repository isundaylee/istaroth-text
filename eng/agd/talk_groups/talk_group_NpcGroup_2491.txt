Uncle Luo: Hmm, what's wrong with this tea?

Traveler: What is it?
Uncle Luo: Is it just that the soil here has lost its fertility? Or has the weather just not been favorable? Either way, the tea doesn't have the same flavor as the previous harvests.
Uncle Luo: And since the problem lies with the tea, no amount of additional processing will help. We have to serve it to the adeptus soon. Ohh, what shall we do?
Uncle Luo: ...And those visiting guests and merchants. How will we deal with them?

Traveler: Have you tried adding fertilizer?
Uncle Luo: Yes, among other things. We've fertilized the soil, tried water from a different source, and we've even had people stationed by the field on rotation, but nothing's helped.
Uncle Luo: If nothing's done, we're not going to have any tea this year.

Traveler: Greetings, Uncle Luo.
Uncle Luo: What brings you here? Are you here for a spot of tea? Come sit, I'll brew some for you.
Uncle Luo: Thanks to you, the tea business here in our village is booming. If we had waited another year, I don't know what would have happened.

Traveler: About the tea leaves...
Uncle Luo: The issue with the water and the soil has been resolved thanks to you and the adeptus. But the tea... The new harvest needs time, so we'll just have to give the re-baked aged tea to the merchants.
Uncle Luo: Moreover, variations in the water and the soil have a huge impact. I mean, even a little bit of extra rain can bring the quality of the tea down.
Uncle Luo: With such drastic changes, there's no guarantee that we'll grow great tea going forward, adeptus's help or not.

Traveler: What's re-baked aged tea?
Uncle Luo: Some tea leaves taste better when they're newly harvested, and some when they've been sitting in storage for a while.
Uncle Luo: Some leaves must be stored for years and re-baked from time to time.
Uncle Luo: They're difficult to make, and even harder to store. But if those two hurdles are overcome, the flavor is... What's the right word for it... Ah, yes, "peerless"! Haha!
Uncle Luo: ...It's a shame that people these days don't want to wait, nor do they want to learn.
