## Talk 1

Traveler: About Flaming Red Bolognese...
Geri: Oh right, you must've seen my commission then. Have you prepared two dishes of Flaming Red Bolognese?
Traveler: I certainly have, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Geri: Aw alright, just let me know as soon as they're ready.
Geri: I can't even remember the last time I had Flaming Red Bolognese.
