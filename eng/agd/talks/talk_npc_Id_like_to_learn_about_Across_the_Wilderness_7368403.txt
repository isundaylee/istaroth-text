Traveler: I'd like to learn about "Across the Wilderness."
Vinkel: "Across the Wilderness" is a fun event held by the Adventurers' Guild, aiming to test the adventurers' strength in various aspects!

Vinkel: The more Wilderness Balloons one collects within the time limit, the higher the rating and the greater the rewards will be.
