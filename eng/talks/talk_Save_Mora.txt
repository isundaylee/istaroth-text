Traveler: Save Mora?
Hao: That's right. Once I save up enough, Tu and I will go to Liyue Harbor to have a look around. The way I see it, he's a pretty good storyteller... Who knows, he might be able to do this for a living at some point.
Hao: Well, as for me, I'm quite used to doing hard labor to earn my Mora, so I wouldn't be too sure about such prospects myself.
