Traveler: You know how to carve wood as well?
Ooshima Junpei: Why, of course! I'll have you know that I'm a dab hand at a few different crafts.
Ooshima Junpei: These wooden carvings here were all made by me using Lady Neko in various poses as a reference.
Ooshima Junpei: These carvings are very small, and can be held and played with in your hand, or displayed in your home as ornaments.
Ooshima Junpei: I've been thinking to get someone to help me bring a batch of these — once I'm done making them, of course — to Narukami Island to see if anyone's willing to buy them.
Ooshima Junpei: If we find willing customers, this might become a decent business venture.
Ooshima Junpei: And if I earn some money, I can spruce this shrine up even further!
Ooshima Junpei: I imagine that the provisional head priestess would be most pleased.
Ooshima Junpei: As for the whole payment, uh... I guess I'll just wait for that "Hibiki" person to come back and give it all to me at once, eh?
