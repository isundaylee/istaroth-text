## Talk 1

Muning: Have you found the Archaic Stones?
Traveler: Here they are.

## Talk 2

Muning: Three more.
Muning: I shall gratefully take the Archaic Stones submitted by our two "civic-minded citizens."
Muning: I didn't expect you to find three of them so quickly. And they are much better in quality than the ones I've previously seen.
Muning: *sigh*... They remind me of the one that I used to have.
Paimon: You have an Archaic Stone?
Traveler: Then why send us to look for it?
Muning: I mean I USED to have one.
Muning: My old man once handled a batch of ores at Shenglu Hall. That stone was just a leftover remnant and its quality was poor, so he gave it to me as a toy.
Muning: We had been arguing all the time back then. I never had a job, and to make it worse, I spent most of my time at Yanshang Teahouse. As such, I ended up in heavy debt — and in distress too...
Paimon: Ah...
Traveler: That feels a bit wrong...
Muning: Well, who hasn't done a stupid thing or two when they were young? Anyway, when I was helpless...
Muning: Someone recognized my Archaic Stone and offered a good price. To me, it was no big deal — a stone in exchange for some Mora to get me out of my immediate predicament. A fair trade I'd say.
Muning: Yet my father brought this up the other day and asked, "Muning, where did you put the stone that I gave you?"
Muning: All I could tell him was, "It's just a stone. I've long lost it."
Muning: Though I said so, I couldn't help wondering what if I hadn't sold the stone — then I could show it to Father when he mentioned it...
Muning: ...Forget it. It's no use wondering about the what-if now.
Paimon: At least the prodigal son has returned.
Muning: You are right... It's just that I still have a long way to go before I can clear my debt.
Muning: I've digressed. If you find more, please bring them to me.
Traveler: Aren't these enough?
Muning: Bring me three more. Three more would be enough.
Muning: Archaic Stone is a rare ore. If Huishan Hall wants more, I seriously doubt if I can find any here in The Chasm.
Traveler: Just how many do you need?
Traveler: C'mon, hand in yours first.
