Paimon: Huh? What's Asagiri doing over there? And she's got a terrible look on her face to boot.
Paimon: She isn't in trouble again, is she? Let's go over and see if she's alright!

## Talk

Asagiri: I admire how these novelists manage to stay so creative, but I wish they wouldn't forget to take good care of their health...

## Talk

Asagiri: Can you really see the eyes of the two statues in Luhua Pool clearly from afar?

## Talk

Asagiri: Port Ormos is so lively! How I wish I could be there myself...

## Talk

Asagiri: I hope that this author's new work will sell well. He has really spent a lot of time and effort on this...

## Talk

Asagiri: The author of The Rockeater has always been in good health. Archon even knows how he stays that way...

## Talk

Asagiri: Agh... Miss Moriko actually came to ask me if we should go to the desert to play...
Asagiri: Seriously, though... what's there to play "with" in the desert...?

## Talk

Asagiri: Phew. That romance novel author finally agreed to give this some more thought.
Asagiri: But I still have to do that illustration... *sigh*

## Talk

Tartaglia: Whew, it's finally done. I have to catch up with the others...
Traveler: Tartaglia?
Tartaglia: #Ah, Traveler? Haha, you're just in time. I'm chasing after the powerful "Great Mujina Youkai" with some new comrades I met.
Traveler: Wait, the Great Mujina Youkai?
Tartaglia: Why, from those comrades of mine, of course. Apparently, this extremely powerful youkai has been wreaking havoc across rural Inazuma. Whenever it comes across a child who has snuck outside to play, it starts teasing them.
Tartaglia: You know, things like tying their shoelaces together, or turning mud and roots into fruits on a tree then tricking the children into eating them...
Tartaglia: Sometimes, it even dispatches a few mini mujina and has them turn into parents or teachers to frighten the children.
Tartaglia: Anyway, there's no way I'm gonna let such a formidable youkai run loose.
Tartaglia: If you have time, why not join us on our pursuit of the Great Mujina Youkai?
Traveler: So these "comrades" of yours...
Tartaglia: Oh? So you know Yoimiya too? What a coincidence...
Tartaglia: Anyway, now's not the time for chitchat. Yoimiya and the others are looking for the Great Mujina Youkai's tracks up ahead.
Tartaglia: It's my responsibility to bring up the rear, and ensure the Great Mujina doesn't attack us from behind in a fit of rage.
Traveler: Could one of them be Yoimiya?
Traveler: Where did you hear that name?
Traveler: What are you doing here?

## Talk

Matsuzaka: It's not here either...
Saika: Uhh, Yoimiya... A—Are you sure the Great Mujina's nearby?
Saika: If so, d—does that mean we're in its territory now? Oh, I—I'm scared...
Yoimiya: Don't be scared! There's a whole group of us here, and we brought lots of fireworks too. If anything, the Great Mujina Youkai is the one that should be afraid!
Iwao: Yep, and Tartaglia is watching our backs! There's nothing to be afraid of...
Traveler: Um, sorry to interrupt...
Matsuzaka: Ahh! Yoimiya!
Saika: Aah! Yoimiya! Yoimiya!
Iwao: Tartaglia, help! It's the Great Mujina Youkai!
Yoimiya: #That's not a youkai! It's Traveler. You've met {F#her}{M#him} before, remember?
Traveler: Are you tracking the Great Mujina Youkai?
Yoimiya: That's right, the Great Mujina Youkai has been getting pretty bold lately. It's even starting to trick people in broad daylight.
Yoimiya: Not only did it scribble all over Iwao's homework and get him in trouble at school, it also stole Saika's snacks and broke Matsuzaka's toys.
Traveler: (Sounds like the kids are the ones behind all this...)
Iwao: Yeah, that's why we're here with Yoimiya! We're gonna chase that Great Mujina Youkai away for good!
Traveler: About Tartaglia...
Yoimiya: Oh, him. Um... We specially invited him to be our "Anti-Mujina Specialist."
Yoimiya: Fireworks can only do so much... They may scare it away, but if we want it gone for good, we need the help of a real professional.
Iwao: Tartaglia is so cool! He becomes like a watery blur when he fights. All you hear is WOOSH WOOSH POW! And then all the monsters are defeated!
Iwao: *sigh* If only he could teach me a few of his moves...
Yoimiya: Well, why don't we ask him after we've taken down the Great Mujina Youkai!
Yoimiya: But right now, our priority is to search for evidence of this youkai and trace it back to its lair.
Iwao: And then... we'll be able to tackle it head on! Right, Yoimiya?
Yoimiya: That's right. We'll defeat it together!
Traveler: Uh, Tartaglia is actually...
Yoimiya: Shh, keep your voice down. Don't let Iwao and the others hear you.
Yoimiya: He's one of the Fatui Harbingers, right? Sakujirou mentioned him to me before... and I heard about everything that happened in Liyue, too.
Yoimiya: I know that he might be dangerous... But he saved Iwao, and the kids all warmed up to him right away. He even happily agreed to help us find the Great Mujina Youkai.
Yoimiya: I've heard that the Fatui are all really scary and dangerous... You know, like the kind of people you'd want to avoid the moment you lay eyes on them.
Yoimiya: But Tartaglia isn't like that at all, he's really nice to the kids. He even had an in-depth discussion with them about the Great Mujina Youkai's combat skills...
Yoimiya: From my point of view, it doesn't seem like he's just pretending to be nice. I think the kids would agree — they believe he's a kind, reliable grown-up.
Yoimiya: No matter what Tartaglia's true identity might be... he's doing something good right now, and I think he deserves to be treated accordingly.
Yoimiya: But don't worry, I'm not gonna let my guard down!
Traveler: Just let me know if you run into any trouble.
Yoimiya: Okay, thanks! It's great to have you around.
Traveler: No need to worry, I can deal with him.
Traveler: Tartaglia's true identity is...
Traveler: (It's probably the kids pulling pranks on each other...)
Traveler: Look! It's the Great Mujina Youkai!

## Talk

Tartaglia: I see... Yeah, this will make a wonderful gift.
Yoimiya: Yae Publishing House released several new novels recently. Shigeru told me that a good number of them are children's fairy tales — perfect for reading aloud to kids.
Yoimiya: Oh, and Ogura Mio has just received a new batch of silk. She might've come up with some new kimono designs.
Yoimiya: But do you still remember what size your sister wears? The kimono might look a little off if you get the size wrong.
Tartaglia: Lemme think for a second, I've bought clothes for her plenty of times before... That's it, I believe it's...
Tartaglia: Ah, hold on — she's having her growth spurt at the moment... She probably doesn't fit into anything I've bought her in the past anymore.
Yoimiya: It's okay if you don't know her exact size. You can always just buy her a few bolts of silk instead! Who knows, maybe she'd like that even better.
Yoimiya: Oh! And why don't you take some fireworks with you as well? I just finished creating a new design that's both pretty and relatively quiet. I'm sure your siblings are gonna love it!
Yoimiya: Hmm... What else should you get them... lemme think.
Traveler: What are you two doing?
Tartaglia: Oh, it's you. Yoimiya was just recommending some Inazuman specialties for me to bring back as souvenirs.
Tartaglia: If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to buy.
Traveler: So how did you two meet?
Tartaglia: Hehe, talk about a coincidence. I happened to be passing through Inazuma while taking care of some... work. I wanted to grab some presents for my younger siblings while I was here, but I couldn't decide on what to buy.
Tartaglia: Teucer once told me that he wanted to hold an Onikabuto, so I decided to go catch one of those little bugs first.
Tartaglia: As I was looking for Onikabuto in the forest, I saw a child playing all on his own... and he was headed straight for a camp of monsters.
Tartaglia: So I stopped the child, dealt with the monsters, and then he led me back to Yoimiya.
Tartaglia: After that... Well, I was designated as the "Anti-Mujina Specialist."
Tartaglia: It's a shame the kids' parents came and took everyone back home, saying that they'd had enough adventures outside. *sigh* Our hunt for the youkai came to an abrupt end.
Tartaglia: The ship I'll be leaving on will arrive in Inazuma in just a few days. Then it'll be my turn to go back home.
Tartaglia: Oh, by the way, Yoimiya, can you recommend a few local beverages as well?
Yoimiya: Local beverages? But you're going to be on a ship for quite some time, right? Beverages spoil easily... How about bringing some snacks with a longer shelf life? Something like Tricolor Dango or Sakura Mochi, for example.
Yoimiya: Saika loves Tricolor Dango, but the adults in her family always scold her for eating too many and spoiling her appetite.
Tartaglia: Teucer used to be like that too. After having too many snacks, he'd refuse to eat his meals and end up getting yelled at by Father...
Tartaglia: Anyways, thanks Yoimiya. I gotta make sure I have enough Mora for all this.
Tartaglia: Two kimonos, three bolts of silk, one novel, five boxes of snacks... Oh, and the Onikabuto as well.
Yoimiya: You really care a lot about your family, Tartaglia...
Traveler: Did anything weird happen?
Yoimiya: Oh, you mean with Tartaglia? Nah, everything's fine. He took great care of the kids and even promised Iwao he'd teach him a few moves with a sword.
Yoimiya: Though, I have to say... It's amazing you have so many friends from all over the world.
Traveler: It's not that many, really...
Yoimiya: You're so lucky... I'd travel all across the world too if I had the chance. I want to see all that there is to see and make friends with all kinds of people... I would even go on adventures with them, just like you do...
Yoimiya: But for now, I have to stay home with my pops, so I won't be traveling far anytime soon.
Yoimiya: Don't keep it a secret next time you come to Inazuma, okay? Just be sure to visit Naganohara Fireworks first and tell me all about the amazing things you've seen on your journey.
Traveler: It's because I'm always traveling...
Traveler: Is everything alright?
