Gentry De'an: Ugh, what do you want?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you...?
Gentry De'an: Typical! Young people these days! Care more about what's on their head than what's inside it...
Gentry De'an: I'll have you know that ten years ago, everyone from Feiyun Slope down to the Dockyard knew the name Gentry De'an!
Gentry De'an: Now? The bank's gone, Chu's gone... It's such a pity! I've lived this long only to watch everything fall apart at the end...

## Talk

Traveler: Do you need a hand?
Gentry De'an: #Hmph! {F#She}{M#He} wants to lend a hand! And just how do you expect to do that? Raise the dead? Magically recover my lost wealth?
Gentry De'an: *sigh* I used to have my own bank... The Minghua Company and the Minghua Bank used to be the two proudest stores on this whole street.
Gentry De'an: But then those bankers from Snezhnaya started descending on the Liyue financial market... All thanks to backing from the Fatui, I might add, not an honest-to-god bootstrapper among them! Anyway... that marked the beginning of the end for the old guard...
Gentry De'an: If I was a young man with some fight left in me, oh you can be sure I'd be fighting to make my comeback...
Gentry De'an: But there's not much an old man like me can do now.
Traveler: The Fatui?
Gentry De'an: What about them? ...You've never heard of them?
Gentry De'an: They came over here from Snezhnaya, flaunting their diplomatic immunity, then they started poking around in business circles, putting feelers out... I had a bad feeling about them from the start.
Gentry De'an: Then they started interfering with my business... They were intent on getting Snezhnayan investment into Liyue one way or another.
Gentry De'an: They were just relentless. Eventually, I had no choice but to sell off the bank to them. And the company? Who knows how much longer it will last. Business is getting worse by the day...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Gentry De'an: Hmph, well I hope I won't see you! Stay out of my sight.

## Talk

Gentry De'an: So many medicines, but no cure for heartache...

## Talk

Traveler: Is something the matter?
Gentry De'an: Hmph... My story has become a byword here in Liyue...
Gentry De'an: Not a while back, I opposed my daughter Huachu's marriage to some beggar boy... and my sweet daughter, she threw herself down a well...
Gentry De'an: Why, oh why, did she have to fall for that indigent, rat-eyed schoolmaster? Ah, alas!
Gentry De'an: She'd rather live a pauper with him than let me arrange her affairs. I said but a few words, and then she... she...
Gentry De'an: How could you be so foolish, Huachu...
Gentry De'an: And you! Are you trying to rub salt in my wounds? Scram! Get lost! Don't bother me!

## Talk

Traveler: See you, then.
Gentry De'an: ...Bye.
Gentry De'an: ...A father burying his daughter...

## Talk

Gentry De'an: Remember, Lantern Rite festival is not all fun and games!
Gentry De'an: The reason we celebrate is to remember the brave heroes who fought and died for Liyue. Enjoy the festival, but don't forget to spare a thought for them.
