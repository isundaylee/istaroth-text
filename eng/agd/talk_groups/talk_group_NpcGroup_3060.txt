Asakura: Heâ€”Hello, how can I help you?

Traveler: Did I scare you?
Asakura: Ah, you're the Traveler. How do you do? This is the side gate, and few people pass this way... so you really did give me a fright there, ahaha...
Asakura: This gate leads to the Tenshukaku, the residence of our Almighty Shogun, so please refrain from doing anything reckless here.

Asakura: You're here just in time. Today's an important day!
Traveler: Is this about your weapon...
Asakura: That's right! I've been looking all over the place for clues, and I've finally determined the location of that band of Kairagi!
Asakura: Today, I will redeem myself and take back my weapon!
Paimon: Oh! Asakura is really motivated!
Asakura: However, I mustn't make the same mistake as before. The Kairagi are numerous, and many of them are unscrupulous.
Asakura: As long as they swarm me and drain my stamina, I'll be put on the back foot, and the same thing will happen again...
Asakura: Therefore, I want you to accompany me this time.
Asakura: I was defeated by them last time because the Kairagi were able to use their numerical advantage and took turns in whittling away my stamina.
Asakura: After I ran out of energy, their leader challenged me to a duel.
Asakura: This time, I would like you to fend off the surrounding Kairagi while I challenge their leader directly.
Asakura: After I cut down that villain, I'll come and help you.
Traveler: You got it!
Asakura: I am grateful for your assistance!
Asakura: In short, I'll be leaving things to you.
Asakura: Now then, let us not delay things. Let's head off.
Traveler: It sounds like I'll be taking on many of them at once...
Asakura: Without their numbers, those Kairagi are nothing more than a rabble.
Asakura: I have faith in your skills. Even if they decide to rush at you all at once, I still believe they'll stand no chance against you.
Traveler: You think too highly of me...
