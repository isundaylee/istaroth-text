Traveler: A trial that looks like a performance?
Vimeur: It's just a metaphor. Since the Hydro Archon would be present, we usually add some dramatic elements, like those found in plays.
Vimeur: But the trials themselves are legitimate. Thanks to the Chief Justice and Oratrice's just verdict, every trial will come to a successful conclusion.
