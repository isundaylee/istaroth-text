Traveler: A lover of climbing, I see?
Rumipaq: Of course. The mountains are my playground, and the mountaintops are my laurels of victory!
Rumipaq: Victories against who, I hear you ask? Why, my former self, of course!
Rumipaq: Victory is when the mountains you climb today are higher than those you climbed the day before.
Rumipaq: My apologies, this is just how we are in Natlan.
Rumipaq: Or should I say, this is how most of us Scions of the Canopy think. If you were talking to the Children of Echoes, they'd probably tell you about heading deep into the mountains, rather than climbing them.
