# Archaic Stone

A strange, rare ore that was mined from The Chasm.
These rocks can only be found in the ore veins of the oldest mountains. It is so rare that most merchants have probably never heard of it.
However, the changes in The Chasm have led to the emergence of much low-quality Archaic Stone, a fact that has given the merchants of Huishan Hall quite the headache.
