Traveler: Where's your dad?
Pepe: He went to chase a huuuge boar. It'll be ages and ages before he gets back.
Pepe: I wanted to go and help my dad with the hunt, but Uncle Draff said I'm not big enough yet, I wouldn't be strong enough to be a hunter, and it would only make things worse if I went.
Pepe: So I wanna grow up as fast as I can, learn how to hunt, and then I'll be able to help dad!
