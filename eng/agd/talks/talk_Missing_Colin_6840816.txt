L'or noir: Missing: Colin
L'or noir: A former researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, an expert in the field of thermal energy. Strong body, weak and timid personality.
L'or noir: The individual has been missing for over a month, and has accrued a tab in the tens of thousands of Mora at the L'or noir. If anyone can provide useful information, please contact Tetreaux. We are most grateful for any information.
Message: I bet old Colin had the underpants scammed off of him. If you ask me, he's long gone.
