# Talk Dialog

Traveler: It sounds like you're the one who needs help, really.
Yves: To be honest, I think I've accepted that my work simply cannot be finished.
Yves: After all, that Goldman — that is, my boss — is one of those... "calculative" people.
Yves: That's how I often find myself here, busy dealing with divesuits that could possibly stop working, or something like that...
Yves: Not to mention the stuff deep underwater, and those waterweeds and detritus that seem to think my job is far too easy...
Yves: ...Oh, I've started complaining again, haven't I? Sorry about that. Anyway, thanks for your concern.
