# Top Note: Floral Debt


## Talk 1

Paimon: So, this guy was a famous perfumer in Fontaine... But then, he came to Sumeru to... teach people from Fontaine? Sounds confusing...
Emilie: It's a long story. If you're interested, we can talk more about it when we see him. He should be staying near the hotel.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow! Look at these flowers! They smell so...
Paimon: So... ACHOO!
Emilie: ...Huh?
Paimon: Achoo!
Traveler: Something wrong?
Paimon: Paimon's... fine, she's just... got a little...
Paimon: ..Aaah—Achoo! ACHOO!
Emilie: ...Rainbow Roses... Glaze Lilies... and Cecilias? No wonder...
Paimon: It... It's getting worse... Why...
Paimon: ACHOO!
Traveler: Maybe you're sick!
Paimon: But... Paimon was fine just a moment ago... She didn't even eat anything weird...
Emilie: Ah, a moment of your time, you two... If it's not too much trouble, perhaps you could try this incense.
Paimon: Incense? ...Oh, the scent is so nice... Wait!
Traveler: You can talk normally now!
Paimon: Woah... That was fast! Paimon doesn't have to sneeze anymore!
Traveler: Must've been the incense! Thank you!
Emilie: Think nothing of it! From your attire, I imagine you two aren't from Sumeru either...
Emilie: Seeing as we're both travelers from abroad, it's only right that we help each other out should the occasion arise.
Paimon: Oh... So, you're here for the Flower Exhibition too?
Emilie: Hm... I suppose that's accurate. Ah, allow me to introduce myself... I'm Emilie, a perfumer from Fontaine.
Paimon: Paimon is Paimon! Thank you so much for your help just now! Oh, and this is...
Emilie: #{NICKNAME}, right? I've heard a lot about you from The Steambird. It's nice to finally put a face to the name.
Traveler: I've heard a lot about you as well...
Paimon: What happened back there? Why did Paimon start sneezing all of a sudden...?
Emilie: Hm... Have you ever heard of hay fever?
Traveler: I think so...
Emilie: To put it simply... When inhaled, certain pollens can trigger abnormal physical reactions.
Paimon: Uh... But, Paimon has seen these kinds of flowers before, and nothing weird happened then...
Emilie: Well, we're all different. The factors that can trigger a reaction to certain stimuli vary by person. In isolation, the effects of certain pollens may seem minimal, but inhaling various types at once can trigger a more overt reaction.
Emilie: But, there's no need to worry. Pollen allergies can be effectively mitigated with the use of medication.
Paimon: Oh, well, that's good...
Tighnari: #{NICKNAME}! Paimon! There you are... Is everything alright?
Tighnari: I left in such a hurry, I forgot to warn you about all the pollen in the air...
Traveler: Yeah, Paimon was not having a good time...
Tighnari: #Emilie? Ah, what a coincidence... Looks like my worry was misplaced, then. {NICKNAME} and Paimon are in good hands.
Emilie: It was nothing, really. We happened to run into each other shortly after my arrival, and I offered them a bit of help, that's all.
Emilie: #I'm more curious as to why you thought {NICKNAME} and Paimon were in danger... Allergies are highly unpredictable. If you were concerned the pollen might trigger a reaction, that must mean... something similar has happened in the past?
Traveler: Something like that, yeah...
Tighnari: Remember the first time we met? You fainted after inhaling Spirit Borneol...
Traveler: That was an allergic reaction?
Paimon: The Spirit Borneol didn't affect Paimon at all, and now she's the one suffering... It makes no sense!
Tighnari: It's not really something you can make sense out of, Paimon. There are all kinds of allergies out there, caused by a variety of different factors. Some people are even allergic to almonds... It's not something you can generalize.
Emilie: Exactly. I even encountered a case in Fontaine where someone had an allergic reaction to Soba Noodles their family brought back from Inazuma...
Paimon: Woah... Good thing Paimon isn't allergic to anything delicious...
Traveler: Are you a doctor, Emilie?
Emilie: Hm... In a manner of speaking. Although, you could say the "patients" I deal with are rather unusual...
Tighnari: In addition to medicine, Emilie is also very knowledgeable about botany. She's taught me a lot about the native flora around Fontaine.
Emilie: And that's where my expertise ends, I'm afraid. When it comes to breadth of knowledge, Tighnari certainly comes out on top.
Paimon: A flower expert... Ah, Paimon's got it! You must be the expert Tighnari mentioned! The one in charge of the exhibition!
Tighnari: ...Wrong again, I'm afraid.
Emilie: Well, I did come for the exhibition, but only to inquire about the "Auguste" variety. I'm not involved in any official capacity.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon was sure she got it right this time...
Traveler: The "Auguste" variety? What's that?
Emilie: It's a kind of flower that was once popular in Fontaine. The perfume made from it also bears the same name... "Auguste."
Paimon: "Auguste," huh... That's not a name you hear often nowadays!
Emilie: In an ancient language, the word is said to mean "sacred" or "noble." It's sometimes used as a name for people as well.
Emilie: ...Ah, that reminds me, are you familiar with the historical event in Fontaine known as the "Perfume Mania"?
Traveler: Not really...
Emilie: The "Perfume Mania" was an event that occurred in Fontaine nearly twenty years ago...
Traveler: But, Paimon was the victim this time.
Traveler: But, Emilie helped us out.
Traveler: But, I don't know much about it.
Traveler: Although, I didn't expect to run into you in Sumeru.
Traveler: Should we go find Tighnari?
Traveler: You feeling okay?

## Talk 3

Emilie: It all started when several merchants released their own lines of high-end, expensive perfumes, marketing them as must-have, luxury products, the very symbol of elegance itself...
Emilie: No one anticipated the absolute frenzy this would create on the market, causing the price of the perfumes to skyrocket.
Emilie: The demand was two-fold... What some saw as a status symbol, most saw as a money-making opportunity. You could take advantage of the soaring price by hoarding them and reselling at even higher margins.
Emilie: The value of these products became so inflated, regular bottles of perfume were even going for hundreds of thousands of Mora. This resulted in countless disputes and scams.
Emilie: But, at the end of the day, perfume is just perfume. The market value greatly exceeded the intrinsic worth of the product, creating an economic bubble that was never going to last.
Emilie: Luckily, the Palais Mermonia recognized the danger and intervened before the craze could truly spread. Many profiteers and scammers were thrown in jail as a result.
Emilie: In the end, only a few wealthy families were affected when the bubble popped.
Traveler: That's good... It really could have been a lot worse.
Paimon: What does all this have to do with that "Auguste" you mentioned earlier?
Emilie: Well, during the craze, the most popular perfume was none other than "Auguste." The demand far exceeded the supply, to the point where it once sold for ten million Mora a bottle.
Paimon: T—Ten million!? Then what about now?
Traveler: Calm down, Paimon.
Emilie: After the mania ended, most perfumes returned to a normal price. "Auguste" was the only exception...
Emilie: ...Its namesake, the flower used to create it, went extinct. As a result, no new bottles of "Auguste" have been made, and the value of the perfume remains exceedingly high.
Traveler: The flower... went extinct?
Emilie: Indeed. The Auguste flower was not a natural variety, you see. It was specially cultivated for use in perfume-making.
Emilie: When the bubble popped, all the flowerbeds used for its cultivation were destroyed in a fire. The variety has never been seen since...
Paimon: But... didn't you say you came to the exhibition to look for it?
Emilie: Ah, yes. I came to investigate a certain rumor that the Auguste flower has reappeared in Sumeru... It's causing quite the stir in the Fontaine perfume market.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! We should help Emilie look for it!
Traveler: It's just a rumor, Paimon...
Tighnari: I have to agree. Emilie wrote me to ask if I could look into the rumor, but the Forest Rangers haven't received any reports of new plant species recently.
Emilie: Even if I can locate the flower, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, Paimon. I don't have any grand Mora-making endeavors planned.
Paimon: Ehhhh!?
Emilie: "Divine," "noble," "one of a kind"... All beautiful sentiments, to be sure... But, to me, they overshadow the very essence of the product.
Emilie: When it comes to perfume, I want people to forget the price and the prestige... and focus on the beauty of the fragrance itself.
Paimon: Wow... So noble...
Emilie: Of course, there's also a more practical reason... In recent years, low-grade, counterfeit versions of "Auguste" have been popping up on the Fontaine perfume market.
Emilie: ...Every so often, someone will claim to have recreated the unique scent of "Auguste," and the rumor mill will start comparing the counterfeits to my own work.
Paimon: Okay, that's more like the reason Paimon had in mind.
Emilie: Ever since that rumor started, three new perfumes claiming to be made from the Auguste flower have appeared on the market.
Emilie: If I can dispel the fanaticism surrounding "Auguste" — even just by proving the rumor to be false — Fontaine's perfume market can finally start to get back to normal.
Emilie: Then, I'll be free from all the "stories" and "added meaning," and can focus on making what I like.
Paimon: That makes sense...
Traveler: Either way, even if it's not for Mora...
Emilie: Oh... I would, of course, be grateful for your help, but I wouldn't want to trouble you.
Paimon: Well, you said it yourself! We're both travelers from abroad, so "it's only right that we help each other out!"
Emilie: Hah... I suppose you're right. Then, you have my thanks.
Tighnari: Based on the information I have so far, it's unclear if the rumor is true.
Tighnari: Mr. Edgar also thinks it's too early to say... But you could always go talk to him? He was there all those years ago, after all... Maybe he'll know something.
Emilie: Ah, I was just about to pay him a visit at the hotel.
Paimon: Edgar...? Who's that?
Tighnari: The person you've been trying to guess this whole time — the "Flower Expert" in charge of the exhibition. He's also the most respected and experienced perfumer in the area.
Tighnari: Back when he was still working in Fontaine, "Auguste"... was his creation.
Emilie: I should also mention... He was my teacher, the one who taught me the basics of perfumery when I apprenticed in Sumeru.
Traveler: We could still help you out.
Traveler: There's no way it's that easy to find...

## Talk 4

Emilie: Master looks a lot older than when I last saw him... I just hope he can hold on...

## Talk 5

Tighnari: I need to stay back and keep an eye on things here at the port. If something happens, don't hesitate to find me.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Woah, look at all the flowers!
Emilie: Apparently, the exhibitor paid a large sum to rent out the hotel and surrounding buildings. They're being used as temporary storage facilities and lodging for exhibition personnel.
Traveler: Seems a bit excessive...
Paimon: Yeah! What if guests come early? They won't have anywhere to stay! Also, renting out this big of a hotel... how are they gonna make that Mora back...?
Traveler: Seems like they might have Mora to burn...
Sylvain: ...It's been so long, I almost didn't recognize you, Edgar.
Edgar: ...Well, you and your brother haven't changed a bit.
Lucien: All this catching up is nice and all, but let's get down to business! We need to talk about Kirya. Is he—
Edgar: Hold on... We have guests.
Emilie: It's nice to see you again, Master.
Edgar: Emilie... Is that you, haha? It's been years... Look at you! You're all grown up!
Edgar: I've heard you've become quite the famous perfumer in Fontaine. It would seem the student has surpassed the master...
Emilie: It's all thanks to your mentorship.
Edgar: Ah! Hardly, hardly... I taught you the basics. Hearing you call me "Master," well, I'm not sure I'm deserving of that title.
Edgar: I've taught many students here in Sumeru over the years, but I've yet to see one turn out quite as accomplished as you... You're the only one who can take credit for that success!
Edgar: And who are these two...? I don't recall you mentioning them in your letter...
Emilie: #Ah, they're my new friends, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Traveler: Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Edgar.
Edgar: Emilie's friends? Well then, the pleasure is all mine.
Emilie: And these two gentlemen... Are they friends of yours, Master?
Lucien: Hmph...
Sylvain: Uh... Haha, of course! We're perfume merchants from Fontaine.
Sylvain: I'm... Eude! And this, here, is my younger brother, Blaise. Edgar and the two of us are old friends... Isn't that right, gentlemen?
Lucien: ...Yes.
Emilie: Merchant brothers...?
Paimon: You must be here to look for the Auguste flower, then!
Lucien: ...!
Sylvain: ...Haha, well, what respectable perfume merchant hasn't heard of "Auguste"? Anyone in the business would be interested in the rumors.
Edgar: I'm guessing you're here for the same reason, Emilie? We were just about to get into it, so you three might as well join in.
Edgar: I commissioned a few Eremites to do some scouting for me. They searched all over Sumeru, but there were no sightings of the Auguste flower.
Edgar: That being said, there are people in Port Ormos who claim to have smelled a unique fragrance on the streets... definitely floral, but still distinct...
Edgar: Some of them were merchants who lived in Fontaine twenty years ago. According to them, the fragrance smelled exactly like the "Auguste" they remember from back then...
Edgar: A "one of a kind," "divine," and "noble" scent...
Paimon: Hmm... Maybe someone around here just happens to have a bottle of "Auguste" from back then?
Emilie: No, I don't think so. I doubt that's the case. Even if someone had a bottle that was never opened, the fragrance of the perfume would have changed over time. Very few perfumes can go decades without a change in scent...
Emilie: "Auguste" is even more prone to that kind of shift. Only a few bottles still exist in Fontaine, and their scent would have completely degraded by now.
Emilie: Although... could there be a flower out there with a similar fragrance? Or an accord with the same base notes?
Lucien: Impossible! If "Auguste" were that easy to replicate, it would never have sold for such a high price all those years ago! The Auguste flower is back! It has to be!
Emilie: Technically speaking, the scent wouldn't be impossible to imitate...
Sylvain: Well, let's table that question for now. Edgar, did any of those people mention where the scent was coming from?
Edgar: ...No. By the time they realized they had smelled something, the scent was already gone. If I hadn't asked about it, they probably wouldn't have given the experience a second thought.
Edgar: Compared to things we see and hear, smells can be much easier to overlook...
Sylvain: Hmm... It almost sounds like someone wearing the "Auguste" fragrance passed them on the street...
Lucien: Wait, are you saying...
Sylvain: Ah, just thinking out loud, haha. Don't pay me any mind.
Edgar: We don't have much to go off of right now, but we can't rule out that possibility. I'll send some more people to investigate.
Edgar: You all traveled so far to be here, why don't you rest in the hotel for a bit? Uh... Eude, Blaise, this is the key to your room.
Paimon: Ooh, you've got the keys to the rooms? Do we get free lodging too?
Edgar: Ah... My apologies. All the rooms in the hotel are accounted for, I'm afraid. Most are being used for storage ahead of the exhibition, you see.
Edgar: I managed to tidy up one of the rooms for these two at the last minute... But, by the time Emilie wrote to me, there was no more space left for her to stay.
Paimon: Oh, and we just showed up out of the blue... Guess that means there's definitely no space for us.
Edgar: *sigh*... I should've been more considerate. Here I am with an entire hotel at my disposal, and no place to offer you to stay... even after you made the trip all the way to Sumeru.
Emilie: Don't worry, Master. I can sleep on the boat tonight. Or, I could even camp in the wild. It would give me the opportunity to collect some plant specimens while I'm here in Sumeru.
Traveler: I'm familiar with the Sumeru wilderness...
Emilie: Ah, even better!
Emilie: Although... Would it be possible for me to leave some of my luggage here? It would be rather cumbersome to take it camping. It shouldn't take up too much space...
Edgar: Well... About that...
Traveler: (It seems like Edgar and the others don't want anyone to stay near the hotel... But, they're also trying not to arouse suspicion... I'm not just imagining things, am I?)
Sylvain: Haha... Of course! No trouble at all! My brother and I will keep an eye on them for you... as long as you don't mind, Mademoiselle!
Edgar: ...Alright, then. Eude, why don't you take Emilie inside and find a suitable place for her luggage.
Edgar: I'll prepare some refreshments and join you in a bit.
Traveler: I'll come with.

## Talk 7

Edgar: I'm sorry I couldn't offer you a room...
Emilie: It's alright, Master. I know it was sudden.
Edgar: I'll be sure to make it up to you with a nice cup of tea.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Woah, the smell of flowers is so strong! Didn't Edgar say he tidied up around here? There's still so many flowers...
Paimon: Paimon took a peek through the window earlier, and his house was packed with flowers! Looks like this exhibition is gonna be huge!
Traveler: Do all perfumers have houses filled with flowers?
Emilie: ...No. That's a Florist thing.
Emilie: We work closely with the essential oils of various plants, but to maintain a sharp sense of smell, most perfumers prefer to keep their homes free of strong odors.
Paimon: Ohhh... Guess there's just too much to store for the exhibition, then.
Traveler: What's behind this door?
Sylvain: Ah, this room seems to be a connected suite. My brother will be staying on the other side of the suite.
Sylvain: Blaise... While you're out, why don't you bring our luggage over as well...
Lucien: ...
Sylvain: Ahem... Blaise!
Lucien: Ah... Yes, of course.
Sylvain: Alright, then... Where can we find your luggage, Mademoiselle? Blaise will go fetch it for you.
Emilie: It's still at the port. In addition to some daily necessities, there's also a case of Amber Wine that I brought back from Fontaine...
Emilie: ...Could I trouble you to bring that back as well? It would be the perfect way to repay you for your hospitality.
Sylvain: Haha, how generous! I should thank you on my brother's behalf. You've stumbled upon his weakness! He's aloof about most things, but alcohol is his one true love.
Emilie: ...Is that so?
Traveler: (Amber Wine... Now that's a Fontaine specialty I've never heard of before...)
Emilie: Mr. Eude, Mr. Blaise.. Thanks for—
Edgar: ...Hey! What are you doing?
Edgar: Argh!
Emilie: That's... Master's voice!
Traveler: Quick! Let's go see what's going on!

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: As you rush out of the hotel, you detect a unique fragrance coming from outside...
Lucien: ...Edgar!
Emilie: ...Master!
Lucien: Hey, Edgar! Are you alright? Can you hear me?
Sylvain: Who did this?
Edgar: K—Kirya... "Auguste"...!
Edgar: Ugh...
Sylvain: ...Kirya!
Lucien: Hey! Edgar! Edgar!
Emilie: No, don't shake him. He's injured. Just leave him to me. You two can...
Traveler: We'll investigate the scene.
Emilie: ...Oh, thank you.
Traveler: We'll try to see where the culprit went.

## Talk 10

Emilie: Skin is flushed, pupils are dilated... But he's still breathing...

## Talk 11

Paimon: That strange smell around here... Is it coming from this bottle?
Traveler: (Only a small amount of liquid is left inside the bottle, and streaks of residue can be seen on both the mouth and the sides of the vessel. It seems like someone forcibly poured out whatever was inside the bottle...)
Traveler: I have a feeling...
Paimon: *gasp* Really? You think so?
Traveler: The liquid in this bottle is...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Do you think whoever did this was hiding in the flowers before they attacked Edgar?
Traveler: (There are no footprints in the flower beds... And it doesn't look like any of the branches or leaves have been disturbed...)
Traveler: Unless the culprit was your size...
Paimon: Hm, true...
Traveler: That would be pretty difficult.

## Talk 13

Lucien: I checked... It doesn't look like anyone passed through here.
Sylvain: But that's impossible... It's not like that kid can just grow some wings and fly away.
Traveler: That kid?
Sylvain: Oh, uh... the culprit, I mean! It's not like the culprit could have just disappeared into thin air!

## Talk 14

Paimon: ...Well, we looked all over, but the only clue we found was that bottle...
Emilie: The most important thing we can do now is focus our efforts on treating Master. Can you help me move him inside?
Traveler: Absolutely.

## Talk 15

Traveler: (Sylvain and his brother seem wary of us... We should leave them be for now. We don't want to spook them.)

## Talk 16

Paimon: So... How's he doing?
Emilie: When I administered emergency treatment, I discovered a residue in his nose and mouth... Master was most likely forced to ingest a certain liquid.
Emilie: He's still unconscious, and inducing vomiting could obstruct his airways... We'll have to look into other clues for now.
Traveler: We found this bottle just now...
Emilie: Ah, yes... The scent is the same, but the chemical composition is still unclear. We'll have to do further tests to determine if it's the same liquid. And how toxic it is to the human body.
Emilie: But, first... I do believe there are two people who could shed some light on the situation...
Emilie: Mr. Sylvain, Mr. Lucien...
Lucien: Wait, you—!
Sylvain: Hey...!
Sylvain: ...Were you talking to us, Mademoiselle? I'm afraid we've never heard of those names before...
Emilie: Hmm... Before arriving in Sumeru, I asked a friend from the Special Patrol to look into the creators of "Auguste"...
Emilie: There were four people in total... The perfumer, Edgar — the one thrust into the limelight — and three others...
Emilie: A researcher from Sumeru responsible for cultivating the Auguste flower... and two merchant brothers responsible for promoting the product on the market...
Emilie: The two brothers capitalized on the mythos surrounding "Auguste." Their actions lured in numerous speculators and profiteers, inflating the price of "Auguste" even further.
Emilie: In the end, they were sent to the Fortress of Meropide for falsifying their accounts and destabilizing the market... If you do the math, they should be out of prison by now.
Lucien: Hmph! And what does that have to do with us? There are countless merchant families in Fontaine... You gonna accuse them of being criminals too?
Emilie: Every time your brother called you "Blaise," it took you several seconds to respond... But, when I called you "Lucien" just now, the name registered immediately.
Lucien: I...!
Sylvain: Ah, Miss Emilie... Out of respect for your position as a famous perfumer in Fontaine, I'm inclined to believe that was simply a poor attempt at humor.
Sylvain: You have a bright future ahead of you. You wouldn't want to develop a reputation as someone who throws around false accusations... especially among merchant circles.
Emilie: Hmm... You claim to be regular perfume merchants, and yet... When I brought up "Amber Wine," you took it to be alcohol...
Sylvain: What!?
Traveler: (Just as I thought...)
Emilie: "Amber Wine" is a perfume I created several years ago. It wasn't particularly renowned, but I'm certain any respectable perfume merchant in Fontaine would know of it.
Emilie: Unless, until recently, they were living somewhere completely cut off from the perfume world... Hmm, somewhere like... the Fortress of Meropide perhaps...?
Lucien: Emilie, you little...!
Traveler: Don't even think about it.
Lucien: Oof...!
Emilie: Don't misunderstand, Mr. Sylvain. I don't bring this up to criticize you. No matter what happened all those years ago, the court has already passed its judgment.
Emilie: But Master's life is in danger. We need to learn whatever we can about the person who has done this.
Emilie: If Master's attack had something to do with "Auguste," I would imagine the two of you might also be in danger.
Emilie: So, I'd like to trouble you for some information, if I may... Tell me about "Kirya."
Sylvain: ...
Sylvain: ...Fine. As you wish.
Lucien: ...Sylvain!
Sylvain: Lucien, if this will help us find Kirya, then it will be all worth it. Besides, we've already told most of this stuff to the Maison Ordalie, anyway.
Sylvain: ...You were right, Miss Emilie, there were four of us at the beginning: Myself, Lucien, Edgar... and a researcher from Sumeru in charge of flower cultivation... Vijava.
Sylvain: Some time down the road, the Marechaussee Phantom came knocking, saddled us with a list of accusations, and started looking into our books... They did their meddling, and my brother, Edgar, and I were forced to serve time in the Fortress as a result...
Paimon: Sounds like he's still upset about that... Wait, then how did Edgar end up in Sumeru?
Emilie: Master was convicted as an accomplice, so he only had to serve a few years. He decided to move to Sumeru so that he could put those events behind him.
Emilie: ...Still, Master was depressed for a long time after that... He stopped making new perfumes and focused on introducing students to the craft instead.
Emilie: That's how I met him. My parents had to relocate to Sumeru for work when I was a child, so I had the chance to study under him for a little while.
Emilie: ...But, we can talk about that some other time. I want to hear more about this researcher... Vijava.
Sylvain: ...Like us, Vijava was also staring down an investigation from the Marechaussee Phantom.
Sylvain: But, before the Phantom showed up at her door, she set all the flowerbeds on fire, along with much of the Mora we managed to earn. All the Auguste flowers, everything we worked to create... was reduced to nothing but a pile of ash.
Paimon: But... destroying all that evidence... Wouldn't that make things worse for her?
Emilie: It didn't matter at that point... Because she died in the fire as well.
Paimon: What!?
Lucien: Hmph, sounds like you did an investigation of your own. Why even ask us if you knew all of this already?
Traveler: So far...
Emilie: The name wasn't mentioned in any of the files I reviewed, either. But... you two seem quite familiar with him.
Sylvain: ...Kirya was Vijava's younger brother.
Sylvain: He was just a clueless kid back then... somewhere in his teens, I think. He helped his sister with her work sometimes, but that was pretty much it... He didn't have any idea what we were doing.
Sylvain: Vijava kept him close most of the time. The three of us were probably the only ones who even knew she had a brother.
Sylvain: After our operation was compromised, he disappeared... There were no signs of him until recently, when people started saying the Auguste flower had reappeared in Sumeru.
Emilie: ...So, you think Kirya took something with him back then... something that allowed him to reproduce the Auguste flower?
Lucien: Hmph, Vijava doted on the kid like you wouldn't believe! She even told us to give her cut to her brother if anything happened to her.
Lucien: If she left something behind before she died, believe me — Kirya's the one that has it!
Sylvain: And judging by the liquid in that bottle... the Auguste flower wasn't the only thing he reproduced... He managed to replicate the perfume itself...
Paimon: So the liquid Edgar was forced to ingest really was "Auguste"! Wait, does that mean "Auguste" is poison?
Sylvain: Ahem! Poison? No, no... of course not! No perfume is meant to be ingested. Even small amounts can be dangerous, let alone ingesting a whole bottle at once.
Sylvain: If "Auguste" could be considered a poison, we wouldn't have even sold half a bottle back then. Edgar fell unconscious because Kirya forced him to drink perfume... it just happened to be "Auguste"!
Traveler: (Strange... Sylvain seems nervous all of a sudden...)
Traveler: Why did Kirya attack Edgar?
Sylvain: Hah... He probably thought we had something to do with his sister's death. But, to tell you the truth, I have no idea why she did all that.
Sylvain: We're not looking for Kirya because we have it out for him... We just wanted to see how he was doing... and, if possible, work together to bring back "Auguste."
Sylvain: We only went to prison for a bit of fraud and market manipulation... It had nothing to do with the product itself.
Sylvain: As long as we keep things honest this time around... bringing the product back to market would almost be like honoring his sister's memory!
Emilie: ...So, that's why you never mentioned Kirya during your interrogation?
Lucien: ...Yes, exactly! We were just looking out for the kid!
Sylvain: Anyway, that's all we know... If you're looking for information on what's in "Auguste" or what to do if you ingest it... there are only two people to ask — Edgar... or Kirya himself.
Emilie: ...Well, at least we're able to say for certain that the substance Edgar ingested was, in fact, "Auguste." That gives us a direction for further testing... Well, then, I'd say that was a very enlightening discussion.
Sylvain: Ah, well, glad to hear it.
Sylvain: Lucien, let's head back to the room and rest for a bit. With everything that's happened... There are things that need reconsidering...
Lucien: Yes, of course.
Emilie: ...
Traveler: ...They're still hiding something.
Emilie: Ah, you think so too? Hmm, that does seem to be the case... Pity we don't have more evidence.
Emilie: But, based on Sylvain's tone of voice just now, I suspect further questioning will only result in more made-up answers.
Paimon: The way you exposed them like that, just based on a hunch... That was genius!
Traveler: Are you really just a perfumer who looks after people in your spare time?
Paimon: Oh, right! Earlier you said you were only sort of a doctor... and that your patients were "unusual"...
Emilie: Oh, yes. That's because most of the "patients" I encounter... are already dead.
Paimon: So, you're a... forensic doctor?
Emilie: Close... I'm actually a "forensic cleaner." Once the forensic team and the Marechaussee Phantom are done collecting evidence from the scene, I'm in charge of clearing away the final traces my "patients" leave on the world.
Emilie: In fact, with just a small alteration to the formula, the same tincture used as the base of perfume can also be made into a cleaning agent.
Emilie: Basically, there are two sides to forensics — those who collect evidence to expose the truth, and those who clean up the smells, bloodstains, and other substances left behind at the scene.
Emilie: I've learned a lot in my line of work, and I've witnessed a lot of death... But this time, we may still save the patient.
Emilie: #Actually, {NICKNAME}, could I trouble you to report back to Tighnari and the officers at Port Ormos? We should update them on the situation...
Traveler: Will do.
Emilie: I'll stay here and continue to look after Master. Now that we have a sample of "Auguste"... I'm hoping further analysis won't be too difficult.
Traveler: Kirya's name still hasn't come up.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Tighnari: Woah, why the rush? Did something happen?
Black Screen Text: You explain everything...
Shyam: What!? Edgar was attacked?
Shyam: He's the most famous perfumer in the region, someone who's helped countless people around Port Ormos... How could this happen...
Tighnari: Sheriff, have you received any reports of a suspicious individual fleeing through the bazaar?
Shyam: No... But we've got eyes all over the area. I'm sure someone's seen Kirya.
Shyam: I'll start gathering my forces. We won't let him get away!
Paimon: What about you, Tighnari? Do you have a plan?
Tighnari: Hmm... I'm sure the sheriff can handle things over at the scene, and I doubt Emilie needs my help looking after Mr. Edgar.
Paimon: Uh... But, she said she's not a real doctor...
Tighnari: Then, she was far too modest. She may not be a doctor by trade, but she has a deeper understanding of human anatomy and pharmacology than most scholars from the Amurta Darshan.
Tighnari: Not to mention the fact that Mr. Edgar's condition is related to perfume... Emilie is certainly in the best position to help him.
Tighnari: As for me... I'll head to the Akademiya and see what I can learn about Vijava and Kirya.
Paimon: Oh, that's right! Vijava was supposed to be a scholar from Sumeru... Do you recognize the name?
Tighnari: From Emilie's letter, certainly, but that was the first time I'd heard of it. The Akademiya produces a lot of scholars, and there are plenty of graduates who choose to pursue a career outside their Darshan.
Tighnari: I didn't have time to look into it earlier... But, now, it seems like Vijava's past could be critical to getting to the bottom of what happened to Mr. Edgar.
Tighnari: I have friends in Sumeru City that can help me investigate. With any luck, we'll have news to share by tomorrow.
Tighnari: ...I'll leave you and Emilie to watch over things here in Port Ormos.
