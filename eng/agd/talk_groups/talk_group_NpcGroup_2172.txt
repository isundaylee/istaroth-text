Yanbo's Note: Dear Anton Melnikov,
Yanbo's Note: "I'm sorry that due to the sudden turn of events, the supply station has been shut down. Our previous plan to drink Fire-Water together upon your return seems impossible now."
Yanbo's Note: "I left some food in secret. It should be enough in the short run. Take as much as you need."
Yanbo's Note: "Sorry, as your friend, I can't do much other than this. The next time we meet, we shall become enemies."
Yanbo's Note: "Although I am aware that you and your mission have nothing to do with what happened on the ground, please understand that we can never forgive such blatant act of invasion."
Yanbo's Note: "Just as you fight for the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, as one of the Millelith, I must protect our homeland. We each have our responsibility to shoulder for what we cherish."
Yanbo's Note: "Best of luck to you. Yours sincerely, Yanbo."
