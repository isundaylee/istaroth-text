# Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies


## Talk 1

Paimon: #We might as well prepare for a fight, Traveler.
Paimon: When we're done, we can take a walk around. After all, we missed out on a lot of stuff when we were locked up.

## Talk 2

Paimon: It seems to have stopped. Let's continue.

## Talk 3

Paimon: The pattern on the ground seems to be all messed up... Let's go around and see if there's a way to fix it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Are we... in the air? And why is there a huge boat!?
Nahida: That's the Boat of Consciousness, which symbolizes reason here. Its course is the direction our consciousness is traveling towards.
Nahida: If we lose control over our consciousness, we will fall into madness... So let's make sure the boat stays on course.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh, this sure seems very different from what Paimon imagined... Shouldn't Irminsul be in this realm of consciousness?
Nahida: Yes, that is our destination, but I didn't expect the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to be as polluted as this.
Traveler: Polluted?
Traveler: Surely not...
Nahida: Forbidden knowledge? Hmm, it seems you know about a concept that even I don't completely understand. Could you tell me what you know?
Black Screen Text: You tell Nahida all about what you had learned in the desert.
Nahida: Your inference seems logical enough...
Nahida: Forbidden knowledge once polluted the desert thousands of years ago, but was successfully repelled thanks to King Deshret's self-sacrifice and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata nearly exhausting her power.
Nahida: Then a second instance of forbidden knowledge pollution occurred during the Khaenri'ah cataclysm five hundred years ago.
Nahida: But I'm afraid it is much more serious this time, with Irminsul itself already in danger.
Paimon: So if we're in the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's also been affected by forbidden knowledge pollution, then does that mean, in order to save us, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Nahida: Yes, it's very possible that she sacrificed her life in the fight against forbidden knowledge.
Nahida: She didn't completely eradicate forbidden knowledge, but if it weren't for her actions, the pollution would have been far more rampant over these past five hundred years.
Nahida: The way that everyone, including me, has forgotten everything about forbidden knowledge may very well be due to her restoration of Irminsul.
Nahida: ...
Paimon: Aw, do you feel sad, Nahida?
Nahida: I'm just sharing her pain... The pollution of her consciousness here is severe. There is madness, chaos, and pain all around us.
Nahida: Did she fight to resist the forbidden knowledge pollution in such terrible conditions, all the way up till her last breath...?
Nahida: She even used her last remnant of lucid consciousness to leave a clue for us to follow...
Traveler: By "clue," you mean...
Nahida: Yes, her words were distorted by forbidden knowledge, so that's all we could hear.
Nahida: But now we have a chance to find the answer to this mystery.
Nahida: We can cross the polluted consciousness until we've found the right path to meet with her lucid consciousness.
Nahida: And then... we'll let Greater Lord Rukkhadevata tell us the truth in person.
Traveler: I hope we can use that truth to save everybody.
Nahida: Each of us need to be mindful of the state of our own consciousness while we are here.
Nahida: Even with the Gnosis' protection, we must always keep a clear mind. Otherwise, we could go mad at any moment.
Paimon: Eek! That's so scary!
Nahida: Don't worry, it should be easy enough for you to keep that mind of yours clear, Paimon. Let's go.
Traveler: The words, "...World... Forget me..."?
Traveler: It must be due to forbidden knowledge.

## Talk 6

Paimon: We changed direction. Are we still going the right way, Nahida?
Nahida: Mm-hmm. Judging from the current route, the Boat of Consciousness will soon take us out of here.
Nahida: We'll be arriving at our destination soon. How are you feeling? Are your minds still intact?
Traveler: Some strange thoughts came from time to time...
Paimon: Huh, but everything's been completely normal for Paimon.
Nahida: Hopefully, there won't be any more interruptions. This time, we should be able to meet Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Paimon: Are you saying you've never met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata before?
Nahida: No, it seems that my birth and her death took place at the same time.
Nahida: Otherwise, I think she would have given me a little more guidance, and I could have done a better job.
Paimon: Hey, you've done a great job, Nahida! Let's get out of this creepy place and go meet her!
Traveler: But I seem to be okay now.

## Talk 7

Nahida: Well, this is the place.
Traveler: Yes...
Paimon: Uh... we're here to find Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, right?
Paimon: But the one standing over there is...
Nahida: Is that... me...? She looks exactly... like me...
Nahida: Are you... Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Yes, that's me. Are you surprised by my appearance?
Traveler: I can't believe my eyes...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Irminsul and the surrounding lands have been reproduced here as they were years ago, but this is just a realm of consciousness.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: We are manifestations of the same nature, hence why we would appear exactly the same.
Nahida: Hmm? We're... of the same nature? Why?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Because you are me, and I am you.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: You are me in the new samsara.
Nahida: The new samsara...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: As Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, I'm the avatar of Irminsul, and you are the purest branch snapped from Irminsul.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Imagine it this way... Even if a tree dies, its branches will eventually take root and grow, continuing the tree's life in another form.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: I'm merely the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. The real me has presumably died a long time ago.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Hmm... Judging from your appearance, I've probably been dead for five hundred years...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: But you're finally here, my new "self" in this samsara.
Traveler: So this is the connection between you two...
Nahida: If this is true, then am I... going to be a great archon like you someday?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Though we share the same nature, our fates are bound to be different. All things have their own fate.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: When a branch grows into a mature tree, it won't be the same as the original tree.
Nahida: That's why fate is the ultimate knowledge, isn't it?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: That's a great insight. Yes, very good.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: It's also precisely why you won't become like me...
Nahida: Really...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: But perhaps, you may become an even greater archon than I.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: I already see a determination in you that I didn't possess in my time, and the future that it leads you to will be yours alone.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Along with the blessings from your past experiences.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Don't worry. The growth of wisdom is like that of a plant â€” you only need to wait quietly for the flower to bloom.
Traveler: I have faith in Nahida, too...
Paimon: Come to think of it, the sages never had the faintest inkling of the meaning of wisdom...
Nahida: Thank you... Nothing makes me happier than discovering that the archon I always admired was in fact myself in another fate.
Nahida: It's so nice to speak with you, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. I've always wanted to meet you...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: The feeling is mutual. From the moment I snapped the branch off Irminsul and created you, I've also looked forward to talking with you.
Nahida: Could you tell me... why you wanted to create me? And what exactly happened when you died...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Ah, I see. You're here seeking answers, right?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Everything that day, even the sky itself, changed into a color like this...
Traveler: I knew it... the Khaenri'ah cataclysm.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: At that time, The Seven were all summoned to the nation of Khaenri'ah, except for me. I had a more important task to attend to...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: I had to protect Irminsul.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: The disaster occurred together with the pollution of forbidden knowledge. At that very moment, with my consciousness connected to Irminsul, I sensed something was wrong.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: The pain started to torment my mind. By the time I reached Irminsul, it was already displaying signs of corruption.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Had I not repelled the pollution of forbidden knowledge with King Deshret thousands of years ago, I might have felt even more hopeless and lost.
Nahida: So what exactly is... forbidden knowledge?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: It's a kind of knowledge that doesn't belong to this world, and a form of "truth" that can't be understood.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: It came from the very bottom of the Abyss. Even I could never understand it.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: The world is constantly rejecting it, leading to all kinds of bad phenomena.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: If we allow forbidden knowledge to pollute Irminsul, I'm afraid the entirety of Teyvat could fall apart.
Paimon: So there's knowledge that even the God of Wisdom can't understand...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: At that time, I knew I couldn't repel the forbidden knowledge with my strength alone.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Which is why I created a device that compiled human wisdom, and named it "the Akasha."
Nahida: It's truly the world's most amazing invention.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Hehe... Thank you. For a long time, I thought dreams were the fruit of human wisdom.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Though it was selfish to do so, I borrowed people's dreams using the Akasha. Then I compiled their wisdom and all of my own power...
Paimon: Well, did it work?
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Thanks to the wisdom of the people of Sumeru, almost all the forbidden knowledge was cleared from Irminsul.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: But... things didn't go as smoothly as I thought. I had a terrible headache, which gave me an uneasy feeling...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: And then, I remembered that my consciousness was also connected with Irminsul. It brought me knowledge and wisdom, but vile corruption as well.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: From the very beginning, my existence had been polluted by the forbidden knowledge.
Paimon: Oh no... How could that happen...
Nahida: I've experienced that pain in your consciousness. It must've been a horrible experience.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Yes, but my feelings weren't important. The important thing was that...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Even if I died, my existence and everything related to me would continue to exist in Irminsul as memories and knowledge, meaning that the forbidden knowledge couldn't ever be permanently eradicated.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: And... there's no way for me to eliminate myself. It would be a sort of paradox.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: So, I took the purest branch of Irminsul as my incarnation in the next samsara, and left a trail of clues...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: All in hopes that you would come here and remove me and my pollution from Irminsul forever.
Nahida: ...Wâ€”Wait. No... I can't!
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Hehe, so you realized what that implies? You are very smart, indeed.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Irminsul has all the knowledge and memories of this world. And as you've realized just now...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Removing me from Irminsul means... I essentially will never have existed in this world.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: But... this is the only way to save Irminsul.
Nahida: People love you so much and... and they've missed you so much over the past five hundred years. I... I am exactly the same. So how...
Nahida: How can we just... forget you like this?
Nahida: Is there really no other way? There must be something else I can do!
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: You're the God of Wisdom, Buer. You should know that there is no other way.
Nahida: But this... this is so... cruel. I don't want to forget you!
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: No need to feel so sad, Buer. As someone who delights in wisdom, you should feel joy at finally finding the answer.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: These are the words in their entirety... the answer you've been seeking all along.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: "Let the world completely forget me."
Traveler: She will definitely become a great archon.
Traveler: Lesser Lord Kusanali and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
Traveler: The two of you look almost exactly the same...
Traveler: It's the same place from my memories.

## Talk 8

Nahida: ...
Traveler: Nahida?
Nahida: #Ah, Traveler, Iâ€”I'm all right. I'm just a little confused...
Traveler: What are you confused about?
Nahida: We've just saved the world, right?
Nahida: So why... why am I crying?
Traveler: ...
Nahida: I don't know where this feeling inside of me is coming from, but I feel very sad...
Traveler: Do you still remember... what happened just now?
Nahida: Just now? We used the power of two Gnoses to successfully connect with the Irminsul consciousness from five hundred years ago...
Nahida: Then, we removed the remaining pollution from Irminsul...
Traveler: (She's forgotten her...)
Paimon: #Yeah, what's wrong? Traveler, weren't you there just now?
Traveler: (Paimon doesn't seem to remember either. Has everybody really forgotten Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?)
Traveler: (Should I... tell them the truth?)
The Doctor (???): *Buzzing*
Traveler: (What's that sound...? I feel... super... sleepy...)
Nahida: #Huh, that sound... Traveler? Paimon?
The Doctor: I've been waiting here far too long... But finally, I have the chance to be alone with you. All the precious time I wasted has finally paid off.
Nahida: The Doctor... What have you done!?
The Doctor: Just a type of sound wave that can quickly put defenseless people into a dream. As I expected... it doesn't have any effect on gods.
The Doctor: This is the only thing of interest I found among the sages' research. I thought I'd take it for a little spin.
The Doctor: Don't worry. I know you would never forgive me if I actually killed them.
The Doctor: I'm here to negotiate with you. Naturally, I won't do anything dangerous that could potentially damage our relationship.
Nahida: Negotiate with me? I heard you had already left Sumeru. Why are you here again now?
The Doctor: "I" left Sumeru, but "I" also stayed in Sumeru.
The Doctor: Even the God of Wisdom is restricted by the habits of cognition. How disappointing.
Nahida: You mean... there are many different versions of you in this world?
The Doctor: An astute guess.
The Doctor: Even the same individual will have different cognitions at different ages.
The Doctor: A long time ago, I made a major decision in hopes of preserving all my perspectives of how I observed the world.
The Doctor: Observation is the first step of any experiment, but observing the current world doesn't satisfy me. It lacks an important dimension â€” that of time.
The Doctor: So I saved "segments" of all my ages, and made them into independent individuals...
The Doctor: That's all there is to it. Indulge me, how does the God of Wisdom find my method of seeking knowledge?
Nahida: It's an insult to the very concept of life.
Nahida: Life inherently has many rules and restrictions, each with its own significance and reason to exist. They can't be broken on a whim.
The Doctor: Hehehehe... Good. Amazing, even.
The Doctor: Indeed. It's difficult for humans... to make peace with themselves, not to mention oneself from a different period.
Nahida: Since you were in the Akademiya, why wait until now to show up? You could very well have stopped us and helped that "fake god."
The Doctor: Simple, let me ask you this: Would any staff member ever help the subject in the middle of an experiment?
The Doctor: It was my experiment, so why should I interfere with the results?
Nahida: ...The Akademiya saw the plan to create a god as their ultimate goal, yet you only saw it as an ordinary experiment...
Nahida: Yâ€”You really are crazy... If the experiment succeeded, you would have had a new god on your hands. How would you have faced your own god then?
Nahida: Would you still take the same stance? Would you still hold the same view of yourself?
The Doctor: I'm first and foremost a scholar. These results should be left to the judgment of the hypothetical "me" confronted with that outcome. But you're right, and that's exactly why I'm disappointed with the conclusion of this experiment.
Nahida: As an individual, you don't have any sense of belonging... And you seem to have even fewer convictions than a typical scholar.
The Doctor: Oh, no. I certainly have my own convictions. They just don't fit your standards, that's all.
The Doctor: All right, that's enough conversation for today. The experiment is over and it's time to tidy up the equipment and reclaim any useful materials.
The Doctor: For example... the Gnosis.
Nahida: ...
The Doctor: Lesser Lord Kusanali, you're an intelligent archon. I'm sure you understand the disparity in our combat abilities at this time... Besides, you have no way to use that Electro Gnosis in battle.
Nahida: Didn't you say you were here to negotiate with me? Somehow it's starting to seem like you intend to take it by force now.
The Doctor: Hahaha... I'm merely stating a fact.
The Doctor: After all, I'm also a scholar. Naturally, I hope to show proper respect and dignity to the God of Wisdom.
Nahida: Your hypocrisy is built on absolute confidence.
Nahida: I understand your scheme, but...
Nahida: ...What if I were to destroy the Gnosis now, and awaken the Heavenly Principles?
The Doctor: Awaken... the heavenly principles?
The Doctor: ...
The Doctor: Do you think that's really possible?
Nahida: The Heavenly Principles have been silent for many years, but the Gnoses are symbols of their control over Teyvat and all the laws...
Nahida: Will the destruction of a Gnosis attract the attention of the Heavenly Principles? And if so... how do the Fatui plan to deal with the consequences?
Nahida: Do you dare... to gamble such a possibility with me?
The Doctor: Hmph, "gamble"? How surprising.
The Doctor: I thought you would show evidence or use rigorous reasoning to prove your point... The word "gamble" is the last thing I expected to hear from the God of Wisdom.
The Doctor: But this is a clever move. You must have seen through me when I first captured your consciousness.
The Doctor: As a scholar, I respect all possibilities. This has always been my principle and is an essential trait as an experimenter.
The Doctor: Indeed, I can't ignore this possibility. So tell me then, what are your conditions?
Nahida: This foreign Gnosis will only lead to disaster if it stays in Sumeru...
Nahida: But this Electro Gnosis is the prize I obtained after defeating one of your fellow Harbingers.
Nahida: Now, as the one who initiated this cascade of events, shouldn't you pay the corresponding price?
The Doctor: Price? Interesting. What price would you have me pay?
Nahida: ...How about erasing all your other segments?
The Doctor: Hahaha... So this is how you wish to restrict me, the most threatening opponent of the Nation of Wisdom. What you request of me is like plucking out the eyes I have placed in the dimension of time.
The Doctor: Segments are extraordinarily difficult to make. They require extremely rare resources and enormous amounts of time and effort. Requiring me to destroy them all here and now... Bravo, a suitably wise decision on your part.
The Doctor: Yes, how very interesting... Can I assume that you have long been wary of me?
The Doctor: Among all the versions of me, this segment you see now is the most selfish. If it weren't me, your idea wouldn't have worked.
The Doctor: What did you see when you were imprisoned? You were observing me, and that's how you know I've long grown tired of their doubts and endless arguments.
Nahida: Like you said, it's difficult to make peace with yourself.
Nahida: Being as smart as you are, have you managed to do that?
The Doctor: ...
The Doctor: I see. If you think all those versions of me are worth a Gnosis... Then, deal.
Nahida: You sure didn't hesitate much. Is the relationship between all the versions of you really that bad?
The Doctor: I don't think there's any need to dwell on that. The surplus versions of me can be exchanged for a Gnosis. Do you think anyone can offer themselves at a higher price?
The Doctor: Besides, with my abilities, it's only a matter of time until I find better "perspectives." Perhaps it's best to say... you're just temporarily ahead.
The Doctor: But what I'd like to know is, how can you be sure that I've really erased them?
Nahida: I can see your remaining honesty...
Nahida: ...
The Doctor: ...Hmph.
The Doctor: Well? Have you confirmed that it's complete?
Nahida: ...Here, take it.
Nahida: The future of Sumeru City will be in my hands alone. I will shut down the Akasha and let curiosity and the thirst for knowledge drive the realm of academics once again...
Nahida: There won't be any further gaps for you to exploit.
The Doctor: It truly pains me that my academic achievements have never been appreciated in my homeland. Of course, I have no interest in being rejected by this city for a third time.
The Doctor: Another chess piece... And where is your Dendro Gnosis?
Nahida: ...Don't be greedy, Harbinger of Snezhnaya.
The Doctor: No, this is a different transaction. If you intend to turn off the Akasha anyway, then there's no further use for the Gnosis of Sumeru, is there?
The Doctor: Besides, isn't it the archon's duty to deliver what's desired of the seeker?
The Doctor: Oh? Judging from your expression, you don't seem to find the idea very agreeable. Then let's think of it this way... Since you're the God of Wisdom, how about I exchange some knowledge with you?
Nahida: People exchanging knowledge with the God of Wisdom is the stuff of legends, yet here you wish to exchange knowledge for the God of Wisdom's property...
Nahida: Arrogant as that is, it has piqued my interest.
The Doctor: Let me ask you... Have you in all your mighty knowledge ever heard the rumor that "the skies of Teyvat are fake"?
Nahida: ...Huh?
The Doctor: That's the secret hidden by Irminsul concerning the "truth" of this world...
Nahida: ...
The Doctor: Once I finish telling you about this, it will be time for me to say goodbye.
The Doctor: With negotiations, we've all gotten what we wanted. I'm very glad I got to meet you like this.
Nahida: Your arrogance may know no bounds, and convictions may mean nothing to you, but I'll still listen to what you have to say.
Black Screen Text: Secrets and dark truths flow to the mind of the wise. Then... everything falls silent.
Traveler: (Did I manage to remember because I'm not from this world?)
Traveler: Don't tell me...
Traveler: ...Are you alright?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Today's the big day! Let's go to the Grand Bazaar and see how the celebration's coming along.

### Additional Talk 2

Viraf: The blond-haired Traveler? How did you come out from the Sanctuary of Surasthana? It's normally forbidden to enter that place.
Paimon: Um, sorry, we don't know the rules here...
Viraf: It's fine, just pay more attention next time. Anyway, I'm looking for Grand Sage Azar. Have you seen him?
Viraf: The more I think about it, the more I believe there's something fishy about Alhaitham's return. I need to let the Grand Sage know somehow...
Paimon: You're finally starting to put two and two together...

### Additional Talk 3

Vihar: Hey, it's you guys! How did your plan go? Are you here for Nilou?
Paimon: It went really well! And yeah, where's Nilou?
Vihar: Great to hear! Nilou's already returned to the Grand Bazaar. Just now, a crowd of Akademiya students came by to ask Nilou for her signature. I've never seen her run away so fast!
Vihar: To think the Akademiya wants to ban artistic performances... Hehe, I think their students would be the first to disagree.

### Additional Talk 4

Rahman: Eh? How did you find the time to walk around? Did you manage to rescue Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Paimon: We did! She's handling some Akasha stuff right now.
Rahman: That's great, haha. Just now, Dehya went to find Asfand, the senior consultant of the Corps of Thirty, and explained everything to him.
Rahman: In response, Asfand said, "Why didn't you tell me earlier. If it was to rescue the Dendro Archon, we would've helped as well," hahaha...
Rahman: I didn't know we could have even counted the city guards of the Corps of Thirty among our potential reinforcements. It looks like we were a bit too conservative with our plan.

### Additional Talk 5

Observe the unconscious guards...: (Someone has knocked these two guards out and removed their Akasha Terminals not long ago. No one seems to have noticed them yet.)
Observe the unconscious guards...: (If they were escorting someone before being knocked out, that person must've escaped.)
