Traveler: About fun activities...
Estienne: Since the result is all the same, choosing one or more people from a group, then isn't it more fun to make a game out of it?
Estienne: Some people think games are childish and I respect their opinion. After all, everyone playing games should participate voluntarily!
Estienne: Unwilling participants will end up spoiling the game and ruining everything. That would leave everyone disappointed, and that's the opposite of why we have the games in the first place...
Estienne: But I don't think Rave and Caterpillar were breaking the rules. They were playing strategically, but that's within the rules.
Estienne: The only thing I regret is that there were too few players. I just don't have the organizational skills... I'd love to host an even more exciting matchup!
