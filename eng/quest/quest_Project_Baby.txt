# Project Baby


## Talk 1

Gulabgir: Gone again... Um... Traveler! Could you please do me a favor?
Gulabgir: My food is missing!
Gulabgir: Uh, no, that can't be it! My pet snakes' food â€” that's what's missing!

## Talk 2

Gulabgir: How did it go? Did you find the food?

## Talk 3

Gulabgir: You are back! I gotta say, that was quick. Did you find the food?
Traveler: Is this what you're looking for?

## Talk 4

Gulabgir: Yes, these would do! Thank you so much.
Paimon: Why weren't these in the camp, but on the nearby tree?
Gulabgir: Well... Maybe the birds had them stashed away for a rainy day...
Gulabgir: Is this stuff so popular with animals? Maybe I should start a business...
Gulabgir: Ahem! Don't mind me. Thank you very much. Here's your payment.

## Talk 5

Gulabgir: Yes! That's it! So I did leave it in the camp after all.
Paimon: It was buried under the rocks. Your camp seems to have gotten caught in a landslide that carried your stuff far away. We spent a long while looking, actually.
Gulabgir: Seriously? How could there be a landslide? That spot has never been in any trouble...
Gulabgir: Oh! When I was camping there, I could hear strange sounds at night, and I could feel something scratching at my tent...
Gulabgir: My snakes were alert and would wake me every time. But I never found anything no matter how many times I checked...
Gulabgir: Eh, you know what, forget about it... Thanks for your help. Here's your payment.

## Talk 6

Gulabgir: Yes! That's it! So I did leave it in the camp after all.
Traveler: About the camp...
Gulabgir: I see... Was it the work of wild animals...?
Gulabgir: Now that you mention it, the food I made attracted Fungi and birds... So, attracting wild animals sounds about right...
Gulabgir: Guess I should really consider starting a feed-selling business...
Gulabgir: If that turns out well, I could be making much more money than I do now by putting up performances...
Gulabgir: Oh, sorry, I'm getting off-topic... Thanks for your help, and please, take your payment.

## Talk 7

Gulabgir: Yes! That's it! So I did leave it in the camp after all.
Paimon: Why is your camp in the middle of a bunch of thorny vines!? Wouldn't you get hurt sleeping there?
Gulabgir: Nah, I'm pretty skilled when it comes to living in the wild.
Gulabgir: And there weren't that many vines around when I established that camp.
Traveler: Have you been away from the forest for a very long time?
Gulabgir: Sort of. I can't remember the details.
Gulabgir: Hahaha, I'm really rusty when it comes to setting up camps now.
Gulabgir: Most of the camps I've set up in the past have been abandoned.
Gulabgir: What kind of life would I be leading had I remained in the rainforest...?
Gulabgir: ...Sorry, I've said too much. Here is your payment. Please take it.

## Talk 8

Gulabgir: You are back! I gotta say, that was quick. Did you find the food?
Traveler: Is this what you're looking for?

## Talk 9

Paimon: There's special food for pet snakes? Don't they eat mice and stuff?
Gulabgir: Yes, they did hunt by themselves in the past.
Gulabgir: But ever since they startled several children whilst feeding, I have banned them from going out without me. I've started mixing food for them.
Gulabgir: *sigh* But after that, they haven't been moving much, and have stubbornly refused to eat any other food.
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought "there was no such thing as a free lunch"...
Traveler: Delicious!
Paimon: Paimon hasn't even asked about the flavor yet, so you can dream on!
Paimon: Enjoying food is Paimon's job!
Traveler: Uh huh. Very reasonable of you.
Gulabgir: I must have left their food at one of my camps when I was out picking herbs.
Gulabgir: But I can't really leave, what with all my little fellas to care for and stuff. I don't want them scaring anyone again when they search for food...
Gulabgir: Traveler, would you mind visiting that campsite and fetching the food for me?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Gulabgir: Thank you so much. Who knows what accidents we might run into if I were to go there with these little fellas.
Gulabgir: If they got it into their heads to go playing around in the forest for a few days, I'd be doomed...
Gulabgir: Anyway, I'll be leaving this to you, Traveler.
Gulabgir: I'll mark all the camps I've stayed at on the map for you, so please take a look at those spots.
Traveler: There aren't any other snakes at the campsites, right...?
Gulabgir: No, not at all. I set all my camps up away from snake lairs precisely so that we could stay out of trouble...
Traveler: How many camps have you got, again?
Gulabgir: Well, I set up a few while I was living in the rainforest.
Gulabgir: I've already stopped living in the rainforest, but I still do rest at my campsites if I collect herbs there.
Traveler: Absolutely delicious!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Paimon's sure we've met someone with a snake for a pet before... Right! It's that weirdo named Baizhu...
Traveler: I don't think Changsheng counts as a "pet"...
Paimon: There's special food for pet snakes? Don't they eat mice and stuff?
Gulabgir: Yes, they did hunt by themselves in the past.
Gulabgir: But ever since they startled several children whilst feeding, I have banned them from going out without me. I've started making food for them.
Gulabgir: *sigh* But after that, they haven't been moving much, and have stubbornly refused to eat any other food.
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought "there was no such thing as a free lunch"...
Traveler: Delicious!
Paimon: Paimon hasn't even asked about the flavor yet, so you can dream on!
Paimon: Enjoying food is Paimon's job!
Traveler: Uh huh. Very reasonable of you.
Gulabgir: I must have left their food at one of my camps when I was out picking herbs.
Gulabgir: But I can't really leave, what with all my little fellas to care for and stuff. I don't want them scaring anyone again when they search for food...
Gulabgir: Traveler, would you mind visiting that campsite and fetching the food for me?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Gulabgir: Thank you so much. Who knows what accidents we might run into if I were to go there with these little fellas.
Gulabgir: If they got it into their heads to go playing around in the forest for a few days, I'd be doomed...
Gulabgir: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Gulabgir: I'll mark all the camps I've stayed at on the map for you, so please take a look at those spots.
Traveler: There aren't any other snakes at the campsites, right...?
Gulabgir: No, not at all. I set all my camps up away from snake lairs precisely so that we could stay away from trouble...
Traveler: How many camps have you got, again?
Gulabgir: Well, I set up a few while I was living in the rainforest.
Gulabgir: I've already stopped living in the rainforest, but I still do rest at my campsites if I collect herbs there.
Traveler: Absolutely delicious!
Traveler: Changsheng would get mad at you for saying that.

## Talk 11

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
Traveler: I found something else in the camp.

## Talk 12

Gulabgir: Huh? This bead... How... Where did you find this?
Paimon: Inside a pot in the camp. Did you leave that behind?
Gulabgir: Ah, it was used in past shows. Whenever I play the flute, my little fellas would carry that bead on their heads and dance with their upper bodies in the air.
Gulabgir: But tricks of this kind have long ceased being profitable, and I haven't performed for quite some time either. I didn't even notice that it had gone missing...
Gulabgir: Anyway, thanks for bringing it back. Here's your payment, please take it.

## Talk 13

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
Traveler: I found something else in the camp.

## Talk 14

Gulabgir: Huh? These hats... Hahaha, I made them for the snakes. How did I even forget these?
Gulabgir: I made each of them a nightcap so that they could attract children to the show.
Gulabgir: Red for Jori, green for Amum, yellow for Gana, and blue for Drak...
Paimon: Sounds cute! The show must've been a hit!
Gulabgir: It went well at first, but the children would burst into tears whenever the snakes opened their jaws...
Gulabgir: Oh, forget about it... Please take this as your payment. It's something, at least.

## Talk 15

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
Traveler: I found something else in the camp.

## Talk 16

Gulabgir: Ah! Isn't this the snake climbing tower I made? Wow, this sure brings back some memories! Hahaha!
Paimon: Snake climbing tower? What even is that?
Gulabgir: Just a toy for the snakes to climb on. I can't have them hanging on me all the time, you know?
Gulabgir: Thanks for bringing it back. Please take this as your payment.
Gulabgir: So I designed it like that? Hah, this sure does bring back some memories...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Gulabgir: Yes! That's it! So I did leave it in the camp after all.
Paimon: When we arrived, there were Fungi that were trying to swipe it.
Gulabgir: Fungi, huh... Phew, guess I was lucky to have you go instead. Thank you so much, Traveler.
Gulabgir: I can't thank you enough. Please, accept this as your payment.
Gulabgir: Here's your meal, little fellas...
