Traveler: Tell me about those names...
Iknal: You've heard of "Ancient Names," right?
Iknal: Powerful warriors chosen by the Wayob will be granted an Ancient Name, engraved upon obsidian stone.
Iknal: This means that the warrior has been acknowledged to have the ability to inherit the legacy of all the heroes who have carried this name before, and will follow the paths of their predecessors to fight for Natlan.
Iknal: The Wayob has never been wrong. Ancient Names are precious, and each will be bestowed upon a warrior who is worthy of the title.
Iknal: Speaking of, do you have a tool or weapon that always comes in handy? Why don't you also give it a name? Surely, it's earned one for itself.
