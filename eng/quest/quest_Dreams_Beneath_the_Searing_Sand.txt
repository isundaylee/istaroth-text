# Dreams Beneath the Searing Sand


## Talk 1

Afratu: Who are you? Hah! The researcher and the traitor? Good! Give us the stuff Samail mentioned!
Paimon: Whoa! Well, looks like negotiations have broken down!

## Talk 2

Jeht: Benben, stop running off with bad people. Once Tirzad has uncovered all the secrets here, he can head back and write his masterpiece... And you can come home with me and father.
Jeht: #Just like how Paimon stays with Traveler, I'm sure you and I will be best companions. Hehe.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Yeah! We should be able to go to the upper level to see King Deshret's throne now.
Paimon: #Hurry up, Traveler! Paimon can't wait to sit on King Deshret's big chair!

## Talk 4

Tirzad: Did something that shouldn't be activated get activated?!
Jebrael: #Traveler! Watch out!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Strange... Why did they stop?
Tirzad: King Deshret is as unreasonable as I thought. We've overcome so many trials on our way here! We're "worthy"...
Jebrael: Let's go. Al-Ahmar's throne is higher up — it is close.

## Talk 6

Tirzad: Phew... We're finally here.
Tirzad: But... Is the alcohol still clouding my mind, or has the sand distorted my vision? Is this really the place we're looking for? I can see Khaj-Nisut... but it feels like I also don't.
Jeht: Actually, I've been meaning to ask... You clearly can't hold your alcohol, so why are you so fond of drinking?
Benben: Beep... Bee-eep?
Tirzad: ...I'd hoped it would prove my fountain of wisdom, but it makes my world spin instead. Ugh... You're right, I really should slow down a little.
Tirzad: But I'll be fine. Nachtigal gave me some invigorating drinks before we left, so I'm as clear-headed as can be.
Traveler: It feels like we're missing a little something here.
Tirzad: "Just a little" might be an understatement. Khaj-Nisut is where it should be, but it seems to be refusing to show itself to us...
Paimon: And what's that supposed to mean?
Jebrael: Shh, look over there.
Paimon: It's the Eremites! They got here before us...
Tirzad: Huh? What should we do? Avoid them?
Jebrael: No, let's go have a little "chat" with them.
Tirzad: But we didn't get along the last time, and we even fought each other. Can we even talk to them now?
Jeht: Haha! Tirzad, do you think we're going over there to invite them for tea?
Jeht: We're going to communicate in our own way, of course! And if all else fails, we'll "talk" with our fists. It is what my father and I are best at.

## Talk 7

Eremite Mercenary: Who are you? Hah! The researcher and the traitor? Good! Give us the stuff Samail mentioned!
Paimon: Give you what? We don't owe you anything!
Eremite Mercenary: Hmph! Acting dumb won't save you! Take this!
Paimon: Whoa! Well, looks like negotiations have broken down!

## Talk 8

Omid: Okay, I've made up my mind! I'm going to Port Ormos. I haven't yet decided on what business to go into, but I'll figure that out after seeing what other people are doing there.
Omid: I'll inform the boss once I'm back in Aaru Village. Although he always complains that he's short on crew, I guess he'll be alright with Mirsad to help him.

## Talk 9

Jeht: How strange... It feels like they didn't go all out. What did they mean when they mentioned Samail's orders?
Paimon: Is it about Benben? Benben did get taken away before.
Benben: Bee-eep!? Beep...
Jeht: Hmm, it is possible. Besides Tirzad, we must protect Benben well too.
Jebrael: They probably stayed for a while. Let's look around, there might still be some clues.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Jebrael! We found this, though we're not sure if it's a useful clue...
Jebrael: When I was still with the Thutmose, we used to leave messages for each other in code just like this.
Paimon: Oh! So you can read it, Jebrael?
Traveler: Samail should be aware that he can.
Paimon: Huh? Th—Then is all of this a trap that Samail set for us?
Tirzad: I knew your past would come back to bite us...
Tirzad: *sigh* Come on, Benben, why don't we just return to Sumeru City now? It is quite regrettable that my paper won't have its final two chapters, but I can always return again if I'm still alive.
Benben: Beep?
Tirzad: Next time, I should get help that has a clean background...
Jebrael: We can use this against them.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Jebrael: We're the latecomers here. They've been here for quite some time, and they've made some discoveries, of course.
Jebrael: They just lack something crucial, so they can't advance.
Jebrael: And we just happen to have what they need.
Traveler: Benben.
Jebrael: Yes, and the stone slate.
Jebrael: Instead of taking them from us, they have a better way to get what they want.
Traveler: Oh, so they'd like to sit back and claim the fruits of our work?
Jebrael: Yes, they'd prefer it if we solved everything for them.
Tirzad: Oh! I get it! They're the people in joint research projects that contribute nothing but take all the credit when it's time to present your findings!
Jebrael: But they won't be able to get what they want if we get stuck here too.
Jebrael: So, we can use this against them.
Jebrael: #...We can't avoid a fight once everything has been uncovered. But Jeht, Traveler, neither of you will run from a fight, right?
Jeht: Of course. I've decided to punch that guy in the face when we meet again.
Traveler: The Eremites are nothing.
Paimon: Yeah, we've fought worse.
Tirzad: Sorry to interrupt... But there must be a safer method, right?
Tirzad: Just think about it, the ruins have been here for years, so just a few months... or even a few years won't change anything! We can come back later!
Tirzad: *sigh* Using their plan against them is a bad idea. All four of you do seem so full of confidence, but that's because you're skilled fighters.
Tirzad: But there are just too many of them. Paimon can fly away and hide if things go south, but what about me?
Tirzad: For safety's sake, we should return to Sumeru City and draw up a plan... No, even Aaru Village would be fine!
Jebrael: Those Thutmose folks may believe in King Deshret, but that doesn't mean they won't touch the ruins. If he can't do it through ordinary means, Samail will use other means...
Jebrael: If they solve King Deshret's puzzle before us, these ruins probably won't be the same when you return, Tirzad.
Tirzad: What!? But they're all relics!
Jebrael: They may be precious relics to you researchers from the Akademiya, but they clearly aren't to the Thutmose. It's all just a process, a phase...
Jebrael: They only care about the final objective... Results are what matters to them.
Jebrael: Tirzad, do you still not get it? We have no other choice now.
Tirzad: *sob* It saddens me to think that I won't get to celebrate my success because I'll have to face the fangs of that venomous snake who will leap out of the shadows...
Jebrael: He may be in the shadows, but we're prepared for him. I won't let him touch you.
Jebrael: According to this coded letter, Al-Ahmar's throne only shows itself to the worthy who have passed the three trials.
Paimon: The three trials... Maybe that refers to the buildings all around us? Y'know, there are so many huge statues here, Paimon's worried that they'll just come to life...
Traveler: Maybe the trial is to defeat them.
Tirzad: I can only hope that you're wrong...
Traveler: I will never cower.
Paimon: Alrighty then! Forward it is!
Traveler: The stone slate.
Jebrael: That's right.
Traveler: Tirzad's knowledge.
Tirzad: Well, it does make sense that they can't advance without the guidance of a professional like me, yes.
Paimon: ...Oh? Is that really how it is?
Jebrael: We wouldn't have been able to approach the core without Tirzad's stone slate and Benben.

## Talk 11

Jebrael: What is this place?
Samail: Jebrael! Haha, you're here!
Samail: I knew it... I knew it! We are the twin blades of Thutmose, our lives dedicated to uncovering the secrets of the Golden Slumber...
Samail: You took the long way around, but it doesn't matter anymore. We've met again here, at the end of that path.
Samail: You were just lost before, but the sands of the Thutmose always return before Al-Ahmar's throne!
Samail: Like the dehydrated thirst for a spring, only the illusion of the Eternal Oasis can relieve our agony...
Jebrael: I'm inside... the Golden Slumber promised by Al-Ahmar?
Samail: Oh... You are not "us" yet.
Samail: ...It's fine. Soon, there'll be no "you." "You" will become a part of "us." This meaningless talk will be unnecessary then.
Jebrael: No, no! I'm here to stop you! My mission is to protect... I must protect Jeht and the others...
Samail: Why? Why care about such trivial matters? Great power is right before you, it's like a torrent in the desert. Don't you feel it?
Samail: You should obey. Al-Ahmar's will is our will. The Thutmose's dreams are our dreams.
Jebrael: No! Ufairah taught me that I'm not just some part of you, I'm an independent person! I have my own dreams... I won't go back!
Samail: Jebrael, why don't you understand? Love is just a fever. I even eliminated the infection for you. Has the heat made you lose your mind?
Jebrael: You're the one who's lost their mind, Samail, not me. The Golden Slumber that Al-Ahmar promised us isn't like this... It's not a sad place with only "we" and no "I."
Samail: I'm not sad. I know what I want. My dream is to be one with the Thutmose.
Samail: Yet you, the warmth of another... I despise such feelings. It makes you weak.
Samail: Your betrayal was like a blade in my chest. But I obtained Al-Ahmar's wisdom, and that wound I thought would never heal is nothing but a memory now.
Samail: You've realized it too, haven't you? That drowsiness... Al-Ahmar is summoning you into the dream. Stop arguing meaninglessly with me. Come, fall into deep sleep...
Samail: When you awaken again... No, when "we" awaken again, nothing will be left standing in our way. The Thutmose's dreams will be fulfilled.
Jebrael: ...No, you're my enemy! My dream is... is...
Samail: "We" are the dunes, and you are a grain of sand. We are one. You know this.
Jebrael: No, I'm the "Treacherous Grit"! I abandoned the Thutmose and chose a different path...
Samail: You took the long way around, but you reached the correct destination. Admit it. This is the dream hidden within your heart.
Jebrael: ...I wanted to return to this place?
Samail: Yes, you did. There is no hatred here, only eternal peace. No bitter salt water, only an endless spring.
Samail: Sleep, Jebrael, sleep.
Jebrael: ...
Jeht: (...Father! Father!)
Tirzad: (H—His body has disappeared. He's not coming back... Jeht...)
Paimon: (This can't be...)
Jeht: (I refuse to believe it! He always keeps his promises! He promised to tell me about my mother... All of you heard him! He wouldn't lie to me! He never lies to me! *sob*...)
Jebrael: ...I refuse to yield. Jeht is right. I'm a man of my word. I promised to protect them... until the end!
Samail: ...
Samail: ...I see. Your ties to the mundane inhibit you. Just like that infection, I just have to eliminate them...
Tirzad: (...The door is open? It must be Jebrael! It's still shaking, Jeht! It's dangerous here! We can't stay, or else his sacrifice would mean nothing...)
Jeht: (Leave if you want! Father... Father will be back. He'll be so sad if he couldn't find me when he wakes up... I won't leave him!)
Samail: Hmph! How foolish! But these trivial troubles will vanish with the wind soon.
Jebrael: I won't let you win!
Jebrael: Haha! I finally get it... Samail, you're right. There will be no "me," only "us"...
Jebrael: But you're not the only one who can decide "our" will!
Samail: You can't be serious...
Jebrael: Samail, the twin blades of Thutmose are equal. So... die here with me!
Black Screen Text: Jeht, forgive me. You'll have to go on alone from now on... No, I'm sure you won't forgive me. After all, it's my first time breaking a promise to you.
I hear the voices of many here. I think I hear Ufairah too. She's humming the song of her home.
Oh... If only you could hear it too. Why couldn't I have told you a little more about her? Her soft curly hair... and that innocent smile of hers.
I have so many things I want to share with you, but I'm no longer able to distinguish if they are my memories... or "our" memories...
Black Screen Text: Sorry...

## Talk 12

Mirsad: *sigh* Am I too old to start a new career as an adventurer now? That being said, I won't know until I try.
Mirsad: Omid'll definitely take me for a madman if I tell him. That's why I'd better only inform my boss. Please keep the secret for me...

## Talk 13

Paimon: Yeah, we're obviously inside... But where's the throne?
Tirzad: Why would you think the throne would be facing the entrance? It isn't a receptionist's desk. Hmm, actually, I feel like I shouldn't say such... Uh, disrespectful things in a place like this.
Tirzad: Anyway, King Deshret's throne should be in a more "dignified" place, or in simpler terms, a place that's higher up.
Jebrael: The mechanisms here probably stopped working a long time ago. We've got to find a way to reactivate them.
Paimon: Ooh... Paimon can't wait to see what the throne looks like.
Paimon: Everything linked to King Deshret is huge! So that throne is definitely very, very huge, right? Hehe, Paimon wants to take a seat on it!
Benben: Bee-eep? Beep...
Jeht: Something seems to be the matter with Benben. It seems like... it wants to go down?
Paimon: Huh? But Tirzad said the throne is definitely higher up...
Tirzad: Hmm... to go up, we must first go down. You cannot reach a peak without falling to your lowest, just like...
Traveler: Just like in life.
Tirzad: Yes! Exactly! Hah, looks like you've learned quite a bit these past few days you spent with me, eh?

## Talk 14

Jebrael: There's a lot to discuss, but let's set up camp first.
Black Screen Text: You and everyone else set up the camp in silence. It is already getting dark as you finish your meal...

## Talk 15

Tirzad: ...Oh, it's you. Is there anything else you want to discuss?
Traveler: Let's talk about Jebrael.
Tirzad: To think that I remained doubtful of him until the end. I'm such an awful person...
Tirzad: Now, all I have for him is gratitude...
Tirzad: I've never been able to commit before this, whether in academics or in life... But that ends now. I will take the path I believe in, no matter how difficult it may be...
Tirzad: This is the least I can do to pay my respects to him...
Traveler: I want to talk about King Deshret.
Tirzad: To be honest, I'm starting to doubt the credibility of the articles I've read...
Tirzad: That prayer... It gives me a strange feeling that I can't put a finger on. And Samail too... What he said... I think I should study it further once I get back.
Tirzad: Of course, my main mission is still to write my paper like I originally planned.
Traveler: Let's talk about Jeht for a moment.
Tirzad: *sigh* I, too, wish that I could do something for her, but...
Tirzad: I can't...
Tirzad: And she refuses to say anything. If she would just speak her desire, I would be willing to do anything in my power to help her...!

## Talk 16

Jeht: Sorry... I'm still not very good at controlling my emotions.
Traveler: Don't apologize.
Paimon: Yeah... We know you're going through a tough time.
Jeht: Thank you... May your travels be smooth.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon hopes that everything will go well for you too... Paimon's sure it will!

## Talk 17

Bonifaz: Where are Omid and Mirsad? Are they...
Nachtigal: Don't worry. They're both fine. It's just that... they have other plans so they won't continue working with us.
Bonifaz: Huh? What do we do? We can't handle all the work with only the two of us. We've gotta hire more people! But who'd want to come to Aaru Village...
Bonifaz: Forget it, let's discuss this later. Anyway, Cyrus got back safely. That's at least something to be happy about, right? I'm never letting it go to such a dangerous place again.
Nachtigal: What are you talking about? We're Sumpter Beast merchants. What are we going to eat if our Sumpter Beasts don't work?
Nachtigal: You can't simply fill your belly with wind. Even if you could, open your mouth here, and I guarantee that you'll get a mouthful of sand instead...
Bonifaz: But we can't let Cyrus take risks. You look pretty strong to me, so why don't you carry our goods instead?
Nachtigal: ?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Hehe, this chair is huge! Paimon feels like just sitting on it is gonna make Paimon super great!
Traveler: I want to sit on it too.
Tirzad: I may disapprove of a tyrant like King Deshret, but your thoughts might be a little too audacious even so, Paimon...
Tirzad: Anyway, nothing happened. Huh? Is something lacking? Or perhaps we made a mistake somewhere...
Tirzad: Hmm... Jebrael did mention that only the chosen may kneel before the throne... M—Maybe we really have to kneel before the throne?
Tirzad: But I'm a researcher of the Akademiya. I can't kneel before a tyrant's throne! And it's an empty throne, too!
Paimon: Don't worry, it won't be empty once Paimon sits there.
Tirzad: You're seriously... Jeht, please, help me with Paimon... Jeht?
Tirzad: Wait. Where did Jeht go? She was still with us just a moment ago, right?
Jebrael: Samail...
Samail: Jebrael, are you still refusing to admit that you are a Thutmose deep down? Self-deceiving makes no difference for people like us, you know it!
Samail: Al-Ahmar's throne is right before us. Aren't you obsessed with it too?
Samail: No mere grain of sand can reject the Golden Slumber. Al-Ahmar's promise is the paradise that all of us dream of.
Samail: Did you think betraying the Thutmose would be enough to deny your nature? Hah! I knew you would be back.
Samail: Little Jeht, do you see it now? Once he laid eyes on Al-Ahmar's throne, your dear father forgot everything! Even you!
Jeht: That was my mistake. It has nothing to do with him!
Samail: Hmph! You're just as stubborn as your father, but your talkativeness... I guess you must've gotten that from Ufairah, huh?
Jebrael: Samail, we've solved everything for you and brought you to the throne. Your dream... should be fulfilled. Jeht is useless to you, so why keep her?
Tirzad: I see! So you're finally showing your true colors, huh, Jebrael? "Use their plans against them"? You're just one of them, like I expected!
Samail: Hahahaha! So this is your choice? Looks like your companions never really trusted you at all.
Jebrael: Tirzad, your expedition should be over now. We've explored the entire Khaj-Nisut, and you now have all the knowledge you need for your paper...
Jebrael: We should start considering how to get back safely now... I promised to protect you until the end, and I'll keep my word.
Samail: Tsk tsk tsk! Such greed!
Samail: Jebrael, I thought I knew you... But I really don't understand what you're doing right now.
Samail: You're trying to shoulder every burden! Your daughter's safety! That researcher's commission! And even Al-Ahmar's secrets!
Samail: I thought you learned your lesson about greed when Ufairah died! Oh, sorry, or should I say "I taught you that lesson when Ufairah died"?
Samail: Oh! Perhaps you learned your lesson, and you're prepared to pay the price now? Let's see which one amongst them will be the price you pay!
Paimon: This weirdo keeps saying weird stuff. Paimon's getting confused... Haven't we uncovered everything? And what are Al-Ahmar's secrets, anyway?
Traveler: And the Golden Slumber...
Tirzad: Aren't those just desert superstitions? Things like that are... too vague. There's no research value in them.
Tirzad: They say anyone who gains King Deshret's wisdom is permitted to enter the Golden Slumber, and enjoy eternal peace and happiness there.
Tirzad: Besides ignorant children... who could take that seriously?
Samail: Hmph! You third-rate researcher! Oh, if Ufairah were alive, she would have written multiple books by now! Someone like you has no right to talk about Al-Ahmar's legacy.
Jebrael: ...Enough! If you wish to sit on Al-Ahmar's throne, then do as you please. I won't stop you, and I won't let Tirzad do that either.
Jebrael: #I opened the path to Al-Ahmar's throne for you, and I used Tirzad and Traveler to make Khaj-Nisut manifest itself.
Jebrael: I don't think I owe Tirzad anything. He wanted a paper that could shock the academic world, and now he has material that no one else has. I've helped him accomplish his objective.
Jebrael: Now, give Jeht to me, and we'll be even.
Samail: Hmm. I'm really curious. Why are you always so evasive whenever Al-Ahmar's secrets are mentioned?
Samail: It's an empty throne! Anyone can sit on it. An unqualified and mediocre person won't become great just by sitting on it...
Samail: That prayer is the key... But of course you know that! Hmm... Well, it all makes sense if you were planning to return alone.
Samail: Unfortunately, unless you're willing to pay with little Jeht's life...
Traveler: Nothing is more important than family.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon may not know what the secrets of Al-Ahmar he keeps mentioning are... But it doesn't matter if it's the truth, or if it's superstition like Tirzad says...
Paimon: Both strength and endless wealth are nothing before family!
Tirzad: What kind of prayer has that much appeal...? I refuse to believe it. But I don't mind listening in. It wouldn't hurt to include it as an anecdote in my paper.
Tirzad: If something like that can be exchanged for Jeht's safety, then stop hesitating and tell him.
Tirzad: To be honest, I expected that we might have to fight for our lives to get home... So isn't it great that we can resolve this peacefully?
Tirzad: I never expected to see such intense superstition... I guess my knowledge is still lacking. Perhaps this superstition, linked to King Deshret as it is, may be worth studying after all.
Jebrael: ...
Jebrael: "O stars high above the wasteland..."
Black Screen Text: Jebrael recites the song he sang softly at night in the oasis.
Paimon: Huh?
Tirzad: But isn't this...?
Jeht: ...Father?
Traveler: (Jebrael? Why?)
Jebrael: (Get ready.)
Samail: "O stars high above the wasteland," huh? I see.
Black Screen Text: Samail repeats the "prayer."
Tirzad: ...What is this?
Paimon: #Traveler, he looks so strange! He fell asleep... No, wait! He isn't breathing!
Jebrael: He got what he wanted. He's inside the Golden Slumber that Al-Ahmar promised, the Eternal Dreamland...
Traveler: So that's what you meant by the Eternal Dreamland?
Eremite Mercenary: What happened to Samail? None of you will leave this place alive!
Jebrael: #Traveler, get ready for battle!
Traveler: Sitting on a seat that doesn't belong to you won't end well.

## Talk 19

Jeht: Father! What's going on? That prayer...
Tirzad: Jebrael, you mentioned that Jeht's mother deciphered it from Al-Ahmar's texts... I didn't expect it to be used here...
Tirzad: But... Is Al-Ahmar's Golden Slumber a way to send his believers into eternal sleep?
Tirzad: That makes it more terrifying than I ever imagined... I really should get back and update the collective knowledge of the academic world.
Paimon: Eek, thank goodness Paimon didn't sit on that throne... Guess sitting on a seat that doesn't belong to you really doesn't end well, huh?
Traveler: I have so many questions...
Jebrael: Ufairah made this inference about Al-Ahmar's promise...
Jebrael: Those who offer the correct prayer to Al-Ahmar will be granted entry into the Golden Slumber, but it's a one way trip.
Jebrael: No one can move freely between the Eternal Dreamland and reality. It seems like Ufairah was right. Samail is gone forever.
Jebrael: I must admit that it was a very risky gamble...
Traveler: But all that matters is Jeht is safe.
Paimon: That's right! Everyone's safe, and that's the most important thing!
Tirzad: Hmm, let me summarize the overall situation now... Jeht's back safely, and Samail's subordinates have been defeated.
Tirzad: Samail... He got his wish, didn't he? If he wasn't such a villain, I'd even feel like thanking him...
Tirzad: Anyway, uh, since he's in the paradise he dreamed of, I don't need his permission to use him as a case study in my paper, right?
Tirzad: ...Hah, all's well that ends well, eh? I, Tirzad, hereby announce that this archaeological expedition has been completed successfully and has yielded great results!
Jeht: ...Is it really over? This doesn't feel real...
Tirzad: Actually, it isn't over. I mean, the minimum requirement in the commission was to escort me safely back to Aaru Village, right?
Jeht: Hmm, that's true. Tirzad's commission isn't over, so I can't slack off just yet.
Jeht: Father and I will be free once we escort Tirzad back safely! Hehe, then we can go wherever we want.
Jeht: Oh! I'm not talking about the desert, by the way. I mean literally anywhere!
Jebrael: It's fine, Jeht. I'm willing to accompany you wherever you want to go. As for Ufairah... I'll tell you about her, if you're willing to listen.
Jebrael: There's her research notes too... But I don't know if you'll be interested in those.
Jebrael: I was worried about losing them, so I didn't bring them along. I left them and some luggage with Bonifaz. Once we return to Aaru Village and get our luggage...
Jeht: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!
Paimon: Hmm? Does anyone else feel like something's wrong?
Tirzad: Something's coming this way!
Jeht: What's going on? How could this be?
Benben: Bee-eep! Beep...
Jebrael: Is it Samail...? Oh no! If he gained Al-Ahmar's wisdom, then even if it's just for an instant, he would have gained Al-Ahmar's authority...
Jebrael: We must leave immediately!

## Talk 20

Jebrael: We must leave immediately!

## Talk 21

Paimon: #The door is shut! Traveler... What do we do?
Jebrael: We must defeat Samail, who has stolen Al-Ahmar's power. But his physical form in this world must've been destroyed already...
Jeht: So that makes him formless... Then how can we defeat him? Don't tell me he's invincible in the Eternal Dreamland...?
Tirzad: U—Unless someone goes to where he is...
Jebrael: Unless someone stops and defeats him in the Eternal Dreamland... I must... I must protect you...
Jeht: Father! B—But how are you going to come back? Didn't you say that no one can move freely between the Eternal Dreamland and reality?
Jebrael: There's no time to lose. I promised to keep you safe, until the end... I can't let you all die here!

## Talk 22

Samail: "The dreams of Thutmose... We will fulfill them."
Tirzad: It was so hard... so difficult to find all the materials for my paper... Will I never have the chance to record all of this again?
Tirzad: I shouldn't have underestimated superstition...

## Talk 23

Paimon: The door's closed again? Thank goodness, we made it out in time...
Tirzad: Jebrael... protected us, but he... *sigh*
Jeht: *sob* Father...
Benben: Beep... Beep-boop beep... Bee-eep...
Paimon: It must be Jebrael who opened the door for us. Without him, we would've been...
Traveler: He fulfilled his promise...
Tirzad: This place may not be completely safe... Let's meet up with Nachtigal's group and head back to Aaru Village...
Black Screen Text: Refusing to give up, Jeht examined the entrance to Khaj-Nisut time after time, only to find the door tightly shut.
Behind it was dead silence. Things had happened and were beyond redemption.
Jeht, now having but to accept reality, put away Jebrael's axe carefully. It is the only thing he has left behind.
We finally managed to persuade her to come back with us to the camp. We then informed the merchants of what happened and returned to Aaru Village...

## Talk 24

Paimon: #Yes! That's the big chair! Traveler, let's check it out!
