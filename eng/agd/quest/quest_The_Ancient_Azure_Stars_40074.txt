# The Ancient Azure Stars


## Talk 1

Xinyan: Everyone, over here!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Is everyone awake now? Mona says that she has something important to tell everyone.
Fischl: The first glimmering daybreak after the return of the Immernachtreich most certainly revitalizes one's innermost spirits.
Oz: What mein Fräulein means is that she is ready to take on the next challenge.
Paimon: Yeah, we're rested and ready too!
Mona: Alright. Then I'll get to the crux of the matter.
Mona: I just peeked into my scryglass, and there's a new mirage forming on the island over there.
Mona: And... I have a feeling that this one is my mirage.
Xinyan: Oh, so now it's Mona's turn. You were with us for all of ours, seems like it's time for us to go with you into yours!
Mona: Ugh... well, I'm sure there's nothing to see, really.
Oz: Lady Megistus, are you embarrassed?
Mona: No, absolutely not! Haha... It's not like I'm worried about everyone judging me after seeing my embarrassingly pathetic mirage or anything...
Kaedehara Kazuha: This emphatic "no" sounds rather like a thinly disguised "yes"...
Mona: Well... *ahem* Astrologists are often regarded as something out of this world, right? But what if my mirage is nothing like that...?
Fischl: Fret not. Your Prinzessin is not so foolish as to entertain preconceived notions on how thy mirage should or should not present itself.
Xinyan: Yeah, me neither! Not that I have low expectations of you, Mona, but personally, I think you're a kind soul, and you shouldn't feel like you have to live up to anything more than that.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm sure Mona's mirage will stay true to her kind heart.
Paimon: Yeah, and it's not like we're going in there just to do some sightseeing. There's other reasons, too, right?
Traveler: Yeah. Maybe...
Mona: ...Really? Well, okay then.
Mona: I suppose I'm not worried as long as everyone doesn't get too excited. Alright then, let's get going.
Traveler: ...we'll find some clues about the unusual phenomena there.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm? There's a star over there...
Paimon: And now it's gone! Let's follow it!

## Talk 3

Paimon: It made its way inside!

## Talk 4

Oz: Lady Megistus... this is heartbreaking.
Mona: Ugh, please don't try to comfort me. It'll only make me feel embarrassed...
Xinyan: C'mon, you don't need to pretend in front of us! Need a hug?
Mona: N—No!
Mona: That was really how I felt back when I first started out in astrology but...
Mona: I've matured now. I'm no longer so easily swayed by random people's opinions.
Fischl: Who would've thought! Even Megistus the Court Archmage was not spared of vexatious times in her career.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It must have been difficult to be misunderstood by others... I'm glad that you were able to move past that.
Mona: Actually, there are many who have given up astrology due to similar circumstances.
Mona: But, I am a genius, so it's only fair that I'm able to accomplish what others cannot.
Paimon: It's pretty inspiring to hear you say all that in an amazing place like this!
Traveler: You're awesome, Mona!
Mona: Yes, good, keep going.
Oz: Ahem... sorry to interrupt, but the door is that way.
Mona: Alright, I'll let you shower me with praise after all the mysteries are solved.
Traveler: You're definitely a genius.

## Talk 5

Kaedehara Kazuha: The surroundings appear to have changed. This isn't the beach we originally left.
Oz: The area appears to be the mountains of Mondstadt. Wait, have we been sent back to Mondstadt?
Fischl: Yet the boundless ocean still surrounds us.
Mona: There should be another pool around here for us to enter.
Xinyan: Over here, y'all!
Mona: Hmm? Why isn't it letting us enter?
Paimon: Oh, something seems to be floating on the water there...
Xinyan: Uh... is it a painting? Or what is it...?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It seems to be hinting at a specific place.
Fischl: It is anticipating that the Prinzessin would guide her loyal followers to the location that has been chosen by fate.
Mona: Why is it always you that has to take the lead... Ugh whatever, it doesn't matter. Let's just find this place first.
