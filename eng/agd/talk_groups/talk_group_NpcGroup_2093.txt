## Talk 1

Madame Ping: Oh? Why, hello child.
Madame Ping: The flowers bloom and fade, people come and go, but the Lantern Rite will be held each year right on time.
Madame Ping: But this year's Rite is quite different from those of yesteryear. Go, go have a look around. Enjoy the sights and sounds of Liyue Harbor.

Traveler: Admiring the flowers?
Madame Ping: That I am. One season after the next, this flower blooms, then falls, only to bloom again. And on it goes — just like Liyue.
Madame Ping: Look over here, and over here. So many flowers are blooming! It looks like this will be a blessed year.

### Talk 1 related talk 1

Traveler: What type of flowers are these?
Madame Ping: These are Glaze Lilies. Probably the last surviving ones in all of Liyue Harbor.
Madame Ping: People say that the sound of singing nourishes them, and helps them grow...
Madame Ping: But the sound of fighting, of cursing... it is poison to them, and eats away at their roots.
Madame Ping: That is why, over centuries of strife, they have disappeared from Liyue's landscape.

## Talk 5

Madame Ping: Don't underestimate me...

## Talk 6

Madame Ping: Hmmm, I lost, young one. When it comes to cards, you seem to be the best at it.

## Talk 7

Madame Ping: Hehe, young one. You didn't let me win because of my age, did you?

## Talk 8

Madame Ping: That's weird...
Traveler: Granny, what's wrong?
Madame Ping: Oh, it's you two again. I was just sorting out my teapot.
Madame Ping: After you helped clean my teapot last time, I thought to myself, I really ought to give it a proper deep clean.
Madame Ping: It would make things so much easier when I wish to treat my guests to tea in the future.
Madame Ping: So I took it down to the Bishui River and gave it a good old wash, inside and out. But it was no use. This teapot is so dreadfully difficult to clean.
Madame Ping: Youngsters, would you help an old lady clean her teapot once more? For old time's sake?

Traveler: Leave it to us.
Madame Ping: Wonderful, thank you, youngsters.

### Talk 8 related talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, I have other things to do.
Madame Ping: Very well, never mind. You must have far more important things to attend to than helping an old lady with her spring cleaning.

## Talk 11

Traveler: This is a beautiful flower.
Madame Ping: Hehe, all thanks to the beautiful weather we're having today.
Madame Ping: I'd always hoped that one day this flower would bloom all over Liyue once more...
Madame Ping: But in the meantime, would you take a few of these flowers from Yujing Terrace with you on your journey, so that they might see the world?

## Talk 12

Madame Ping: ...The younger generation doesn't appreciate flowers anymore.

Traveler: Tell me about the past.
Madame Ping: Just because my complexion screams "ancient history" doesn't mean I love discussing the past, you know.
Madame Ping: ...Relax, I'm only kidding.
Madame Ping: Truth be told, the older you get, the more time you have on your hands, and the more you start contemplating the past... I do wonder how my old friends back in the mountains are getting on...
Madame Ping: Liyue Harbor is really a wonderful place now. I wonder if they would ever want to step down into the mortal realm and get a taste of the lifestyle here...
Madame Ping: Look at me rambling on again, I must sound like a lunatic! Maybe one day I can discuss my past with you... if it is meant to be.

Madame Ping: Oh? Why, hello child.
Madame Ping: Though flowers bloom yet always fade, but people go yet return another day. I just knew that you'd be back to see me before long, hehe.

## Talk 18

Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is dedicated to Skybracer... He always was a show off — I'm sure he'll be very pleased!

### Talk 18 related talk 0

Traveler: Who's Skybracer?
Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern will be the spitting image of him when it's complete!
Madame Ping: Well, that's the plan. I do hope they make the antlers big enough, they were his pride and joy after all.
Madame Ping: The story goes that the antlers were made from the very essence of Rex Lapis' divine power, which made it the hardest material in all of Liyue.
Madame Ping: But then, that fateful battle happened... The gods exchanged powerful blows, and the mountains started collapsing. To avoid impacting the villagers at the foot of the mountain, the adeptus got his friend to chop his antlers off...
Madame Ping: He used those blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. And if that wasn't enough of a sacrifice, he then kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out...
Madame Ping: Thanks to him, Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day. And the blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River.
Madame Ping: Hehehe... Whether you believe the story or not, I'm just happy you're willing to listen to me tell it.
Madame Ping: Surely, the reason Lantern Rite exists because people throughout the ages have chosen to come together as friends rather than stay in isolation.
