## Talk 1

## Talk 3

Ruu: We'll leave this Perch to you too.

## Talk 4

Ruu: Thanks so much!
Ruu: The Perch seems to be in a good state. I'm sure the ceremony will go well this time!
Traveler: Easy-peasy.
Traveler: It was pretty dicey.
Paimon: Hehe. We're pretty seasoned travelers, after all!
Ruu: #Actually, {NICKNAME}, where are you from?
Ruu: The people who came before talked about places called Inazuma and Narukami Island. Are you from Inazuma?
Traveler: If you're speaking relatively...
Paimon: Huh, that's right, we did come from Narukami Island, didn't we... Wait a moment!
Paimon: Paimon's almost forgotten that we're here for the Maushiro!
Traveler: We're from a very, very distant place...
Paimon: That's true...
Ruu: ...
Ruu: Wow! You even climbed on top of a dragon?
Traveler: Well, it was a pretty uncomfortable affair.
Traveler: It was alright.
Ruu: That's so awesome...
Paimon: The world's a big place, kiddo!
Ruu: I never knew that there were so many places outside the Sea of Fog. If I leave someday, I'd love to see all of them!
Ruu: They always tell us that our souls will become lost if we leave the fog, and that the fog protects us from the darkness outside.
Ruu: But I've met quite a few people from the outside. That's why I know that the Sea of Silence must be inhabited somehow.
Traveler: You can come with us if you have the chance.
Ruu: Alright! It's a deal, then!
Ruu: You two go ahead first!
Paimon: Once the ceremony's over, let's explore the world outside Tsurumi Island together!
Ruu: Sure!
