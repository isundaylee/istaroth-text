# A Pact That Crosses Time


## Talk 1

Huixin: Ms. Ganyu, thank you for accepting my invitation. And as for the two of you, your presence is also much appreciated.
Paimon: Sure!
Ganyu: That's so kind of you, Huixin. You went to great lengths to organize this.
Huixin: Ha, truth be told... Apart from thanking you for all the help, there's something I'd like to tell you...
Ganyu: Oh? If there's anything I can help you with, just tell me straight away. No need to hesitate.
Huixin: Ah... No, no, I don't really need help. Uh... Could you just listen for a bit?
Ganyu: With pleasure.
Huixin: Ha... When I was a little girl, my father used to tell me many stories about you, Ms. Ganyu.
Huixin: Even though I have the utmost respect for my father... I always admired how gentle and reliable you are.
Huixin: I only decided to join the Yuehai Pavilion staff because I've always looked up to you.
Ganyu: I didn't know that you think so highly of me.
Huixin: However, in reality, working at the Yuehai Pavilion turned out to be an arduous task.
Huixin: I can't compare myself to such an outstanding secretary like you. I often doubt myself as a result...
Ganyu: I disagree. You're a great secretary in your own right.
Huixin: Aha, thank you.
Huixin: Over the years, I became a mother, too...
Paimon: Huh! So Uncle Tian is a grandpa!
Huixin: Influenced by my youthful ideals, she followed my footsteps and came to be a secretary at the Yuehai Pavilion, too.
Huixin: At first, I was worried about her. It's not an easy job, after all. To tell the truth, I'm still unsure if she's capable enough.
Huixin: But after all that happened this time, I've... made up my mind to support her choice.
Ganyu: So, what made you change your mind?
Huixin: The fact that she'll have you, Ms. Ganyu, as her senior colleague.
Huixin: You'll help her, gentle as always, and tell her, "Your mom used to do it like that." Heh.
Huixin: It'd be such a beautiful moment.
Huixin: If it's not too much to ask for, she might still need your guidance in twenty plus years, too.
Ganyu: Huixin...
Ganyu: I... I never thought that I meant so much to you.
Huixin: Heh, just like when you showed me my father's trick. Having you as their "witness" makes people feel at ease.
Ganyu: "Witness"...
Ganyu: ...It's true that I've witnessed thousands of years of Liyue Harbor's history. All the changes it's gone through, the stories of its people...
Ganyu: But I've always regarded it as nothing more than the source of my loneliness.
Ganyu: Huixin, you don't know how important those words are to me...
Ganyu: You've made me realize that I share another connection with the people of Liyue Harbor, apart from my contract with Rex Lapis.
Ganyu: They rely on me, accept me, and long for me to bear witness to their stories.
Huixin: Of course! You're irreplaceable to us!
Ganyu: Ehehe... That's right. That's why I can't disappoint you.
Paimon: Hooray! Ganyu's finally cheered up!
Ganyu: Even if I've really been supplanted, I wish to fight for my place...
Ganyu: I won't let you down. I'm going to fulfill my contract and keep working as the Qixing's secretary.
Traveler: Uh... I told you, you haven't been...
Ganyu: Regardless, I'll go back and see for myself.
Ganyu: I'm afraid that it might've all become a mess during my absence.
Ganyu: No time to waste — let's get back to work!
Huixin: Good luck, Ms. Ganyu!
Paimon: Huuuuh!? We leaving already? Paimon's still hungry!
Traveler: You haven't been fired. It's a misunderstanding.

## Talk 2

Baishi: Ahhhh...
Baiwen: Baishi, are you okay? Did you fall asleep standing up?
Baixiao: Look... Look who's back!
Ganyu: You even have enough time for leisure? It seems you three are a suitable replacement for me after all.
Baiwen: Not at all! We just... We've been working for too long. If we didn't take a break...
Baixiao: We wouldn't have survived long enough to see you again, Ms. Ganyu.
Baishi: Ms. Ganyu, we've missed you...
Ganyu: Ehehe. That's so kind of you all, given we've only met once.
Baiwen: We've been praying day and night for you to return and take over your duties again.
Baishi: To us, you're like an adeptus coming down to the human world to save all life.
Baixiao: Forget all our envious complaints from before — just free us from this strenuous work, please...
Ganyu: Alright, alright, I see.
Ganyu: Please divide the matters at hand into government affairs, business affairs, and civil affairs. Mark out the tasks that haven't been started and those that are in progress...
Ganyu: I'll take care of the rest.
Baiwen: Of course! We'll do it right away!
Baishi: Finally... We're saved...
Ganyu: Ah, yes, there's one more thing.
Ganyu: I'd like to earnestly thank you, Traveler. If it weren't for your companionship, I would still be embroiled in my inner conflict right now.
Traveler: It was a fun adventure for me, too.
Ganyu: Hehe, to think that I'd gain a human friend outside of work. It makes me happier than I could've imagined.
Ganyu: I'd like to repay you when I'm done with the work at hand. What would you say if I... accompanied you on one of your trips?
Paimon: Sure, but... are you ever done with work, Ganyu?
Ganyu: Hm...
Ganyu: Uh, let's cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we...
Traveler: It's good that you've pulled yourself together.
