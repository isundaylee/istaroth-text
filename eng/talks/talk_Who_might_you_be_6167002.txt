Traveler: Who might you be?
Knotty: What, can't you tell? I'm an elite member of the Treasure Hoarders... Achoo!
Knotty: ...Our boss reckons that this inhospitable mountain must be home to lots of treasure, and I was sent here to scout out the way... Never expected it to be this cold, though.
Knotty: Hmph. You here for the treasure too?
Knotty: Go if you want to, I'm not going to stop you. But once you do, you'll know just how cold this place is... Achoo!
