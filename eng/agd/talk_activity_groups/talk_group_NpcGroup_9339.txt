Sangonomiya Kokomi: I used to use my rest time to review documents, but... that was when we were at war.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Given that there's no time pressure here, I prefer to take things at a slower pace, and make sure to rest and recover my energy in between battles.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: After all, exhaustion is one of the deadliest enemies you can encounter on the battlefield.

## Talk

Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are so many different kinds of enemies here. We have to think carefully about how to allocate our troops.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If you'd like, I can help you analyze the situation, and make some strategic suggestions.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Or... I could even write a few directives for you. Of course, whether or not they get used... hehe, well, that'll be your decision.

Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's a rare treat for me, being able to read undisturbed in a quiet place like this.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: On Watatsumi Island, as the Divine Priestess, every action I take is the subject of scrutiny and speculation. I have to show some restraint so that my personal preferences don't unduly influence everyone else.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But here, I feel like I can relax a little. Umm... You won't mind if I suddenly laugh out loud while I'm reading, will you?
