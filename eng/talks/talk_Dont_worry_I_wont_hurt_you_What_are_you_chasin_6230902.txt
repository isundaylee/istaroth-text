Traveler: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. What are you chasing?
Little You: My shadow. Everyone says I won't be able to catch it, including my big brother.
Little You: My big brother is the smartest person I know. He can do anything I ask him to! But even he couldn't catch my shadow...
Little You: I'm sure there must be a way, though, and once I've caught it, it'll prove that I'm as smart as him!
Traveler: I can help you.
Little You: Thanks for the offer, but I can do it.
Little You: I'm the one my whole family worries about, and I've had enough of it.
Little You: If I prove I'm as smart as my big brother then Granddad will stop worrying about me, and so will Mommy and Daddy, who work far away from home.
Traveler: Why don't you play with your big brother?
Little You: I really want to, but... It seems like he doesn't want to, he's really busy andâ€” and I think he might be trying to avoid me.
Little You: Granddad says I should be a good girl. I don't want to annoy my big brother.
