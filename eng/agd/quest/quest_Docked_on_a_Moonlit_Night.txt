# Docked on a Moonlit Night


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.

## Talk 2

Ningguang: ...
Beidou: ...
Paimon: Well? Hâ€”How is it? This silence is making Paimon nervous!
Ningguang: Mmm... The bittersweet taste of nostalgia.
Beidou: You mean the taste of going from rags to riches? Just what kind of taste is that?
Ningguang: Hehe... It's mainly sour with just a tinge of sweetness, and a lingering aftertaste.
Beidou: Interesting... Does it taste like starting a little business then discovering that selling fruit isn't very lucrative?
Ningguang: No need to get into the details. Let's leave the past in the past.
Beidou: Haha, who'd have thought that the dignified Tianquan was once a fruit vendor on the street.
Beidou: On the other hand, I bet few can tell that I'm from an ordinary fishing village, right?
Ningguang: Not necessarily. If you ask me...
Ningguang: I'd say that Captain Beidou has eyes that can pierce the sea. You're an adventure-seeking pioneer who tames the wind and the waves... Which is clearly indicative of someone who grew up by the sea.
Beidou: Hey, you're not mocking me, are you?
Ningguang: Come now, it wouldn't do any good to be sarcastic.
Beidou: I know how fierce you can be with words. It's my treat today, so remember to take it easy on me.
Ningguang: Alright, then I'd like to have a few more.
Traveler: Another drink for the lovely lady?
Traveler: We're here to serve you!
Paimon: Well, you heard the good lady, bartender!
Beidou: I like where this is going! I'll have another round, too!
Black Screen Text: You give the two a refill immediately...
Ningguang: Mondstadt's fresh fruit juice is hard to top. I wish I could enjoy some every day.
Beidou: Are you serious? Don't tell me you're gonna open a Sunsettia trade route now...
Ningguang: Hmm, an interesting proposition.
Beidou: Wait... Huh, really?
Ningguang: I'm just joking, of course. There's already a whole industry established for that. They don't need me muscling my way in to their business.
Ningguang: #Thanks for the drinks today, Traveler. If you'd ever like a cushy job, I'd enjoy having you as my personal bartender.
Beidou: You're also welcome aboard the Alcor. The crew loves to drink, you could come feast with us. I promise you'd have a blast.
Ningguang: My, my, Captain Beidou, are you competing with me for talent? That's hardly necessary. You may simply stop by the Jade Chamber whenever you want the Traveler to mix you a drink.
Traveler: (I'm so popular!)
Paimon: Is it Paimon, or does it sound like they think you work for them?
Traveler: When I have a chance...
Traveler: I'll visit you both. I promise.
