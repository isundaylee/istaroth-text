Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: Of all the martial faculties in the world, speed reigns supreme...
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: What is your purpose here, fellow truth seeker? Do you, too, come in search of divine guidance on the Way?

Traveler: Who are you?
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: Hehehe, the truth is I am an Adeptus of the Way living the life of a hermit in this place.
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: No mortals succeed in entering Jueyun Karst save for those of superior strength and extraordinary spirit...
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: I am truly overjoyed to witness it. Henceforth, my door is open to you. You shall be my disciple, and I shall impart to you the secrets of the Way.

Traveler: Divine guidance on the Way?
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: Precisely! As the saying goes, "That which the sages sought first in vain, they found from the hermit when they sought it again"!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: What makes the guidance divine, you ask? All guidance is divine when it comes from an adeptus such as myself! And what is the Way of which I speak? It is a martial art form without peer in all the world.
Traveler: Sounds like a load of mumbo-jumbo...
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: How dare you display such flagrant irreverence towards an Adeptus of the Way!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: So be it! If you insist on squandering your chance to learn the secrets of the Way from me, go and spend the rest of your life regretting it!
Traveler: What d'you teach here then?
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: So I teach— No! The Way of the Adeptus cannot be conversed about with such nonchalance!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: I am not in the business of "teaching," but "imparting," and I am quite insistent about that.
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: If you must know — for a fee of seven thousand Mora per month, I will impart to you the secrets of harnessing your martial faculties. Your feet and your fists shall fly with the force of a comet and the ease of a butterfly!

Traveler: ...Bye.
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: Farewell! You are most welcome to visit me again.
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: There is a saying that goes: "Even a champion is defenseless against a frenzy of fists; even a master may be slain by a stray roof tile..." Remember it well, my child!
