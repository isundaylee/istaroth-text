Ioroi: Kichiboushi and the others are young, so their speaking ability is limited... I miss the days when the bake-danuki could run circles around the humans.

Ioroi: Speaking of... *sniff, sniff* That kitsune is gone, yes? Good. I have a request, young one. Come closer...
Ioroi: You must protect the cubs from that sneaky kitsune at all costs!!!
