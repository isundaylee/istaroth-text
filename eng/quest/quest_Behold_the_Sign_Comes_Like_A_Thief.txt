# Behold, the Sign Comes Like A Thief...


## Talk 1

Paimon: According to the marks on the map from Yuften, this must be the right place!
Paimon: Let's have a look around, maybe the caravan has left some clues!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look, what's that over there?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey! Look, over there! It's a rug...

## Talk 4

Yuften: This matter is e—extremely urgent! P—please go inform the Matriarch.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Over there! It's a cart! We've found the caravan!

## Talk 6

Eremite Assassin: We've also been commissioned to complete a task. You should empathize. Why must you make things so difficult?

## Talk 7

Investigate: (A rolled carpet that's still in good condition. The symbol of the Tanit tribe is stitched into it, while ominous blotches dot its surface...)
Traveler: The rug... how strange...
Paimon: Huh... Wow, that rug looks expensive. But why did it just get left here?
Traveler: Maybe there was a struggle or fight over it...
Paimon: Hm... Yeah... Paimon thinks she can see that happening.
Paimon: The caravan and the robbers had a fight here. Some goods got damaged during the battle, while other perfectly fine ones were left aside in the ensuing chaos...
Traveler: Very astute, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe. Paimon's the best!
Paimon: And then, the caravan and the robbers fought while running all along the way... fighting and running and fighting... That's why all these boxes and jars are scattered everywhere.
Paimon: Hm. Paimon thinks that's a good deduction!
Traveler: That doesn't make any sense!
Paimon: Hmph!
Traveler: The trashed goods should have been discarded after the bandits got to them...
Paimon: Really...
Traveler: Because we didn't see any signs of a struggle along the way.
Paimon: So, that's how it was... Still, Paimon's theory was close... Like ninety-percent accurate close!
Paimon: Huh... Paimon can't help feeling something's wrong...
Traveler: About what?
Paimon: Don't you... think these clues are too neatly laid out? It's like they were placed in a line to lead us over somewhere...
Traveler: You... might be a bit too suspicious.
Paimon: Hey! Look, the cart's right there!
Paimon: Paimon can barely recognize it... Though the Tanit marking's there, it looks a bit... blurry...
Paimon: Alright. We can close this case now!
Paimon: It's elementary: What happened was that the caravan was ambushed and the goods were all stolen. Let's go back to Yuften and tell him what happened!
Traveler: Right, let's head back.
Eremite Assassin: Pardon me, but I beg you both to still your stride.
Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Eremite Assassin: We are friends. Of Jeht's. You have been working hard.
Paimon: Oh, well, Jeht's friends are our friends! We were just finishing up! Let's head back together!
Eremite Assassin: Haha, no need to be so hasty. And guests shouldn't be so harried to depart.
Traveler: Paimon, wait... There's something not right with them.
Eremite Assassin: Jeht requested that you stay in the desert for a time... She commissioned us to come here and give you the "hospitality" you deserve.
Eremite Assassin: It would be cruel of you to disappoint her kindness.
Paimon: #Uh... Traveler...
Traveler: Paimon. Hide.
Paimon: A—Alright!
Traveler: Possibly, but we don't have enough evidence for that.
Traveler: Time for Paimon to use her intuition!
Traveler: The things they left behind were to ensure they moved fast and light.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hmph... They left absolutely nothing intact. Oh, Paimon's getting mad! These hilichurls really know how to break stuff!
Traveler: Wait, it doesn't look like it was destroyed by hilichurls...
Paimon: Huh? But... the hilichurls have their camp here, don't they?
Traveler: I don't see any carts around us...
Paimon: Yeah... You're right! There aren't any carts or even wrecks here... The shack left behind by the hilichurls also doesn't seem to have any cart parts... How strange.
Traveler: Let's follow the road a while longer.
Paimon: Alright. But if it wasn't the hilichurls, then who?
Traveler: Look. No cart in the camp either.
Paimon: Yeah! If the hilichurls raided the caravan, they would've taken the carts apart on the spot. But we're not seeing any carts, or any parts... Paimon thinks that's kind of weird!
Traveler: Wait, the raid might not have happened here...
Paimon: But the hilichurls placed their camp right in the middle of the road... Look there. If they block that spot off, won't it be easy to rob someone?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow... that was close. Luckily, we're good at fighting. Took them down in no time flat!
Traveler: Thanks for your "hospitality."
Paimon: Why is it that every bad guy wants to mess with us? Is it because we look soft?
Traveler: They claimed to be sent by Jeht...
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Do you believe them?
Traveler: I don't think Jeht has a reason to do this.
Traveler: But she might be wrapped up in something big...
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon doesn't think Jeht would do this either... But, what should we do now?
Paimon: The people who just ambushed us knew Jeht, which means that they must know people amongst the Tanit as well...
Paimon: You mean that if we return to the tribe, we'll catch their attention? Paimon doesn't think they'll just let this go.
Paimon: And Jeht... Paimon's not suspecting her, but the people who tried to kill us might be hiding within the tribe. Maybe we should leave for a while...
Traveler: If we leave, Jeht might be in danger.
Paimon: Yeah... We can't just leave her.
Traveler: Let's go back first. But don't mention Jeht.
Paimon: Huh? But...
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon's not scared! If you've decided, then that's how we'll do it!

## Talk 10

Yuften: Y—y—you're back?
Paimon: What? Something strange about us coming back?
Yuften: N—N—No. I'm v—very pleased th—that you h—have returned, e—esteemed Master of the Jinni.
Yuften: R—right. Ab—abo—about the c—caravan. How did y—your investigation... go?
Traveler: The caravan got ambushed. The goods have been taken.
Yuften: Cu—curses! It's those traitors again! I—I—I just kn—know it!
Paimon: Traitors...
Yuften: Th—Th—Those traitors! Those northerner colluding dogs!
Yuften: A—aside from this, wh—what else ha—have you uncovered?
Traveler: We were ambushed by the Eremites.
Paimon: Yeah. Just as we finished investigating what happened to the caravan, the Eremites showed up to ambush us! They also said...
Traveler: They also said that they knew us.
Paimon: Right... That too!
Yuften: ...
Yuften: I—if—if that's the c—case... Th—then they might be onto you as well.
Yuften: H—Here is your pa—payment. P—Please go see Matriarch B—Babel about th—this matter as s—soon as possible!
Traveler: Right.
Yuften: Fa—farewell, esteemed Master of the Jinni.

## Talk 11

Babel: Greetings, esteemed Master of the Jinni. Is there something you need?
Traveler: Yuften's caravan got raided by some of your traitors.
Babel: Truly... Well, it's not unexpected. The northerners from the snowlands have long tried to push into our lands. The treacherous amongst our number fell prey to their words and turned against us.
Babel: These traitors have been causing havoc for quite some time. Sporadic but persistent raids and robberies have been happening since a few months ago...
Babel: Oh... Apologies, I didn't mean to interrupt. Please continue.
Traveler: The traitors have also taken an interest in us.
Paimon: Yeah. Just as we finished investigating the caravan, thugs from the Eremites ambushed us.
Babel: Is that the case... How vile.
Babel: It appears that... with Aderfi and Azariq both gone, these wild dogs see this as high time to bare their teeth.
Babel: How about this? Please wait here and rest. I will handle all matters regarding your safety.
Babel: Jeht is still outside fulfilling her duties to the tribe. I will have her work alongside you to get to the bottom of this matter.
Babel: And before that, I will do my utmost to find the assassins who sought you dead... I ask for only patience in return.
Paimon: Uhh... Oh, one more thing! The bad guys that jumped us seemed to know us! They might be from the tribe!
Babel: It's not impossible... But it matters little. With your privileges as esteemed guests, you will be protected... So long as you stay here, no one can hurt you.
Babel: If anyone of the Tanit seeks to trouble you, whoever they are, they will face judgment at my hands, under my authority as Matriarch.
Babel: Please, rest. I will pursue the matter of the traitors to the fullest of my ability.
Babel: Additionally, I will keep watch for Jeht on your behalf. I will notify you the moment she returns.
Paimon: Alright! Thanks a lot, Matriarch Babel.
Babel: The courtesy is unneeded.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Babel: Greetings, esteemed Master of the Jinni.
Babel: Regarding the attempt on your life, rest assured, I am still investigating.
Babel: I can promise your safety when you are amongst the Tanit, but should you walk the desert sands... Be very careful.
Traveler: About the Eternal Oasis...
Babel: Allow me to offer my deepest thanks on behalf of the Tanit and Jeht herself for your deeds...
Babel: The Eternal Oasis not only bears great importance to Jeht, but it also stands as a central pillar of our faith.
Babel: Claiming the Eternal Oasis means claiming the sovereignty that once belonged to the Queen of All Oases, Nabu Malikata... For her descendants, this inheritance means everything.
Traveler: I don't quite understand... Just what is it actually worth?
Babel: Hahaha. Perhaps it can't even be traded for a single coin...
Babel: But it is beyond value nonetheless.
Traveler: Has Jeht been busy?
Babel: Yes. As we now hold the Eternal Oasis, we must prevent all with dubious intent from ever breaching its thresholds. The Tanit stands now as defenders of the Eternal Oasis.
Babel: And the one most suited to complete this task is, to my mind, undoubtedly Jeht. She is guarding her parents, is she not?
Traveler: About the traitors...
Babel: I suppose it is due to the fact that we have opened a path to the Eternal Oasis that has caused these traitors to grow restless.
Babel: Our goddess, to them, is a symbol of status above all others, and might bring them unfathomable wealth... I cannot tolerate such blasphemy.
Traveler: You still believe she'll wake up.
Babel: Of course... Sooner or later, she will reclaim the mantle of her divinity and lead us to become a blooming nation. But before that happens, I... and the Tanit, will continue to serve her will.
Traveler: We went there. She wasn't there.
Babel: She "was" present. You just didn't "see" her. But she "was" and will always "be there."
Traveler: Bye.
Babel: Farewell, esteemed Master of the Jinni.
