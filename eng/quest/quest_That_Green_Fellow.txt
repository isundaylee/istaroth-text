# That Green Fellow

Green Fellow: Wait, you guys are...
Green Fellow: Oh, that's right! You're the ones that scared Dvalin away.
Paimon: Dvalin? Who's that?
Traveler: That's Stormterror's real name.
Paimon: Huh? ...Oh, right. Most people seem to call him "Stormterror."
Paimon: Why do you call him that... are you two meant to be close or something?
Green Fellow: Oh, so close...
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}. Paimon thinks this guy has a screw loose...
Traveler: Ahh... hi.
Green Fellow: Good day, outlander. Seems we meet again.
Venti: I'm Venti the bard.
Venti: Three-time winner of the "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt," to be precise.
Venti: So, what do you need from me?
Paimon: Given you recognize us, Paimon doesn't believe we need to explain any further.
Paimon: Of course it's about Stormterror.
Venti: Storm...?
Paimon: Hey! Cut it with the amnesia act!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, show it to him.
Venti: Oh! Isn't thisâ€”
Paimon: What!? The crystal has been purified!? When?
Traveler: Not sure how this happened.
Venti: Dvalin, he...
Venti: The anguish he feels... has brought him to tears...
Paimon: Tears...?
Traveler: The last time I checked, it was full of impurities.
Traveler: I'm sorry, you are...?
Traveler: Lisa told us already, weren't you listening?
