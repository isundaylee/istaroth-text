# Tracks Through the Wilderness


## Talk 1

Paimon: Why did Chasca rush off like that? And then Elder Allpa and the others, too... Anyway, let's go see what this is all about!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Is Chasca gonna be okay? Should we go check on her?

## Talk 3

Isidore: Ch—Chasca!? How'd you get here... Quick! Stop her!
Chasca: Don't you even think about running away!

## Talk 4

Paimon: The Flower-Feather Clan should be about ready to hold the new flying trials by now. Let's go check it out!

## Talk 5

Paimon: This is a really remote location... Guess she was trying to get as far away from humans as possible.
Chimpu: ...Cheep.
Chasca: ...We stay here? Mm... Okay, got it.
Chasca: #Traveler, Paimon, Mom says we should stay out of sight for now. She'll talk to Coya first.
Chasca: Coya is very hostile toward humans right now, so if we show up unannounced, it might just make things worse.
Traveler: Got it.
Coya: ...
Chimpu: ...Cheep?
Coya: ...Cheep!
Chimpu: Cheep...
Paimon: Uhhh... Any idea what they're saying?
Chasca: Hmm... Sounds like things are more complicated than I imagined.
Chasca: ...There's evidence in this area suggesting that Coya might have been the victim of a human attack.
Paimon: What!?
Coya: ...Cheep.
Chimpu: Cheep!?
Chasca: No...!
Traveler: What's wrong?
Chasca: It's Chime, Coya's child... the attackers kidnapped her!
Chasca: "They came over the sea... under the cover of night... and they took Chime."
Paimon: What the heck? Who would do such a thing!?
Chasca: "I searched day and night... and finally found them..."
Traveler: When she says "them"...
Chimpu (Coya & Chimpu): ...Cheep!?
Young Merchant: Oh, yeah! Tepal's contraption is working like a charm! Got 'er in one!
Elderly Merchant: Hey, there's another one... Wait, is that the one that got away last time?
Isidore: Who cares, just get 'em all! Tepal pays us per catch!
Coya: Cheep...!
Chasca: ...!
Paimon: Chasca...!
Traveler: Does she mean...

## Talk 6

Allpa: Is everyone alright?
Isidore: We're okay, no serious injuries... Thank goodness you all got here just in time.

## Talk 7

Isidore: D—Don't come any closer, or I'll... Uhh, go, Phlogiston Wings, take me outta here! ...Aah!
Paimon: Uh-oh, looks like it malfunctioned!
Chasca: (This is bad... Mom and Coya are already injured, and if that thing explodes right next to them...)
Isidore: Help! Uh, Elemental Energy suppresses it! Please, someone—
Chasca: Get back!
Chasca: ...!
Paimon: Uh... It's still going... And it's getting worse!
Chasca: Guess we need a more permanent solution. Alright then...
Chasca: Hurrrh!
Black Screen Text: Chasca throws the malfunctioning trackball into the distance... Moments later, a huge explosion rings out over the ocean.
Isidore: ...*panting*...
Isidore: That was too close... I thought I was gonna die...
Traveler: That can still be arranged...
Isidore: Eek!
Chasca: Answer us honestly. Were you the ones who attacked Coya before?
Isidore: I, um... No, it was, it was...
Coya: ...Cheep.
Chasca: Well, she says it was you.
Traveler: If you still want to deny it...
Chasca: Just tell me. Who sent you here?
Isidore: I—It was Tepal! He told us to catch all the wild qucusaurs we can find!
Isidore: And... he also said that this qucusaur has become a thorn in his side... so it needs dealing with urgently...
Chasca: "Tepal"? Huh, sounds familiar... But where from...?
Traveler: So, where is he now?
Isidore: Um... He tends to send his orders in writing...
Isidore: He pretty much never communicates with us in person. When he does, he wears a mask to hide his face...
Isidore: And whenever we trade qucusaurs for Phlogiston Wings, we deal with his henchmen.
Paimon: So you didn't even make those wings!
Isidore: All we did was slap some labels on them and transport them over here, to make them look like they're imported...
Chasca: ...To make it harder to trace their origins.
Traveler: Why does he want you to catch qucusaurs?
Isidore: Uh... I don't know, honest!
Chasca: Well, that's mighty convenient, huh? What about if I held a gun to your head, would that change your answer?
Isidore: N—No need! I'm sorry, I'll tell you everything I know!
Isidore: Tepal doesn't tell us much, but he's always stresses that he wants them alive... So that gives us some clues...
Isidore: This is just a best guess, of course, but we suspect that the gaseous phlogiston stored in the trackballs... is drawn directly from the qucusaurs.
Paimon: What!?
Coya: Cheep!
Chasca: Easy now, you're still injured... Hey, keep talking.
Isidore: Yes Ma'am... So, the gaseous phlogiston has to be highly refined in order to power the Phlogiston Wings. The slightest imperfection can have disastrous consequences, as you just witnessed...
Isidore: But the qucusaurs have a natural ability to process gaseous phlogiston, so... if you use them as an intermediary, then...
Coya: Cheep!
Chasca: That's enough... So, the qucusaurs you took. Where are they now?
Isidore: Uh... Tepal should have them... But no one knows where he's based apart from him and his henchmen.
Isidore: We've tried looking for it ourselves. Even followed them a few times. But we always end up losing track of them...
Paimon: Random thought: Maybe they're hiding up in the sky...?
Traveler: I guess this means we can't go after the ringleader yet.
Chasca: Tepal... Tepal... I'm sure I've heard that name. Maybe it was...
Allpa: #Chasca! Traveler!
Paimon: That voice! It's Allpa!
Chasca: Elder Allpa? What brings you all the way out here?
Allpa: Well, I was patrolling nearby when I heard the sound of an explosion... What's going on?
Traveler: Let me fill you in...
Black Screen Text: You explain Tepal's scheme to Allpa...
Allpa: I don't believe it...
Chasca: Elder Allpa, does the name "Tepal" ring a bell to you? I feel like I've seen it written down before... maybe in a list of candidates for the flying trials.
Paimon: Huh? So he's a member of your tribe, then?
Chasca: No... If he was a member of the Flower-Feather Clan, I'd definitely know him.
Traveler: Shall we head back to the tribe and do some investigating?
Allpa: ...
Allpa: ...Now that you mention it, I do remember a young man from outside our tribe who came to participate in our flying trials once.
Allpa: You were away on a mission at the time, which is probably why you don't remember him.
Allpa: He was a craftsman from the Children of Echoes, but he'd always dreamed of soaring the skies. So he wanted to join our flying squad.
Chasca: The Children of Echoes? That's rare.
Allpa: But despite his best efforts, he unfortunately failed to pass the trial and gain the qucusaurs' approval.
Allpa: In the end, he went wingless, and returned dejected to the Children of Echoes.
Paimon: Wingless, huh... Maybe he invented the Phlogiston Wings to get revenge on the qucusaurs?
Allpa: Perhaps... or maybe it's simply his way of dealing with his regrets over his past flying endeavors.
Chasca: ...Either way, it doesn't excuse his abuse of the qucusaurs. I'm gonna take these guys back and expose the truth to the tribe. It's time for this conflict to end.
Isidore: Aah...!
Allpa: Easy, Chasca. Remember what I said about keeping a low profile?
Allpa: The ringleader still hasn't shown himself, and this man's allegation about powering the Phlogiston Wings with qucusaurs is only speculation.
Allpa: Bringing these men to the tribe now won't win over any current supporters of the Phlogiston Wings. In fact, it may even escalate the conflict further.
Allpa: ...After all, many are mistrustful of the qucusaurs after recent events.
Chasca: ...Is that why Tepal waited until now to try to capture my sister?
Isidore: I—I don't know! I mean, he did tell us to spread negative rumors about the qucusaurs, and slip some Mora to anyone opposed to them, but...
Paimon: But Coya only attacked humans because they stole her child!
Allpa: Nevertheless, we will be hard-pressed to change people's minds while emotions are running high — unless we have irrefutable evidence...
Traveler: ...You mean, we need to catch Tepal himself?
Allpa: Bravo, my thoughts exactly. In the meantime, leave these men with me — I'll escort them back to the tribe.
Allpa: I'll take the other members of their crew into custody, too. They won't get another chance to stir up trouble.
Chasca: Fair enough... I guess finding Tepal is gonna be the key to resolving this conflict. Let's hope the Children of Echoes have some info on him.
Coya: Cheep...
Chasca: Sorry, whatever it is, it'll have to wait till this has all blown over. I have to fix this situation before it spirals out of control...
Chimpu: Cheep...
Chasca: Mom, Sis... rest up, and get well soon. I gotta fly.
Black Screen Text: Everyone departs, leaving only Chimpu and Coya...
Coya: ...
Chimpu: (...If you're worried, go ahead and follow her.)
Chimpu: (Don't worry about me. Mom can take care of herself.)
Coya: (...Got it.)
Traveler: We have other ways of making you talk.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Coyllur: What was wrong with that qucusaur? Why was it so aggressive?
Zhunan: If we just let it escape back into the wild, who's to say it won't attack again?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Chasca... A—Are you okay?
Chasca: Phew... I'm fine, sorry for making you worry.
Traveler: You're not going to keep following her?
Chasca: No point. She's an expert at hiding her tracks. Once she's shaken you off, you'll never catch up to her.
Chasca: ...At least, I always used to lose to her at hide-and-seek when we were kids.
Traveler: When you were kids?
Chasca: Well, yeah. You know I was raised by qucusaurs. Anyway, she and I grew up in the nest together... her name's Coya, and she's my "big sister."
Chasca: We played together all the time, chasing each other through treetops, or mountaintops. It felt like it would go on that way forever... Until the day I was sent back to live with the humans.
Chasca: Not all qucusaurs are friendly towards people. Coya, for instance — she's fine with me, because we grew up around each other, but she's not fond of other humans.
Chasca: When "Mom" decided to send me away, Coya strongly protested, and after I left, she became more and more reluctant to interact with humans...
Paimon: Maybe she thinks that... humans stole you away from her?
Chasca: ...It's a possibility. But in any case, we still stayed best friends at first.
Chasca: I had a hard time adjusting to life in the tribe, so whenever something went wrong, I'd run off into the wild and vent to Coya.
Paimon: Ah, so that's what Uncle Cusco was talking about. He said you seemed to prefer hanging out with saurians to your own kind back then.
Chasca: Yeah, I did... but then gradually, everything changed. With a new mom and dad, a new tribe, and Chuychu...
Chasca: I started getting curious about these humans, and made an effort to understand their behavior. The more time I spent with them, the less I spent with Coya...
Chasca: And then, one day... it was Coya's turn to leave the nest. She sought me out and asked if I was willing to leave the tribe and go live in the wilderness with her.
Chasca: As far as I can remember... That was the first time she ever approached a human settlement on purpose.
Paimon: So... how did you answer her?
Chasca: Well, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you if I'd said yes.
Traveler: In other words, you turned her down?
Chasca: No, I... I was torn. On the one hand, I'd already made up my mind to embrace my new family, and accept my human identity.
Chasca: But I also knew that Coya wasn't a fan of humans, and I didn't want to disappoint her... *sigh* She took my hesitation as an answer.
Chasca: She saw it as a personal betrayal, threw a huge fit, and then flew off. We hadn't seen each other since... until today.
Chasca: Not for lack of trying, though. I tried asking Mom where Coya's new nest was so I could talk things out with her. But Coya had already asked Mom not to tell me where she'd moved to.
Chasca: It must be hard for Mom, being stuck between her two daughters, so I didn't press the issue, and I didn't go looking for her.
Traveler: But after today's events...
Chasca: Mm, if things carry on like this, I need to make sure I find her before anyone else... Even if she doesn't want to see me.
Chasca: For now, let's bring the wounded back to the tribe, and see what Mutota and Elder Allpa have in mind.
