# Timaeus' Alchemy Tutorial


## Talk 1

Timaeus: I want to find out more about alchemy.
Timaeus: The ancient art of alchemy is simply captivating... I wish more people appreciated it.
Timaeus: Oh, you're into alchemy too?
Traveler: Very much so.
Timaeus: #Well then, boy, it's time for you to get some first-hand experience!
Timaeus: All great accomplishments start with a firm grasp of the basics and go from there.

## Talk 2

Timaeus: Let's have you start by making some Shocking Essential Oil.
Timaeus: It is a foundational alchemical product. The best place for beginners to start.
Timaeus: To make Shocking Essential Oil, you will need some electro crystal and a frog.
Timaeus: Both can be easily found outside the city— What? You can't see a connection between crystal and essential oil?
Timaeus: Hahaha, that's because there is none! The electro crystal is for the shocking part; it's the frog that provides the essential oil.
Timaeus: Once you've gathered everything, try and create some Shocking Essential Oil. No half measures now, give it all you've got! I'll be watching from here.
Traveler: Okay.

## Talk 3

Timaeus: Let's have you start by making some Frosting Essential Oil.
Timaeus: It is a foundational alchemical product. The best place for beginners to start.
Timaeus: To make Frosting Essential Oil, you will need a lizard tail and some mist flower corolla.
Timaeus: Both of these are found frequently in the wild— The point of the lizard tail, you ask?
Timaeus: Why, the crispness of a frozen lizard tail makes for a far more appetizing potion!
Timaeus: Hahaha. That was a joke.
Timaeus: Once you've gathered everything, try and create some Frosting Essential Oil. No half measures now, give it all you've got! I'll be watching from here.
Traveler: Okay.

## Talk 4

Timaeus: Let's have you start by making some Flaming Essential Oil.
Timaeus: It is a foundational alchemical product. The best place for beginners to start.
Timaeus: To make Flaming Essential Oil, you will need a frog and a flaming flower stamen.
Timaeus: You should easily be able to find these outside the city— You want to know why we mix a frog with fire?
Timaeus: Why, flaming flowers have to be diluted with the mucus found on frogs' skin before they are safe for consumption...
Timaeus: I mean... Ah, no! I didn't say anything. I said nothing!
Timaeus: Once you've gathered everything, try and create some Flaming Essential Oil. No half measures now, give it all you've got! I'll be watching from here.
Traveler: Okay.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Understood.
Timaeus: So then, let's start with something simple.

## Talk 6

Timaeus: (Test) I like your style. I'm excited to see what we will come up with. Now, go and get me the materials I need!

## Talk 7

Timaeus: Remind me about that potion?
Timaeus: Have you finished making the Shocking Essential Oil?
Traveler: Still working on it...
Timaeus: Shocking Essential Oil is made from electro crystal and frog.
Timaeus: It shouldn't be too hard to find them when you're out and about. Gathering raw materials is a major part of the alchemist's work, you'll just have to get used to it.
Timaeus: When you've found them, try making some Shocking Essential Oil and show me how it turns out.

## Talk 10

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: Nice work! This is some genuine bona fide Shocking Essential Oil alright. It helps people channel Electro energy more easily.
Timaeus: Now, let me tell you what happens if you swap the frog for butterfly wings!
Timaeus: It produces a powerful Insulation Potion, which protects the taker against electroshocking.
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same electro crystal can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Go on, take this Insulation Potion and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!

## Talk 11

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: Wow, that's a mighty fine batch of Frosting Essential Oil you've made! Rub some of this on you to get more in touch with your Cryo side...
Timaeus: But guess what happens if you swap out the lizard tail and use crystal core instead?
Timaeus: Boom! You got yourself a Frostshield Potion, which protects you against the harmful effects of too much playing in the snow, amongst other things!
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same mist flower corolla can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Here's a Frostshield Potion for you. Now, go and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!

## Talk 12

Timaeus: Yes, it's ready.
Timaeus: That sure smells like Flaming Essential Oil alright! And you can really feel the heat too.
Timaeus: Did you know that there is a similar recipe using butterfly wings instead of a frog?
Timaeus: Voilà! You have yourself a Heatshield Potion. If you're ever rescuing a baby from a burning building, this little thing will make sure you don't even break a sweat.
Timaeus: Amazing, isn't it? The very same flaming flower stamen can, depending on the specific alchemical process used, produce two completely opposite effects.
Timaeus: Take this Heatshield Potion and get a taste of what alchemy can really do!
