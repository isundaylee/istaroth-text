Pampa: Yo, you've got time to come here?
Traveler: Do we know you?
Pampa: We've met, we've talked, so we're friends! Besides, weren't we on the same side during that thing? Don't say you've forgotten already!
Traveler: I'm on my own side.
Pampa: *sigh* Fine, you're right, you're right. I heard even Mr. Tenehua really admires you. Being your friend is a great honor!
Traveler: I should get going.
Pampa: Don't let me keep you!
