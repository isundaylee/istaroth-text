The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: "Radiant and Rejuvenated: A New Discovery in Cleansing"
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: A clean face isn't just a requirement for beauty, but the foundation of your health!
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: But clean water doesn't cut it for cleaning away all the dirt and grime, so why not use some facial cleansing ointment and give your face a true deep cleaning!
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: Fret not, the formula for the cleansing ointment is simple! All you need is some fresh Tidalga, Romaritime Flower petals, and Hydro Slime gel.
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: After cleaning the Tidalga and petals with water, mix them in the proper proportions, and use clean gauze to wrap them to use as ingredients.
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: Then, using a small bowl of Hydro Slime gel as a base, heat it at a low temperature until it forms a mushy paste. Be very careful when using an open flame!
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: The next step is the most critical! Take the previously prepared ingredients and grind them up to extract the juice, then slowly add the fluid into the gel paste and mix it until uniform.
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: And finally, using the magic of "time," wait for the gel mixture to cool â€” and you will have a chilled cleansing ointment for your beautiful face!
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: After using this ointment to clean your face, all your messy little faces will become tender and shining, and everyone will like you even more! Be sure to give it a try!
