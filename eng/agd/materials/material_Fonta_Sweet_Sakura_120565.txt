# Fonta: Sweet Sakura

Specially flavored Fonta, said to use Inazuman Sakura Blooms as an ingredient. During its manufacture, the amount of sugar was reduced in order to avoid overwhelming the sakura flavor, but consumer feedback indicates that the so-called "sakura flavor" is more like the smell of a freshly-mown lawn.
