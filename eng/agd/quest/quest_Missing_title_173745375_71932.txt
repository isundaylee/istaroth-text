# Missing title (173745375)

Traveler: Has traveling been fun?
Tia: Yup! This is my first time outside Mondstadt. Everything here is so cool!
Tia: When I was small, I could only read "Vera's Melancholy." I would imagine I was Vera, experiencing all kinds of amazing adventures!
Tia: I know! I'll give you this copy of "Vera's Melancholy." I might have flipped through it a bit too much...
Tia: But I don't need it anymore, because I'm on a real adventure with Daddy. My experiences will be even more interesting than the novel!
