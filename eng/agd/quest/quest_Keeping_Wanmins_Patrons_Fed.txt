# Keeping Wanmin's Patrons Fed


## Talk 1

Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 2

Chef Mao: How many more dishes was that again...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Chef Mao: What am I doing? Why, I'm running Wanmin Restaurant, of course! Haha.
Chef Mao: Things have been getting busy with everyone going out to eat during the Lantern Rite. Even travelers from faraway lands have come to visit and join the festivities.
Chef Mao: Even though my dear Xiangling has returned to help, we're still struggling to keep our heads above water. As a matter of fact, she just went out on a delivery...
Chef Mao: While everyone else has been out hanging lanterns for the festival, we've been too busy to make a single lantern yet.
Chef Mao: If you don't mind, Traveler, could you lend us a hand?
Chef Mao: Do you happen to know Atsuko? She's the girl from Inazuma down by the docks.
Chef Mao: We've prepared her order, so could you please go deliver the food to her? I've even made her extra large portions to celebrate the festival.
Chef Mao: There's also the others who work down by the docks... *Wrench Wang, Hammer Li, Guanhai, and Zhihua*.
Chef Mao: They're regular patrons here and always look after our business. They seem to still be busy with work down by the docks, even though it's time for the festival.
Chef Mao: I would like to prepare some food to give them, but I'm afraid that we're simply too busy and won't have the chance to leave the restaurant...
Chef Mao: If you could, Traveler, please help me ask them what they would like to eat, and I'll whip up whatever they request.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Chef Mao: Thanks a lot, Traveler. Just come back here and let me know once you've asked them.

## Talk 3

Atsuko: I wonder why my order from Wanmin Restaurant hasn't arrived yet...
Traveler: Here's your order. Enjoy!
Atsuko: Oh, thank you so much! I'd thought that it would still take a while longer before it arrived.
Atsuko: All the festivities for Lantern Rite have been making me feel a little homesick... But I certainly won't be returning to Inazuma any time soon.
Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 4

Atsuko: I wonder why my order from Wanmin Restaurant hasn't arrived yet...
Traveler: Here's your order. Enjoy!
Atsuko: You're here at last. I've been waiting for a while... Still, I'm grateful that you're still making deliveries during the festival period.
Atsuko: All the festivities for Lantern Rite have been making me feel a little homesick... But I certainly won't be returning to Inazuma any time soon.
Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...

## Talk 5

Chef Mao: Did you deliver the food?
Traveler: Yes, we did.
Chef Mao: Great, I knew that I could count on you! Did you also happen to ask Wrench Wang, Guanhai, and Zhihua what they would like to eat?
Traveler: Wrench Wang and Hammer Li would like to have Bamboo Shoot Soup.
Chef Mao: Oh? These two have rather similar tastes, though Bamboo Shoot Soup will take some time to make. I'll have to start preparing it early.
Traveler: Guanhai would like to have Squirrel Fish.
Chef Mao: No problem, that dish is one of my specialties.
Traveler: Zhihua would like to have Lotus Flower Crisp.
Chef Mao: Huh, I never would have guessed that Zhihua would have a liking for pastries and the like. Making Lotus Flower Crisp is straightforward enough, no problem.
Chef Mao: Thanks for going and asking them what they'd like to eat. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. Now, I should get started on all those dishes.
Traveler: Won't you be hanging any Xiao Lanterns?
Chef Mao: Hah! We don't have time for that now, I've got more dishes to make and Xiangling has just gone out on another delivery...
Chef Mao: The two of us can barely keep up with the orders as it is. There's no way we'd have any time for hanging lanterns.
Traveler: I can take care of it for you.
Chef Mao: Y—You'd really do that? I'll leave the lantern to you then. I was just starting to worry that the restaurant doesn't look festive enough without any lanterns.
Traveler: I'll make a Xiao Lantern for you.

## Talk 6

Chef Mao: This Xiao Lantern looks great! I'll be sure to write a wish on it shortly. Once Xiangling gets back, we can release the lantern together as father and daughter.
Chef Mao: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, take these as a token of my appreciation.

## Additional Conversations

### Additional Talk 1

Wrench Wang: Let's put our backs into it! Once we're through with this, we can finally eat!
Hammer Li: Alright, back to work...

### Additional Talk 2

Zhihua: I can't wait for some Lotus Flower Crisp...

### Additional Talk 3

Guanhai: *sigh* Here I am still working while everyone else is out enjoying the festival...

### Additional Talk 4

Chef Mao: Is the Xiao Lantern ready yet?

### Additional Talk 5

Wrench Wang: I'll never finish all this work...
Hammer Li: Let's finish this up so we can finally have a rest and enjoy the festival...
Traveler: Chef Mao would like to treat you to a meal...
Wrench Wang: Huh? Oh, I remember Chef Mao did say something about treating us to a meal during Lantern Rite. I guess he was serious, hahaha!
Hammer Li: This is too good to be true! Please give Chef Mao my thanks...
Traveler: So what would you like to eat?
Hammer Li: I'm not going to ask for too much, I'd be more than satisfied with just a sumptuous bowl of *hot soup* and some *crisp bamboo shoots*.
Wrench Wang: I'm not picky, *anything with meat is good enough for me*. I'm not one for fine dining, so what do you suggest?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: I recommend *Triple-Layered Consommé*.
Hammer Li: I've heard storytellers say that it takes only one bite to finish all the soup of Triple-Layered Consommé. How 'bout something else?
Wrench Wang: When have you ever gone to listen to stories? And why didn't you bring me along?

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: I recommend *Come and Get It*.
Hammer Li: I've heard storytellers say that Come and Get It is an exquisite dish, but there's no bamboo shoots. How 'bout something else?
Wrench Wang: Since when do storytellers ever talk about recipes? I've never heard them do that before...

### Additional Talk 8

Wrench Wang: Hmm, so that won't be any good. What else can you recommend?

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: I recommend *Bamboo Shoot Soup*.
Hammer Li: That's a good one! I've heard a storyteller describe it once as a dish that's "simmered to perfection over a low flame, with a distinctive savory taste."
Wrench Wang: Sounds pretty good to me, let's get that one then.

### Additional Talk 10

Guanhai: *sigh* Here I am working while everyone else is out enjoying the festival...
Traveler: Chef Mao would like to treat you to a meal...
Guanhai: Chef Mao would like to treat me to a meal? Hmm, it would be nice to kick back with a good meal and enjoy the festivities.
Traveler: So what would you like to eat?
Guanhai: I really love the taste of *fish*. It would be great if it was *fish* paired with some special flavor — say, *sweet-and-sour*, perhaps...
Guanhai: I can't think of anything special off the top of my head. What would you recommend?

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: I recommend *Squirrel Fish*.
Guanhai: Oh right, that's the one! How could I forget Squirrel Fish!?
Guanhai: Sweet and sour flavor with a crispy texture. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I can't wait to taste more of Chef Mao's cuisine.

### Additional Talk 12

Traveler: I recommend *Black-Back Perch Stew*.
Guanhai: Ah yes, Wanmin Restaurant's signature dish. I've eaten it many times already, and it doesn't have that sweet and sour taste I'm hankering after... I think I'd prefer something else.

### Additional Talk 13

Guanhai: Hmm, can you recommend something else?

### Additional Talk 14

Traveler: I recommend *Crystal Shrimp*.
Guanhai: Hmm, there's no fish in that dish, is there? Besides, the flavor's too bland, I think I'd prefer something else.

### Additional Talk 15

Zhihua: As soon as I'm finished with work, I'll go release Xiao Lanterns with Qiming...
Traveler: Chef Mao would like to treat you to a meal...
Zhihua: You say Chef Mao wants to treat me? That's great!
Traveler: So what would you like to eat?
Zhihua: But I'm planning to invite Qiming to release Xiao Lanterns later, so I'd prefer *something without fish or meat*, and *something without a strong flavor*...
Zhihua: Maybe something like *a light pastry* would be best?
Zhihua: Do you have any recommendations?

### Additional Talk 16

Traveler: I recommend *Tianshu Meat*.
Zhihua: That dish is a little too oily...

### Additional Talk 17

Traveler: I recommend *Lotus Flower Crisp*.
Zhihua: Mm, that sounds good. It's nice and light and tastes great. That'll be perfect...
Zhihua: Alright, put me down for Lotus Flower Crisp, please.

### Additional Talk 18

Zhihua: How about something else... Do you have any other recommendations?

### Additional Talk 19

Traveler: I recommend *Grilled Tiger Fish*.
Zhihua: Grilled Tiger Fish is good and all... But the flavor is a little too strong for me and I'll smell like grilled fish for the rest of the day...
