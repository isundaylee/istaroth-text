Muli: Hello there, tall guest. Do you know how to fish?

## Talk

Traveler: Haven't fished much...
Muli: Then let's go fishing together! Fishing is one of the most interesting things in the world!

## Talk

Traveler: I'm an ace angler!
Muli: Really? In that case, do you... think it's possible to fish up jadeware?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Muli: Bye! I'm going to continue thinking about fishing!

## Talk

Traveler: Why would you even think that...
Muli: I love fishing, especially when it's with Qiongjiu!
Muli: But father says that someone must take over our family's jade business...
Muli: So it would be perfect if I could fish up some jadeware! Don't you think so too!?
Muli: Or maybe I'll ask Little Mao to learn how to make jadeware while I go fishing with Qiongjiu! That would be great too!
