Siger: Financial compensation... That's all they can offer!
Siger: Is this something that can be solved through paying money?

Traveler: What's going on?
Siger: I came all the way from Fontaine to have a serious and rigorous academic discussion with the researchers about the ancient books in my collection.
Siger: But as soon as my feet touched the shore, I was swarmed by researchers who made a huge mess of my books.
Siger: They said it was out of love for knowledge, but I saw that they were all port staff, and no one was reading the books earnestly!
Siger: They were flipping carelessly through my books while muttering, "no need to bother the great matra with these"...
Siger: My books are rare antiques! How dare they call them "these"? This is an outrage!
Siger: My books have now been devalued, and all they did was compensate me with money! How could I not be angry at them?
