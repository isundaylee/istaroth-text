# The Mysterious Letter


## Talk 1

Paimon: We haven't seen our Sumeru friends for a while now. Paimon wonders how they're doing...
Paimon: #Traveler, let's go to Sumeru City and catch up with them!

## Talk 2

Cyrus: Aarav, Aarav... Ah, there he is.
Aarav: #Mahamatra Cyno, Sir Cyrus. Ah, and Traveler and Paimon. It's been a while.
Black Screen Text: Cyno briefs Aarav on the case...
Cyno: ...As such, I'm inclined to believe that the culprit in this case is a student at the Akademiya. Somebody young, and strapped for cash.
Cyno: Oh, one last thing. I'd start your investigation by taking a look at the cafes in the city.
Paimon: Oh, of course! You think the culprit spilled their coffee on the letter, huh?
Cyno: They do look like coffee stains to me.
Cyno: Also, if I'm not mistaken, the letter is written on a type of scented paper that has aromatics added during the manufacturing process. The kind often provided as writing material for customers in cafes and taverns.
Cyrus: Ahh, of course... Yes, like they sell in the gift shops. I remember now, Zaha Hadi bought some a while back. She said she was going to use it as wrapping paper for a vase.
Aarav: Understood. I'll assemble a team to investigate the points of interest immediately.
Cyrus: You have my gratitude.
Cyno: One last thing: Send some matra to guard the entrances and exits of Sumeru City. And change into plain clothes — don't let them see you coming.
Aarav: Will do.
Paimon: Great thinking, Cyno! So... Where do we think the culprit's at right now?
Traveler: I doubt they'd go back to the cafe.
Paimon: Yeah... They've probably been lying low at home, waiting to see how Cyrus reacts...
Cyno: Hm, you're right, Paimon.
Paimon: Really? Which part?
Cyno: The culprit's approach.
Cyno: Whatever happens, they need this Mora. But just because they warned Professor Cyrus not to go to the matra doesn't mean they know what he'll do next. So like you said, they need to wait and see.
Cyno: And crucially, the culprit said they'd be watching the professor's every move.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, are you saying...
Paimon: Eek!
Cyno: Found you.
Urraca: Argh! Wh—What are you doing!?
Cyno: You wrote the threat letter.
Urraca: I—I don't know what you're talking about! What threat letter?
Cyno: I sensed someone was watching us from the shadows the moment we entered the House of Daena. You managed to stay relatively well hidden for someone reckless enough to threaten Professor Cyrus.
Cyno: There are a lot of people here, but we were looking specifically for Aarav. Whoever followed us the whole way was likely to be the culprit.
Urraca: I—I was just listening in, that's all! ...You know something big's going down when Mahamatra Cyno shows up! Right? So I got a little curious, what's the big deal?
Cyno: You smiled when Aarav left. I saw it as clear as day.
Urraca: Is smiling a crime now!?
Cyno: There are coffee stains on the letter. You mixed some coffee with water, gently smeared it onto the paper, then wiped it off with a wet cloth. All to create the impression that the letter was written at a cafe.
Cyno: Closing off the exits to the city doesn't affect you, because you already live here. And as long as the matra were focused on the cafes, you would be free from scrutiny.
Cyno: The cafe was a red herring all along. You had to be somewhere where you could monitor the professor's movements.
Urraca: You can't pin this on me! I haven't done anything!
Cyno: Really? Then why are you shaking like a leaf?
Cyno: The innocent have no reason to fear the matra. But you...
Cyno: Your heart's racing, and your eyelids are twitching. You're a terrible liar.
Urraca: ...I would never—
Cyno: Don't try anything, or you'll pay the price. Now, come with me.
Paimon: Well, that was over quickly. Cyno already caught the guy...
Cyrus: You're telling me! One minute I go out for a quick smoke, the next minute I see Aarav, already on his way back to meet up with Cyno.
Cyrus: *sigh*... Looked like a young guy, too. Couldn't have been much more than thirty. But after what he's done, I'm afraid he's ruined his whole future.
Cyno: Everyone, it's all over.
Paimon: Gosh, that was so fast!
Cyno: The culprit's name is Urraca. A sixteen-year-old student in the Rtawahist Darshan.
Cyrus: ...Huh!?
Paimon: Sixteen!? Cyrus thought he looked thirty-something...
Cyno: We checked his records. He's sixteen. A third-year student.
Cyrus: But... he looks so old...
Paimon: Yeah, seriously!
Cyrus: *sigh* Foolish child... He's too young for the criminal life. What the devil drove him down this path?
Aarav: We questioned the culprit regarding his motives. He, umm...
Cyrus: Oh, just spit it out. Nothing can surprise me at this point.
Aarav: Very well. It's our understanding that Urraca is a mediocre student who has been underperforming in his classes. He started taking extra tutoring to improve his grades, but developed a gambling habit around the same time and lost a lot of Mora.
Aarav: Down on his luck, he went to the tavern for a drink, and overheard some people chatting about Sir Cyrus's comfortable retirement. They mentioned that he's always arguing about his tomato plants with some old woman on the street...
Cyrus: "Some old woman on the street"? Goodness gracious, has that rascal attended a single one of his classes? That "old woman" is Kshahrewar's very own Professor Zaha Hadi! How can he not know who Zaha Hadi is?
Cyno: ...Is this going somewhere?
Cyrus: Oh! Right, yes, umm... So another thing — we don't just argue about tomato plants... And what are they trying to insinuate by "comfortable retirement"? A man grows a few vegetables, and suddenly he's living a life of luxury?
Cyno: Maybe it's more the fact that you have the time to grow vegetables in the first place.
Aarav: Urraca mentioned he'd heard a rumor, alleging that Sir Cyrus illegally obtained a large sum of money from the desert before retiring, and kept it for himself instead of reporting it to the Akademiya.
Aarav: Urraca believes this money to be the reason why Sir Cyrus hasn't kept up with any academic research or other projects since his retirement... And given your advanced age, he thought that you'd be an easy target to blackmail.
Cyrus: Oh, Urraca... I'm at a loss for words. I'm so angry I don't know where to start!
Cyno: People make up rumors all the time. I am quite confident that Professor Cyrus has never embezzled a Mora in his life.
Cyrus: Aarav, you'll have to find an excuse to interrogate Urraca again later. I need you to deliver a few firm fistfuls to him on my behalf.
Aarav: I completely understand how you feel, Sir Cyrus. But I'm afraid that course of action goes against the matra's principles.
Cyno: Professor, there's no need to be childish about this.
Cyrus: Oh come on, I was clearly joking.
Paimon: Uh, okay... Where does this go from here?
Cyno: The Akademiya will determine the appropriate disciplinary action against the student. And as for the individuals spreading rumors about the professor's obsession with tomatoes and some old woman on the street... There could be a slander case here. The matra will continue to investigate.
Cyrus: Who said I'm obsessed with some old woman on the street!? Mind your wording, or you'll start a whole new rumor!
Cyrus: ...You seem confused. Haha, don't you understand?
Cyrus: Urraca is just a young boy who made a very rash and very stupid decision based on some groundless rumor he heard. Besides, I didn't actually hand over any Mora to him. The whole thing sounds a lot worse than it is.
Cyrus: All it's cost me is a little reputational damage, that's all.
Cyno: Please rest assured, Professor, that the Akademiya will issue a fair and reasonable punishment.
Cyrus: Yes, I have no doubt about that.
Cyrus: But as a former educator, I'd still like to have a serious conversation with the boy's parents. The family lives in the city, yes?
Cyno: Correct.
Aarav: We looked into the family. Both parents are merchants, and they're often away on business. They've never taken much of an active role in their children's lives.
Cyrus: *sigh* What a mess...
Cyrus: You don't have to seal the evidence away yet, do you? I'd like to have that letter back for the time being, if possible. I'll need something concrete for when I talk to the family tonight.
Cyrus: We have to show them how serious this situation is!
Aarav: The relevant authorities have already reviewed the evidence and are now discussing Urraca's punishment. You can hold onto the letter for now — just make sure to return it within a couple of days.
Cyrus: Oh! So you'll be able to close the case in two days?
Cyno: Give or take. Cases like this are quick to resolve.
Cyrus: Very good. Well, thank you all for your help — perhaps we can all go for a meal together? My treat, of course.
Aarav: My apologies, Sir Cyrus, but I have a prior commitment. Enjoy the meal, everyone.
Cyrus: Ah, I see... well, that's a pity. But Cyno, you have to come. You found the culprit at record speed, and I owe you for that.
Cyrus: Ah — and isn't Tighnari in town at the moment? Bring him along too.
Paimon: Wait, you mean Tighnari's in the city?
Cyno: He is. Tighnari's master, Sir Naphis, called him and Collei to the Akademiya to help out on a project. They should be at Naphis's office at this hour.
Cyno: Though I must say, I'm surprised you're extending the invitation to Tighnari... Did you do something to offend Sir Naphis?
Cyrus: Don't be outrageous. Naphis offends me all the time — it's never the other way round.
Cyrus: #Anyway, hurry up and fetch Tighnari. I'll head over to the tavern with Traveler and Paimon. See you there.
Cyrus: Go on, now. Don't keep us waiting.

## Talk 3

Cyrus: Not to brag, but we never had problems like this at Rtawahist back when I was still teaching... And if you don't want to take my word for it, you can ask them.
Cyrus: They were students at the time, they'll tell you what it was like. Won't they?
Tighnari: I was out in the forest at least four days a week back then, thanks to a colossal workload from Master. It wrought havoc on my poor tail... So, I didn't exactly keep up to date with what was going on at the Akademiya.
Tighnari: Most of what I know, I heard from Cyno after the fact.
Cyno: Professor's become a lot more laid-back in his retirement. He used to be far stricter, and was especially known for being extremely principled.
Collei: Wow... It's hard enough to stay true to your principles as a normal person. I can't imagine doing that as a sage...
Cyrus: It's a pity Collei wasn't around at the time... I would have happily taken her on as a student.
Cyno: And then we'd have one more person who has to address Lisa as "upperclasswoman"...
Paimon: Really? Can't you just call her "Lisa"...? She seems to prefer it when people treat her like an older sister.
Cyrus: Oh, believe me... Back when she was a student, nothing made her happier than the younger students acknowledging her seniority.
Paimon: Whoa! More food! Are you sure about this? We don't wanna take advantage...
Cyrus: Hahaha, don't worry about it! Order whatever you like, and if it's not enough, order some more! After all your help today, treating you to dinner is the least I can do.
Kaveh: I thought I heard some familiar voices. Ah, and Sir Cyrus is here as well...
Cyrus: Oh, Kaveh! It's been a while. Zaha Hadi was talking about you last month. How have you been?
Kaveh: I've been alright, thank you. You're looking very well, Sir. I'm glad to see it.
Cyrus: Have you eaten yet? Care to join us?
Kaveh: That's awfully kind of you, but I had a late lunch, so I'm not really hungry just yet. I'll have dinner a little bit later tonight.
Kaveh: I just came to Lambad's to buy some wine, and when I heard some voices I recognized, I thought I'd come and say hello.
Kaveh: So what's the occasion, anyway? Some sort of celebration?
Cyrus: Ugh, consolation, more like... You wouldn't believe the day I've had...
Black Screen Text: Cyrus vividly recounts the day's events for the benefit of those who weren't there to witness it...
Tighnari: ...Sounds like things have really gone downhill since I was there. In my whole time as a student, I've never heard of anything remotely like that.
Collei: I can't believe how young the guy is... *sigh* What are his parents going to think?
Cyrus: Young people are always more susceptible to making rash and ill-advised decisions. Their minds are still developing. It's just an unfortunate fact of life.
Cyrus: But still! This boy has some nerve, just look at what he wrote! It makes my blood boil!
Kaveh: ...Wow, yeah... Geez...
Collei: "I will always be watching you and all of your secrets..." And then he just followed you into the House of Daena?
Cyrus: If this were my son, oh, he'd get the scolding of a lifetime! Hmph!
Cyno: Luckily, I'm also an extremely principled person.
Lambad: Kaveh! Your order's ready, Sir!
Kaveh: Ah, coming!
Kaveh: I'll have to get going. Have a nice evening, everyone — I'll catch you all another time.
Paimon: Okay, bye-bye!
Kaveh: Here I am. The coffee beans are in here too?
Lambad: Yep, it's all there.
Cyrus: I'll stop babbling away now. Let's eat before the food gets cold.
Black Screen Text: You were all busy chatting that you almost forgot about the food.
Black Screen Text: Luckily, it's still hot, and you enjoy a delicious celebratory meal after a crazy day.

## Talk 4

Cyrus: Phew...
Paimon: Too tasty... Paimon's belly is about to explode...
Cyrus: Haha, mine too. I'll have to walk home to burn some of it off.
Collei: Thanks for dinner, Sir Cyrus! Master Tighnari and I will bring you some home-made herbal tea next time. It'll do wonders for your sleep.
Cyrus: Well, I look forward to that! In fact, could I trouble you to bring a little extra, for the other old folks on my street? I'll be the envy of the neighborhood!
Tighnari: No problem at all. I'll pack some up and bring it over.
Traveler: Thank you for treating us!
Cyrus: Ah. I'll see you all later! I'd better head home now and tend to the crops.
Cyno: Good night, Professor. Don't let those tomatoes keep you up too late.
Cyrus: Hey! My tomatoes are serious business! I am not about to be beaten by Zaha Hadi!
Cyrus: Anyway, I'll be leaving now. Don't stay up too late now, children. I bid you all a good night.
Paimon: Take care! Have a safe trip home!
Cyno: Alright. Now, we finally have some "us time."
Paimon: What do you mean, "us time"?
Cyno: Well, I was talking with Tighnari and Collei, and since we all have some free time, we thought we could all go camping together. Think of it as our way of welcoming you back to Sumeru.
Paimon: Camping!? That sounds fun, Paimon's in!
Traveler: Yeah, that sounds really fun!
Collei: Right? It's been so long since we did something fun together. I can't wait!
Tighnari: Everyone, let's meet tomorrow afternoon at the riverbank to the southeast of Gandharva Ville.
Tighnari: No need to bring anything — we've already packed everything for the trip. Just bring your delightful selves and prepare to have some fun.
Paimon: You got it! We'll be there!
Cyno: Great. Then we'll see you tomorrow.
Traveler: Time to show off my tent-pitching skills!
Collei: Wait, no, that's my job! Don't take it away from me... Why don't you and Paimon help out Master, or Cyno?
Collei: You don't have to play the hero when you're out with us! This is your chance to just... y'know, laze around and switch off for a bit.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Woah, the Akademiya sure is busy during the day!
Paimon: Hmm... But where should we go looking for people that we know...
Cyno: #Traveler, Paimon.
Paimon: Cyno! It's been so long since we last saw you!
Traveler: Really feels like it's been forever.
Cyno: Welcome back to Sumeru City. I'm delighted to meet you again.
Cyno: So. What brings you back here?
Paimon: Oh, nothing in particular. Paimon just... saw a really big mushroom out on the road the other day, and suddenly missed all our friends in Sumeru.
Cyno: Funnily enough, we were reminiscing about you recently, too. It was at a group dinner. I look forward to hearing about your travels — something tells me we must have a lot to catch up on.
Paimon: Really, you were thinking of us too? What a coincidence!
Cyno: Indeed... Or as I call it, the Biryani factor.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: ...
Cyno: ...You really want me to say the rest? Heh, okay. It's always rice to meat stew again.
Paimon: Oh... darn, he said it!
Traveler: I win the bet, Paimon! Time to pay up.
Cyno: You like that one, huh? You must, if you remember it after all this time. Admit the truth! You have long been in awe of my razor-sharp wit.
Paimon: Alright, alright, here's your five hundred Mora...
Traveler: Thanks, Cyno. Feels good to hit the jackpot.
Cyno: You're exaggerating. It's only five hundred Mora.
Paimon: Hey, five hundred Mora is still a lot of snacks to Paimon!
Cyno: Alright, I'll treat you to some desserts later.
Cyno: Anyway, I'm actually investigating a case right now. My mind is focused on work, which is why I didn't complete the joke at first.
Paimon: A case? What happened?
Cyno: Nothing major. But after finding out who was involved, I decided, on reflection, to handle this one myself.
Paimon: Need any help? We only came here to hang out, so we've got the time. You may as well take us with you, and then when you're done, we can, uh... y'know! *nom* *nom*
Cyno: Such enthusiasm. Are you worried I'll forget about treating you to some sweets if you're not around to remind me?
Paimon: Whaaat? Nooo! ...Alright, was it really that obvious?
Cyno: Obvious enough. Still, it's a fine idea. You are the heroes of Sumeru. It makes perfect sense to work together.
Cyno: Alright. Follow me.
Traveler: Thanks, Paimon. Feels good to hit the jackpot.
Paimon: Paimon's never making a bet again... Paimon really thought Cyno would be able to hold back on the jokes... They say people can change, but maybe that's just wishful thinking.
Cyno: Ah, so this was technically my fault? In that case, I'll treat you to some sweets later.
Traveler: You look like you've been keeping well.
Cyno: As do you. You don't seem weary at all from your travels — if anything, you seem stronger.
