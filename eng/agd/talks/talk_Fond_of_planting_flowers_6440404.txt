Traveler: Fond of planting flowers?
Raef: Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
Raef: She's never been the healthy sort, so she's always at home resting and can't come out often... But she always looks way better when she has some plants for company.
Raef: I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
Raef: Many times, those flowers that do get sent over don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
Raef: That's why I ask my fellow workers to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.
