# Into Eternal Night


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, you don't have to drag Paimon. You're pulling too hard!
Mualani: Looks like we made it. This is the Night Kingdom.
Iansan: It looks so different from what I imagined in the stories.
Traveler: There's Abyssal energy everywhere...
Mualani: That overflow of energy is probably what trapped Kachina here in the first place.
Chasca: From this point forward, everything we know about the real world no longer applies. Anything can happen here.
Paimon: Paimon's more worried about how we're gonna make it out... We obviously can't go back the way we came.
Chasca: Do you see that patch of light on the ground? It's shining down from that fissure in the sky.
Paimon: Oh, yeah, right in front of us. So, that's coming from up there... Whoa, it's so high up! Did we really fall that far down!?
Chasca: Just like I said — our real-world knowledge doesn't apply here. We fell all this way, yet came out completely unscathed.
Chasca: If this was the real world, we'd have to climb our way back up to the entrance. But, here, all we have to do is stand underneath the light and offer a prayer.
Paimon: Th—That's it?
Traveler: Don't try it now.
Paimon: Right, right... We've still got a job to do.
Mualani: So that means all we need to do is find Kachina and bring her to this location.
Chasca: Exactly. This light is streaming in from the real world. It's a link between the two realms.
Iansan: Hmm, the terrain looks difficult to navigate, and the visibility's not great, either. How are we supposed to find Kachina in these conditions?
Paimon: Yeah, these floating black things don't look super friendly, either.
Mallko: Those are all manifestations of Abyssal power. Be careful.
Paimon: G—Ghost! A talking ghost!
Mallko: Calm down, I'm here to help. You're the ones who helped Vichama, right?
Traveler: Wait, does that mean you're...
Mallko: Yes. I'm Vichama's friend, Mallko. I was completely lost to this realm until I sensed a mysterious power calling out to me.
Mallko: It's like it was seeking me out, attempting to reassemble the pieces of who I used to be. Of course, it could only do so much...
Mallko: I'm sorry I can only appear before you in this imperfect form.
Chasca: No, we should be the ones apologizing. If the Spiritspeaker Stone hadn't become corrupted by the Abyss, we could've done much more.
Chasca: But, we had to destroy it, otherwise Vichama and his tribe would have been in danger.
Mallko: Of course. Thank you for protecting him. I never imagined that, even after all these years, he'd still take such a risk for me...
Mallko: Under the power of the Stone, it felt like our souls were connected.
Mallko: Turns out even our regrets were exactly the same...
Mualani: Whether in triumph or death, you want your best friend by your side.
Mallko: Exactly. That may not be in the cards for us, but... It's not too late for you.
Mallko: You're looking for a young girl from the Children of Echoes, right? She's being chased by an embodiment of Abyssal power.
Mallko: I'd like to help her while I'm still in this form, so follow me.
Mallko: Be careful. This place has been severely corroded by the Abyss.
Traveler: Don't try to run away.
Paimon: You really think that little of Paimon? That's not even why Paimon asked!

## Talk 2

Whisper: Journey... Lies...
Paimon: Ahhh, Paimon just heard it too!
Paimon: Let's keep going! Paimon wants to get out of this place!

## Talk 3

Mualani: Does your head still hurt? Let me help you walk.
Kachina: I'm fine, I'm fine! You should know I'm made of stronger stuff than that!

## Talk 4

Kachina: You're here, you're finally here! *sobbing* Thank you so much...
Kachina: That monster can appear from anywhere... It almost caught me a bunch of times.
Kachina: The Wayob's power helped keep me hidden, so I just tried to stay out of sight until you got here.
Mualani: Attagirl! You did so well! And most importantly, you weren't hurt!
Paimon: Should we start heading back, then?
Kachina: Actually, I have a request. Will you come visit the Wayob with me?
Kachina: I can't exactly put it into words, but something's wrong with the Ode of Resurrection, and I know it has something to do with the contamination from the Abyss.
Iansan: That was the Pyro Archon's theory as well. Everything we've seen here certainly seems to back it up.
Mallko: In the Night Kingdom, there are six main totem poles, representing the Wayob of each tribe.
Mallko: You can think of them like the body of each Wayob. Additional totem poles, like the ones around here, serve as proxies to which the Wayob can extend their consciousness.
Mallko: There are countless proxies scattered around the Night Kingdom. Through them, the Wayob can extend their consciousness over the entire realm and track down souls no matter where they roam.
Mallko: But if a proxy were to become severely contaminated, then a soul could become lost within the Night Kingdom.
Iansan: Judging by the current situation, I don't think we're dealing with just one contaminated proxy. Even if we could drive back the Abyssal power from one of them, that probably wouldn't even put a dent in the problem.
Kachina: Still, we can't just leave the Wayob to suffer. It's protected me this whole time...
Traveler: Saving one is better than saving none at all.
Chasca: I agree. We might even manage to draw out the monster that's been hunting Kachina.
Chasca: Getting rid of the monster might help slow down the deterioration of the Night Kingdom.
Kachina: Ugh, ugh... Argh...
Mualani: Kachina? What's wrong?
Kachina: N—Nothing, just a headache, and that voice again... telling me to abandon the Wayob and leave this place...
Paimon: Maybe we really should leave... Kachina's already been here for too long.
Kachina: No, I... I'm fine. I don't plan on listening to that nonsense. I can hold on.
Traveler: Where's the totem pole?
Kachina: Just up ahead. I'll lead the way. Besides, I can still fight, so please... help me out a little longer.
Mualani: Listen to me, Kachina. We'll come with you, but that's because we want to help the Wayob, not because we have something to prove.
Mualani: You don't have anything to prove, either. It's okay if you reach your limit. We'll be there for you.
Iansan: Alright, the sooner we get this done the better.
Chasca: We've already come all this way, so we might as well try to get to the bottom of this.
Kachina: Let's go. This way.
Mallko: I'll stay here and try to stall the Abyss monster.
Mualani: All by yourself!? That's too dangerous!
Mallko: It's alright. I may not be as strong as that monster, but I'm definitely more familiar with the area. Besides...
Mallko: I don't have much time left. If you're anything like my friend, I'm sure you're not particularly fond of goodbyes.
Mallko: So, go. Achieve your goal, and return to the world where you belong.
Iansan: Thank you for everything.
Mualani: You're a true hero.
Mallko: Hahaha, thank you.
Mallko: "No one fights alone."

## Talk 5

Kachina: Wayob? Wayob! I'm back! My friends and I are here to heal you!
Kachina: Wayob! Can you hear me? Wayob!
"The Great Spirit of This Land": ...
Mualani: So, we were right. The contamination is already too severe. It's preventing the Wayob from answering our calls.
Mualani: Alright, get ready, everyone. Time to purge the Abyssal energy from this place.
Traveler: I'll help, too.
Chasca: Careful. We've got company.
Iansan: Already!?
Comonqui: You really think that puny soul could slow me down... Courage in the face of futility is pure folly.
Comonqui: He tried to get in my way, so I disposed of him.
Paimon: You... You killed Mallko!?
Comonqui: He would have dispersed with or without me. Rather than worrying about him, I would urge you to focus on yourself.
Comonqui: You may have defeated others of my kind in the past, but underestimate me now, and it will be to your peril.
Traveler: Are you the one behind all of this?
Comonqui: No. The power of the Abyss is intoxicating. The destruction it seeks captivates like a masterful work of art. I strive only for the opportunity to see it up close.
Comonqui: I thought this naive little girl was an exception, but it turns out... humanity is full of lambs willing to offer themselves up to the slaughter.
Comonqui: That is the tragedy of your short lives. You understand nothing of all-encompassing power.
Comonqui: Ancient Names? Pride? Friendship? All empty ideas invented to give you a false sense of self-worth. They possess no power at all.
Comonqui: The Pyro Archon created those grandiose ideals out of pure selfishness! Anything to avoid sharing power. Anything to avoid handing over the Primordial gift to ordinary people like you.
Comonqui: Don't believe me? Then ask yourself — why is the Pyro Archon strong beyond measure, while you, Kachina, remain so pathetically weak?
Kachina: I... I...
Mualani: Kachina.
Mualani: Give me your hand.
Mualani: Feel that? I'm right here next to you.
Kachina: Thanks, Mualani. You're right... I have nothing to fear.
Kachina: Because I'm not alone anymore.
Comonqui: Huh?
Mualani: You're right... Maybe comforting ideals don't have any power.
Mualani: But, you also couldn't be more wrong. You've never had to work for your own strength, so you will never understand the true source of our power.
Comonqui: What!?
Mualani: The courage we have to stand before you and not back down... It comes from our friendship.
Mualani: The power lies not in the ideal itself...
Mualani: But in our commitment to upholding that ideal, and in our decision to stand together and fight!
Paimon: Well said!
Mualani: Let's go, Kachina. It shouldn't take more than two of us to handle an enemy like this.
Kachina: Sorry in advance, but you... you deserve what's coming to you!
Mualani: There aren't many in Natlan who can beat us when we're together. It's time he got a taste of that kind of power.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Whoa! Wh—What's going on? An earthquake!?
Iansan: We're out of time.
Mualani: It's the power of the Abyss! Quick, we need to run!
Paimon: It's a Seelie! The Seelie opened the way for us!

## Talk 7

Kachina: We won! We actually won!
Traveler: Nice job!
Iansan: That's what he gets for underestimating you two.
Mualani: Fantastic work, Kachina! Absolutely fantastic!
Mualani: This makes me so... unbelievably happy...
Kachina: I'm happy too, Mualani. Together, we really are unstoppable, hehe!
Mualani: Huh? Wh—What's happening?
Mualani: My Ancient Name... is glowing? But, I thought I didn't bring it with me...
Chasca: It's probably a projection from the real world, but that doesn't explain why it's glowing all of a sudden...
Iansan: Wait, does that mean you're...!?
Tupac: That was a bold move... diving head first into the fire to save your friend, especially in a place so overrun with Abyssal corruption.
Tupac: Still, seeing you pull it off was really something.
Tupac: Everything you said was exactly right. As isolated individuals, we stand no chance against the power of the Abyss.
Tupac: It took years' worth of scars and lots of unnecessary suffering for me to understand that for myself.
Tupac: The Pyro Archon's plan will unite us as one. Everyone has a part to play.
Tupac: Only then will we have the power to defeat the strongest of foes.
Mualani: Wh—Who are you...?
Tupac: Tupac, a warrior from the People of the Springs. I fought against the Abyss during the invasion five hundred years ago.
Mualani: I've heard that name before! You were the "Giant" who saved all of Natlan!
Tupac: Since you were able to awaken my words from your Ancient Name, that means you've fully embodied the aspirations of the Wayob.
Tupac: Under the Name "Umoja," you shall uni{RUBY#[D]Umoja}te the tribes and save Natlan from its impending doom.
Mualani: M—Me...?
Tupac: "As long as blood still runs through your veins, even the tiniest spark of steel against stone can ignite a flame."
Tupac: "Its blaze will become one with our vision for Natlan."
Tupac: "Even amid everlasting darkness, our bonds remain eternal."
Mualani: Aaagh!!!
Kachina: Wh—What's wrong, Mualani?
Mualani: So many memories... My brain was just flooded with everything he once knew...
Mualani: So that's what happened...
Paimon: What do you mean? Did you just figure something out?
Mualani: Five hundred years ago, they foresaw the very crisis we're facing now. Efforts to save Natlan started all the way back then...
Iansan: We can go over the details once we get back. We shouldn't linger here longer than we have to.
Traveler: Does that mean... you already know about this whole thing?
Iansan: I know bits and pieces, but I had no idea Mualani was also part of the plan.
Kachina: This sounds like something that's going to need a lot of explaining. Let's focus on saving the Wayob first.
Kachina: Okay, that should be enough! Wayob... Wayob? Can you hear me?
"The Great Spirit of This Land": I hear your voice, Kachina... my dear child.
Kachina: Great... Well then, I'm afraid it's time to say goodbye. I just wanted to make sure you were okay before we leave, but we can't afford to stay here any longer.
Kachina: I was going to ask why you bestowed an Ancient Name upon someone like me, but it's okay...
Kachina: I'll keep searching within myself for the answer. I'll never stop trying to improve my strength. One day, I'll live up to the hero you saw in me!
"The Great Spirit of This Land": You are already an outstanding child in my eyes, Kachina, no matter what happens.
Kachina: Huh?
"The Great Spirit of This Land": You are all my most beloved children. It has always been my honor to protect and nurture you.
"The Great Spirit of This Land": Your Ancient Name is just that... a name. Much like your parents chose to name you, "Kachina," I also gave you a name, but it need not define you.
"The Great Spirit of This Land": Focus on who you want to be. You are already worthy of your Name. Now, you need only devote yourself to becoming a better "you."
"The Great Spirit of This Land": The story of your Ancient Name is for you to continue. Just like your parents, my love for you will never change... no matter what the future holds.
Kachina: ...
Kachina: *sobbing* Thank you, Wayob...
"The Great Spirit of This Land": It gladdens me to see the Pyro Archon's plan move another step towards completion, but it is time for you to leave this place. The situation here is getting worse.
"The Great Spirit of This Land": Go now, my children. Save Natlan on behalf of all you hold dear.
Mualani: I know we've never met before, Wayob, but I just want to say...
Mualani: Thank you for encouraging Kachina... It was exactly what she needed to hear.
Traveler: Turns out, he wasn't any stronger than the ones we've fought in the past.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whoa! Wh—What's going on? An earthquake!?
Iansan: We're out of time.
Mualani: It's the power of the Abyss! Quick, we need to run!
Paimon: It's a Seelie! The Seelie opened the way for us!

## Talk 9

Kachina: We're... back?
Iansan: The Pyro Archon saved us.
Paimon: But, she's not here...
Traveler: How did she regain her strength?
Paimon: Yeah... Didn't she say she used it all up?
Iansan: She's still in the Speaker's Chamber. What we saw in the Night Kingdom was just her consciousness.
Paimon: So you're saying... Her consciousness did all that!?
Iansan: ...Every great display of power comes at a price.
Kachina: *coughing*
Mualani: You must feel terrible, Kachina... Just hold on, we'll get you to a doctor soon.
Mualani: Let's get back to the Stadium. The Pyro Archon said she'd have a doctor waiting for us.
Chasca: I recommend getting a full check-up, just to make sure no damage gets left behind.
Paimon: #Paimon feels okay! What about you, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm completely fine.
Paimon: Right, you always seem to do pretty well against the Abyss.
Iansan: Let's get going. We need to share what we learned in the Night Kingdom, as well.
Paimon: Right! The Wayob mentioned something about the Pyro Archon's plan. What is it, exactly?
Iansan: I'll let her explain everything. We're all a part of the plan now.
Iansan: Every move we make from here on out will decide Natlan's ultimate fate.
