Traveler: What happened?
Tirda: It's because I was born with a fear of heights.
Tirda: That's pretty much the worst curse you can get as a reserve member of the Qucusaur Riders.
Tirda: Knowing that, it's also no surprise that I keep failing the Rider prep exams...

Traveler: That's a right shame...
Tirda: Yeah. But even if you weren't born with a fear of heights like me, getting through the Exams is still no walk in the park.
Tirda: Those who couldn't pass, like me, are called the "Wingless." Many of us ended up leaving the Flower-Feather Clan.
Tirda: Some Wingless are not adept at flying, but are otherwise very capable at fighting. They often find permanent work as warriors in the other tribes.
Tirda: I'm not that strong, though, so the only choice left to me was to work as a singer in this restaurant...

Traveler: Heroes tend to get a chance to show their stuff.
Tirda: By that, do you mean that my singing techniques will come in useful?
Tirda: Maybe you're right. I suppose the ability to help everyone feel relaxed and happy is a gift in its own right...
Tirda: Thanks for saying that, I feel much better. Here, have some flowers. Thank you — you have no idea what a relief it was to hear your words.
