# ...What Do Adventurers Do Again?


## Talk 1

Lan: Was there anything else?
Traveler: Have you found that sword of yours?
Lan: ...Huh, to think you still remember that. Unfortunately, no. I still don't have the foggiest idea where it might be.
Lan: It seems I'm still at square one, waiting for things to happen.
Lan: If anything related to that matter crops up, I might come looking for you — When that happens, I'll be counting on you.

## Talk 2

Tiantian: A—Are you an adventurer? Are you here to accept commissions?
Tiantian: Uh, please... wait a moment, let me see what I have here... "Speed Glider," "Outdoor Survival Experience Guide," "Free Climbing Instructor Wanted..."
Traveler: That doesn't sound like the Adventurers' Guild...
Tiantian: I know, and Lan says so too! But all the adventures I've read about in books were something like this...
Tiantian: If I don't give out these commissions, what should I give out, then...
Traveler: Something like "beat up monsters," perhaps?
Tiantian: I—Isn't that dangerous? I mean, there are a lot of them around Lisha, and they are a threat to passers-by.
Tiantian: But normal people don't stand a chance against them. They might even get hurt...
Traveler: Well then, leave it to me.
Tiantian: Can you really? Well.. Alright then, I'll leave it in your hands. I'll go back and discuss appropriate payment for your services with Lan.
Traveler: Adventurers are anything but ordinary.
Tiantian: Is that so... W—Well then, I'll let you handle it. I'll discuss your payment with Lan later.

## Talk 3

Tiantian: Do all adventurers do these dangerous things?
Tiantian: But what if they get injured...

## Talk 4

Tiantian: Eh? You're back already? Have you completed the commission?
Traveler: Done, and done!
Tiantian: That's... really impressive. I went back to the Guild to reorganize our commissions based on the one I gave you.
Tiantian: There was a whole mountain of commissions related to defeating monsters. So adventurers are supposed to do this sort of thing all the time...
Tiantian: But other than monsters, there've been reports that say that Treasure Hoarders have been seen along the roads.
Tiantian: Is this really also something the Adventurers' Guild should do? It feels like it falls under the job scope of the Millelith...
Traveler: We can do it.
Tiantian: Huh. Adventurers can really do anything, it seems.
Tiantian: Well then, I will prepare adequate compensation for you — so please take this commission, too!
Paimon: What, another one already? We haven't gotten our...
Tiantian: There'll be further compensation! I've already discussed this with Lan. So as long as you complete the next commission, you'll receive further payment.
Traveler: Well, that sounds more like it.
Tiantian: I'll be counting on you, then.
Tiantian: Well, that's two commissions down.
Tiantian: The secret method Lan taught me to "get adventurers to take commissions gladly" really works...
Traveler: If the money's good...
Tiantian: Adventurers really are impressive... It seems like you can do almost anything.

Tiantian: Have you finished the commissions?
Traveler: You bet I have.
Tiantian: Wow... So this is the strength of an adventurer.
Tiantian: Well, um, if you don't mind, could you answer some of my questions about adventurers and commissions?
Tiantian: Other than defeating monsters, what other commissions do adventurers take?
Traveler: We also help people fix carts and houses.
Tiantian: Whoa, doesn't that just mean that you adventurers do everything? I never knew.
Tiantian: Thank you! I'll make note of it for sure... Ah yes, right. This is your repayment, please take it. It's as generous as can be, you know!
Tiantian: Next time you're here to take commissions from me, I'll make sure to give you the best ones!
Traveler: We help people pick flowers and catch fish.
Traveler: We send takeout and play with children.
