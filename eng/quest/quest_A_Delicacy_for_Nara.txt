# A Delicacy for Nara


## Talk 1

Arapacati: Oh! If it isn't the Golden Nara! Alas...
Arama: #Arapacati not afraid. Nara {NICKNAME} is good Nara, just like the Nara in the stories. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon have helped us a lot.
Arapacati: #Okay, Arapacati not afraid. Arapacati trusts Arama, and the grass, leaves, and seeds. All say you're a good Nara. Hello, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Paimon: Hello, Arapacati!
Traveler: Actually... I'm bad.
Paimon: Hey! Don't make that kind of joke!
Arapacati: You good. Arapacati knows.
Arapacati: #Lots of winds bring lots of small seeds. They come to Vanarana with Nara. They say Nara {NICKNAME} is nice.
Paimon: Arama said something like that too! Speaking of which, seeds brought by winds... You mean like dandelion seeds?
Traveler: Or Windwheel Aster seeds?
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME} is going to help Arana to form a Bija. So, we will prepare for Festival Utsava together.
Arapacati: Oh, Festival Utsava...
Arama: Arapacati looks strange. Is anything troubling you?
Arapacati: Arapacati's big brothers have not returned to Vanarana. We siblings can't celebrate Festival Utsava together if they don't return...
Arama: I haven't seen Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala in Vanarana for a very long time either. Never seen them after that incident.
Paimon: A very long time... How long is that?
Arapacati: Many, many moons ago, when the seedlings had just sprouted. But now they are already big trees, big enough to keep the rain off Aranara! It's seven Arapacatis tall!
Paimon: From seedlings to trees! Wow! That's a really long time! Are your brothers missing, Arapacati?
Arapacati: Missing? Is that a type of seed?
Arama: Ooh! So Nara seeds are called Missing? Amazing!
Arapacati: #Nara are amazing! Nara {NICKNAME} must have many Missings.
Paimon: Uh, that's not what we mean...
Traveler: It means you don't know where they are.
Arapacati: Oh, not like that. Arapacati knows where Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala are. Brothers not missing.
Arapacati: They have been training at Vanarana for a long, long time. Cooking training.
Paimon: Oh, cooking training. Paimon gets it...
Traveler: Sounds like something Paimon would be interested in...
Paimon: #Hmm! Paimon is more interested in {NICKNAME}'s cooking training!
Paimon: So, what is this cooking training exactly...
Arama: It happened in the last Festival Utsava. Nara made lots of food for Aranara to try.
Arapacati: So, to make food for Nara in return in this Festival Utsava, Arachatora and the others have been taking cooking training.
Paimon: Paimon can't wait any longer for this Festival Utsava!
Traveler: But that's Aranara's food...
Paimon: Delicious food is the common language of all living creatures! It'll be fine!
Paimon: But Arapacati, since you know where they are, why don't you search for them yourself?
Arapacati: The magnificent Festival Utsava is about to begin. Arapacati has lots to prepare. No time to search for them.
Arapacati: They left Vanarana for cooking training to prepare for Festival Utsava. But they don't know Festival Utsava is about to start! Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala stupid.
Paimon: #Then leave it to us! We'll be going with Arama to find the Aranara in the forest and prepare for Festival Utsava anyway. Isn't that right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Paimon: But how will we find Arachatora, Ara... What were the other names again?
Arapacati: Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala.
Paimon: Ugh! Arana, Arama, Araja, Arapacati... Aranara names are so hard to remember!
Arama: Paimon, don't say that about Aranara names. You're gonna make the Aranara sad.
Paimon: Okay, okay. So, how do we find them?
Arama: They used to do cooking training in Vanarana. But they made lots of smoke, so Arapacati kicked them out.
Arapacati: Everyone was so scared then. Some Aranara even hibernated. Luckily, Arama was brave and punished the smoke. Arapacati was furious and made them leave.
Arapacati: So, you should be able to find them in the forest by looking for <color=#00E1FFFF>the rising pillars of smoke</color>, I think.
Paimon: So you kicked them out!
Arapacati: Yes. Did I make a mistake?
Paimon: #Uh, not really... Anyway, {NICKNAME}, let's get going!
Arapacati: Oh, right. One more thing. If my brothers are acting strange, go splat them with <color=#00E1FFFF>the power of Dendro</color>.
Arapacati: In the past, they created lots and lots of smoke. Filled all of Vanarana with smoke. They were afraid too and ran around everywhere. Sometimes they also became like that if they touched strange mushrooms.
Arapacati: But Aranara are spirits of the forest. So, we can recover and regain our senses by absorbing <color=#00E1FFFF>the power of Dendro</color>.
Paimon: #Paimon gets it now. By that logic, {NICKNAME} recovers after eating Sweet Madame, so {NICKNAME} must be a Sweet Madame spirit. Yes! This makes perfect sense.
Traveler: ?
Arama: ?
Arapacati: ?
Paimon: ...Aaaanyway, let's go!
Arama: #Good luck, Nara {NICKNAME}! Good luck, Paimon!
Traveler: Yeah, yeah, let's go.
Traveler: Sure.
Traveler: Can't wait!
Traveler: I know what that feels like...
Arapacati: #Nara {NICKNAME} understands how I feel?
Paimon: #Yeah, {NICKNAME} has a lost {F#brother}{M#sister} too...
Arapacati: #Oh. Nara {NICKNAME}, is your {F#brother}{M#sister} also doing cooking training?
Paimon: Huh? Paimon thinks there's been a misunderstanding... Missing means you don't know where something has gone!
Arapacati: Oh, not that. Arapacati knows big brothers not missing. They go for training outside Vanarana for a long, long time. Cooking training.
Traveler: Or maybe pinecones?
Traveler: Did the winds bring the seeds of those stories...?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: Hello.

## Talk 2

Arapacati: ...So difficult to talk to Nara, and they are so tall.
Traveler: Hello.
Arapacati: #Eek! It's Nara {NICKNAME}...
Arapacati: Arapacati not scared. Brothers are very brave, so they definitely not scared too.
Arapacati: You should find them if you move towards <color=#00E1FFFF>the pillars of smoke</color>. If they are acting strange, go splat them with <color=#00E1FFFF>the power of Dendro</color>.

## Talk 3

Arapacati: Arapacati is sooo mad! Argh! More mad than mad!
Arapacati: Forest is very dangerous as Marana is rampant there. When they left, Arapacati reminded brothers to work together...
Arapacati: But you started arguing right after leaving. Arachatora, you even ate strange thing.
Arachatora: *sob*
Arapacati: Arapacati has decided. Arachatora not allowed to pick mushrooms until Sunsettias have ripened ten times.
Arachatora: Noooo... *sob*
Araphala: Exactly! What would we do if he brought back bad spores and mushroom monsters grew here?
Arapacati: Araphala, you too! You went so far away from Vanarana to collect fruits. There are many bad things over there! Araja told us about it especially!
Araphala: *sob*
Arapas: That's right. Fruits need to drink water and Aranara need to drink water, so water is the best.
Arapacati: Arapas, of all places, you had to go to the Varuna Contraption. Don't you know that even Nara Varuna said the water of Vanarana is the most delicious?
Arapas: *sob*
Arasaka: Y—You see, only the "taste of happiness" can bring happiness to our little sister.
Arapacati: #Arasaka, I heard you caused a lot of trouble for Nara {NICKNAME} because of your "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: E—Everything I did was for the "Supreme Delicacy"...
Arapacati: The purpose of making the "Supreme Delicacy" is to show the fruits of the "cooking training". Alas, what's the point of the training if you could only complete it with someone else's help?
Arapacati: Arapacati thinks Arasaka needs to reflect on himself the most.
Arasaka: *sob*
Paimon: Arapacati! We're here!
Arapacati: Oh, it's you two.
Arapacati: #Nara {NICKNAME} shared Arapacati's trouble with Paimon and solved the problem at its source...
Arapacati: Arapacati no longer needs to worry about brothers missing Festival Utsava or being in danger outside. It's all thanks to you.
Arapacati: Arapacati and brothers are all thankful.
Paimon: That's great!
Paimon: But there's something Paimon has always been curious about...
Traveler: Who is this Nara Varuna?
Arapacati: #{F#He}{M#She} is our friend, a friend of Vanarana.
Arapacati: #A friend of Aranara from a long, long time ago. A Golden Nara just like Nara {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Huh. But Paimon's still got another question for you...
Traveler: Is it about her brothers?
Paimon: Yes. Arapacati, which one of them is your biggest brother, and which one's the smallest?
Arapacati: Hmm? The biggest and the smallest?
Traveler: Their ages...
Arapacati: Ages... Ah, Arapacati understands. Just like tree rings. Hmm, the children of the forest aren't distinguished by age.
Paimon: Huh? Then why are they your brothers and why are you their younger sister?
Arapacati: #Oh, this. We once had a Nara friend. Nara Varuna. {F#He}{M#She} said {F#he}{M#she} had a "{F#sister}{M#brother}."
Arapacati: #When Arapacati and brothers listened to {F#him}{M#her} talk about the "{F#sister}{M#brother}," Nara Varuna looked happy and sad at the same time.
Arapacati: That's how we understood. To an "older brother," a "younger sister" is an important Nara. To a "younger sister," an "older brother" is an important Nara.
Arapacati: We thought it was great, so Arapacati and brothers decided to become brothers and sister. Nara Varuna said this was great. We should cherish our family.
Traveler: That's right, we must cherish our family.
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: There's one more thing Paimon's been wondering... Do Aranara need to eat?
Arapacati: Humans cook ingredients into food, and the children of the forest can also make ingredients into food.
Arapacati: Nara Varuna taught us how Nara eat. That's why Arapacati and brothers started doing cooking training...
Paimon: Okay, but that's certainly unusual...
Traveler: It's like you're playing a game...
Arapacati: Arapacati and brothers are very serious because Nara Varuna said that to be able to share food is a very happy thing.
Arapacati: #Oh and Arapas said that Nara {NICKNAME} knows how to cook too.
Paimon: #Yeah! {NICKNAME}'s cooking skills have been tested by time!
Arapacati: #Arapacati gets it... Nara {NICKNAME} must come to Festival Utsava and cook with Arapacati's bush-league brothers.
Arapacati: Impress them once again with real cooking skills and food that only Nara can understand and Aranara will never understand.
Traveler: Try not to be surprised by then...
Arapacati: Arapacati is looking forward to it. This Festival Utsava will be really great and amazing!
Traveler: I'll show you what I've got!
Traveler: It's like you're playing house...
Traveler: Their sizes...
Paimon: No! Paimon is asking about their ages!

## Talk 4

Arapacati: #Thank you for everything, Nara {NICKNAME}. When the time comes for Festival Utsava, you must come as well!

## Talk 5

Arachatora: I can't pick any mushrooms until the Sunsettias have ripened ten times. *sob* I know it's not a long time...
Arachatora: But for some reason, just thinking about it slows time to a crawl...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Araphala: Arapacati is so scary when she's angry. I hope she won't be so angry after she has had some fruit...

### Additional Talk 2

Arapas: Vanarana's water is good, but it's water that's right within reach... But we can try using that water to cook next time!

### Additional Talk 3

Arasaka: The "taste of happiness" doesn't bring happiness but bitterness instead? How can this be?
