# Adventure Takes Courage!


## Talk 1

Patchi the Curious: There's no such THING as a perfect plan when you're on an adventure! How are you going to make any progress at all if you keep deliberating like this?
Doolan: If the plan isn't perfect, then we need to be prepared for anything!
Traveler: What are you arguing about?
Patchi the Curious: I am a researcher of ancient ruins, and I wish to embark on a field trip to the Thousand Winds Temple. But I don't deal well with situations involving combat.
Patchi the Curious: Mr. Doolan here is an adventurer, and has taken it upon himself to make all the necessary arrangements for the temple investigation.
Patchi the Curious: Now, I do not mean to be critical of Doolan in any way, and I know that those Ruin Guards can be a real nuisance... but he insists on devising a fully comprehensive adventure plan down to the last detail, to which end he calls meeting after meeting...
Patchi the Curious: We've had research, investigation, and amendments, followed by supplementary research, further investigation, and round-two amendments... Ahh, I just can't take it anymore!
Patchi the Curious: Now he says he's found new evidence of monsters camping out next to the temple.
Patchi the Curious: I'm begging you, clear them out for me, would you? Just to shut him up, even if it doesn't get us inside the temple...
Traveler: I think I understand what needs to happen...
Traveler: I'll happily take your place at Doolan's meetings.
Patchi the Curious: I appreciate the gesture, but take it from me...
Patchi the Curious: ...You'll find those monsters far less stressful to deal with than one of his meetings!

## Talk 2

Patchi the Curious: So, have you wiped out the monsters' camps?
Traveler: Not just yet...
Patchi the Curious: Please do it as soon as you can. Before Doolan finds yet another piece of evidence to pursue and ponder...

## Talk 3

Patchi the Curious: Have you wiped out the monsters' camps yet?
Traveler: Yes, they're all gone.
Patchi the Curious: Wonderful. I will speak with him at once about a proposed means of entry into the temple.
Patchi the Curious: He'll have no excuse to pull me into a meeting this time!
