# Talk Dialog

Pauline: Honorary Knight, word around town is that the charity sale was a runaway success, all thanks to you, Paimon, Bernhard, and Mats!
Pauline: Even I got a taste of the limelight, getting a few "thank you" notes of my own...
Traveler: This is the result of our collaborative efforts.
Pauline: I haven't done enough, not as much as you guys.
Pauline: However, after listening to your business strategy, I felt I have learned a lot and have become a more skilled businesswoman!
Pauline: Anyway, many thanks!
Traveler: Let's work together next time!
Pauline: Please make sure to look for me when you get the chance.
