# Talk Dialog

Kamisato Ayaka: ...Hm, don't you think this puzzle is a bit too complicated? If we make this small adjustment... it'd be a lot easier to understand, don't you think?
Sayu: Yâ€”You're right! I never thought about it that way...
Yoimiya: Nice one, Ayaka! I knew you'd be a great addition to the team!
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, no, no! You two did all the hard work! You made it easy for me...
Traveler: Hello.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... When did you get here...
Paimon: Just now! Seems like you're a natural, Ayaka! A real game developer at heart, huh...
Traveler: You talked about wanting to create a game the day before yesterday...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... You remember that. Well, brother had everything covered. So, I asked Yoimiya if she could use a hand...
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm just glad I didn't turn out to be an inconvenience.
Yoimiya: An inconvenience? We were in such a jam! You saved us!
"Kichiboushi": In a jam... because jam is sticky, and we got stuck!
Sayu: Not that kind of jam... But, it doesn't matter. We just need to get this done.
Kamisato Ayaka: #Traveler, Lady Guuji told me about the upcoming battle. As I understand it, this is an extremely dangerous endeavor, and the rest of us can only help from the sidelines...
Kamisato Ayaka: Our thoughts and prayers are with you... Be careful!
