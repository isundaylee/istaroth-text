Traveler: Why don't you have anything to do?
Great Merchant Huang: Oh, just talking about it makes my blood boil.
Great Merchant Huang: Ever since I received the protection of the adepti, I've been doing business on the road between Mondstadt and Liyue, and it was going swimmingly, too!
Great Merchant Huang: But after a while, someone — I have no idea who, but I'm sure it was someone in our merchant guild jealous of my success — caused the higher-ups to have me posted to Qingce Village!
Great Merchant Huang: ...Hmph. Even if I were to die here at Wangshu Inn, I would never go to Qingce Village. That destitute backwater would be the death of my talents and fortune!
