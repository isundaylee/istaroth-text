Traveler: Beyond the rainforest...
Kamal: Going west, across the Caravan Ribat, you will reach the desert. Somewhere in the desert lies King Deshret, a spot many Adventurers often beat a path to.
Kamal: But the environment is treacherous, and even a small sandstorm can be a terribly foul experience. If you must go, you'd better find a reliable guide at Aaru Village.
Kamal: Aaru Village is on the edge of the desert, and is friendly to tourists and traveling scholars.
Kamal: There seems to be an abandoned medical facility up there, and it was sealed off by the Akademiya.
Kamal: I know adventurers are mostly curious and don't really like the Akademiya or the Eremites bossing around with their plans...
Kamal: Still, that doesn't look like a great place for travel, so I don't advise you to be rash with your actions.
