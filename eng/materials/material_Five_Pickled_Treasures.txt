# Five Pickled Treasures

Pickled vegetables. A round of fermentation makes food richer and also allows it to keep for longer. There were originally only four "treasures," but for auspiciousness' sake, the four vegetables were mixed and plated up with one additional "treasure" added in, hence the name "Five Pickled Treasures."
