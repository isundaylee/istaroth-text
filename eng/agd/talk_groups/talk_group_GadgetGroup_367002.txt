A Letter to Armand: Hello, Armand? Is Armand there? This is Arbon and Alberre.
A Letter to Armand: Caron really inspired us back there! We've got a new idea, and we need your help. I'm sure you'll be able to do it!
A Letter to Armand: We call it the Automated Comeditron. All we'll need to do is to enter some comic lines into it, and out of its mouth shall come comedy!
A Letter to Armand: But I feel that if it's just the two of us, this thing won't be interesting enough. So please, help us come up with some lines.
A Letter to Armand: We know you don't say much, but I'm sure you know a banger or ten!
A Letter to Armand: C'mon, surely you must be interested in this somewhat! We'll see you after work, alright? Alright!
