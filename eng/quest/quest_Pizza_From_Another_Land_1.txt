# Pizza From Another Land


## Talk 1

Rie: Oh, hello. Can I help you with something?
Traveler: About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
Rie: Oh, that pizza tastes really good.
Rie: But...how do I put this, I'm not very used to its flavor.
Rie: I just think that if you can mix some of Inazuma's local ingredients into the pizza, such as Lavender Melon...
Rie: Maybe, the pizza will be more popular with everyone.

## Talk 2

Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you've returned.
Kiminami Anna: How did it go, any feedback?
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Pizza made with Lavender Melon... That's not too complicated...
Kiminami Anna: The rest of the ingredients just need to be prepared as usual. Well, since the feedback said to "incorporate some of Inazuma's local ingredients," then I can add some other ingredients...
Kiminami Anna: Hmm, Sea Ganoderma? Naku Weed? Oh, how about Fluorescent Fungus...
Traveler: Umm, need some help?
Kiminami Anna: Oh! I'm sorry, I was busy thinking about what ingredients to put in! Let's see, I don't think there's much Lavender Melon left in the store...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, please help me get a Lavender Melon. When it comes to ingredients...this should be all that's missing.
Traveler: I'm on it.
Kiminami Anna: Mm, I'm counting on you, then. Just one Lavender Melon will do.
Traveler: Do you need other ingredients?
Kiminami Anna: There are still some other ingredients in stock in the store. Just bring back a Lavender Melon, please.

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?

## Talk 4

Kiminami Anna: Thank you, these ingredients will do.
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what a pizza made with Inazuma's local ingredients would taste like...
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Kiminami Anna: This pizza looks... pretty good...
Kiminami Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Kiminami Anna: I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
Kiminami Anna: If it's not bad...it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
