# Gang Bylaws


## Talk 1

Matsumoto: Did I see anyone come by this way? Sorry, I was concentrating on my lemon water tasting...
Matsumoto: Your best bet would probably be to ask someone at the bathhouse across the road.

## Talk 2

Aikawa Susumu: I was just doing some cleaning when I suddenly heard a loud noise outside.
Aikawa Susumu: I got to the door just in time to see <color=#00E1FFFF>a shadowy figure disappear up that tree</color>!
Aikawa Susumu: This is a busy street... Surely it wouldn't be a burglar, would it...?

### Additional Talk 1

Souta: What are we gonna do? Do we really have to give up on playing Genius Invokation today?
Eita: We could try playing somewhere else. But where else apart from under the bridge can we escape from the grown-ups?
Souta: Oh, I know! We can get Yoimiya to set off some fireworks and scare off the guy that took our spot!
Eita: That's kinda mean... Although, he kicked us out first...
Souta: Yeah, so it's his own fault!
Yuma: I think... maybe we should just go home and do our homework?
Yuma: People who spend all their time playing and never studying turn into <color=#00E1FFFF>the kind of grown-ups who hang out under bridges</color>, too...

### Additional Talk 2

Kuki Shinobu: Alright you two, stay here, you understand? No running off.
Mamoru: You can count on that... We ain't going anywhere right now...
Kuki Shinobu: Yes, I can see that. But you'd better not change your mind once you've caught your breath.
Genta: We won't! Never again!
