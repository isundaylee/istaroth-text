Traveler: How do you like it here?
Ganyu: I think it's beautiful here.
Ganyu: It must have been quite an undertaking to decorate such a large space. Thank you for all your efforts.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Ganyu: In my spare time, I particularly enjoy taking strolls outside. It's so quiet and peaceful.
Ganyu: Even at midday, it's perfectly safe to take a nap.
Traveler: Yes, you definitely don't need to worry about safety here...
Ganyu: Agreed! So I really do like it here.
Ganyu: Anyway, um... Thanks so much, once again!
Traveler: Take care to not catch a cold...
Ganyu: Please don't worry, I've slept like this every day for at least a thousand years.
Traveler: As long as you like it.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Ganyu: Sure... but I may not be able to offer any practical advice if our topic of discussion is not work-related.
Traveler: I just meant small talk.
Ganyu: Oh, a—alright...
Ganyu: You know, I used to agonize a lot over whether to try and integrate into human society.
Ganyu: When our workload is light, my coworkers sometimes organize social events.
Ganyu: But my strict vegetarian diet is completely different from everyone else's. And I don't really share their interest in shopping or lively forms of entertainment.
Ganyu: Sometimes they can be quite critical... People say that my whole mindset is just fundamentally different from an ordinary person's...
Ganyu: But what can I do? It's hard to change your habits when they've been that way for thousands of years...
Traveler: I'll think of a social activity that you would find easier to accept.
Ganyu: Then it would only be proper for me to offer you something in return! Shall I take you out... for a meal? In a restaurant?
Traveler: We're friends, so there's no need for all that formality.
Ganyu: Ahh... Okay... Duly noted!
Traveler: Sounds good, I'll take the opportunity to share more knowledge with you.
Ganyu: ...Great, with your help, I'm sure I'll be able to integrate into human society in no time.
Traveler: I can go with you and help you slowly get accustomed.
Traveler: Don't worry about that.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Ganyu: I thought maybe we could plant some flowers together. Or some other plants, like... vegetables...
Traveler: You must be good at gardening, huh?
Ganyu: Yes, indeed... You could say it's my greatest hobby... aside from work.
Ganyu: Though in the past, I've been reluctant to grow vegetables... I always worried that I wouldn't be able to control my appetite and I'd end up eating them all in one sitting...
Ganyu: But I'm sure that if I grow them together with you, I'll definitely be able to control myself!
Traveler: Even if you did eat them all, it wouldn't be such a big deal.
Ganyu: No, uh... you don't understand, I...
Ganyu: I—I put on weight very easily, and...
Ganyu: If my appearance changed, then perhaps... I—I mean, the way people see me — well, the way you see me...
Traveler: ...Would remain unchanged.
Ganyu: Oh! Uh...
Ganyu: Still, I... I think it would be best to share them with you. You know, first rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Ganyu: ...Anyway! I'll go, uh... fetch some seeds. I'll make sure they're the very best.
Traveler: I'll eat them with you, then.
Ganyu: Great! And, uh... you'll help me plant them too, right...? First rule of gardening — grow together, eat together!
Traveler: I've never seen you grow vegetables before.
Ganyu: That's because... I've always feared I wouldn't be able to control my appetite, and that I'd end up eating all the vegetables I grew in one sitting...

Ganyu: Where are you off to today, is it far? My schedule is actually free right now.

Ganyu: That smell... the fragrance of true Liyue cuisine.
Ganyu: Ahem... you must have put a lot of effort into finding these blueprints for Rain Calmer, yes?
Ganyu: Your liking for Liyue also signifies your approval of my work... Thank you.

## Talk 10

Ganyu: A big bed and soft pillow, appropriate lighting, and even a miniature tree for embellishment...
Ganyu: One can certainly rest well in a room like this.
Ganyu: I will try to finish all of my work before the sun comes up, and then... have a good sleep.
