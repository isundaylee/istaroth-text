# Sangayaki

A simple, humble fisherman's side dish. Freshly caught fish is de-skinned and sliced, minced together with Snapdragon, mixed with miso and salt to form a batter, and then finally grilled. The lovely scent enters your nose long before the food enters your mouth. Three servings later, and you're still raring to go for more.
