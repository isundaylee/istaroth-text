Traveler: Then you must know Atea, then?
Pele Nui: Atea... Ah, if I'm not mistaken, you must be Mualani's friend, right?
Pele Nui: Atea's mentioned you to me before. Thank you so much for helping everyone at our tribe.
Pele Nui: Ah, Atea... She said that she knew her day would come. She even told us to not be too sad on her behalf...
Pele Nui: Speaking of Atea, I once took a picture of her with our Archon! They looked super cool together.
Pele Nui: I don't have it on me, though, so I guess I should go dig it out and show it to everyone.
