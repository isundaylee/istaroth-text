Traveler: Surely you didn't gain it via fraudulent means?
Brother Qian: You're right, I didn't. I've never done anything fraudulent in my life.
Brother Qian: That said, in the interests of knowing your enemy as you know yourself, I have schooled up on all the fraudulent methods used by others so that I don't fall prey to them myself...
Brother Qian: ...For example, you often see gamblers wearing a flower on their chest. Actually, they're hollow inside. They use them to store cards, dice, and so on.
Brother Qian: Here, take this. I'd never use it anyway, I'm better than that.
