# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Arataki Itto: Uh... is that a trick question? This is me we're talking about...
Arataki Itto: Send me anywhere in the world — anywhere at all — and I guarantee you I'd be able to live there.
Arataki Itto: I've slept on the streets, down at the dock, deep in the forest... Pretty much everywhere! Of course, comfort-wise, the cells at the Police Station are up there at the top of the list.
Arataki Itto: That was all before I met you, though.
Arataki Itto: This place is something else! In fact, I'm gonna go on the record and say that the comfort level here is like 10... No, what am I saying — 100 prison cells rolled into one!
Traveler: I don't want it to be like any number of prison cells!
Arataki Itto: Why not? They're great!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, look me in the eyes, and listen up, okay? This place is awesome!
Arataki Itto: Anyway... point made, boom. I'm not gonna drag it out like some... granny at a tea party.
Arataki Itto: But the code of the streets says I should find a way to express my, uh, you know, gratitude... but, I know... I—I can be your bouncer here!
Traveler: You flatter me!
Arataki Itto: Haha! Seriously though, I'm just telling it how it is. I think we're past the point where we need to be polite to each other all the time.
Arataki Itto: If it's okay with you, I might actually make this my main pad. It's a sweet deal, I'm pretty psyched at the idea of crashing here every night...
