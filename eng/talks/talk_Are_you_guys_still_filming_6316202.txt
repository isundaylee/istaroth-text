Traveler: Are you guys still "filming"?
Xavier: #Ahh... If it isn't you, my gallant {F#heroine}{M#hero}!
Xavier: I'm discussing what to film next with this soldier over here.
Xavier: I want to document the legends of the tanuki and the kitsune. But as for our good soldier...
Toranosuke: Well, I recommend that you head into the city and capture the might of our samurai on film, Mr. Xavier.
