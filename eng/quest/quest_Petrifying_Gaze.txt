# Petrifying Gaze


## Talk 1

Park Announcement Speaker: All actors and actresses have arrived, and all stage mechanisms are operating normally.
Park Announcement Speaker: This performance of "Petrifying Gaze," a play from "Daiya's Three-Day Reverie," will now begin!
Narrator On Speaker: On the edge of a thick and eerie forest, two wise and learned sages happen upon a Hydro Eidolon, wandering alone...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: Please, help me... someone help me! I don't want to abandon my friends...
Paimon: Water Droplet!? Wait, did the Water Droplet talk?
Traveler: It's actually the sound of the speaker.
Paimon: Oh, so this Water Droplet is actually a main character in this play, and we have to act along with it?
Narrator On Speaker: It is truly fortunate that these two wise sages have already researched the language of Hydro Eidolons in depth, and can understand its plea for help.
Narrator On Speaker: This must be a fated encounter! Such a portentous meeting, could you even entertain the notion of not assisting this Hydro Eidolon?
Paimon: Wow! We have our own characters too? That's really cool.
Traveler: Let's get back on topic.
Lone Hydro Eidolon: We... while we were lost in the woods, we happened upon an ancient castle and accidentally awoke the evil spirits slumbering within...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: Two of their leaders, they... they laid curses upon us! Now, the moment a ghost sees us, we... we turn to stone!
Lone Hydro Eidolon: I barely managed to escape, but my companions...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: *sob* ...They must be in such pain... Is this our fault?
Paimon: Of course not! Even if those ghosts got up on the wrong side of the bed, that's no excuse to be bullies!
Paimon: Those jerks! Turning lost Water Droplets into stone... that's even worse than bullying! Those ghosts are all super bad guys!
Traveler: If we teach them a lesson they won't soon forget...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: No, the two ghost leaders never show themselves, and the castle is vast... even the strongest and most capable person could never find them...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: But I heard one of the ghosts say that deep within the castle is a chest, and that chest contains an ancient hex-cleansing remedy. That is the only hope...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: The chest is locked inside a secret chamber, and you must first find the hidden key.
Lone Hydro Eidolon: But... I've already been cursed, and if I go back alone, I'll certainly be seen by the ghosts... then I'll be turned to stone and trapped forever...
Paimon: That sounds easy! We'll escort you there, find the key, and get that remedy!
Paimon: As long as you avoid those... ghosts' gaze, you'll be fine, right? It'll be a walk in the park!
Lone Hydro Eidolon: That's right, you are both... wise sages, and you must certainly know what to do... Please, I'm begging you...
Traveler: Paimon sure got into character quickly.
Paimon: Hehe, it sounds pretty straightforward.
Paimon: Even if we can't beat up the mastermind, taking down the ghosts and saving the Water Droplet's companions should be a piece of cake for you, right?
Paimon: C'mon, little Water Droplet, let's go find that remedy, lift your curse, and save your friends!
Traveler: You guessed exactly where the plot was going.
Traveler: ...Can we save your companions?
Traveler: What happened to your companions?
Traveler: Just treat it like the Water Droplet's lines.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ugh! It's impossible to avoid their line of sight! This is just cheating!
Paimon: Paimon just wants to kick those ghost mechanisms right over!
Paimon: Hey, wait, Water Droplet! What are you doing! There's ghosts there, it's dangerous!
Angry Wraith Leader: Insolent beings, have you gone insane? Or have you abandoned all hope, and simply wish to see your friends in the next world?
Happy Wraith Leader: Oh no! It used its body to block their gaze... why does it have such a noble spirit of self-sacrifice!?
Narrator On Speaker: A sudden twist! The lonely Hydro Eidolon has thrown itself in front the ghost's vision, using its body to block the fatal gaze, and is slowly turning to stone!
Paimon: The Water Droplet turned to stone... just so we could get the key...
Traveler: The Water Droplet can still be saved!
Paimon: Oh, right! That's right! As long as we aren't in their line of sight too long, we should be okay!
Paimon: Did the Water Droplet figure that out? It's so smart and brave!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's find the key and get the remedy, fast! We can't let the Water Droplet suffer too long!
Traveler: We have to hurry!

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: The speaker continues to describe the strange scene in front of youâ€”
The two wise sages slowly drop the remedy onto the petrified body of the Hydro Eidolon, and a strange phenomenon begins to occur...
As though time were flowing backward, the petrified Hydro Eidolon begins to return to normal...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: *sob* ...So that is how it feels to be turned to stone... The pain, the agony! I cannot let my friends suffer this fate any longer.
Paimon: Water Droplet, how could you just charge ahead like that without saying anything!? You scared Paimon half to death! It's a good thing we got the remedy so quickly...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: That ghost was so scary, I was so terrified I couldn't even speak...
Lone Hydro Eidolon: Also, you are so wise that I think you don't even need me to remind you.
Lone Hydro Eidolon: Even if I turned completely into a stone, I knew you guys would save me right after you got the remedy, and things would be just like before! So there was no real need to worry.
Paimon: Huh... uh, did Paimon get too invested in the play? Paimon was just so worried about the Water Droplet...
Traveler: It's good to dive into your role.
Paimon: Eh... Paimon is a guest who's here to have fun, but she let the acting get to her head... It's a little embarrassing...
Paimon: But anyway, we succeeded! Now you can take the remedy and save your friends!
Lone Hydro Eidolon: Thank you, thank you! I... I'm forever indebted to you for all that you've done!
Lone Hydro Eidolon: My companions and I will always remember your kindness in our hearts!
Traveler: It's nothing!
Paimon: Paimon hopes those ghosts won't cause any more trouble...
Paimon: Whenever you guys play in the forest, you'll have to be more careful! No more coming to this castle!
Narrator On Speaker: Congratulations, congratulations! The impeccable plans and stratagems of the wise sages and the bravery of the Hydro Eidolons has become a perfect partnership, and the curse of the ghosts will soon be completely lifted!
Narrator On Speaker: After the timely arrival of the wise sages, the ghosts will never again be so reckless. The lonely Hydro Eidolon and its friends can now play again, without fear or worry.
Narrator On Speaker: The dense, eerie forest is now gradually showing its peaceful, quiet side...
Narrator On Speaker: Thus ends "Petrifying Gaze," thank you for watching!
Paimon: Hooray, we finished "Petrifying Gaze"! Paimon really got into it!
Paimon: Hmm... the combination of lines on the stage and narration by the speaker does a great job of working the audience! Paimon wonders where Daiya learned to do that...
Paimon: If we get a chance, we should definitely ask her!
Traveler: No need to be so polite!
Traveler: It means Paimon's having fun!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Though, if a Water Droplet has turned to stone, can it still drink a potion? And how does water even drink water...
Paimon: Oh! Maybe this remedy is the kind you rub on! Let's try it out!

## Talk 5

Lone Hydro Eidolon: Complete the challenge, and then you can find the key to the secret chamber... it's all in your hands now!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Narrator On Speaker: The two sages watch the poor Hydro Eidolon slowly turn into unfeeling stone before their very eyes, and it no longer responds to their anguished calls...
Narrator On Speaker: But this was not in vain! For it was only so willing to sacrifice itself, because it believed in the two sages from the bottom of its heart!
