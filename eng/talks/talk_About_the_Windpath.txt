Traveler: About the Windpath...
Clanche: Well, I did specifically select them for their particular intensity.
Clanche: I believe that one must face the furious flurry without practice or preparation to best hone one's art of flight — to best uncover one's true potential.
Clanche: Flying squirrels nowadays are far too timid! They've utterly forgotten the lessons taught by the "Brave Northerly Wind"!
Clanche: They stand in safe spots and declaim the courage of leaves that dance in the wind, yet are far too frightened to leap into its embrace themselves.
Clanche: How can we protect the kingdom alongside Her Highness if things keep going this way?
Clanche: Shall we merely watch and applaud helplessly as our Princess fights our battles? How risible!
Clanche: It is our duty to defend the kingdom, mastering flight our obligation!
Clanche: The safety of the realm is intimately tied to each and every one of us!
Clanche: Still... Hmph. I wonder if any of my kin will understand these words — they likely think me some obstinate idiot.
Clanche: No matter! Once my techniques have been refined, I shall leave them all speechless.
Clanche: When the time comes, I shall once again tell them of my philosophy.
