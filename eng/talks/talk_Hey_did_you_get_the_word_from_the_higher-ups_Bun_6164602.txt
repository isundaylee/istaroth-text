Mikhail: Hey, did you get the word from the higher-ups? Bunch of masked bandits broke into one of our strongholds and tore the place up!
Lyudmila: You mean someone else is out to get us now? This is not great...
Mikhail: It's too early to say. We're still not sure on the identities or affiliations of these masked intruders...
Mikhail: It could be the Abyss Order. Or it could be the Knights of Favonius, just working outside the system.
Lyudmila: Well whoever it is, we're the enemy to them, so we need to be on our guard...
Mikhail: It's fine. If it turns out the Knights of Favonius are ready to throw our good will back in our faces, they will find out soon enough just where the limit of their strength is!
Lyudmila: I just hope all our efforts in Mondstadt won't go to waste...
Mikhail: Don't worry about it! The Fatui can handle this, no problem!
