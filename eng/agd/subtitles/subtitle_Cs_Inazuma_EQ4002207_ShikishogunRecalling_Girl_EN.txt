Master Kamuna
Over half our trained samurai are wounded
And our shikigami losses are far greater than anticipated
Besides
The outside situation is beginning to stabilize
Do we really need to keep pursuing this "ultimate attainment"?
Why so apprehensive?
This is all within my expectation
Harunosuke
Forgive my directness
But she's not coming back
All I ever wanted... was to assist her descendants
And guard this territory
Now that our targets no longer exist
And those needing our protection are finally safe
Then perhaps our sworn mission
Has indeed come to an end
I always believed
That I would stand guard in this place forever
If time permitted
I almost fooled myself
With such a notion
I hope you never make the same mistake
Don't worry
Harunosuke
I know everything
That you've done for Inazuma
Your efforts need not be judged by others
The same goes for my existence
Bestowing you with intelligence
That should you know human emotion
It would seem this was the right decision
In the end
It is you that have enlightened me
"Rosy cheeked in the morning"
"Bleached bones by dusk"
How so very true
I have nothing left
To keep me
Shiki Taishou, my friend
You have completed your assignment magnificently
As for me... I need wait no longer
I will set out again
In search of a new purpose
Then this is farewell
Harunosuke
Be safe in your travels
I remember everything
Harunosuke didn't abandon me
It was I
That persuaded him
And helped him escape
The labyrinth of his heart
