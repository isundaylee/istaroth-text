# Talk Dialog

Lisa: When would I ever not?
Lisa: If it weren't for my library work and potion-making duties, I'd love nothing more than to spend every day chatting with you like this.
Traveler: Have there been many people borrowing books recently?
Lisa: The number of people borrowing books is around the same as always. But lately, more people seem to be returning them on time than ever before.
Lisa: It seems that the citizens of the "City of Freedom" have become more conscious of time. Frankly, I'm quite relieved.
Lisa: Of course, I can't expect everyone to be as sensible as you, cutie.
Lisa: Haha...
Lisa: #You look so adorable with a little more red in your cheeks, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Made any special potions recently?
Lisa: Special potions? Hmm...
Lisa: Oh! As a matter of fact, I concocted one that makes textiles softer to the touch.
Lisa: And another that keeps the air fragrant and fresh. I'm quite fond of that one.
Lisa: They weren't requested by the Knights of Favonius, though. I just made them out of personal interest.
Lisa: Hmm... Is it just me, or have my interests become more domestic in nature since I met you...?
Traveler: Lisa, you're making me blush again...
