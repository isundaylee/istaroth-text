Traveler: Have you tried all these before?
Zayah: Oh, they're on my To-Eat list, that's for sure.
Zayah: That Boyan told me that Chenyu Adeptea was the best... and then he hoodwinked me into buying a large batch of goods that turned out to be absolute junk!
Zayah: Then he turned around and said that it was just that batch of tea that was faulty, and now that the water and soil in Chenyu Vale are back to normal, so too are the tea leaves.
Zayah: I don't trust it. Fool me once, shame on you â€” fool me twice, shame on me...
Zayah: I'm going to Liyue personally, and I'll taste it for myself.
