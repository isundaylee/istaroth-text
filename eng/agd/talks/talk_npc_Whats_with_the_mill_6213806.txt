Traveler: What's with the mill?
Ms. Bai: What's with it? This was left to me by my father. When I returned, I renovated it wholesale, and now maintain it every day.
Ms. Bai: Maybe my father also once lived this kind of peaceful life... Every time I hear the sound of the water wheel, it reminds me of many things in my childhood.
