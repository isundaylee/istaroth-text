Hosseini: Alright, let's test run the Pursina's Spike. Don't worry, I'll be over here watching you operate it.

## Talk

Hosseini: Start the Pursina's Spike. Be careful of the dark mud and monsters, though, and prevent the stoppage of the Spike.

## Talk

Hosseini: #We can only initialize the Spike here. Careful now, Traveler, make sure they don't get damaged.

## Talk

Tu: If you want to start moving the device, just start the hot air balloon right up.
Hao: Be careful of the mud and monsters along the way.

## Talk

Hosseini: I hope you succeed in transporting the Pursina's Spike.

## Talk

Hosseini: I'm quite sure there will be some serious effects when you activate the Pursina's Spike at the location where the Ley Lines vent out dark mud, so you must be careful.

## Talk

Hosseini: We also need to collect some rock samples from The Chasm to get a better picture of some involved parameters.
Hosseini: We cannot shame the good name of the Akademiya...

## Talk

Hosseini: Speaking of which, those miners are surprisingly reliable. Their footing was incredibly stable as they moved the Spike from the camp to this place.
Hosseini: I do hope that things will go as well when they move the Spike further down into the tunnels.

## Talk

Hosseini: The dark mud keeps spreading gradually. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist...
Hosseini: Is there some way we can transport the Pursina's Spike without touching the ground?

## Talk

Tu: *cough* I'm a little unwell, but I'm feeling much better now than I did down there in the mining complex.

## Talk

Hao: What on earth was that dark mud. I just touched it once by mistake, and it felt like my entire side went cold... *cough*
Hao: I just hope there won't be any long-lasting side effects...

## Talk

Hosseini: #Ah, Traveler! I apologize, but I need more time to finish the adjustments to the Pursina's Spike.

## Talk

Tu: How's the mud-clearing going? Well, I hope?
Tu: Just give us a shout if you need our help with anything!

## Talk

Hao: I just hope that the mud can be cleared out soon.
Hao: *sigh* When can we go back to the way things were, with everyone going down into the mines together...

## Talk

Hosseini: I suppose I've finally managed to help Khedive with this dark mud problem of his...
Traveler: Hey there.
Hosseini: #...Ah, Traveler, hello! How is your day going?
Hosseini: Now that I think about it, you truly have been a big help to me a great many times.
Hosseini: The business with the Energy Amplifier, our observations of that special Ruin Grader on Tsurumi Island, and now again here at The Chasm.
Hosseini: Each time, it was always some kind of emergency or highly complicated matter, which was then resolved wonderfully by your presence.
Hosseini: Honestly, I wonder if it's your luck that's good, or if it is my good fortune bumping into you so often...
Traveler: So, how are those memoirs going?
Hosseini: Heh, I mean, I was just saying it ... I still have a long way to go before my achievements are anything worth writing a memoir about.
Hosseini: What's more, there are still many research topics left for me to tackle... and the more I tackle, the more I'll be able to write in my memoirs.
Hosseini: A such, I'm of the view that the later you write your memoirs, the better.
Traveler: So, about Khedive...
Hosseini: Do you mean to ask why I accepted his commission to help him out here at The Chasm?
Hosseini: Do you know of the Purbiruni? Khedive is from that school of researchers.
Hosseini: When I was at the Akademiya, I received quite a lot of help from that school, and so you can consider this a returning of that favor.
Hosseini: I mean, it's just normal to have such relationships, right? And in any case, no one school of researchers can solve all problems by themselves. That's why there's a need for collaboration!
Hosseini: It is how we bond as researchers.
Traveler: Well, all the best, then. See you!
Hosseini: All the best to you too!
Hosseini: Well, I'm hoping that things will turn out for the best, at least...
