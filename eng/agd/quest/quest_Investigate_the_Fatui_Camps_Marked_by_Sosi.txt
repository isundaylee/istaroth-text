# Investigate the Fatui Camps Marked by Sosi

Sorush: Hey, you scheming humans! I suggest leaving this place at once â€” the heritage and secrets of us Pari are not for you to covet, and certainly not within your reach.
Markozov: ...Pari? You're a Pari! Oh, what an amazing experience!
Markozov: #Oh! And there's also a wiry young man with his... pet?
Paimon: #Hey, watch what you say! Paimon's his best friend!
Markozov: Friend... Why, of course! "Best friend"... What a beautiful sound! I've always wanted to have a "best friend" since childhood...
Markozov: #Wiry young man, you're certainly not in need of two best friends, are you?
Traveler: What do you mean?
Markozov: I mean... Even if you're the one having two best friends, don't you think it's a little unfair?
Markozov: Inequities like this are impossible to forgive... So please, hand the Pari over to me. As for how I'll treat it... you wouldn't have to worry. I'll make sure it's used to its full potential.
Sorush: Insolent fool...
Paimon: Whoa, he's being so unreasonable... There's no getting through to him!
Sorush: We can always make him understand without wasting our words... My clever Yasnapati, surely you know what I mean?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! Sorush wants us to teach him a lesson!
Sorush: Hmph! Silence, Pale Floater!
Traveler: I actually wouldn't mind.
Paimon: No way! Only Paimon can be your best friend!
