# Missing title (2778414079)

Traveler: I'm glad that we met.
Kumi: I feel the same way. Thank you for your help previously.
Kumi: Oh, by the way... Anisa's been trying really hard to get used to life here. Lately, she's been learning how to make our local cuisine from me.
Kumi: It's just that she's, uh, made some changes to it based on flavors from Sumeru... I hope you don't mind.
