## Talk

Anna: Hi. Is there something *coughs* I can do for you? *coughs*

## Talk

Anna: What are you doing?
Anna: I am... *coughs* making a wish.
Anna: I just toss the coin *coughs* into the pool just like this, and *coughs* make a wish...
Anna: You must be *coughs* sincere and do it every day for the fountain fairy to hear you... *coughs*
Anna: I'm sorry... I can't stop coughing...
Anna: What do you want?
Anna: Oh... I've been *coughs* unwell for a long time.
Anna: I wish that *coughs* the fountain fairy could help me *coughs* get better.
Anna: So I can stop *coughs* being a burden to my parents and my *coughs* brother Anthony.
Anna: Can't your family help you?
Anna: My parents and my *coughs* brother Anthony have all been *coughs* really good to me...
Anna: Anthony works tirelessly every night
Anna: just to *coughs* earn money to buy medicine for me.
Anna: I... also want to do something for them. *coughs*

## Talk

Anna: Sorry for bothering you.
Anna: Be well.
Anna: I hope *coughs* all your wishes will be granted soon... *coughs*

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Anna: *cough* To tell the truth, I made a wish to the fountain fairy when the dragon attacked, wishing that it would keep Mondstadt safe.
Anna: Now, both the storm and the danger has passed. Does that mean that the fountain fairy truly exists?
Anna: I wish that the fairy can make me well soon â€” that would lessen my family's burden a little... *cough*

## Talk

Anna: Thanks to Anthony and the blessings of the fountain fairy, I've been getting better...

## Talk

Traveler: You haven't made a full recovery yet?
Anna: Not yet. I still cough at times, but I'm much better than before.
Anna: I want to get well soon... That way, I won't burden Anthony and the others any further.
Anna: I'd also be able to do some things that I want to do as well.

## Talk

Traveler: The fountain fairy?
Anna: Yes. I heard from Anthony that he was able to get a prescription from Liyue Harbor.
Anna: To think that he was able to get a prescription from such a distant place so smoothly... the fountain fairy might have heard my wishes after all.
Anna: She must have protected Anthony and helped him to obtain that prescription.
Anna: Once I've made a fully recovery, I must make a trip to Springvale...

## Talk

Traveler: See you, and get well soon.
Anna: Goodbye. My wishes have been granted, and I hope that yours will soon come true as well.
