Traveler: Alchemy?
Timaeus: Alchemy is a craft that has been passed down since ancient times, but it is barely understood in the present.
Timaeus: Its mechanisms are magical and mysterious, completely unlike the principles that shape our understanding of the physical world.
Timaeus: If I can get the hang of it, I should be able to create some pretty awesome stuff, and contribute to our knowledge of ancient civilization.
