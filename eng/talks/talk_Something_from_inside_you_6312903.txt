# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Something from inside you?
Tejima: Like... a kind of enthusiasm or obsession that I had. Maybe that was what has kept me in the village this entire time. But I can't remember any of it anymore...
Tejima: Why did I come here? Why did I stay? What should I be doing right now? What should I do next?
Tejima: Amnesia? No, I couldn't call it that. I know who I am and who everyone is here. I remember every road and everything I've done in the village. I haven't forgotten anything.
Tejima: *sigh* It's just that... All of this feels like they've lost their meaning after I lost the Vision.
Tejima: Never mind, go tend to your own business. I'm just rambling. I'll look around some more and give this some more thought...
