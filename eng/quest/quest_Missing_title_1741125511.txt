# Missing title (1741125511)


## Talk 1

Linlang: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: This thing you've brought... It looks pretty good. This pattern also seems quite old indeed. Hold on while I open it.
Linlang: There are some defects here and there, but if you're eager to have it taken off your hands, I can offer you a price. It'll be fair, but it won't be high.
Linlang: I just had a look at this one. These markings are definitely those of Liyue, and you can see inscribed here an anecdote about Azhdaha.
Linlang: They say that Azhdaha was a dragon spawned by a convergence of the spirits of Geo in Liyue, and that even Rex Lapis could not easily subdue it.
Linlang: Rex Lapis thus summoned three adepti to his aid, and together they created a cavernous realm.
Linlang: Rex Lapis then battled the creature, luring it into the realm, before ordering the adepti to seal the entrance, trapping Azhdaha within.
Linlang: The patterns on the thing you brought seem to describe the three adepti joining hands to create the cavernous realm.
Linlang: I guess that there should at least be three relics of this kind. Combining all three should give us the complete item.
Traveler: You know all this...
Linlang: Well, I do trade in items of all kinds. A little general knowledge here and there couldn't hurt.
Linlang: Ah, but I digress. As I said earlier, there should be three of this item. One of them alone is likely not going to fetch a high price.
Linlang: But if you could gather all three, that would be a different story. But this looks to be quite ancient. Gathering all three might be too tall a task...
Traveler: Liyue truly is a mystical place...
Linlang: Now this I'm not certain of, but a senior of mine once told me that Liyue is too large, and its history is, similarly, far too long.
Linlang: Don't be surprised if you find strange relics in Liyue. What we know of Liyue's lengthy history is but a single drop in the wide ocean.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: If my guess isn't off, the object you brought previously is one of three.
Linlang: It will only be complete once all three objects are gathered together.
Linlang: If you could find them all, I would be more than willing to make you a generous offer.
Linlang: I fear that they may be from too ancient a time, however, and that gathering them... could be difficult.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Linlang: Alright. If you do manage to gather them, please bring them to me.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Found all three.
Linlang: You... actually managed to put them together? Please, let me see... Indeed, these three patterns, when put together, do tell the story of Azhdaha.
Linlang: This crane must be the adeptus Mountain Shaper, and this deer might be Moon Carver. But this last one...
Linlang: Eh? It seems like this pattern has been... intentionally ground away by someone, to the point where I can't make it out. Who was this third adeptus?
Linlang: Forget it. These matters are beyond my knowledge. Regardless, this treasure is complete, and will definitely sell well.
Linlang: So, would you like to take it for a keepsake, or would you prefer to sell it to me? I'll pay you a pretty sum.
Traveler: It's yours.
Linlang: Great. Please take this, then.
Linlang: Still, why was the image of one of the three adepti marred?
Linlang: Who made this thing, and who broke it and ground away the adeptus' image?
Linlang: Right, it seems as if Soraya has arrived in Liyue. I could write her a letter... she would definitely be interested in this object.
