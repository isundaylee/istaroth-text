Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Xudi: But just as the solitude and sorrow were soon to squash his soul, a girl holding books happened by.
Xudi: "Oh my, an empty shelf! What a lifesaver!" So she cried happily. "Dear shelf, could I place these books in your care?"
Xudi: "Of course you may â€” yet I am a worthless shelf. I do not know if I can even be of help to you," the shelf said sorrowfully.
Xudi: "But... Your frame is large, your boards flat and sturdy." The girl continued, surprised. "No matter how you look at it, you're a good shelf, and you can hold a whole bunch of books."
