## Talk 1

Vahid: Oh no... how did this happen?
Traveler: What's the matter?
Vahid: Traveler, I was just looking for you!
Vahid: Do you still remember Konda Densuke? He came to the store several days ago, asking about the fertilizers.
Traveler: Is he satisfied with the fertilizers?
Vahid: I wouldn't put it in those terms. Strictly speaking, I think Mr. Konda Densuke is feeling lost.
Traveler: Lost?
Vahid: Well, here's the thing. After your previous promotion, Mr. Densuke did use our fertilizers according to your instructions.
Vahid: However, although the crops did grow well, at the same time... a lot of mushrooms came out of nowhere...
Vahid: To be honest, after Mr. Konda told me about it, I am also feeling a bit lost.
Vahid: But anyway, it definitely has something to do with the fertilizers.
Vahid: Traveler, could you please go to Konda Village and help Mr. Konda clear those mushrooms out of his fields?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Vahid: That I will. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...
Vahid: *sigh* If only Alrani were here. She would definitely have found the cause already.
Traveler: How about we ask Alrani to work on this issue?
Vahid: If she was here, we would have figured it out quite quickly.
Vahid: But she hasn't returned yet, and I have no idea where she went.
Vahid: I can only count on you, Traveler. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...

## Talk 2

Konda Densuke: What is the matter with these mushrooms...
Traveler: I'm here to clear the mushrooms!
Konda Densuke: Were you sent by Mr. Vahid to help me clear them away?
Konda Densuke: Hmm, then they're all yours. There are way too many mushrooms in the field. It's not a job for an old timer like me.
Konda Densuke: How could these mushrooms have grown so fast...
Traveler: Sorry for the trouble!
Konda Densuke: Oh, the mushrooms? Well, there's no shortage of them on my dining table, that's for sure.

## Talk 3

Konda Densuke: Why did these mushrooms grow so quickly?

## Talk 4

Konda Densuke: Have you cleared them all?
Traveler: All the mushrooms are here.
Konda Densuke: That's all? I remember there being be a lot more. Did you really clear them all out?
Konda Densuke: Anyway, you have my appreciation, youngster. Take this as payment.
Konda Densuke: I have to say that these fertilizers are quite amazing. The mushrooms grew so quickly. If only they could help the crops grow this fast as well...
Konda Densuke: When I've got the time, I will surely come buy some more and try them out...

## Talk 5

Konda Densuke: Have you cleared them all?
Traveler: Got all the mushrooms right here.
Konda Densuke: There were so many mushrooms, but looks like you did get them all.
Konda Densuke: Thank you, youngster. I really don't know what I would do without your help. Take this as a token of my gratitude.
Konda Densuke: I have to say that these fertilizers are quite amazing. The mushrooms grew so quickly. If only they could help the crops grow this fast as well...
Konda Densuke: When I've got the time, I will surely come buy some more and try them out...
