Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! I've arrived at Ritou! Stop harassing outlanders all the time!"
Bulletin Board: "Don't you ever forget the beating that you gave me!"
Bulletin Board: "You cannot escape our rematch, you hear me?"
Bulletin Board: Ugh! Can you stop vandalizing these boards everywhere you go? You keep talking about the same thing every time, too!
Bulletin Board: If you want your rematch so much, come at me, then! Forget appearances or whatever... once this war is over, I will grant you your wish!
Bulletin Board: So just knock it off already! If I wasn't an officer of the Kujou Clan, I would have sued you for harassment already!

Bulletin Board: We ask that those in need of help please visit the Kamisato Clan to file the required paperwork.
Bulletin Board: (Outlanders with valid documentation will also receive some form of subsidy.)
Bulletin Board: As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Bulletin Board: "I'd like to thank Lady Yae Miko and the Yashiro Commissioner for their good intentions. The problem is that the documentation approval process takes way too long..."
