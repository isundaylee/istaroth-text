Cauich: "Do not fear failure or death. They are but an omen of coming glory."

Traveler: About my reputation with the Children of Echoes...
Cauich: Thank you for your help. May you go undefeated even in this nation of conflict.

Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Cauich: Ah, this? It is the center of our tribal beliefs, the Obsidian Totem Pole. It is the symbol of the connection between the tribes and the Night Kingdom.
Cauich: Not everyone here can communicate with the Wayob through these totems, though.
Cauich: Only a very small number of distinguished, or notably powerful individuals can accomplish that, and most of them are Masters of the Night-Wind.
Cauich: Still, you may yet get a response from it if you help our tribe with some commissions.
Cauich: Manpower's always at a premium, so it's definitely worth a shot.

Traveler: Death and failure...
Cauich: Haha, you might not know this, but here, even warriors who fail have a chance to start over.
Cauich: As long as you've got an Ancient Name as I do, and the companions who fight alongside you succeed, you can return to the battlefield even should you fail.
Cauich: To be honest, I've had experience... You know, being dead. Wasn't fun, but fortunately, I wasn't alone.
Cauich: *sigh* It's just a shame I'm getting on in years... But perhaps, one day, my Ancient Name will carry my story on and find itself a new bearer.
