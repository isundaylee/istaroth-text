Traveler: I'm afraid I'm no longer a rookie.
Furuya Noboru: Wow, such forcefulness! It seems that I have judged a book by its cover. My apologies.
Furuya Noboru: But since you have just arrived in Inazuma, you probably still find many things unfamiliar. If you run into any trouble, be careful. Come look for me!
Furuya Noboru: Inazuma is in turmoil right now, which you probably already know. However, this may be a blessing in disguise. Ever since the Sakoku Decree, fewer and fewer foreign adventurers have been arriving, so there should still be quite a lot of lost treasures to be found.
Furuya Noboru: If you have confidence in your abilities, this might be the right place for you to flex your muscles.
Furuya Noboru: *cough* Anyway, best you be careful when going outside. The Adventurers' Guild will always be behind you.
