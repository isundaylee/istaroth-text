# Thundering Dance

When a character causes opponents to be Electro-Charged, there is a 50% chance to trigger a lightning strike that deals 500% of the triggering character's ATK as DMG and decreases the opponent's Electro RES by 25%. This effect can be triggered once every 5s and this CD is shared between all party members.
