Traveler: Have you managed a harbor before?
Cassigneul: I've been involved in handling some harbor management-related matters in the past, but this is my first time in an official managerial role.
Cassigneul: To be perfectly frank, the pressure is enormous. Especially in a crucial port like Lumidouce Harbor with not just a high volume of cargo, but also trade involving so many different nations...
Cassigneul: But since I've taken on this role, I've got expectations to live up to, and people whom I can't let down. I have to ensure that this critical trade hub runs smoothly.
Cassigneul: The trade volume at Lumidouce Harbor keeps on rising. I really need to find a way to reintroduce those expansion plans. I should seek out Mr. Doutey when I get the chance.
