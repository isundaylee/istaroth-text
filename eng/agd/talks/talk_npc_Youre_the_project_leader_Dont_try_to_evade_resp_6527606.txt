# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You're the project leader. Don't try to evade responsibility.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Ha! So you came all this way just to lecture me?
Edwin Eastinghouse: I never asked to be the project leader. If the Institute hadn't imposed a deadline on my researchâ€”
Edwin Eastinghouse: I wouldn't have had to hire that gaggle of fools to assist me. If I had the time to personally oversee every project, that accident would never have happened!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Forget it. I won't waste any more of my time explaining it to you. When I get out of the Fortress of Meropide, I must get it through to the Institute to restart the research.
