# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Chit-Chat


## Talk 1

Nakul: You two! Please wait. I hear you're... people of leisure... who never turn down a request.
Traveler: That is correct, indeed.
Nakul: *ahem* Actually, a girl in a purple dress asked me to take care of you.
Nakul: But I was thinking, since you accept any and all requests, you must be very capable. So I'd never need to take care of you. Indeed, it would be more accurate to say that you two can take care of me.
Traveler: Sure, but no discounts.
Nakul: I know the rules, don't worry. Regardless of the outcome, I will compensate you according to market rates. But Mora is useless here, so I'll pay with Coupons.
Paimon: We'll be compensated no matter what happens? Really?
Nakul: Absolutely and totally correct! Our task is just that difficult, you see. It's that Nizami's fault for being great with his fists, but for using them where they shouldn't have been used.
Nakul: I'll be staying here for a while longer, so I need a place to pursue my studies. It's best if it has a bookshelf, a table, chairs, and a board to write on and stick materials to...
Nakul: I'm sure you know exactly what place I'm talking about, but it's simply not available and there's no point in asking. But I believe that a room on the opposite side has the same internal structure, and should be usable.
Nakul: But it's a really strange place. It seems to be occupied by someone who rarely entertains visitors. I've never seen the person nor even seen the doors open.
Nakul: So I appointed Nizami as my representative. He was always reliable during the time I employed him as a bodyguard. However, he got into a disagreement with the occupant, and negotiations broke down.
Paimon: Hmm... Maybe communication and negotiations have never been his strong suit.
Nakul: Indeed. It didn't even look like a negotiation. He just hammered on the door with his fist, standing outside and shouting. It was a truly shocking moment for me.
Traveler: Whoa!
Paimon: That doesn't sound like a negotiation at all!
Nakul: As such, I'd like to ask you to act as my representative and negotiate with the occupant to rent out the space he is currently occupying. I expect the price to be... a maximum of 54,000 Coupons.
Nakul: You may not succeed, and that's fine, but at least give it a try. I'm counting on you.
Traveler: How unprofessional.
Paimon: Paimon suspects he was never a professional when it comes to things like this...
Traveler: And just who told you that?
Nakul: Uh, well... Rumors... Just rumors...

## Talk 2

Nakul: If only I hadn't ticked off Carranza earlier, then maybe the negotiations would go more smoothly. *sigh*

## Talk 3

Paimon: (According to Nakul, non-Fontainians seem to be discriminated against. Will he ignore us as well? Is there a better way to go about this?)
Traveler: (Knock)
Someone: Who is it?
Traveler: A nameless traveler, an adventurer crossing all the nations of the world.
Someone: ...Since when did this place become a scenic attraction?
Paimon: #Stop playing around, {NICKNAME}. Don't forget what we're here for.
Traveler: We were asked to discuss something with you.
Paimon: Well... We were hired to ask about renting this room of yours. Of course, the client will be happy to pay you in Coupons!
Someone: Something similar happened a while ago... That client of yours really refuses to give up, huh? You were sent by that guy with the really funky way of talking, weren't you?
Someone: Forget it, out of respect for his perseverance... Tell me his offer.
Paimon: (Yes! Looks like we've still got some room for communication!)
Paimon: (Nakul told us about his expectation for the price. If we're making the offer, should we reveal his budget from the get-go? Or should we try getting a bargain?)
Traveler: (Let's just lay all the cards on the table.)
Paimon: Alright, Paimon's telling it like it is! The client's budget is 54,000 Coupons. Paimon thinks it's a good deal.
Someone: Only 54,000? That's just 10% higher than when he had that psycho hammer on my door... What a miser.
Paimon: Only? Paimon thinks it's a lot!
Someone: You know nothing. Haven't you ever heard of Carranza? He's much more generous. He offered... Uh, he offered me 108,000!
Paimon: Really? That much?
Someone: ...
Someone: O—Of course! Do I look like a liar to you?
Paimon: We can't see anything from this side of the door!
Paimon: (He didn't sound very confident. Maybe he made it all up to trick us.)
Paimon: #(What's our negotiation plan now, {NICKNAME}?)
Traveler: (We honestly only have this much, so it's his if he wants it.)
Paimon: We told the truth from the start. We only have 54,000. 108,000 is crazy...
Paimon: If you refuse, then... o—our hands are tied. We'll have no choice but to give up.
Someone: I just have to wait a little longer... Just a little longer and it'll rise all the way up. I'll definitely get a higher offer when you return the next time, and the time after that!
Someone: I never misinterpret the trends! It will go up! So I must hold on! I cannot rashly agree, cannot agree so easily...
Paimon: Is there a reason you're so confident?
Someone: Experience, of course! Based on my last two experiences, the upward trend will continue if I don't interrupt it. Isn't that obvious?
Paimon: What kind of logic is that!?
Someone: You're a child, so of course you don't understand. Anyway, it isn't the right time yet, so I won't agree. You can go now.
Paimon: #Well... It doesn't seem like he'll be changing his mind. Let's head back and pass the news to Nakul, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: (Since he's trying to play us, let's play him instead.)
Paimon: Aww... Paimon didn't expect we'd be up against a strong competitor like Carranza! It doesn't seem like we stand a chance!
Paimon: #Let's go, {NICKNAME}! We'll tell Nakul his offer was way too low to even be considered!
Paimon: In the meantime, good luck with Carranza, Door Guy! Bye now!
Paimon: ...
Someone: Huh? You're leaving already?
Someone: Hey! Are you still out there?
Paimon: ...
Someone: Heyyyyy! Don't goooo! Come back real quick, please!
Paimon: We could hear you shouting from all the way over there! What is it? Do you want us to get Carranza for you?
Someone: Oh, no, no! How could I trouble you like that?
Paimon: #It's no trouble at all, and it's even on the way, right, {NICKNAME}? Something like that would be a piece of cake!
Someone: *ahem*... You've got a real mean streak, don't you? Anyway, let's get down to business. Is your previous offer still valid?
Traveler: For now, but not for long.
Someone: Alright, I'll take it. But tell your client to come speak to me himself.
Paimon: #Alright! Let's head back and pass the news to Nakul, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: (It's hagglin' time! Let's put this price in the basement!)
Paimon: Then... 27,000! What do you think about 27,000 Coupons?
Someone: 27,000!? You kidding!? Are you here to insult me!? That offer's even lower than before!
Someone: I didn't even accept the offer from that psycho who hammered on my door, and the offer was way higher then! So what makes you think I'd accept this one!?
Paimon: #(What do we do, {NICKNAME}? Do we still stick to this offer?)
Traveler: The market price is falling, and it will only fall further.
Someone: Really? Doesn't Nakul really want this room? I'm sure he's willing to pay handsomely for it.
Paimon: Well... Everyone has a limit to their patience! You've already rejected him firmly twice, so, y'know, maybe he's feeling discouraged.
Paimon: It's half now, and next time, it might be... Oh! Maybe there won't even be a next time!
Someone: ...Let me... Give me time to consider.
Someone: ...
Paimon: Hey! Door Guy! You done thinking?
Someone: Alright, I'll take it. But tell your client to come speak to me himself.
Paimon: #Alright! Let's head back and pass the news to Nakul, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: (Let's raise it to match the client's budget.)
Paimon: Hmm... How about 54,000 Coupons then? It's double the last offer!
Someone: Only 54,000? That's just 10% higher than when he had that psycho hammer on my door... What a miser.
Someone: And the way your offers keep fluctuating... I bet there's room to increase it even further!
Someone: I just have to wait a little longer... Just a little longer and it'll rise all the way up. I'll definitely get a higher offer when you return the next time, and the time after that!
Someone: I never misinterpret the trends! It will go up! So I must hold on! I cannot rashly agree, cannot agree so easily...
Someone: You can go now. I won't accept your offer, at least this time.
Paimon: #Well... It doesn't seem like he'll be changing his mind. Let's head back and pass the news to Nakul, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: (Try opening the door.)
Someone: ...Hey! Wh—What are you doing!?
Paimon: Opening the door? We can't even see each other's face like this, and it's always better to discuss things face to face!
Paimon: And it's not like the rooms here are anyone's private property, right? They're just temporary quarters, so we should be able to enter too.
Someone: No! Of course not! You don't understand... Y—You don't know what kind of darkness is hiding on the other side...
Someone: Uh, I mean... I get nervous and freeze up in front of people. So let's talk through this door. Anyway, what brings you here?
Traveler: We were asked to discuss something with you.
Paimon: Yeah! We were hired to ask about renting this room of yours. Of course, the client will be happy to pay you in Coupons!
Someone: Something similar happened a while ago... That client of yours really refuses to give up, huh? You were sent by that guy with the really funky way of talking, weren't you?
Someone: Forget it, out of respect for his perseverance... Tell me his offer.
Paimon: (Yes! Looks like we've still got some room for communication!)

Traveler: (Keep trying to open the door.)
Someone: My goodness! Why won't you stop!? I told you that you don't know what kind of darkness is hiding on the other side...
Traveler: How do we know you're real if we don't speak face to face?
Someone: Of course I'm real... And so what if I'm not real? It's the same for me too, I don't know if you're real either! But aren't we still talking to each other?
Traveler: I can pinch Paimon's cheeks! She looks very real.
Someone: Fine, I guess you two can prove each other's existence.
Someone: Anyway, I refuse to open the door, and I advise you to stop trying to open it.
Paimon: *sigh*... But we were hired to inquire about renting this room of yours.
Someone: Then you should tell him to give up. There doesn't need to be another who is one with the darkness.
Paimon: You've been going on about the darkness for awhile now. What are you talking about?
Someone: You sound like a child, and children will never understand.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon thinks you're just making it all up to trick us!
Someone: Haha! That's possible too! But I've said what I want to say, and this door will not open for you nor will I agree to rent out this room. Please leave now.
Black Screen Text: The voice behind the door vanishes.\nAfter waiting a bit, you knock on the door again but receive no response. It is as though there never was a person on the other side of the door.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon thinks he's really ignoring us... Have we failed the commission?
Paimon: Well, no matter what, we should head back and tell Nakul what happened.
Traveler: Maybe I'm just a character in someone's dreams.
Someone: Then could it be my dreams? I've heard your voices... I heard you speaking to a lively young girl.
Paimon: #Maybe it's Paimon's dreams? If so... It would be great to still wake up and see {NICKNAME} by Paimon's side. Hmm...
Traveler: Ask not for my identity, nor inquire as to my origins.
Someone: Huh?
Paimon: (What are you doing? Speaking like that will only complicate things, won't it?)
Traveler: I am Melusine.
Someone: #{M#With a voice like that? If you're a Melusine then I'm a Blubberbeast. Give me a break!}{F#I'm not sick, I'm absolutely fine. Stay away from me!}
Paimon: (Isn't calling yourself a Melusine a little over the top!?)

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: We're back! So, here's what happened...
Black Screen Text: You give Nakul a detailed, blow-by-blow account of the negotiations...
Nakul: Oh... I see. Nevertheless, I always keep my word, so here the compensation we agreed upon earlier.
Nakul: Ugh... Now what am I going to do...
