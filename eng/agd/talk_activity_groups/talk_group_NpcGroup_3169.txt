Shinozuka: Ah! Who are you?! And how did you get here?
Shinozuka: Eek... Sorry about that, it just feels a little spooky around here. Am I thinking on it too much?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Shinozuka: I am a horror novel writer. I've recently hit a wall in my inspiration and it's been hindering my work.
Shinozuka: I heard rumors that said that there are ghosts in this deserted temple, so I came to see what I could find.
Shinozuka: But I immediately realized that this was no place for the living... Even the temperature feels lower here...
Shinozuka: Ah, what should I do? Should I go inside the temple and have a look? I need to prepare myself. I need to be brave...

Traveler: Silly-churl, billy-churl...
Shinozuka: Geez... what an eerie song! P—Please stop singing it!
Shinozuka: Y-You're a living person, right? You don't seem to be see-through...
Shinozuka: But if you're here, maybe... *shivers* Ahh, It's getting a little too scary in here...
Shinozuka: I'm just here for some inspiration for my horror novel! I—I didn't mean to offend you!

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry... Just take care of yourself, alright?
Shinozuka: Huh? You're not a ghost? Whew... Thanks for the reminder, but please don't scare me like that again.
Shinozuka: Wait... Can you sing the song that you were singing again?
Shinozuka: It has an eerie feel to it, can you teach it to me? Maybe I can find some inspiration if I sing it while I'm writing my novel.

Traveler: Be careful. Goodbye.
Shinozuka: Hmm, should I go into the temple or not...
