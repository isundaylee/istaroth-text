#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Many, many years ago, back when I still harbored the wish to become human, I prayed that I would one day be able to lead a normal life.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I never did fulfill that wish, but that doesn't mean I'm here pining ever harder for it to come true. Still... the fact that things didn't work out doesn't make my past self a fool for hoping in vain that they would, does it?
