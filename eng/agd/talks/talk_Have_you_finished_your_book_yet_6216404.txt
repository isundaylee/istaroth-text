Traveler: Have you finished your book yet?
Wang Ping'an: Not quite. Heh... well actually, to tell the truth, I'm still a long way off...
Wang Ping'an: I did collect quite a fair bit of material, but some of the stories don't have enough evidence to back them up.
Wang Ping'an: I've spent goodness-knows how much time just trying to confirm which sources are reliable.
Wang Ping'an: So as for my book... *sigh* Even I don't know how much longer it'll take at this point.
