The Fire Seed shattered!
And Nahida's, she's...!
I know
A sacrifice must be made
But not by the Lord of Dendro
We've all grown on this long journey
If the purpose of that growth was to return home
Then our wishes have come true
Would you lend us your power?
You knew it would come to this...
All the knowledge
Language
And emotions that you have learned
Will be reverted into pure elemental energy
In your new homeland
Nothing of who you were will remain
You won't be remembered by anyone...
Is that truly...
The return you've always dreamed of?
Lord of Dendro
Don't be sad
This is not
Your home
We
Go home
Lord of Dendro
Should also
Go home
Hear us please
Feel our heartfelt desires!
Awaken!
