Yegor: Hello, is there anything I can do for you?

## Talk

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Yegor: It's actually not that big of a deal. I'm applying to travel to Narukami Island, and I'm guessing that my request should be processed soon.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders on Narukami Island. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yegor: Goodbye.

## Talk

Yegor: The legendary treasure... Well now, isn't that exciting?

## Talk

Traveler: Treasure?
Yegor: Huh? You heard that? Oh, that's problematic, um...
Yegor: But judging by your gear, you seem like a seasoned adventurer... Well, then I'll be honest with you.
Yegor: I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like Konda Village or whatever that place is called...
Yegor: Sadly, I can't leave Ritou yet. If you can figure out a way to get into Inazuma, could you help me ask around?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yegor: Okay, goodbye.

## Talk

Traveler: Why did you come to Inazuma?
Yegor: As you can see, I'm a Snezhnayan merchant. So naturally, I'm here for business.
Yegor: Apart from doing business, I also plan to travel around Inazuma.
Yegor: I've heard a lot of legends about places in Inazuma. Perhaps I might be able to find something if I go check those places out.

## Talk

Traveler: Miss Ryouko?
Yegor: Yeah. Miss Ryouko is a lady who runs a food stall there. Have you ever tried her snacks?
Yegor: She knew that I wouldn't be used to the food here, so she changed the taste up for me... That's so sweet of her!
Yegor: I've heard that her husband passed away several years ago, leaving her to take care of the stall alone...
Yegor: Hmm... I suppose I should go visit her stall more often.

## Talk

Traveler: Aren't you afraid that I might take the treasures for myself?
Yegor: Hehe, I don't think you will. After all, I haven't told you the most important piece of information yet!
Yegor: Even if you find out anything about it, you'll still need clues from me to continue.
Yegor: And I on the other hand am no expert adventurer. I'll need a helping hand.
Yegor: Once you get the information, we can strike up a partnership. Rest assured, I will pay you handsomely.

## Talk

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Yegor: It's nothing serious, really. I'm living just fine here in Ritou, and business has been great since the Sakoku Decree was abolished.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders in Inazuma City. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...

Yegor: If you've got some contacts, could you help me ask around?

## Talk

Traveler: Help her...
Yegor: Say, if I can learn how to cook, would I be able to open a shop with Ryouko?
Yegor: I tried cooking recently, but it feels like I'm not made out of the right stuff for a chef...
Yegor: Have a try. Is my cooking really that bad...?
