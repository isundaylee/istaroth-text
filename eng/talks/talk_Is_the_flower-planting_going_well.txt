Traveler: Is the flower-planting going well?
Hanayama Kaoru: It's going pretty well, but something feels to be missing. The flowers don't seem to be blossoming as fully as before. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: *sigh* I guess the Mikage Furnace did have some sort of effect on the soil surrounding it after all...
Hanayama Kaoru: I've heard that there's someone named Vahid who sells specialty fertilizer in Ritou. It's said to be a local specialty from Sumeru.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'd grown quite interested in those fertilizers, so I got some people to ask around for me.
Hanayama Kaoru: But I've heard them say that the store owner... Vahid, I think his name is â€” whenever he introduces those fertilizers, all he does is repeat the same lines over and over. He never says anything about the details of how it works, either.
Hanayama Kaoru: That just doesn't seem... How should I say this? It just doesn't seem very reliable, you know?
