# Temporary Acclimatization


## Talk 1

Paimon: D—Don't look down! It's so high up here. Let's just get out of here once we've placed the instruments!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm... Would this place do? Ah well, let's just trust that this device will do its job.

## Talk 3

Woliu: That position right up ahead looks quite promising... Hmm... Maybe I'll take a look by the drawbridge in a bit.

## Talk 4

Woliu: ...These adjustments ought to do it.
Woliu: Ah, have you placed the instruments already? Thank you so much.
Woliu: Once I'm done placing this one, I'll give you your reward.
Traveler: You could have just given it to me alongside the rest of the batch.
Woliu: Thank you for your kindness. Unfortunately, this instrument is somewhat special. It requires some additional adjustments and calibrating, and I wouldn't want to trouble you that much.
Woliu: Let's go to that cliff over there and place it, then I'll give you your reward.
Paimon: That sounds really hard... Have you always worked like this?
Woliu: Haha, at least now, I only need to place my instruments down on the ground. In a previous expedition, I actually had to figure out a way to place one in the middle of a raging river...
Traveler: Couldn't you just take a boat over there?
Woliu: I mean, if all I needed to do was to drop the instrument, then sure, I could have just taken a boat, dropped it in the middle of the river, and left...
Woliu: But I was trying to measure the intensity of the water flow, so I had to keep that specialized instrument stationary within the heart of the stream so that it would neither float to the top nor sink to the bottom...
Woliu: Thankfully, there was a drawbridge above that river. Had there not been a bridge, I'd have had to ask some people to help me draw a rope between the two mountains...
Woliu: And then hang the device onto one of the ropes, before using another rope to move it to the center of the river and drop it in the water.
Woliu: Anyway... There's no point talking about that now. It's not like that's something we'll have to deal with... That said, we'll still pass by a drawbridge on our way to our destination.
Woliu: Come this way. That drawbridge isn't far from here.

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: After chasing away the Treasure Hoarders, you bring the people they cornered to a nearby pavilion to catch their breath.
Ms. Qiu: Thank you, I really don't know how to express my gratitude...
Traveler: You are... Ms. Qiu?
Ms. Qiu: #Ah... It's you, {NICKNAME}! Well, fancy running into you again! This is really... This is the second time that you've done me such a huge favor!
Paimon: Weren't you guys in Fontaine learning how to shoot a film? How are you already back in Liyue?
Traveler: Have you already mastered the art of filmmaking?
Yifeng: Well, rather than that...
Xingye: It'd probably be more accurate to say we've been forced to make some quick Mora first.
Ms. Qiu: You two...
Yifeng: Mr. Geisert is indeed a master filmmaker, and he's given us a lot of very useful advice. However...
Xingye: The films that he's helped us shoot have all really focused on big ideas and themes. As for the actual plot, or the world and things that were intended to be featured...
Yifeng: They kind of... In Mr. Geisert's words, they were "left behind the scenes."
Xingye: But we had looked into filmmaking in the first place to create a film that could bring attention to Chenyu Vale's excellent teas. If we had stayed with Mr. Geisert, we would have gone nowhere. So...
Ms. Qiu: So! I made the executive decision to put a pause on our studies and come back to shoot a documentary. We will use this opportunity to put our knowledge to the test!
Yifeng: ...Well, and because we'd just about run out of funds.
Ms. Qiu: H—Hey, haven't I told you about my plan already? As long as this documentary becomes a smash hit, we'll make our investment back in no time.
Yifeng: #Well, and then we found ourselves cornered by Treasure Hoarders on a drawbridge. Thankfully, the great {NICKNAME} came to save us.
Traveler: Isn't this place... a bit far from Qiaoying Village?
Traveler: But why are you here if you want to photograph Qiaoying Village?
Ms. Qiu: *sigh* Well, I wanted to get some majestic shots of the scenery, so the film would look a bit more imposing...
Ms. Qiu: But we got a bit too distracted while shooting and caught the attention of those Treasure Hoarders. We fled all the way here but were still cornered by them in the end...
Paimon: Wait, so the "pro photographers" Woliu mentioned earlier were...
Woliu: Yep, they were Ms. Qiu and her assistants.
Ms. Qiu: Wh—Where did you suddenly just pop up from, Ms. Woliu? I—I swear I didn't see you at all before now...
Woliu: I just hid myself very well.
Traveler: So you already know each other...
Ms. Qiu: I mean, Ms. Woliu is an expert hydrologist. No one knows these lands better than her.
Ms. Qiu: We'd consulted her several times before this on the best places to shoot.
Ms. Qiu: We've even tried to get her to join us! But she said that she could only consider once she's finished with her work.
Yifeng: Boss, um... While we were running away earlier, we seemed to have, um, left the case containing our film and equipment on the ground...
Xingye: I think... All the work that we've done so far is in that case...
Ms. Qiu: ...
Ms. Qiu: #Ms. Woliu! {NICKNAME}! Paimon! Thank you for everything! Wh—When you are next free, please find me in Qiaoying Village!
Ms. Qiu: After all... You've saved our lives, so we've got to prepare a reward in return!
Ms. Qiu: But for now, we must be off and away! Hurry! Where did we leave that box!? We need to go back for it!
Black Screen Text: Ms. Qiu and her assistants leave in a great hurry...
Paimon: That film case... sure has gone through a lot...
Woliu: They say that good things often come at the end of many tribulations. I'm sure Ms. Qiu's film will turn out to be a hit.
Woliu: Anyway, let me give you your reward. I'll go place my final instrument shortly, and then... probably go check on Ms. Qiu to see how she's doing.
Woliu: I've got to find her fast, or she'll probably be off archon-knows-where again, shooting her film.
Woliu: Hmm, I suppose she did just say that she can be found at Qiaoying Village. I'll just go check that out later.

## Talk 6

Ms. Qiu: *sigh* Maybe we should've grabbed the Qiaoying Village shots first after all...
Traveler: Is everything okay?
Ms. Qiu: #Ah, {NICKNAME}, Paimon! Thanks to you, we were able to save all of our stuff.
Ms. Qiu: I suppose, though, that if we were to ever return to that area in the future, we shall have to bring a few adventurers with us.
Paimon: So, um, about your feature film on tea... How is the shooting for that going?
Ms. Qiu: Well... We've currently got...
Xingye: A good opening sequence.
Yifeng: And a good artistic vision.
Traveler: So... you haven't shot much at all!?
Ms. Qiu: Well, you see... We're currently a little short on money. As a master filmmaker, Mr. Geisert's tuition doesn't exactly come cheap...
Ms. Qiu: Even though we've already shot a few smaller films, and made some Mora from that, a feature film of this length just burns through your budget as if it's nothing.
Xingye: Especially since Boss also turned down a few potential sponsors.
Yifeng: And refused many invitations to collaborate.
Ms. Qiu: Hey, what do you two know!? This was all so that we can create an excellent film that reflects our standards and our vision!
Xingye: But Boss... Didn't we start this film company because we wanted to make money...
Ms. Qiu: I... Stop worrying about that for now! Just go and set up the equipment!
Ms. Qiu: #{NICKNAME}, this is your reward. Thank you for always lending me your support.
Ms. Qiu: Once I've made the film of my dreams, I'll be sure to invite you over for the premiere, and then also take you out for tea.
Ms. Qiu: Yifeng, Xingye, make sure you get the best angle for our lighting! We're gonna get this in one take, you hear me?
Xingye: But Boss, we don't even have any actors here with us...
Yifeng: Isn't it all up to chance whether or not we can grab a scenery shot in one take...?
Ms. Qiu: J—Just hurry up and set up the equipment! And then wait here!
Traveler: Looks like you didn't lose any equipment, at least.

Woliu: I hope Ms. Qiu will be able to shoot the film of her dreams while ensuring her personal safety.
