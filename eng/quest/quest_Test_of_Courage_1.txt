# Test of Courage


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ayato~!
Traveler: Long time no see!
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, it's you two. Yes, it has been a while.
Paimon: Hehe, we heard the Yashiro Commission is holding a Test of Courage, so we came right over to sign ourselves up!
Paimon: We didn't expect to see you here in person, though. Does that mean this event is really important?
Kamisato Ayato: You think I only make an appearance for occasions that are deemed sufficiently important? Hehe.
Kamisato Ayato: It just so happens that this Test of Courage event was actually my suggestion, but naturally, I've left the planning and more trifling details to be arranged by my retainers.
Kamisato Ayato: Considering that such events are quite popular across Teyvat, I've had numerous examples to draw from, so everything should be in good order. I'm merely here to do a routine check on the progress of the event, that's all.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it... so what you're saying is you're not very busy right now.
Paimon: In that case, maybe you can give us a quick rundown of the event rules!
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, only Paimon could be so natural at ordering others around.
Kamisato Ayato: However... the possibility remains that we may yet require your assistance.
Paimon: Uh, sorry? What did you say?
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, nothing. Hehe, seeing as I apparently have some time, I suppose we may chat about the event for a moment.
Paimon: Yippee!
Traveler: Thanks, Ayato.
Kamisato Ayato: As its name implies, the event is a game designed to put one's courage to the test.
Kamisato Ayato: The venue for the event will be set up in the Chinju Forest. Before the start of each round, participants will be divided into teams of two.
Kamisato Ayato: Once teams have been formed, the event staff will announce the name of an item that has been placed in or around the Chinju Forest area.
Kamisato Ayato: The first person to locate the specified item will be declared the winner of that round.
Paimon: "The winner of that round"? Huh, so there's gonna be multiple rounds to the Test of Courage?
Kamisato Ayato: Precisely. There will be a total of three rounds in the Test of Courage because the event was actually orchestrated by three different parties.
Kamisato Ayato: Merchants raised event funding, the Kamisato Clan provided the grounds, and the Grand Narukami Shrine provided consulting services.
Kamisato Ayato: As such, each of these three parties have selected one item for participants to find, so naturally, the event will require three rounds to determine the winners.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it. So basically, it boils down to searching for stuff in Chinju Forest.
Paimon: We'll need to find one item each round, for a total of three items after three rounds. Simple enough for Paimon!
Kamisato Ayato: Yes, seems you've got the gist of it. We will be issuing different rewards based on the number of rounds won, so if a participant wins multiple rounds, then that will also be reflected in their final reward.
Kamisato Ayato: If a participant manages to find all three items, then they shall receive the grand prize provided by the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Paimon: Oh, a grand prize! Sounds like it could be really valuable!
Kamisato Ayato: As for its true value, I'm afraid you'll have to win the event first and ask Lady Guuji yourself.
Kamisato Ayato: Of course, this event is intended to measure your courage. If you withdraw from the event because you become too frightened, then you might as well forget about seeing any rewards.
Kamisato Ayato: I'm curious myself how many people will be brave enough to make it to the end. It'll be most disappointing if nobody claims the prizes we've prepared.
Paimon: Don't worry, those prizes are as good as ours!
Paimon: #Even though just the thought of this event sends shivers down Paimon's little spine, {NICKNAME} will be brave enough, no doubt about that!
Traveler: That's right!
Kamisato Ayato: I appreciate your enthusiasm. Hehe, I look forward to seeing how you perform.
Kamisato Ayato: Anyway, I think I've given you sufficient details. I'll add your names to the list of participants momentarily.
Kamisato Ayato: As for the three items you'll be searching for, please wait for a staff member to inform you at the start of the event.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh, and a friendly word of advice... Test of Courage events tend to give rise to a variety of strange rumors and stories, so please, be sure to exercise caution.
Paimon: Whoa! What did he mean by that!? Oh, will there be spooky things in Chinju Forest?
Traveler: It's certainly a possibility...
Paimon: Ahh! Now even you're trying to scare Paimon!
Paimon: Anyway, we've got an event to win... Grand prize, here we come!
Traveler: He's just pulling your leg.
Paimon: Heh, Paimon thought so, too... Well, in that case, there's nothing to be scared of!
Traveler: I'm not really that amazing...
Kamisato Ayato: No need to be so modest. Your journey thus far already speaks volumes of your bravery.

## Talk 2

Arataki Itto: Hold it right there! Haha, well if it isn't my compadres! Didn't expect to see you here.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon knows that voice... It's Itto! What are you doing here?
Paimon: Wait, don't tell Paimon that you're here for the Test of Courage.
Arataki Itto: Hah, what else! I'm sorry, but those prizes already belong to yours truly... Arataki "Ain't Scared of Nothin'" Itto!
Arataki Itto: I mean, well, that's what I really wanna say... But uh, I've actually got something else goin' on.
Paimon: Oh? What's that?
Arataki Itto: Ah, it's a long story. As soon as I heard about the Test of Courage, I got the gang together and was ready to bring everyone for the time of their lives.
Arataki Itto: But uh, it turns out the other members weren't as pumped about the event as me...
Arataki Itto: "Chinju Forest? We've already been there a million times. There's nothing scary about that place!"
Arataki Itto: "That event's just a game for kids! What a waste of time... Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!"
Arataki Itto: "Seriously, Test of Courage!? Ugh, whatever. I guess if that's what the boss wants..."
Arataki Itto: Can you believe that!? What a group of deadbeats... I'm not gonna put up with that, nuh-uh, not in my gang!
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now... dragging the gang to an event they don't want to go to won't be the best for your reputation as a leader.
Arataki Itto: Hey, this isn't about me!
Arataki Itto: As leader of the Arataki Gang, it's my duty to find new and tantalizing experiences for everyone. A happy gang means a happy life!
Arataki Itto: Even if they can't get it through their stubborn heads now, one way or another, I'll show them how much fun a Test of Courage can be!
Traveler: Wow, Itto...
Arataki Itto: Anywayyy, I'm no stranger to Chinju Forest. Sure, it was a little terrifying going through there, but hey, I'm used to it now!
Arataki Itto: And seriously, what kind of scary pranks could those guys in the Yashiro Commission ever come up with? If they can't scare anyone, then it's not gonna be a "test of courage" now, is it?
Arataki Itto: Not to mention, if the gang starts complaining... I won't ever be able to show my face around here.
Paimon: And after all that talk, it still boils down to you!
Arataki Itto: Ah, well, leading a gang can be complicated. You don't understand... Anywho, I've got a plan.
Arataki Itto: Since there's no way I can trust the Yashiro Commission to make a fun event, I've decided to step in and spice things up a little.
Paimon: Wait, you don't seriously mean that...
Arataki Itto: Oh, you bet I do! Yours truly is gonna be out scaring people! Hahaha, I'm taking this event to a whole 'nother level!
Arataki Itto: But it's gonna take more than an oni to make it happen... So I came here to recruit some help, and then I saw you come walking along.
Arataki Itto: C'mon! Come scare people with me, please!
Paimon: No way!
Arataki Itto: Pretty please!
Paimon: Forget it!
Arataki Itto: Pretty pretty pleaseee!
Paimon: Ugh, fine! But don't forget, we're here to win the Test of Courage and take home the grand prize.
Paimon: We'll help you out. Just don't get in the way of our prize.
Arataki Itto: Hahaha, yes! You're a real oni saver! Don't worry, with me around, winning the Test of Courage will be a piece of cake.
Arataki Itto: Alright, those participants won't scare themselves! Let's get out there, hahaha!
Paimon: What a noisy guy... Hmm, but after hearing him laugh and talk, Paimon doesn't feel scared anymore.
Paimon: Huh, maybe laughter is the key to making fear go away! If things get scary later, we can all start laughing at the top of our lungs!
Traveler: Okay.
Arataki Itto: #Hey! {NICKNAME}, Paimon, enough chitchat! We're gonna miss the event!
Paimon: Ah! Coming!
Traveler: Pretty sure that would just make things even scarier...
Traveler: You sure do care about your gang members...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Alright, this looks like the place.
Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or does it look a lot scarier than usual here?
Arataki Itto: Hey, Paimon!
Paimon: Waaah!!!
Paimon: Argh! Don't sneak up on Paimon like that! What do you want?
Arataki Itto: Ah nothing, I just had a thought occur to me.
Arataki Itto: I want to scare the gang members real good, but now that I think about it, I've never actually scared anyone before.
Paimon: ...You're only now realizing this?
Traveler: So you mean you want to practice first?
Arataki Itto: Practice? Oh, now there's an idea.
Arataki Itto: Hey, I've got it! Why don't you join the Test of Courage like everyone else, and I'll go hide and try to scare you from time to time?
Arataki Itto: Then, you two can judge my scaring skills. Alright, that's the plan. Lemme go get ready!
Arataki Itto: Just wait, you'll see how scary this oni can be! Hahaha!
Paimon: And there he goes, running off and still talking to himself...
Paimon: Well, we were here to join the event anyway. Guess we'll just have to pass Itto's little "test" along with whatever else the event throws at us.
Paimon: Oh, seems one of the event staff is over there. Let's go talk to her.

## Talk 4

Shrine Maiden: Aha, you must be here to participate in the Test of Courage?
Paimon: Yep, that's right! Uh, judging from your outfit, you must be one of the shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine!
Shrine Maiden: That's right. Huh, I can already see a dark aura surrounding the two of you... Yes, truly ominous.
Shrine Maiden: If you carelessly go running into the event, all it'll take is one little misstep and the darkness will swallow you up, hehehe...
Paimon: Whoa! What's with the sinister laugh...? Is she really a shrine maiden?
Shrine Maiden: Sure you don't want to back out? This is your last chance. I'll count it down... three... two... one. Welcome to the Test of Courage... Enter at your own risk.
Traveler: Uh, was that the first test?
Shrine Maiden: Sure, you could say that. You know, the most unfortunate tales always happen unexpectedly on just a normal, average day... just like today.
Shrine Maiden: But no need to worry. Allay your qualms and suspicions... Everything was already set into motion the moment you two stepped into this place.
Shrine Maiden: Just enjoy the calm before the storm... The first round is about to begin. Have you already decided on your partner?
Paimon: Ah, you finally said something that Paimon can understand! Yep, the two of us will be partners! We always make the best team!
Shrine Maiden: ...Hmm?
Shrine Maiden: #But it appears your names were written together as a single participant... "{NICKNAME} and Paimon."
Shrine Maiden: Which means, you'll have to find yourselves another partner in order to join the event.
Paimon: Wait, are you serious!?
Paimon: Ugh, if only Itto hadn't gone running off on his own, we could have had a partner! Now what should we do?
Shrine Maiden: As far as I know, there have been other participants who have yet to designate a partner. You could go ask around.
Shrine Maiden: Just be sure to make it quick. If you don't have a partner by the time the event starts, then you'll be immediately disqualified!
Paimon: Uh oh, we can't let that happen! Let's go see if we can find anyone to partner up with nearby!

## Talk 5

Kamisato Ayaka: #Oh, {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Greetings!
Paimon: Huh, it's Ayaka! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, my brother told me that the event would be "most interesting," and suggested that I personally participate.
Kamisato Ayaka: I have never experienced a Test of Courage event, so I don't really know what to expect.
Paimon: Oh, so this is your first time?
Kamisato Ayaka: To be frank, I'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural... I often worry that I haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, speaking of which, may I ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
Paimon: Actually, the shrine maiden just told us that we only count as a single participant, however that works... so we're looking for a partner now!
Kamisato Ayaka: Splendid. In that case, how would you like to be my partner?
Kamisato Ayaka: I always feel at ease when you're by my side. Ah, but of course, please don't let me get in the way if you wish to participate with someone else...
Traveler: I want to partner up with Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, you'd really like to? Then it's my honor... Or I suppose I should say, please pardon my inexperience.
Kamisato Ayaka: And if I appear to be frightened, please promise not to laugh at me.
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Kamisato Ayaka: Sure, I understand. I'll be waiting for you here.
Kamisato Ayaka: You may let me know if you need anything.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Gorou!
Gorou: #Ah {NICKNAME}, Paimon! I didn't expect to run into you here!
Paimon: We're here for the Test of Courage! How about you?
Gorou: Well... I was originally headed to Yae Publishing House to hand in responses for this month's issue of That's Life.
Gorou: But I had no idea that that crafty fox would be there! She brought up the Test of Courage event and suggested I give it a try.
Gorou: I wasn't interested, but she said, "The mighty general of Watatsumi Island isn't afraid of anything, is he?"
Gorou: And before I knew it, I found myself caught in her persuasive mind games. *sigh* I immediately regretted it the moment I arrived here. There could be traps everywhere...
Paimon: Oh, this event's sounding more and more dangerous...
Gorou: My instinct tells me that the forest is chock-full of ambushes. One misstep and it'll be over.
Gorou: Perhaps that crafty fox is hiding somewhere in the dark, waiting for another opportunity to tease me. Who knows, she might even use a Kamera and send embarrassing photos back to Watatsumi Island...
Gorou: Her Excellency once said, "When you march into an ambush, escape the enemy vanguard. When escape is impossible, then seek ample reinforcements."
Gorou: Hmm, now that you're here, maybe we can turn the tables. Could I ask you two to partner up with me?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Gorou.
Gorou: Great! This'll be our chance to fight side by side once again!
Gorou: With you around, there's nothing to fear! That crafty fox's games are over!
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Gorou: Oh, sure... I completely understand. Perhaps you have a friend you'd like to enter the Test of Courage with?
Gorou: Anyway, whoever you decide to partner up with, the most important thing is to enjoy the event. Good luck!

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: There was a familiar scent upon the wind. I knew that I'd see you around here.
Paimon: Kazuha!
Kaedehara Kazuha: We meet again.
Paimon: Paimon didn't expect to see you at the Test of Courage!
Kaedehara Kazuha: And why's that? Do I seem unsuited for this sort of event?
Paimon: No, not at all! It's just that Paimon's never seen you get scared, Kazuha.
Paimon: You're always so calm and collected. It's like you've never been scared by anything!
Kaedehara Kazuha: You flatter me. I suppose that's only a reflection of my time wandering the wilderness. I've heard many strange stories in my travels.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I can say I've even experienced a few myself. Over time, I must have gotten used to it.
Paimon: Ah, that makes sense! But uh, why do you want to join the Test of Courage?
Kaedehara Kazuha: After hearing the Yashiro Commission promote the rewards for this event, I was guessing that you two would show up.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since we hadn't seen each other for some time, I figured I might as well come and see you. After all, meeting someone after being apart for so long always lifts the spirits.
Paimon: Oh, so you were waiting for us?
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's right. So, tell me, how has your journey been lately?
Paimon: Things have gone pretty well! Uh, by the way, the shrine maiden told us that everyone needs a partner to participate in the Test of Courage event. Have you found a partner yet, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: No, not yet. Do you need me to be your partner?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well, then. I wouldn't mind a walk together.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I haven't participated in many of these events, so I'm curious what new experiences lie ahead.
Traveler: Let me think about it...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Take your time. We'll have plenty of chances to talk later, so there's no need to make a choice this very instant.
Kaedehara Kazuha: We could even go together for a late night snack once the event is over.

## Talk 8

Kamisato Ayaka: So, have you given it some thought?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, you'd really like to? Then it's my honor... Or I suppose I should say, please pardon my inexperience.
Kamisato Ayaka: And if I appear to be frightened, please promise not to laugh at me.
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, I see. That's alright.
Kamisato Ayaka: You may let me know if you need anything.

## Talk 9

Arataki Itto: Shh... I think we're getting close.
Arataki Itto: C'mon c'mon c'mon!!! Can't let them see us!
Paimon: Oh, here they come... So how are you going to scare them, Itto?
Arataki Itto: Easy peasy. We'll wait for them to get real close, and then we'll jump out and shout together. They won't know what hit them!
Paimon: Huh? What're we, a bunch of kids now...?
Traveler: I kinda doubt this will work...
Arataki Itto: Hey, don't underestimate me. It may sound simple, but I know exactly what will scare them.
Arataki Itto: The gang's probably moping along on their way back, saying things like, "this is boring" and "let's go home."
Arataki Itto: But it's dark and their guard is down — now's our chance. Having the three of us suddenly come flying outta the bushes is gonna scare 'em real good.
Arataki Itto: Before they come to their senses, we'll already be half-way to our next ambush spot!
Traveler: I guess it might work.
Arataki Itto: Shh! You hear that? Someone's coming. It must be them.
Arataki Itto: Alright, I'll count us in, ready? We jump on zero! Three...
Arataki Itto: Two...
Arataki Itto: One...
Arataki Itto: Haaah!!!
Paimon: Wooga booga booga!
Arataki Itto: Huh!? Wait, you're not—
Paimon: Th—They're... They're...!
Paimon: Ghosts!
Hitotsume Kozou: Ghosts!
Arataki Itto: Wait, hold on a second.
Paimon: Ahh! Did you see that!? They were definitely not human!
Paimon: So all the strange rumors about the Test of Courage are true... Oh, what should we do? Do you think the ghosts are coming after us?
Arataki Itto: Haha, Paimon, I didn't expect you to be such a baby!
Paimon: Hey, you're one to talk! You were the first to start running! Don't make fun of Paimon!
Arataki Itto: Well, you shouted "ghosts," so my instinct to escort you two to safety kicked in.
Arataki Itto: After all, real "ghosts" are terrifying, my skills are completely useless against 'em!
Traveler: So, why did we stop running?
Arataki Itto: Oh, because I just realized that they were also running from us.
Arataki Itto: Which means they were afraid of us, too... And if that's the case, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.
Arataki Itto: Now that I've calmed down, I'm starting to wonder if they were actually ghosts... They might have been people dressed up as ghosts to scare us!
Traveler: Were they sent by the Yashiro Commission then?
Arataki Itto: Definitely not. During the event, I took a little walk around the Chinju Forest and saw all the gimmicks that the Yashiro Commission had set up.
Arataki Itto: Those three weren't from the Yashiro Commission, but they did seem a little familiar...
Arataki Itto: C'mon, let's go back there and take a look!
Paimon: Huh? Now you wanna go back?
Paimon: B—But... th—there's still a chance that they were real spirits, right?
Paimon: If we go back now, they might try to eat us...
Arataki Itto: #It's alright, Paimon. If you're scared, you can stay here. {NICKNAME} and I will go investigate.
Paimon: Really? Whew, that'd be great!
Traveler: But wouldn't it be more dangerous to stay here alone?
Paimon: Oh, right! The last mystery novel Paimon bought from Yae Publishing House had a plot just like that...
Paimon: During the investigation, whoever said "I'm not going" would always be the next victim.
Paimon: Uh, so on second thought, Paimon's going with you. Don't ever leave Paimon behind! EVER!
Arataki Itto: It looked like they were running that way. But it's hard to say exactly where they went, so let's split up!
Paimon: But then you'll be all alone, which, according to the mystery novels, is super dangerous.
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! Don't worry about me. Once my rear's in gear, I'm not afraid of nothin'.
Paimon: Oh~ Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
Arataki Itto: They scared you that bad, huh? Looks like they really do have a knack for spooking people.
Arataki Itto: This time, I'll capture them and learn their art for scaring people! Anyway, I'll catch you around!
Paimon: And there he goes, running off and talking to himself... again.
Paimon: Uh, do we really have to go?
Traveler: We'd better go have a look.
Paimon: Ugh fine, let's go take a look then.
Paimon: But the second we see anything scary, we make a run for it! Got it?
Traveler: Just sitting here won't accomplish anything.
Traveler: Genius.
Traveler: So what exactly were you practicing all this time?

## Talk 10

Paimon: Well, we've already walked all the way here...
Paimon: Hmm, wonder where those three went... Paimon didn't see them anywhere.
Paimon: Maybe Itto was right! Maybe they've been hiding. Seems like they're not scary after all!
Traveler: Sounds like you've come to your senses.
Paimon: Hey! Listen up, you three little wimps! Paimon can already see you guys, so just come out and show yourselves!
Paimon: Waaaah!!! There's someone actually here! Paimon's scared again!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Don't do it, Chizuru...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: You can't give in to your desires... Others will suffer for it. You mustn't make the same mistake...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Just hold on a little longer... you've already come all this way, right?
Paimon: Uh, excuse us. Did you happen to see three rascals pass by here? Let Paimon tell you what they look like...
Traveler: Is it me, or does it look like she's burying something?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Are you... talking to me?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: To... someone like me?
Paimon: Waaaah!!!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: You have no business coming here. You shouldn't be anywhere near me...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: If you value your lives, you must leave immediately. Otherwise, your souls will be trapped here forever.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I won't warn you again. Now, away with you... be gone...!
Shikanoin Heizou: Wake up. Hey, Traveler... wake up!
Traveler: ...
Shikanoin Heizou: Thank goodness you're okay.
Traveler: Heizou?
Shikanoin Heizou: Before we get to that, I think someone needs your attention first.
Paimon: *sobbing*... Please don't eat Paimon... Paimon doesn't taste very good.
Paimon: Please! Avenge Paimon...
Traveler: Wake up, Paimon.
Paimon: Ah! Are you here to rescue Paimon?
Paimon: Oh, and Heizou's here too! Huh? What happened to that scary person just now? Did you manage to defeat her?
Shikanoin Heizou: Scary person?
Traveler: There was a person wearing a weird outfit...
Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, I see...
Shikanoin Heizou: I only found the two of you passed out here when I arrived. There was no one else around.
Shikanoin Heizou: What happened? Tell me all the details.
Black Screen Text: You tell Heizou everything that just happened...
Shikanoin Heizou: As I suspected, there appears to be something more behind this Test of Courage event.
Shikanoin Heizou: But let's get back to your original question, I haven't told you the reason I'm here.
Shikanoin Heizou: The truth is, I was commissioned to come here for an investigation.
Paimon: You were... commissioned?
Shikanoin Heizou: That's right. Some time ago, a peculiar game was discovered on the beach.
Paimon: A peculiar game on the beach... Ohh, could it be the Akitsu Yuugei game that Ei mentioned?
Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, so you've heard of it...
Shikanoin Heizou: The game quietly appeared some time ago and has since attracted some players. Apparently, it's very interesting.
Shikanoin Heizou: There was no one on the beach other than visitors and tourists when the game appeared. Imagine it like this: a stall suddenly appears on the street with no owner...
Shikanoin Heizou: And stranger yet, it could operate normally without anyone supervising it. People at the beach can start the game simply by talking to the Bulletin Board...
Paimon: Could it be run by... ghosts?
Shikanoin Heizou: Some tourists started to say that, and the rumor began to spread, until it became a full-blown ghost story. The further that story spread, the more plausible it seemed, causing people to be unwilling to go anywhere near the beach.
Shikanoin Heizou: The Tenryou Commission wanted to close the beach in order to investigate the situation and dispel the rumors, but before they could do anything, the Yashiro Commission organized the Test of Courage event here.
Shikanoin Heizou: People that were initially scared by the rumors began to believe that the "beach game" was actually a preview event planned by the Yashiro Commission for the Test of Courage, so visitors have gradually returned again.
Shikanoin Heizou: But I'm quite positive that the game never had anything to do with the Yashiro Commission...
Paimon: Wait, so the Yashiro Commission were fully aware of all the spooky stuff going on, but they still decided to hold their event here?
Paimon: But... Ayato must be one of the smartest guys we know. What the heck was he thinking!?
Shikanoin Heizou: Who knows? But I'd rather trust tangible evidence than speculate on his thoughts.
Shikanoin Heizou: As for my commission, apparently someone reported that they found themselves trapped for hours on the beach while playing the game.
Shikanoin Heizou: According to his own account, he kept returning to the same location no matter which way he went, and even though his friends were nearby, they couldn't see him.
Paimon: Ah, that sounds so scary!
Shikanoin Heizou: Even though it was obvious that he wasn't telling me the whole story, the testimonies of his friends did validate that what he said actually occurred.
Shikanoin Heizou: On top of that, it was also this very incident that led to all the ghost rumors. No one dared to go near the beach until the Yashiro Commission announced the Test of Courage...
Shikanoin Heizou: Who set up the game on the beach? And why did the Yashiro Commission help them cover it up?
Shikanoin Heizou: I need to uncover the truth, so I'm here to investigate.
Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, don't mind me. Working together will only raise suspicion, so I'll undertake my own investigation for the time being.
Shikanoin Heizou: However, please proceed with caution. Based on my observations, most people are still unaware of anything happening here. Telling people that something's amiss might cause quite a stir.
Black Screen Text: The air is permeated with strange fragrance of flowers, which makes you drowsy...
Traveler: And who spoke strangely.
Traveler: C'mon, wake up.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Traveler: Wh—What happened...?
Traveler: You're finally back to your normal self, Paimon.

## Talk 11

Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, it seems we'll be the first to find it.
Paimon: Why do you say that?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I can sense a sweet aroma on the wind. The Dango Milk should be nearby.
Paimon: Really!? Let Paimon have a look here... Oh, you're right! There it is!
Paimon: Yippee! Who would've guessed we'd be the first ones! Hmm? But what's that scarecrow doing here?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Careful...
Paimon: Whaa!!! It... It's standing up! Is it alive!?
Traveler: Calm down.
Paimon: What? Oh, well it sure worked on Paimon!
Paimon: But that should be the end of it... right? There doesn't seem to be anything else around here.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It seems the test wasn't as scary as I had anticipated. However, I have enjoyed the experience together with you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Now that we've found the Dango Milk, we can head back the way we came.
Kaedehara Kazuha: What's the matter? Is there something over there?
Traveler: I saw someone I know just now...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, I see. So she is at the Test of Courage, too.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To avoid any unnecessary complications, I'd prefer not to meet with her. You may pass on my regards.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There is a lot of Dango Milk here. I'll take half of it back and leave the rest to you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Till we meet again.
Traveler: It's just a device meant to scare you.

## Talk 12

Shrine Maiden: Have you found a partner yet?

## Talk 13

Shrine Maiden: Ah, it looks like you've found yourselves a partner.
Shrine Maiden: The event is just about to start. I will now reveal the item you'll be looking for in the first round.
Shrine Maiden: It's called "Dango Milk."
Paimon: Dango Milk?
Shrine Maiden: Correct. Tomoki was kind enough to provide us with his Dango Milk and it has been hidden somewhere in the Chinju Forest.
Shrine Maiden: The path will be marked with <color=#00E1FFFF>signs</color> to guide you, but some strange and unusual things may occur along the way... If you ever feel you can't handle it, you may withdraw from the event at any time.
Shrine Maiden: Now, if you're ready, then you may begin.
Paimon: We don't want anyone to beat us to it — let's go!

???: Oh no, you spotted me!
???: Shh! Please, not a word of this to anyone! Otherwise, they'll dock my pay.

## Talk 16

Kamisato Ayaka: Look, everyone. Isn't this the Dango Milk we are searching for?
Kamisato Ayaka: And there's a scarecrow beside it. Strange... What is that doing here?
Paimon: Well, it doesn't matter now! Since we found the Dango Milk, then we must be the first ones here, right?
Paimon: But there's no way we can carry back so much Dango Milk. Why don't we drink some to lighten the load a little?
Paimon: Paimon could use a sip... Whaa!!! The scarecrow stood up!
Kamisato Ayaka: It appears to be guarding the Dango Milk here...
Paimon: You mean, it's watching if we touch the Dango Milk? Uh, don't worry, P—Paimon didn't even touch it!
Traveler: Let's try not to scare ourselves.
Paimon: Oh, maybe you're right, Paimon will try to calm down... Let's try some together!
Black Screen Text: You drink some Dango Milk with Ayaka...
Paimon: Mmm, tastes great!
Kamisato Ayaka: Indeed. Any fears I had a moment ago seem to have been dissipated by the Dango Milk.
Kamisato Ayaka: And now that I look around, this is Chinju Forest as I have always known it. After making it here, it doesn't seem nearly as frightening.
Kamisato Ayaka: My brother once said that fear stems from one's heart, and if your heart is at peace, then fear naturally dissipates. Now I understand what he meant.
Kamisato Ayaka: But fear is not entirely bad... Although I've been scared a few times, I still feel happy now.
Kamisato Ayaka: I would like to continue walking through the forest for a while. Will you accompany me?
Traveler: I think I saw someone I know just now...
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, I see. Well, I shall continue walking while you go greet your friend.
Kamisato Ayaka: Don't worry. Now that I've experienced the event once already, I won't be easily frightened. I'll see you later. Have a lovely chat with your friend.
Traveler: You're getting scared over nothing.

## Talk 17

Gorou: Oh, have you decided whether or not to participate with me?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Gorou.
Gorou: Great! This'll be our chance to fight side by side once again!
Gorou: With you around, there's nothing to fear! That crafty fox's games are over!
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Gorou: Oh, alright... To be honest, I was really looking forward to the chance of teaming up with you.
Gorou: With the two of us fighting together, I feel like we could take on any enemy!

## Talk 18

Gorou: *sniff* *sniff* That's the scent of Dango Milk — we've found it!
Paimon: Oh! It really is Dango Milk! A lot of it, too.
Paimon: And look, there's a scarecrow here. Now who could have knocked it over— Wh—Whaa!!! It's standing up!
Paimon: #Ghost! It's a ghost! {NICKNAME}, save Paimon!
Traveler: It's only a trick meant to scare people.
Paimon: Huh, really? Whew, that almost scared Paimon's socks right off.
Paimon: Oh, looks like we managed to be the first ones here! Hehe, with so much Dango Milk, it wouldn't hurt if we drink a couple of bottles, right?
Gorou: Is that permitted?
Paimon: Everyone knows that Dango Milk spoils quickly if it's left out. Besides, we should try some!
Unknown NPC (BLACKSCREEN): You drink some Dango Milk with Gorou...
Gorou: Mmm, that's delicious! I would like to buy some to bring back to Watatsumi Island.
Gorou: I bet the troops would be happy to have such a good-tasting drink. It's unfortunate that it spoils easily...
Gorou: Let's split the remaining bottles and start heading back. Ready?
Traveler: I think I saw someone I know just now...
Gorou: Oh, was it one of your friends? Do you need to go talk to them?
Gorou: In that case, I don't want to get in your way. I'll take back the remaining Dango Milk. Maybe I'll run into you in the next Test of Courage round!
Traveler: There's nothing to be scared of.

## Talk 19

Kaedehara Kazuha: Do you need me to be your partner?
Traveler: I want to partner up with Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well, then. I wouldn't mind a walk together.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I haven't participated in many of these events, so I'm curious what new experiences lie ahead.
Traveler: I still need to give it some more thought.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Sure, please don't worry about me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The point of friends gathering is to have a good time. Worrying will only dampen the mood.

## Talk 21

Paimon: Ei?
Paimon: Whoa! It's really you! What are you doing here?
Raiden Shogun: Oh, hello. Miko told me about the Test of Courage event taking place here. I thought I would come and have a look.
Paimon: Ah, so that's why you're here. So, what do you think of the Test of Courage, are you having fun?
Raiden Shogun: It's more or less the same as I remember before.
Raiden Shogun: I wasn't scared by anything... But on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
Paimon: Oh, that Miko! Did she send Ei here to scare people on purpose!?
Traveler: Certainly seems that way.
Paimon: If that's the case, it feels like Ei isn't really experiencing the event like everyone else...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon has an idea! We'll give you a bottle of the Dango Milk we just found. That would make you a winner in this round, too!
Raiden Shogun: Ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? Sure, I'll take one.
Raiden Shogun: Actually, I've sensed a familiar feeling ever since I arrived here. It's brought some old memories to mind.
Paimon: Huh? A familiar feeling?
Raiden Shogun: Have you been down to the beach by any chance?
Traveler: Yes, we have.
Raiden Shogun: I was just strolling nearby when I noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
Raiden Shogun: I took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
Raiden Shogun: I saw the game was called "Akitsu Yuugei." I'm guessing it originated from "Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura." The thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
Paimon: Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura? What's that?
Raiden Shogun: It's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. It was once quite popular during festivals.
Raiden Shogun: Makoto also enjoyed playing Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura when she was alive. Hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in Inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
Raiden Shogun: The youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
Paimon: Oh, does that mean you could eat the delicious festival food whenever you liked?
Raiden Shogun: Yes. The youkai called their celebration the "Mikawa Flower Festival." Makoto and I attended it once... She found it particularly fascinating.
Raiden Shogun: Sadly, the past has all but vanished. But seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
Paimon: Sounds like it could be fun! Paimon would like to play!
Raiden Shogun: If you're interested, you can go to the beach and give it a try.
Raiden Shogun: It was still being set up when I was there earlier, but I assume it should be ready soon.
Paimon: Yay!
Raiden Shogun: I shall return to Tenshukaku. Miko told me that the Test of Courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
Raiden Shogun: Considering you two, I think you should have no problem making it to the end.
Paimon: Oh, of course! Hehe...
Raiden Shogun: I know you can do it, good luck.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember hearing anything about a game on the beach from Ayato... You think that activity's also planned by the Yashiro Commission?
Paimon: Oh, the more Paimon thinks about it, the scarier it feels... Ugh, this whole Test of Courage thing is keeping Paimon on edge!
Paimon: Anyway, the first round of the event should be finished by now, so let's head back!
Traveler: No, not yet...
Traveler: Sure sounds like something she'd do...

## Talk 22

Arataki Itto: So? What'd you think? Do I know how to scare people or what!?
Paimon: Oh uh, let Paimon think...
Paimon: Uh... Paimon was hiding behind you the entire time, so Paimon didn't really notice Itto scaring us at all...
Paimon: #Uh, Paimon will leave this one to {NICKNAME}! So, was Itto scary or not?
Traveler: He was very subtle...
Arataki Itto: What? No way! Listen, every time I made my move, I scared the living daylights out of everyone!
Arataki Itto: Even I had no idea I possessed such talent... But this is just what I needed to hear! Now I'll show 'em — the gang will know just how terrifying their leader can be!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, I already figured out which path they'll be taking, so let's wait nearby and scare the pants off 'em!
Arataki Itto: Hahaha, now things are getting interesting! You ready? We've got people to scare!
Traveler: You're the scariest oni ever.
Arataki Itto: Oh? Really?
