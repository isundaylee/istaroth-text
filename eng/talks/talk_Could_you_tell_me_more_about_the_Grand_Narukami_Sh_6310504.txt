Traveler: Could you tell me more about the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Inagi Hotomi: The Grand Narukami Shrine is a place for making offerings and performing ceremonial affairs. Everything here is done according to the will of Her Excellency the Electro Archon.
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae Miko is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine. She is in charge of everything here.
Inagi Hotomi: But Lady Yae is very busy indeed, and she is also the boss of Yae Publishing House. So when she is not around, I will take over some of her work.
Inagi Hotomi: If you need any help from the shrine, feel free to ask me.
