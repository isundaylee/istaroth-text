Traveler: What is this place?
Ding Sr.: This is the Qiaoying Village tea workshop. Most of the tea leaves are sent here after being picked.
Ding Sr.: You might not realize that tea leaves require several processes and careful handling before they can be used to make tea.
Ding Sr.: Simply put, we need to remove the excess moisture in the leaves to deepen their fragrance and make them easier to store.
Ding Sr.: Our workshop's in charge of sunning, baking, and then stirring them in a pan.
Ding Sr.: Some types are then taken back by the tea farmers for additional processing, such as piling and fermenting.
Ding Sr.: If you have time, you should stay in the village for a month or so. That way, you can see the full process, from leaf picking to the moment the tea's served up on tables.

Traveler: What's the machine in that room over there?
Ding Sr.: Ah, you're asking about the stirring machine, yes? Compared to our village's history, the machine is very young.
Ding Sr.: We used to use a huge tea cauldron for stirring. They said it was an adeptal mechanism of some sort...
Ding Sr.: The traditional process creates a traditional flavor, but we must also meet the quantity demands, so these days our workshop uses new, faster machines.
Ding Sr.: That said, with higher efficiency and more heat, the need to ensure quality is even greater.
Ding Sr.: That's why people like me, with more than thirty years of experience, are needed to make sure things don't go wrong.
Ding Sr.: As for Ding Jr... He's got another decade of buckling down and learning this craft ahead, that's for sure...
