# Ministry Missions


## Talk 1

Ms. Yu: Hello. Are you interested in doing some work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs?
Traveler: Ministry of Civil Affairs?
Ms. Yu: Yes, the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Ms. Yu: My name's Ms. Yu, and I'm a resource manager with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Ms. Yu: By resource management, we don't just mean the management of material goods. We also manage information and human resources.
Ms. Yu: I trust that you, too, understand how important resource management is to a city that prizes commerce as much as Liyue does.
Ms. Yu: Exchanging material for manpower and intelligence, and using all three to solve issues â€” that's our Ministry's specialty.
Ms. Yu: To put it more plainly, you help us, we pay you. Haha.
Ms. Yu: But there are still more details to it than just that, of course.
Ms. Yu: Go ahead, have a look for yourself. You can see what work is available to you now.

## Talk 2

Ms. Yu: How about it? If there's work you're interested in, you can get started right away.
Ms. Yu: If you're able to successfully complete the work, not only will you gain reputation, but there will be rewards awaiting you as well. It will definitely be worth your while.
Ms. Yu: Still, the work you can take on is dependent on your reputation.
Ms. Yu: Given that you're just starting out, you will most likely only be able to take fairly routine tasks for now.
Ms. Yu: But if you would like to try your hand at more important tasks and see better rewards, then you'll have to earn the trust of others. I'd suggest taking as much work as you can.
