## Talk 1

Changchang: I hope that our puppy isn't starving...

## Talk 2

Changchang: Have you fed our puppy yet?
Traveler: It should have eaten its fill.
Changchang: #Thanks so much, {M#Sir}{F#Ma'am}!
Changchang: Here, this is for you. I saved it up myself just to thank you!
Changchang: Granddad should be here in a few days to take me to go feed it.
