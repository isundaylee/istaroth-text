Traveler: About the aftermath of the war...
Avilix: Ah, thank you for your concern. The reconstruction work is progressing at a steady pace, and our stockpile of gemstones and equipment is finally being put to good use.
Avilix: Some of our warriors were injured, while others are now gone... It is a great pity. You may notice that some familiar faces in Natlan are no longer to be seen.
Avilix: But you needn't look sad. They fought for the glory of Natlan, and their sacrifice was not in vain.
