## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Layla: Okay, everyone's given us a lot of useful information. Let's go through it and try to organize everything.
Layla: Some things we heard were pretty straightforward, but others were just ridiculous...
Traveler: We should be able to figure out more about its identity and whereabouts.
Layla: Yeah, let me think and see what I can make of it.
Layla: (Okay, calm down Layla. I know the info's all over the place, but you can definitely do it.)
Layla: (First, let's try to figure out the Seelie's identity based on the clues we currently have.)
Layla: (Then, we'll analyze where it's been sighted and its motives... Finally, we'll piece everything together...)
Layla: (From there, we should be able to predict its movement. Alright, let's give it a try.)

### Additional Talk 2

Layla: We should be able to see more from up above, but how do we get up there?
Layla: Let's try using the Elemental Monuments in the area.
