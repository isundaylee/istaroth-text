Traveler: You're that busy, huh?
Muning: You bet. There's so much work to be done that I reckon that I'll start losing hair over it soon.
Muning: But there's nothing for it: the resumption of work at The Chasm is good for Liyue as a whole, of that there is no doubt. But the deluge of work will always have to be taken up by an unfortunate few.
Muning: Still, you have my thanks. Things are busy here, sure, but it's much improved from how things were when it was just Zhiqiong and a couple others.
