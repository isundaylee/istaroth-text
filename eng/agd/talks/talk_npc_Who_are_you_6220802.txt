Traveler: Who are you?
Verr Goldet: My name is Goldet and I come from Mondstadt. I am the boss here at the Wangshu Inn.
Verr Goldet: Lest you think I was the boss' wife.
Verr Goldet: I'm the boss, with a capital "B-O-S-S."
Traveler: I've heard the rumors...
Verr Goldet: Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
Verr Goldet: What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
Verr Goldet: All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
Verr Goldet: Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
Traveler: Whose is this kitty?
Verr Goldet: *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
Verr Goldet: Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
Verr Goldet: You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief â€” you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.
