#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Oh? Now this is a first. Who goes to the Akademiya in the middle of a festival?
Traveler: You're here, aren't you?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: This is the only place where I can escape all the commotion.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Go have your fun, and don't tell anyone you saw me here.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: These festivals don't come by often, so you might as well let me enjoy it in my own way.
Traveler: You're not going to join in on the fun?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Do I strike you as someone who wants to hold hands and dance with everyone?
