Layla: Maybe it would be nice to read something a little lighter for once. It would be a nice break from the academic texts I usually read â€” they give me such a headache.
Layla: Hmm... Actually, maybe not. I can't afford to relax yet, or I'll end up missing my next thesis deadline...
Layla: I can't just rely on "The Stars' Blessing" to see me through. I have to put in the work myself!
