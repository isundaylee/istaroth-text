Traveler: Mighty hero?
Dugu Shuo: That's right. Heroes are always commemorated at Lantern Rite.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph, and one day I too shall become a hero that's revered by one and all, I'm certain of it!
Dugu Shuo: Just you wait. By this time next year, crowds will be gathering to light lanterns for me, hehe...
Traveler: But this is the festival for remembering fallen heroes.
Dugu Shuo: Huh? You mean they don't commemorate you unless you're dead?
Dugu Shuo: You're joking, right? I—I don't believe you!
Dugu Shuo: W—Well then, never mind about next year's Lantern Rite...
Dugu Shuo: In 50 years... No, in 100 years, everyone will remember this mighty hero during Lantern Rite!
