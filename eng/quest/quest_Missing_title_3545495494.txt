### Additional Talk 1

Raimondo: Any questions? Honorary Senior Researcher?
Traveler: What will happen to Nacker and Edwin?
Raimondo: They will temporarily stay at the Fortress of Meropide where they will repent for their misconduct.
Raimondo: That said, the Edwin I know doesn't do "repent."
Raimondo: No matter, as long as Edwin is kept away from research equipment and Arkhium.
Raimondo: As for Nacker... I don't believe he'll cause more trouble for us.
Raimondo: I... I can only hope I don't run into situations that would require their expertise...
Traveler: Did Fusilier use to worship Edwin?
Raimondo: ...Edwin Eastinghouse is a genius. People in the same field either gave up on themselves or became his followers.
Raimondo: Miss Fusilier is a very passionate and creative researcher, often achieving great results with minimal resources.
Raimondo: After joining the Tech Sect III of the Arkhium Research Project, she was put in charge of the structural design of the suppressor and had frequent run-ins with Edwin.
Raimondo: Maybe that's when she started idolizing Edwin. Just like the other followers, Edwin's approval became her only pursuit.
Raimondo: After the explosion, she refused to believe that Edwin was the one who caused it, so she applied to join the investigation in an attempt to clear Edwin's name.
Raimondo: Now that you've dealt with Edwin, what do you make of him?
Paimon: A freak of nature who cares only for his research! He always tries to push the blame to others, and he can't even remember Miss Fusilier's name!
Raimondo: That sounds like him, all right. Other than his research, there's rarely anything that's worth a second of his attention.
Raimondo: And he cares for nothing else as long as his research runs smoothly. Not even when his own subordinates stole the Institute's assets to sell.
Raimondo: I only approved Fusilier's application to join the investigation... so she would come to realize she was chasing an image of him she fabricated.
Raimondo: Now that image has finally been shattered, I can only hope she picks herself up soon... The Fontaine Research Institute cannot afford to lose more of its people.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Raimondo: Goodbye, Honorary Senior Researcher.

### Additional Talk 2

Choiseul: Phew... It's okay. It's okay. The nightmare is over.
Traveler: How do you feel about Edwin's "coming back to life"?
Choiseul: Whoa! You scared me! How I feel? Nothing, to be honest. I only hope that irresponsible scoundrel pays for what he's done!
Choiseul: Personally, I'd tie his hands and legs up and blindfold him to stop him from getting his hands on Arkhium if I could!
Traveler: Do you feel relieved, now?
Choiseul: A bit more relieved, yes, compared to before.
Choiseul: But, to be honest, locking Nacker and Edwin up together? Gosh! I can't even imagine what those two would be up to!
Choiseul: Explosion has been past and done. So what's next? Flooding the entire Fontaine with Fonta? I can't even imagine...
Traveler: I hope you have a good day.
Choiseul: You too, Honorary Senior Researcher.

### Additional Talk 3

Fusilier: No value... My research has no value...
Lemarcq: Miss, please don't think that way. Your invention saved my life.
Fusilier: But... But... Mr. Edwin... *whimper* *sob* Edwin said this thing is worthless...
Chaussivert: That just means that that Edwin's blind! This thing is a treasure! Worthless? Ha! I'd give an arm to have one for each of my men!
Traveler: Edwin's a bad person. He's full of baloney.
Fusilier: Mr. Edwin is not a bad person! He... He... Anyway... He can't even remember my name! I even showed him my designs so many times...
Paimon: Miss Fusilier, you are very talented! Why do you let that Edwin guy judge your worth?
Traveler: He doesn't see what I see in you!
Fusilier: Râ€”Really?
Chaussivert: Of course. Take it from all of us.
Fusilier: But... you don't know research... *sobs*
Paimon: Miss Fusilier... she's no longer coherent. I think we better leave her alone for a bit...
Chaussivert: Okay... Lemarcq and I will be right here. Call us if you need anything.
