# Until the End of the World


## Talk 1

Paimon: The time has come to slay the dragon! How are you feeling? Nervous?
Paimon: Paimon's curious to see what this "end of the world" place is like. C'mon, let's go meet the others at the station.

## Talk 2

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Are we... inside the black mist?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Huh? I see something up ahead.

## Talk 3

Kirara: The book's on the move again.

## Talk 4

Navia: So that's why you took the stars... Because you missed your mom.

## Talk 5

"M": "...Go forth and witness this world, my..."
Traveler: ...
Navia: Are you okay, Miss Nilou?
Nilou: #I'm fine, but I think Traveler is still unconscious...
Navia: We're lucky this guy caught us on the way down!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph, passed out from a little fall, did you? How fragile...
Navia: #Ah, cut him some slack. Traveler's had a rough few days, we should just let him nap for a bit.
Nilou: Uh? But my... my leg's falling asleep...
Nilou: #You couldn't have set him down on the grass over there, Hat Guy?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hah... I go out of my way to save four people who fall out of the sky, and now you're nitpicking my choice of soft landing? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: #Ah, he's awake!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Morning, sunshine. You were having a nice little dream there, weren't you? Not gonna lie, it was kind of adorable.
Traveler: What happened...
Traveler: What happened...?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You and your friends fell from the top of that waterfall, and you passed out along the way. Guess someone couldn't keep it together...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Sorry to break it to you, but crashing into the ground doesn't take you to another world. That kind of thing only happens in those stupid light novels they sell in Inazuma.
Paimon: Also, he kind of set you down on Nilou's lap. So, that's where you've been napping all this time.
Nilou: P—Paimon!
Traveler: ...Sorry...
Nilou: Oh, no... It's alright... I—I'm just glad you're okay.
Navia: You didn't hit your head, did you? Is the dizziness gone?
Traveler: I feel a lot better...
Traveler: But it seemed like someone was talking in my head just now.
Navia: Really? What did they say?
Traveler: "...Go forth and witness this world..."
Traveler: "...Be nice to everyone."
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: The fog you see around here can have *a hallucinatory effect*. Apparently, it's the work of that dragon. Maybe you inhaled some while you were freaking out on your way down...
Navia: #Uh, Traveler, Nilou... Do you know this Hat Guy person?
Nilou: Oh, yeah. He's a student at the Akademiya. We met during the last Interdarshan Championship. He was representing the Vahumana Darshan.
Navia: Well, then... Hello there, friend! I'm Navia, the President of Spina di Rosula. It's very nice to meet you. So, should I just call you Hat Guy as well? Seems like that's what everyone's calling you.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Sure, whatever.
Nilou: Wait, Hat Guy, what's that sword around your waist?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Tch, an unwelcome encumbrance, that's what... I've had it ever since I woke up here. Tried to toss it, but no matter what I do, it always reappears. Such a pain...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Anyway, if any of you want the "Hero's Sword," you can have it.
Paimon: Wait... It's called what?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: The "Hero's Sword," meant to be wielded by the hero... I know, me of all people, right? The irony.
Paimon: What!? ...YOU'RE the Hero of this world?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Will you calm down? It's just a dumb title.
Paimon: Oh, uh... It's just that, this entire time, we thought we were the heroes of the prophecy...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Well, if it means that much to you, you're welcome to claim the title. You'd be doing me a favor.
Traveler: I'm good, actually...
Paimon: That's not the point... The real question is: If you're the hero, then where the heck have you been all this time?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Looking for a way out.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I heard there's a boat in this area that can bring you to another world, so I came to investigate.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: But look at the state of things around here — the lighthouse collapsed, the boat won't budge... I say we try to find a different way out.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon's guessing a voice told you what you were supposed to do here... That's what happened with Navia and Nilou, at least.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hah, you expect me to take orders from some disembodied voice?
Paimon: Hey, wait! Where are you going?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: To find the so-called "source of this world's misfortune" — the dragon responsible for this whole mess.
Navia: Wait, we came here to fight the dragon as well. Why don't we go together?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Tch. Grab that *dragon scale* over there before you leave. It'll come in handy later.
Paimon: A dragon scale? Where? How did you know about it? What's it for? And—
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Have you ever considered keeping your questions to yourself? Because if you actually expect me to answer them all, we'll be here until the next Interdarshan Championship.
Paimon: You little...! Ugh, Paimon thought you might've learned some manners by now, but clearly not!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Well, we made it.. But, with the force of this waterfall, there's no way we're getting through!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Quick, take out the dragon scale.
Paimon: Wait, but... No, Paimon doesn't need to ask you anything! Hmm... The dragon scale can turn anything it touches into toy blocks, so... Aha! You want to use it to block off the water!
Paimon: See! Paimon can figure things out all on her own!

## Talk 7

Paimon: This should do it, right? Wow, this scale is amazing! It turns everything it touches into something hard, almost like a toy block. Doesn't seem to work on us, though.
Navia: It spews out poison, and transmutes everything it touches... No wonder they call it the "evil dragon."
Wheel: Your Majesty! Madame Fairy! Brave Hero!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: What are you looking at me for? He's obviously talking to you.
Nilou: Mr. Wheel! You didn't get hurt when we fell, did you?
Wheel: No, not at all. Thankfully, the young man in the hat was kind enough to lend me a hand.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Tch...
Wheel: There seems to be a village over here. Some of the residents used to work in the toytanium mines, and some came to fight the dragon, then got stuck here.
Nilou: I see... I'm glad they're all safe and sound. I can try to use my magic to fold a boat to bring everyone back.
Navia: I'll help, too! Still, I think we need to take care of the dragon first. We don't want it to start causing trouble when we're trying to load people onto the ship.
Wheel: Apparently, the villagers often see the dragon fly into *a space behind the waterfall*. They think that's the location of its lair.
Paimon: Then, we should look around and try to find a way in!
Wheel: I'll wait here for your triumphant return. Your Majesty, brave heroes... Please, be careful.

## Talk 8

Nilou: ...
Paimon: What's wrong, Nilou?
Nilou: Oh, nothing. It's just... I sensed a very powerful magical signature just now...
Navia: Guess this is the dragon's lair after all.
Paimon: Huh? When did you put your hat on?
Navia: Well, we're getting ready to fight, aren't we? I feel more comfortable in my regular outfit. Hat Guy also put away that sword around his waist.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Should've never had the useless thing to begin with.
Paimon: #Do... Do you need to do anything to prepare, Traveler? Paimon's getting kinda nervous, seeing everyone all serious like this.
Traveler: I'm good. Let's go.
Traveler: I just need a little longer...
Navia: Of course! We should be fully prepared before going in.

## Talk 9

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Well? How long are you gonna keep us waiting?
Traveler: Alright, I'm set. Let's go!
Traveler: I just need a little longer...
Navia: Of course! We should be fully prepared before going in.

## Talk 10

Nilou: Huh, this space is completely empty...
Paimon: Paimon bets this is where the dragon sleeps...
Paimon: Ah! The road behind us is cut off!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Watch out in front! It's coming!
Durin: —!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Huh? That statue looks different from the one in the Metropole.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: It's a different goddess. This one is the Goddess of Fate.
Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...It's alright now, Durin. Nobody here wants to hurt you.
Durin: I don't understand... Why would you say that? ...I'm the one who hurts people.
Paimon: Don't say that, Durin! Paimon made a mistake, she was wrong about you... But it's nice to talk, isn't it, now that we've all calmed down?
Durin: No... It's pointless. Maybe you're willing to talk to me... but the world above is still terrified of me.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: So that's why you made that wish? ... So stupid...
Durin: Aw...
Paimon: Hey...!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Anyone with eyes can see that all you want to do is get along with everyone.
Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You just want to make friends. People to play with, to talk to... People who accept you, or at least... accept your apology.
Traveler: (That may be true... But I'm not sure the people of Simulanka are prepared for such a gigantic next-door neighbor.)
Navia: You never hurt anyone. Heck, the idea never even crossed your mind! Sure, you scared a bunch of people half to death, but that's only because they had no idea what kind of dragon you really are.
Kirara: Yeah! If you had a heart-to-heart with them, I'm sure they'd come to understand you and see your point of view.
Durin: What's the point? As long as I'm cursed with this body, I'll never be able to live alongside them...
Durin: Everything I touch will be turned into toy blocks... Anywhere I set foot reduced to a barren wasteland...
Traveler: (Is there no way for them to co-exist, even if they come to an understanding?)
Nilou: ...
Nilou: The curse...
Paimon: Huh? Nilou?
Nilou: ...Is it your true wish to live side-by-side with the people of Simulanka?
Durin: ...
Durin: ...Yes, it is.
Nilou: Then close your eyes, and make a wish to the Goddess of Fate. We will help make your wish come true.
Durin: Huh? But... But how?
Nilou: Just trust me.
Durin: ...
Nilou: ...
Nilou: I, Nilou, the Forest Fairy, give to you my blessing, and welcome you as a dweller of the Forest...
Traveler: (Wait! That's...!)
Nilou: May everyone accept you as one of our own, and may the Forest of Blessings be a place you can call home.
Navia: I, Navia, King of Constellation Metropole, give you my blessing! I grant you citizenship to my kingdom!
Kirara: Me too! As the, uhhh, Nekomata-in-Boots of this world, I give you my blessing, too!
Traveler: (The rays of light, they're... coming together...)
Paimon: Wait! What's going on!?
Traveler: This must be... the magic power of words.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...I, the Hero of this world, give you my blessing. I recognize you as a resident of Simulanka... May you find acceptance in this world.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Also... Speaking as someone who'd like to be your friend, I wish you all the best for the future.
Traveler: #(...! {REALNAME[ID(1)]}...)
Traveler: I, a Traveler who has traversed many worlds, give to you my blessing. May you find friendship and goodwill, no matter where you go.
Durin: ...
Durin: Mom...
"M": As for this world... I leave it to you.
Mini Durin: Huh... What? Why are you all staring at me?
Mini Durin: ...Huh!? My... my claws... are these my claws? And my wings, my tail... *gasp* Does this mean...!
Navia: Wow, you look so cute! Quite a radical transformation!
Navia: ...Uhh, not that there was anything wrong with the way you looked before, of course! It's just... Ugh, you get what I mean.
Nilou: How do you feel? Are you happy with your new appearance?
Mini Durin: Does... anyone have a flower with them? Or... even just some water or paper from this world?
Kirara: Oh, I do, actually! Here you go!
Mini Durin: They're... They're not changing! I can touch things without changing them!
Paimon: Hey, that's great! One more flying friend for Paimon!
Nilou: Now, the residents of Simulanka won't be scared of you anymore.
Mini Durin: Hmm... But, what about all the things that I did before?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: That's simple — just go out there and atone. You could fill in the footprints you left on the ground, or help the people around the Broken Sea get home.
Mini Durin: Okay... And... You'll come along and help me, right, Hat Guy?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Huh? Why would I do that?
Mini Durin: Uhh... Because... You said you wanted to be my friend...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You little...! Gah, well maybe I spoke too soon!
Mini Durin: Huh? But I thought... *sniff*
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Come on, Hat Guy...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Alright, fine! I'll go with you!
Mini Durin: ...Really?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Yes, really. Lying to you would be no fun anyway.
Mini Durin: Thank you! You're the first friend to call me by my name.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Let's go back up. I'm about to suffocate down here.
Paimon: Oh, it feels so good to finally see Hat Guy meet his match! Hehehe!
Traveler: Paimon...
Traveler: Don't be so insensitive...
Paimon: Yeah, okay... Paimon just never thought we'd see the day, that's all.
Navia: Alright, let's also head back up, then.
Mini Durin: ...
Nilou: Don't be scared, Durin. We'll be right by your side.
Mini Durin: Mhm. Thank you for your blessings, everyone... This is the happiest day I've had in a really long time.

## Talk 12

"M": Look. He's here.
"B": Ah... Another new soul has joined this world.
"M": But... Are you sure his fate will be as you described?
"B": Of course. My predictions are never wrong.
"M": I just don't like that kind of story...
"B": Then you need only do as you said, and let him find his own story within your fairytale.
"M": Haha, you're right. Then, listen closely, my child. Your name is—
Durin: ...?
Traveler: ...What is this place?
Durin: ...
Traveler: Is that... water?
Durin: ...
Durin: ...! —!
Durin: ...
Traveler: ...Are we above Constellation Metropole?
Person Within the Door: It's... It's the dragon! The dragon that destroyed the toytanium mines!
Person Within the Door: Help!! Heeeeeelp!!!
Person Within the Door: Soldiers, pick up your weapons! Destroy that monster!
Durin: ...!

## Talk 13

Navia: ...
Nilou: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Ugh. How many times am I going to have to save you?
Nilou: Thank you, Hat Guy...
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon still feels dizzy... Hey, did any of you also see something strange? It was like we were witnessing...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: The dragon's memories?
Navia: Sounds like we all saw the same thing just now.
Paimon: Well, we definitely saw a different side to the story... Watching it all unfold, Paimon couldn't help but feel bad for the dragon...
Navia: This world might be a lot more complicated than we thought.
Nilou: The next time we encounter the dragon, how about we try talking to him instead of fighting?
Paimon: That sounds like a good plan... But, maybe we should figure out where we ended up first...
Navia: Hm, if the world above is a fairytale realm, then maybe we've fallen into the next page of the book...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Just keep walking, and don't fall behind.
Paimon: Huh? Hey! Wait for us!

## Talk 14

Nilou: ...Hat Guy!
Paimon: You're getting too far away!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: He's just up ahead.
Nilou: Is he trying to lure us somewhere?
Navia: Well... I'd say we were the ones who backed him into a corner...
Paimon: But... we just wanna ask him a few questions about his past...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: He's had year after year of people coming here to try to take his head. If you ask me, his reaction is perfectly normal.
Nilou: Maybe there's still something we can do to calm him down!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I wouldn't count on it. Maybe his earlier attacks were just a warning, but now, he's actually getting serious.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Prepare for a final battle. Sometimes... it takes a little force for someone to finally wake up.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Now's our chance!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...! Wait!
Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...?
Durin: —!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Huh...!

## Talk 16

"B": Are you sure you want to create this child, M, even after what I told you about his fate?
"M": ...
"B": He will be abandoned by his creator, and eventually...
"M": I know, B. You've told me already. That sad story with the disappointing ending... It's what happened in the real world, isn't it?
"M": But, that's exactly why I want to change things. In a different world, his story can have a happier ending. That child... His heart is so full of love.
"B": I understand, Anya. But, know that if you give him that name, his fate in Simulanka is destined to parallel that of his real-world namesake...
"M": But, there's still a chance, right? Maybe it's a shot in the dark... But, I have to try. He deserves a better life.
"M": Although... he might need the help of others when the time comes.
"B": Alright, my dear, the choice is yours.
"B": Since you're so persistent, let me tell you a secret...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph... More boring "fate" talk.

## Talk 17

Little Flying Squirrel: Hey, mister dragon! I brought you some food. You must be hungry?
Durin: ...
Little Flying Squirrel: Shh...! Quiet, we can't let anyone hear us. Everyone says you're a bad dragon, but you're always nice to me when we play together. You always help me pick the flowers way up high that I can't reach.
Durin: ...
Little Flying Squirrel: It's okay. Just keep hiding here, and tomorrow, I'll—
Flying Squirrel Mama: Oh no! My child!
Flying Squirrel Mama: Help, somebody help me! Save my child, the dragon's trying to kidnap her!
Little Flying Squirrel: No! Mom, it's not like that! Listen to me...!
Durin: —!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: So, you're hated by people, too...

## Talk 18

Durin: ...
Durin: (Mom...)
"M": I'm sorry, my child...
"M": Unlike my friends, I don't have a long time to live. All said and done, the story of my life will be shorter than the fairy tales in this book. So, I will have to leave your side, I'm afraid.
Durin: ...
"M": It's okay, it's okay. Once I'm gone, I will become a star in Simulanka, and watch over you from above. If you ever feel lonely, just look up towards the sky...
Durin: ...
"M": Go forth and witness this world, my child... Make sure to be nice to everyone...
"M": You'll meet good friends one day, I'm sure of it... That is my wish for your future.
"M": As for this world... I leave it to you.
Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: So, in the end, you were "betrayed," too...

## Talk 19

Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: So, that's it? That's really your wish?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: "To never have been born at all"... That's not a fate you should wish for.

## Talk 20

Navia: That was a close call! Are you guys alright?
Traveler: Yup, all thanks to Kirara.
Kirara: Back in Constellation Metropole, I heard people saying you'd gone to fight the dragon, so I followed you here. Right when I managed to catch up, I saw you fall through that hole!
Kirara: Wait, didn't someone else fall through just now? Shouldn't we do something?
Paimon: Oh, yeah, Hat Guy... Well, he can fly, so he'll probably be fine...
Nilou: He called the dragon something earlier. It sounded like he said...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Durin. That's his name.
Navia: Hat Guy, you're okay! Wait, what about the dragon... Durin?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: He's fine.
Paimon: Durin... Wait, that's the name of the dragon from Dragonspine, right? The one that became a part of the mountain after being slain by Dvalin! If Paimon remembers correctly, it was created by...
Traveler: "Gold" Rhinedottir...
Paimon: Right, it was created by Rhinedottir.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Created, you say... Heh...
Paimon: So, what exactly happened down there? You've been acting weird ever since the end of the fight!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Black Screen Text: #{REALNAME[ID(1)]} tells you about what he saw in the mist...
Nilou: So that's the truth about Simulanka's evil dragon...
Navia: What we saw in the mist weren't hallucinations, but the dragon's memories...
Traveler: (Everything I heard during my fall... must have been things said to Durin in the past...)
Kirara: Huh, I thought it was strange! The people around the Broken Sea are clearly stranded, but I never heard any stories about the dragon attacking the village.
Nilou: The people we met along the way are probably workers from the toytanium mines, or guards who came here to claim the dragon's head... Durin probably allowed them to live here because there was nowhere else for them to go...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: When I first came to this world, a voice spoke to me and said, "You are the Hero of this world. Now go forth, and save the dragon."
Paimon: Huh, who is the person behind this voice, anyway? And why did they bring us all here?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Come with me. The answer to all of this can be found below.

## Talk 21

Navia: It's... Simulanka Durin? And he's looking up at something... a star.
Nilou: This must have been after M passed away...
Nilou: This looks like... a mine.
Kirara: Maybe... the toytanium miners dug too deep? So deep that they dug right through to the world on the next page?
Nilou: Yeah... Now that you mention it, this miner's lamp looks really similar to the star on the previous page...
Nilou: The Forest of Blessings... This book has been recording Simulanka's history all along...
Kirara: Look at the size of those footprints... If that's every time he lands, then no wonder people are so terrified of him.
Navia: So that's why you took the stars... Because you missed your mom.

## Talk 22

"M": "...By all rights, I should have been 'A,' since 'A' is the first and last letter of my name. But Alice overruled me on the basis of seniority, and said I would be 'M' instead, because of my middle name. Haha, she really knows how to push my buttons..."
"M": "Still, her magic never fails to amaze me. I still can't believe she got one of my origami frogs to start talking."
"M": "Hmm... Why don't I write a story with origami animals as the main characters? Let's see... Once upon a time, in a magical Forest, there lived a group of animals made of paper..."
"M": "Barbie loves looking into the future, so she used her powers to map out the fates of all living things in Simulanka. But knowing the ending in advance takes all the fun out of the story..."
"M": "I think I'll make a bet with her. I believe that one day, the people of Simulanka will decide to carve their own destiny."
"M": "...Apparently, she wants to build a statue of herself in the capital city!? Haha, always looking to add some pizzazz."

## Talk 23

Nilou: The Forest of Blessings... This book has been recording Simulanka's history all along...
Kirara: Look at the size of those footprints... If that's every time he lands, then no wonder people are so terrified of him.

## Talk 24

Nilou: This looks like... a mine.
Kirara: Maybe... the toytanium miners dug too deep? So deep that they dug right through to the world on the next page?
Nilou: Yeah... Now that you mention it, this miner's lamp looks really similar to the star on the previous page...

## Talk 25

"M": "My dear sisters, I fear my pen shall soon run dry... Even now as I write this letter to you, my dexterity is all but failing me. Thank you for enjoying my stories, and for creating this world for me..."
"M": "The time we spent together was the most wonderful youth I could have asked for. Haha, I always feel so young when we're together..."
"M": "'A' says that even after I am gone, the Goddess of Fate in Simulanka will continue to exist, and carry on granting people's wishes. It makes me glad..."
"M": "If you ever want to chat, feel free to pay a visit to the Goddess statue. Just don't wish for anything weird!"

## Talk 26

Alice: Ta-da! Surprise, everyone!
Paimon: Aah! A talking street lamp!
Alice: Street lamp...? Oh my, you mean you still don't remember me, after all the times we've spoken?
Mini Durin: I know that voice... It's Mom's friend!
Traveler: Alice.
Alice: #Hello there, Traveler and friends. And Durin — it's good to see you. You've changed quite a lot.
Alice: In fact, you look so different that perhaps... I should call you "Mini Durin"?
Mini Durin: "Mini Durin," huh... Yeah, I like the sound of that! It's nice being smaller.
Nilou: You must be one of the three Goddesses of this world... Are you the Goddess of Creation?
Alice: Yep, that's right! But although it's the most impressive-sounding of the three, to be honest, we all made an equal contribution toward the founding of this world.
Alice: If you've ever read any of M's stories, you'll know just how enchanting the worlds are that she writes about. So enchanting that I just had to step inside and explore it for real.
Alice: So I got B involved, and with M's consent, created the world of Simulanka.
Paimon: Whoa whoa whoa, you're getting a little ahead of yourself! First things first, would you mind explaining what you're doing here? ...In fact, no, what are WE even doing here?
Alice: Haha, don't worry! All will be revealed! After everything you accomplished on your journey, you're free to ask me anything you want.
Alice: Hm, let's start with your first question, then. I'm here because I sensed a great magic power emanating from the book just now, and I couldn't resist the urge to peek inside and check it out.
Navia: That must have been when we all gave Mini Durin our blessings, right?
Alice: Yes, exactly. In the world of fairytales, words and emotions often carry far more power than any spell.
Alice: It's all thanks to your magic that Mini Durin was able to take this form. Come say hi to me, little one. Ah, look at you. You're as cute as a button!
Kirara: So... What about us? Was it always part of the plan that we'd come here?
Alice: "Plan" isn't the word I'd use. If you ask me, I'd say... fate works in mysterious ways.
Alice: When Durin of Simulanka made his wish to the Goddess of Fate, it just so happened that in a world far away, all of you wonderful people were holding a copy of M's fairytale at that exact moment.
Alice: And because of your noble and kind souls, you were selected by the Goddess of Fate to come and save this world.
Navia: Now that you mention it... That's what I was doing when I was transported here! I was reading a fairytale to some children in the Fleuve Cendre!
Kirara: I think I just... happened upon an old book, and decided to use it as my pillow during a nap in a box... Hehehe...
Paimon: Wow... What a crazy coincidence...
Paimon: Wait, that's not right... How come everyone else got assigned a role except us? 'Cause we were also...
Paimon: ...Yeah, that was it! We'd just received a strange book, and we had no idea who sent it. Then, the moment we opened it up to start reading it, we found ourselves here... You're the one who sent it to us, aren't you?
Alice: Oh, is that what happened? Hahaha, yes, that does sound like me, doesn't it?
Traveler: Why did you send us here?
Alice: Hmm... Good question. Why, indeed? Maybe I thought this was such a good story, it simply had to be read by someone. As the Traveler and witness of many worlds, how could I let such a beautiful place pass you by?
Alice: I can sense that your blessing for Mini Durin was a very special one. With this blessing from beyond the story, he might even be able to explore worlds outside of this one.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Teyvat, you mean?
Alice: That's right. In fact, back when we were first creating Simulanka, M told us that she hoped the people of this world would one day be able to explore the wider world beyond.
Alice: "Every story has an ending, but if the story becomes reality, it should have the right to choose its own path."
Navia: So in other words... the predestined lives these people lead were always going to disappear one way or another.
Paimon: Wait, so if even the people here get to go to other worlds... Surely there's gotta be a way we can leave, too, right?
Alice: Don't you realize you've been able to leave all along?
Paimon: Huh?
Alice: You can either take the *boat* at the Broken Sea, or touch the *giant bookmark* at the Cliff of Prophecy. All you need to do if you want to leave is focus on the place you want to go.
Paimon: ...How were we supposed to know that if you never told us!?
Alice: Huh? Didn't I? Hehe, well, given how smart and capable you are, surely that can't have posed a huge problem for you?
Alice: As for your other friends who were summoned here... If I had to guess, I'd say the Goddess of Fate probably didn't tell them about it because she wanted them to get engrossed in the story.
Alice: She's M's reflection, after all. It wouldn't surprise me if she shares M's love for cliffhangers!
Alice: Anyway, I think that answers your questions, yes? What do you all plan to do next?
Mini Durin: I... I'm gonna go say sorry to the people of this world. After that... I wanna start protecting Simulanka, just like Mom told me to.
Paimon: Hmm... Now we know how easy it is to get back home, Paimon's suddenly not in such a hurry to leave.
Kirara: Same here! It's not every day that you get to come to such a magical world. I, for one, plan to explore it a little longer.
Alice: Haha, I'm glad to hear it. Maybe I should invite some other friends to join you, too...
Alice: By the way, Mini Durin, I'm delighted to see you've made some new friends. I'm sure M would be very proud of you.
Alice: Now, before I depart, please let me give you a blessing as well. May your future be as rich and colorful as the stories M used to tell.
Nilou: ...She's gone.
Paimon: Guess this is where the Hero's journey comes to an end, huh?
Navia: Huh, but it's also where a new journey begins: The adventures of Mini Durin and friends!
Mini Durin: Huh? An adventure for me...?
Nilou: You bet! For starters, I'd love to introduce you to my other friends in the Forest. Even though there have been some misunderstandings in the past, I'm sure they'll welcome the new you with open arms.
Mini Durin: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Stop looking at me. I already said I'll come with you!
Kirara: Whoa! Look over there!
Nilou: Wow... The stars are beautiful...
Navia: I'll bet that's a gift to Mini Durin from the three Goddesses of this world!
Mini Durin: ...
Mini Durin: Thank you, Mom...
