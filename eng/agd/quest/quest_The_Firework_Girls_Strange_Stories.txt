# The Firework Girl's Strange Stories


## Talk 1

Yoimiya: Inazuma is home to the Yae Publishing House, and a lot of people who like to write stories, too. In fact, most of what they write is based off of the kinds of fairy tales I was just talking about.
Yoimiya: A bunch of them have bad endings, though. Like, oh — the Fire Diamond will get put in a rich person's gallery, where it will never be ignited again.
Yoimiya: Or someone will see the Mist Spirit, and not manage to catch it, but because they angered it, it'll never show itself again.
Yoimiya: The hero who slays the dragon becomes the next dragon... The sacred sword that once fought the darkness now becomes a doomsday weapon...
Yoimiya: *sigh* I know these kinds of stories are all the rage nowadays, but... I really can't bring myself to like them.
Yoimiya: If something's magical, it should be kept that way.

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: Oh yeah, if it's fine with you, can I ask how you two first met?
Paimon: #{F#She}{M#He} saved me from drowning this one time, and after that, we started traveling together... Why do you ask?
Yoimiya: Oh, nothing... I'm just quite envious of your relationship.
Yoimiya: If my pops had a person like you around, his being deaf wouldn't hold things up all the time.
Yoimiya: ...Huh? Why do you look so excited?
Paimon: Because, because...
Paimon: You said "person," and not "floating child," or "mascot"!

## Talk 3

Yoimiya: Hey, Pops, I'm back!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The fireworks show is almost upon us, and the fireworks for each family are almost ready.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, new faces? Who are these two? Friends, or customers?
Yoimiya: A bit of both, actually. They arrived in Inazuma just recently. Can't let them miss out on a fireworks show after coming all this way, can we?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Hahaha, well, either way, come on in and have a seat and I, Naganohara Ryuunosuke, will tell you all about the long history of the Naganoharas.
Yoimiya: That can wait. Pops, I need to ask you about something.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: A long, long time ago...
Yoimiya: *sigh* Pops has started telling his stories again...
Yoimiya: Sorry about this — ever since Pops had his accident, his ears don't work too well.
Paimon: Really? But for a moment there, it almost seemed like you were having a coherent conversation...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Much, much later, people eventually realized that if you grind certain minerals into dust, they burn with many beautiful colors.
Yoimiya: Pops — Pops wait!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Eh? What is it?
Yoimiya: Did they deliver those firework materials that we ordered yet?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, yesterday's fireworks have all been delivered. So have the ones from the day before yesterday, and the ones from the day before that.
Yoimiya: No, Pops. I meant the materials. The materials that we ordered. They should have arrived today.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Today's fireworks are almost ready, too, don't you worry! Hehe, your old man's skills are still as sharp as ever.
Yoimiya: No— Pops, the materials! The raw materials for making fireworks.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Sorry?
Yoimiya: Ma-te-ri-als!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh... Ohh, the materials?
Paimon: Yes, yes! The materials!
Paimon: Sorry, sorry... Paimon got all excited because you finally got the message across, hehe...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The materials aren't here yet. The couriers did come over to explain why, but... Well, I think they did, but I couldn't quite hear what they were saying...
Yoimiya: No worries, as long as we know, that's fine. We can just make them later. Oh, uh — don't forget to take the goods in when they deliver them, okay, Pops?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Of course, leave it to me.
Yoimiya: Oh, sorry if we were a little loud. It's always the way, though — it's like that every time I need to ask pops something.
Traveler: Still, he seems like a warm and friendly person.
Yoimiya: Uh-huh, that's my pops! He's a good person, alright. Everyone around here respects him.
Yoimiya: Because my pops is deaf, he never argues with anyone, and never contradicts them. He just listens cheerfully.
Yoimiya: When I was little, I thought it was because he really understood me, and agreed with whatever I had to say. So, I'd tell my pops everything.
Yoimiya: Eventually, I realized that the reason he was like that was that he's deaf. But I still tell him stories every day.
Paimon: Huh? Why would you do that?
Yoimiya: It just makes me happy to see him smile. And it keeps him from being lonely, right?
Yoimiya: Anyway. More importantly right now, the fireworks show is right around the corner and the materials still haven't arrived. We need to think of an alternative...
Sakujirou (???): Um, Yoimiya, is that you?
Yoimiya: Wah! Oh, you scared me there! I thought I told you to be more careful before you speak?
Sakujirou (???): S—Sorry...
Yoimiya: Hold on, I'm coming over.
Traveler: I think the two of you are quite similar.
Yoimiya: Hehe, I get told that a lot.

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: No one's looking. Okay, you can come out now. Uh, come around the side.
Yoimiya: *sigh* We're lucky that no one from the Tenryou Commission was around, otherwise, we'd all be in big trouble.
Sakujirou (???): Sorry, I guess I was a little rash. But when I heard you come back, I just...
Yoimiya: Don't worry, Sakujirou. So far, at least, everything is going according to plan.
Yoimiya: We're going to look for firework materials shortly. While we're out, we'll sort out the boat situation for you, as promised.
Sakujirou: Thank you for all your help.
Traveler: Who is this?
Yoimiya: He's one of our old customers. He came back to Inazuma from the outside world not long ago. While he was smuggling himself in, the Tenryou Commission found him and put out a warrant for his arrest...
Paimon: An arrest warrant!?
Yoimiya: Shhhh, keep it down! We don't want to draw any unwanted attention.
Yoimiya: If Sakujirou is caught, there's no knowing what crimes they could charge him with. All we can do is find him a boat and send him out of Inazuma again.
Traveler: But isn't there a thunderstorm out in the ocean?
Yoimiya: Yeah, we know it's going to be dangerous, but there aren't many other options left.
Paimon: What if the boat capsizes? Uhh! Drowning is really scary!
Paimon: If things are this bad, couldn't you have just not come back in the first place?
Sakujirou: Well... There is something I felt I had to do...
Sakujirou: But as soon as I got back, I started hearing about all these unbelievable changes. I had made my mind up, originally, but now I'm not sure anymore...
Sakujirou: I didn't want to cause any trouble for Yoimiya or Mr. Ryuunosuke, but I'm very grateful to them for taking me in.
Yoimiya: Hey, no worries, you're more than welcome. Remember what I said? As long as you've got that little piece of paper, you'll always be a valued customer of the Naganoharas.
Paimon: Little piece of paper...?
Traveler: I remember something about that.
Yoimiya: Yep, the same paper slips as the ones I gave to the kids earlier. Whenever a customer orders fireworks for a commemorative event, we always include a little paper slip with the goods.
Yoimiya: Only people from inside my family can understand what's written on it. It's the recipe for the fireworks they ordered.
Yoimiya: If someone shows a Naganohara that paper slip, we guarantee we can make the exact same firework as the original one they purchased, whether it's ten or even a hundred years later.
Paimon: Wow, that is so awesome!
Yoimiya: It's a family tradition. All our regular customers know about this.
Sakujirou: The slip I have is from back when my parents ordered fireworks from Mr. Ryuunosuke. Now I think about it, it must be nearly 20 years ago.
Sakujirou: *sigh* Who would have thought that things would turn out the way they have...
Yoimiya: It'll be fine. Escaping in a boat is just a last resort for if there's no other way. I'll still try and come up with a different solution, because it'd be much better if you could stay in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Whatever their reasons might be, if our customers come to us looking for help, we're not about to leave them high and dry.
Sakujirou: Thank you... This way, I'll still have some time to consider my options...
Yoimiya: Alright, well, let's not stay out here in the open for too long. Hurry up and get back inside. I'll let you know as soon as I have an update for you.
Sakujirou: Thank you, I—I'll leave it to you, then, I guess.
Yoimiya: *sigh* It's a shame, they still wouldn't give him a permit, even though he was born and raised in Inazuma.
Yoimiya: Speaking of, you guys only got here recently, how did you manage to get a permit?
Traveler: We went through a long bureaucratic process on Ritou.
Paimon: Even then, we only got through thanks to some help from Miss Hiiragi Chisato of the Kanjou Commission.
Yoimiya: I see, so you had big shots helping you. I guess that won't be of much help to Sakujirou.
Yoimiya: *sigh* I just wish the commissions could be a little more flexible.
Yoimiya: I bet nowhere else you've been is quite like Inazuma, huh?
Traveler: It's true.
Yoimiya: *sigh* Well, no matter what, I have to find a way to help him.
Yoimiya: I'm sorry, I invited you to come and watch the fireworks, but now I have to run a few errands.
Yoimiya: You don't have to join me if you don't want to. I can go sort out the firework materials and the boat by myself, and then you can come and meet me back at the house later.
Traveler: I don't mind coming along.
Yoimiya: Oh, cool! Then let's start with Sakujirou's boat. We can chat along the way!
Traveler: I'm interested to learn how fireworks are made.
Traveler: Each archon has their own idea on how to run things.
Traveler: Like the paper slips you gave to the kids?
Traveler: And why is he hiding in your home?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, don't worry about me, go take care of business first. There'll always be time for my stories later.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I have a lot of time, and a lot of stories to tell, too.
