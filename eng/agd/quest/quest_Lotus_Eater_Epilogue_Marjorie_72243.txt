# Lotus Eater Epilogue: Marjorie


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Marjorie: You want to sell treasure? That's quite a surprise.
Marjorie: I imagine that an adventurer as skilled as you must have some truly rare goods to sell.
Marjorie: Let me have a look.
Black Screen Text: You tell Marjorie about the Dragonbone Orb.
Marjorie: Huh, isn't this what the bards called the "Fretnaught Fruit"?
Marjorie: To think that it really exists... So its real name is the Dragonbone Orb.
Marjorie: If its effects are as you say, I'd be willing to pay 80,000 Mora and some specialty dishes for it.
Marjorie: Hmm... How does 80,000 Mora and 5 Moon Pies sound to you?
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Marjorie: Hehe. I mean, it's such a unique treasure.
Marjorie: Why, it has abilities straight out of a fairy tale! I doubt those alchemists would be loath to part with their Mora.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Marjorie: I'll take this, then. Thanks for your patronage!
Marjorie: Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.
Marjorie: As such, it might be best to cover it with a diaphragm or place it within a sealed container to ensure its quality.
Marjorie: I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
Marjorie: If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Marjorie: Sure, no problem. Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
Marjorie: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

## Talk 2

Traveler: About the Dragonbone Orb...
Marjorie: How about it? Told you that my price was the best, hehe!
Marjorie: If you sell it to me, my price is 80,000 Mora and 5 Moon Pies. Sounds reasonable, yes?
Traveler: It's yours.
Marjorie: I'll take it, then. Thanks for your patronage!
Marjorie: Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.
Marjorie: As such, it might be best to cover it with a diaphragm or place it within a sealed container to ensure its quality.
Marjorie: I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
Marjorie: If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
Traveler: Let me think about it one more time.
Marjorie: Sure, aren't you the careful sort? Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
Marjorie: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.
