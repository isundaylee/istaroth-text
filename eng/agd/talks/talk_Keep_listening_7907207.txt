Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: But before the hatter had thought of something he truly wanted fulfilled, soldiers in the employ of a noble suddenly came knocking at his door.
Devitt: "Our Lord orders you to make him the best hat," a soldier said in an overbearing tone.
Devitt: "Sure. I'll have it delivered to him once it is done. But before that, I have to..."
Devitt: "No! From now on, you shall only make hats for our lord!" The soldier cut him off. The cold light glinted off their blades and spears, and he had no choice but to leave with them.
Devitt: At the palace, the noble welcomed him warmly, even throwing him a grand banquet.
Devitt: "Come then, make me the best hat! Should not the most powerful of people have the loveliest of hats? Hahaha!" The nobleman laughed loudly, but the hatmaker could not bring himself to eat a single bite.
