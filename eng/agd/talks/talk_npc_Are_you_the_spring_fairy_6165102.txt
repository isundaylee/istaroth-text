# Talk Dialog

Gentle Voice: Are you the... spring fairy?
Gentle Voice: Yes... that's me.
Gentle Voice: But I must apologize. I don't have the power to grant wishes, or anything of that nature. Sorry to disappoint.
Gentle Voice: The most I can do is turn water into wine, make all drinks taste delicious, do a little bit of healing... that sort of thing.
Gentle Voice: Also... I do apologize that for now I can only talk to you from within the water.
