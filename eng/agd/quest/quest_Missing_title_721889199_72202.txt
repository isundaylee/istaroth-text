## Talk 1

Chise: Has the Great Thunderbird... forsaken me?
Traveler: Err, hello?
Chise: O mighty Thunderbird, please... Do not be angry...
Chise: I will do my best to read your decrees and your instructions... But...
Chise: But why do you reject me... Why... *sobs*
Chise: Why can't I enter the fog you created...
Traveler: Read... What are you talking about?
Chise: The Stormstones you left behind... I will do something about them. But the silver boat is coming. My time is short...
Traveler: What are these Stormstones you're talking about?
Chise: The Stormstones of the Autake Plains... Only those who can wield the thunder can bring them back to life, and only those who can traverse the fog can find them...
Chise: To stand tall like the Thunderbird... to unfurl one's wings like the Thunderbird...
Traveler: Wait a moment. Hasn't the fog dispersed?
Traveler: Need any help?
