# Dust of Enlightenment

The power of Artifacts stems from stories. Thus, sacred or profane writings may reshape them.
There is no good or evil inherent in stories, while songs and words have the power to save as well as destroy â€” such was the belief of the emissary who once conveyed revelations on the holiest one's behalf, governing the nations on earth and their glory, and who eventually fell from the high heavens. To this day, whether pure or impure, these feathers can still inscribe false revelations and rewrite fated tales, yet the only outcome of defying the world is to scatter into dust.
