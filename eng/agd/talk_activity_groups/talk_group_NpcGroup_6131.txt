Titu: #Ah, it's you, mighty Traveler! How's it all going, been on any more adventures? If you've heard any amazing stories, I'm all ears!
Titu: Tell you what, I've got a brother at the Saurian Relics Association. Name's Manqu, and man, if I told him what we saw at the Shadow Pins...
Titu: He'd go so green with envy, it might kill him! Gonna wait till I get back from my post to break it to him, though.
Traveler: About marked young Saurians...
Titu: #You mean {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? Well, all I know is that it's not a good sign.
Titu: I've heard that such marked Saurians are rejected by the Night Kingdom, the tribes, and the Saurians too. They die as they lived, alone.
Titu: #But that's just superstition. I mean, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s got you, right?
Traveler: About the tales of those heroes...
Titu: I'm giving it some thought. Uh, not that I'd let it affect my sentry work, though, no sir! I'm a real multitasker.
Titu: Those two from Khaenri'ah have a terrible reputation here in the tribe. All the more reason for my story to be as exciting as possible!
Titu: So I've got to give this all the consideration it's due!
Traveler: About storytellers...
Titu: We sure are an amazing bunch!
Titu: Take, for example... Sanhaj from the Masters of the Night-Wind, who all storytellers revere...
Titu: They say he had every scroll ever written up to his time committed to memory, and that he was willing to go from tribe to tribe and share those tales... That said, they also say that he also mooched a lot of food and drink off them along the way...
Titu: Stories speak of bygone times, and they represent the wisdom of our forebears. Thus, the mere act of sharing it was seen as a selfless act, so all both loved and hated cunning Sanhaj.
Titu: Later, that tale-telling hero would himself become part of a heroic tale — a fate I doubt even he ever envisioned... But yeah. Sanhaj was an amazing storyteller.
Titu: Still, the characters in his tales were all tribal warriors of a sort, but in mine, we'll also include a golden-haired outlander, a silver-haired fairy, and a little Saurian with a red scarf.
Titu: So, if only in terms of the variety of the main cast, I'm the winner!
Traveler: I saw you in Ochkanatlan...
Titu: What? Me? ... Haha, you must be joking. "I've" never been there, that's for sure. "I" am simply a storyteller from the Children of Echoes.
Titu: "Titu" is just a name. Anyone could be called "Titu." Perhaps the one you saw was someone using that name...
Titu: Hehe, and that makes me another who is using it, of course.
Traveler: See you! Guard your post well!
Titu: #Alright, alright. See you, Traveler.
