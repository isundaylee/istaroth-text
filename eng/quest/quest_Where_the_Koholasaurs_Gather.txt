# Where the Koholasaurs Gather


## Talk 1

Mualani: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! Over here!
Paimon: You're here, Mualani. Oh, and those strange scholars are here, too.
Karya: Good morning, you two.
Paimon: Morning!
Viramdra: So when are we leaving?
Mualani: Haha, seems you're as excited as a child before the start of our journey.
Viramdra: I just want to get down to business as soon as possible... You know this is no leisurely spring stroll, so I hope we can all act a little more professional.
Mualani: Don't worry, I'm a very professional guide. Ahem, our journey to the mysterious island has officially begun.
Paimon: Yay!
Mualani: First, do you all see this statue here?
Paimon: Mm-hmm. Is it an important clue?
Mualani: Well, no. It's not a clue at all. He was the first chief of the People of the Springs who came back from the mysterious island and set up this place. It's a monument.
Mualani: The first thing we need to do before we set off is to touch the statue and pray to our ancestors. This will make our journey to the mysterious island smoother.
Viramdra: Is there any theoretical basis to support that claim?
Mualani: Theoretical basis? No, but my teacher taught me it's an essential step before heading to the mysterious island.
Viramdra: ...
Mualani: Very good! You didn't try to argue with me over something that you aren't knowledgeable about. That's very professional of you.
Viramdra: Sure, but since this practice doesn't have an empirical basis, I won't be able to include it in my thesis...
Mualani: Come on, everyone!
Mualani: Greetings to my ancestors. As your descendant, I'm about to follow in your footsteps and witness your accomplishments. Allow me to depart under your gaze and return under your protective watch.
Paimon: It really feels like we're about to embark on a great adventure!
Mualani: Now, please get ready. We're going to look for the first clue.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, there are a lot of Koholasaurs here!
Viramdra: As expected, the first clue is related to the Koholasaurs.
Mualani: When people from outside the tribe get a copy of the map, most can deduce that the first clue is related to the Koholasaurs, but they often end up looking in the wrong direction.
Mualani: When the first chief created the map, he left a special mark for this part. It's a code that the tribe uses to indicate a herd of them.
Mualani: So, it'll be impossible to gain any leads from just finding one or two stray Koholasaurs.
Paimon: You're a real pro at this, Mualani!
Viramdra: But according to the information I've been able to find, Koholasaurs don't like gathering as herds unless it's to compete for the hot springs...
Mualani: So let me tell you a secret that only a guide from the People of the Springs would know. It so happens that wild Koholasaurs periodically gather in the valley up ahead.
Mualani: It's almost like how our tribe gathers together for festivals. Still, as soon as the season changes, the herd quickly disperses again.
Mualani: Unless you're a guide who's always running across Natlan, it would be very rare to ever witness such a thing.
Viramdra: This is a thing!? I need to note this down right away, and include an explanation as a part of my thesis...
Mualani: According to what I've deciphered from the map, a clue is hidden deep in that valley.
Paimon: But to get there, won't we have to get through the herd of Koholasaurs?
Mualani: Hmm, we'll have to think of a way to sneak past without startling them. They're gathering together with their friends, so I'm sure they don't want to be disturbed.
Karya: You mean, we're going to have to walk through the Koholasaur herd? That feels a little...
Viramdra: Ahem... Given we've agreed to work together, everyone should do their part. However, Karya has been attacked by Koholasaurs before, so this isn't an ideal plan for her.
Viramdra: But it shouldn't be a problem at all for me! Let's have Karya wait here and I'll take over all the tasks that were supposed to be entrusted to her.
Mualani: Hehe, no worries. We don't need everyone to go.
Mualani: #We actually need someone to stay and look after the luggage, so we'll leave that to you two. {NICKNAME}, Paimon, please come with me.
Viramdra: Is that so? Then that works out perfectly.
Mualani: And now I understand how much you care for your assistant scholar.

## Talk 3

Paimon: These Koholasaurs sure seem on guard. We'll never get through...
Viramdra: Given you've already used the information provided by the map to deduce that the clue is in that valley, why don't you simply chase them away? You're pretty strong, aren't you?
Mualani: First of all, the elders of the tribe have always warned us to never hurt the Koholasaurs. Doing so will almost certainly bring bad luck.
Mualani: And secondly, you can't just show up and intrude on others' gatherings, much less make them leave! That's just terrible!
Viramdra: But on what basis...
Karya: Okay, so can we figure out another way to enter the valley?
Mualani: Hmm, there must be a way to enter the valley without startling them. It'd take a while for me to come up with a solution on my own, so I'd like to ask everyone to help come up with some ideas.
Paimon: Let Paimon think... is there a detour or another way around?
Mualani: According to the map, the clue is right in the middle of the Koholasaur herd. Even if we try to approach from the other side, we'll just run into the same problem.
Paimon: Hmm, this is tricky...
Mualani: Karya, I've noticed that you only talk when you're trying to help smooth things over between Viramdra and the others. I'm sure you must have some ideas of your own, so why don't you share them with us?
Karya: Me? Alright... When Viramdra decided to look for leads on the Koholasaurs, I wanted to help, and so, I also looked up some information about the creatures.
Karya: I discovered something very interesting... We thought that the Koholasaurs relied on their hearing to track their prey, but they also possess a very keen sense of smell.
Karya: But, I'm not sure how useful that information is...
Mualani: Oh... oh! That was actually very useful, Miss Karya!
Karya: You can just call me Karya.
Mualani: #In that case, please stay here and keep an eye on the luggage. {NICKNAME}, Paimon, come with me. I've got an idea!

## Talk 4

Mualani: Found it!
Paimon: What's this...?
Mualani: The key to making our way through the herd!
Mualani: If the Koholasaurs have a keen sense of smell, then even if we try to sneak around and stay out of sight, they'll still notice us once we get close enough.
Mualani: But this plant can help us solve that problem, because its fragrance is very similar to the scent of a Koholasaur.
Mualani: We can apply the plant's extract to our bodies and trick their sense of smell!
Paimon: So we're gonna... rub plant juice on ourselves?
Mualani: Don't worry, it's also good for your skin.
Black Screen Text: Mualani collects some of the plant's extract and masks everyone with its fragrance.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon feels all wet and slimy... but this actually does smell like a Koholasaur!
Mualani: Perfect! Okay, let's try to make our way through again!

## Talk 5

Mualani: We must be getting close.
Paimon: Look, a bunch are gathering around that rock. What're they doing?
Mualani: Hmm, maybe when things start to get boring, they gather together and talk about something fun? Too bad I can't understand what they're saying...
Paimon: But, Paimon thought guides from the People of the Springs could understand Koholasaurs.
Mualani: Sounds like someone has been trying to trick you.
Paimon: True, they were definitely trying to scam us... Huh? Do you see that on the rock? It looks like some kind of... drawing?
Mualani: I've heard that there is a type of moss that changes color when it reacts to the biological signals released by Koholasaurs. But to trigger that sort of reaction, you'd need a huge number of Koholasaurs...
Mualani: That must be the clue!
Paimon: Should we take a picture?
Mualani: The flash might disturb them. Let me try to copy it down.
Black Screen Text: Mualani copies down the mossy drawing and quietly leads you back the way you came. You then tell the patiently waiting Viramdra and Karya everything you saw and heard.
Paimon: So we've passed the first stage of the journey now, right?
Viramdra: I see... Had we chosen to drive the Koholasaurs off, then we never would've found this lead... Seems there was a logical basis for everything you said after all.
Mualani: Has he always been this way, Miss Karya?
Karya: He's just obsessed with his research, that's all...
Mualani: At least this has shown that my judgment is correct. I've proven my trustworthiness. And so, there should be no need for us to argue next time.
Viramdra: Yes, I understand... and I suppose that'll help us avoid wasting time.
Paimon: Mualani really knows how to lead our group!
Traveler: She is a professional guide, after all.
Mualani: Next, we'll need to use the lead we found to uncover our next destination. Now, what does this pattern represent?
Paimon: Hard to tell... Paimon certainly doesn't have any idea what it's trying to get at.
Mualani: Aha! I got it!
Mualani: Though the lines are kinda rough, I can still see that they represent the boundaries between the water and the land at Jadeskirt Knoll. We can use this to fill in the hole on the map and...
Mualani: Find our next destination!
Paimon: Really? You got all that just from some rough lines?
Mualani: Well, intuition is also a part of it. Maybe I've just seen too many maps as a guide, and now it's easier for me to pick up on patterns like that.
Mualani: Alright, break time is over, let's get ready to move!

## Talk 6

Viramdra: How much I care? I was just trying to practice good crew resource management.
Karya: Viramdra and I will keep an eye on the luggage. We'll leave the rest to you!

## Talk 7

Mualani: #We actually need someone to stay and look after the luggage, so we'll leave that to you two. {NICKNAME}, Paimon, please come with me.
Black Screen Text: Mualani leads you into a valley where a herd of roaming Koholasaurs gathers. You must approach with caution...

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: Mualani collects some of the plant's extract and masks everyone with its fragrance.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon feels all wet and slimy... but this actually does smell like a Koholasaur!
Mualani: Perfect! Okay, let's try to make our way through again!

## Talk 9

Viramdra: Why can't we just chase the Koholasaurs away?
