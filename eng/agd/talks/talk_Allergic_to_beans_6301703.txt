Traveler: Allergic to beans?
Yukio: There was a case like this before, so it's better safe than sorry for me to ask first.
Yukio: There was once an Oni gentleman and a lady with kitsune ears who made a bet here on who could eat the most kitsune ramen.
Yukio: But there was fried tofu in the ramen, and the Oni people are allergic to beans...
Yukio: Therefore, even though that gentleman with long horns won the bet, he also almost lost his life... Was it worthwhile?
