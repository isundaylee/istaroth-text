Klee: Mona, look! I found a four-leaf clover. It's so pretty; do you like it?
Mona: Huh? Is it for me? Thank you, Klee!
Klee: Um, could you also say something nice to Klee?
Mona: Oh, of course! Ahem. I've actually gotten really good at this! Hmm...
Mona: O Miss Klee, our mighty Spark Knight, you are the flame of hope for all of Mondstadt, and the vessel for...
Klee: Huh? What's a vessel?
Mona: Oh no, Klee doesn't seem to really appreciate this kind of praise. Okay, then...
Mona: Klee, you're super adorable, and your hat and backpack are the cutest! Did your mom get them for you?
Klee: Yep! Mom said that she picked them out with Dodoco, and Dodoco really loves this backpack, too! Which is why Dodoco's always hanging from the side!
Klee: Mom also said that someone else was also helping her pick out the gifts that day... Hmm, what was the name again...?
Klee: Ah, if Klee remembers correctly, people would call her... the old hag.
Mona: Wait, the old hag!? ...Huh, okay, now that you mention it, the old hag does have a fondness for picking out hats...
