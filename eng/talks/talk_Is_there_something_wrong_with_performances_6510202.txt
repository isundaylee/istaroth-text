Traveler: Is there something wrong with performances?
Vimeur: Not that, per se. I'm just not all that interested in operas, plays, or magic, and the like.
Vimeur: Speaking of which, I was only sent here because when asked "do you like theater?" I answered "no."
Vimeur: I suppose they don't want Gardes posted here to be distracted by performances or trials. We do need to focus on work, after all.
