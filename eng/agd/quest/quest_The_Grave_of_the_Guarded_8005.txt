# The Grave of the Guarded


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whew, that was the last of them! Now, let's see what it was they were trying to hide.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Dain... Why so quiet?
Dainsleif: I'm just thinking, nothing more. If you're trying to console me, I can assure you there is no need.
Paimon: Hmph! Fine...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey look, vines. You should be able to climb up, right?

## Talk 4

Paimon: So there's no Abyss Order secrets to be found here... Just a bunch of hilichurls nearing the end of their existence.
Paimon: We probably shouldn't disturb them.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Halfdan jumped down over there. Let's follow him.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Oh no, more Black Serpent Knights!
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Huh, they're not coming after us. Are they just trying to scare us off?
Paimon: These knights seem like they're hiding something behind them...
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Dainsleif: Hold on, I think they...
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Aah, they're coming! Quick, get them!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Huh!? What's this?
Dainsleif: ...So the Black Serpent Knights have nothing to do with the Abyss Order's secret. Huh, I should have guessed.
Paimon: So what exactly is going on with these hilichurls?
Dainsleif: As I said, for these hilichurls, the end is nigh.
Traveler: The hilichurls are preparing to meet their end...
Dainsleif: They have grown old and fearful of the light, even become one with the darkness. And yet the curse continues to corrode them.
Paimon: But why would the Black Serpent Knights wanna stay here and guard them?
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Paimon: Aah! More of them are closing in!
Black Serpent Knight of Old: !!!
Traveler: Let's try to avoid fighting them.
Halfdan (???): !
Paimon: ...It's him! The guy that came out of nowhere and disappeared again!
Paimon: And now they're retreating... Did he just order them to do that?
Dainsleif: ...Halfdan?
Halfdan (???): ...
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, what? You recognize him?
Dainsleif: ...Could it be... If it's as I suspect, then this is a truly tragic state of affairs.
Paimon: Dain?
Dainsleif: You want to know why they were gathered here guarding the hilichurls, don't you?
Dainsleif: It's because as far as the Black Serpent Knights are concerned, they are simply doing their duty.
Dainsleif: The one who ordered them to retreat just now... I suddenly recognized him. I knew him as a young man, an elite in the Royal Guard of old... His name is "Halfdan."
Paimon: So he's from 500 years ago, too...
Dainsleif: To this day, I still remember the final orders I, the Twilight Sword, gave to Halfdan on the day of disaster in Khaenri'ah, before I made haste back to the palace...
Dainsleif: "Inform all Black Serpent Knights to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs."
Dainsleif: Because we, of course, were royal guards. But this would mean nothing in the events that followed... Royals, gentry, common folk, these identities made no difference.
Dainsleif: Against the might of the gods, the only identity that mattered was being from Khaenri'ah.
Traveler: ...
Dainsleif: These Black Serpent Knights have lost their intellect. But perhaps, in whatever remains of their minds, they are still protecting the people of Khaenri'ah.
Dainsleif: If you see these ruins as Khaenri'ah in the throes of disaster, and these hilichurls as the people crying for help...
Dainsleif: ...then suddenly, I can make sense of what I'm hearing. Their growls are less of a threat and more of a warning.
Paimon: Then... what are they saying?
Dainsleif: Though it is barely discernible, I can just about make it out. They keep repeating a word from the old language of Khaenri'ah... "Run."
Traveler: So they're not talking to us...
Dainsleif: Even I have to admit, the fact their will is strong enough to survive 500 years of erosion... It is nothing short of a miracle born from hopelessness.
Paimon: Oh... So Paimon had them all wrong...
Dainsleif: It doesn't matter. Even I took them for enemies for a moment.
Dainsleif: Let's keep heading toward the light at the top. I believe the Black Serpent Knights will no longer try to stop us.
Traveler: So they're telling the hilichurls behind them to escape...
Traveler: Fighting them is meaningless.
Traveler: "End"...

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey look, there's no door sealing this room off. Looks like we can finally head to the room in the center.
Paimon: C'mon, let's go!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Look, up there! A water pool!
Paimon: Even the water pool is upside-down. Wow! This is a pretty amazing place.
Paimon: Dain, do you have any idea at all how it works?
Dainsleif: The pool must be part of the entire city structure, a relic of this ancient civilization.
Dainsleif: And more importantly... it is the very thing that is weakening the curse.
Dainsleif: Here, my whole body feels more at peace than it has in a long time. The effect is stronger here than it was before, and I think it's because that water pool has something akin to a cleansing effect.
Paimon: Cleansing? So that means... the water in that pool can wash away the curse for good?
Dainsleif: No. That would be impossible.
Paimon: How are you so sure?
Dainsleif: I have lived with this curse for 500 years, and I have been fully conscious the entire time... Suffice to say, no one understands the curse like I do.
Dainsleif: It is a way of branding us at the level of the fate of the world itself. When a god applies a curse, it takes effect at a higher level of reality than the person themselves.
Dainsleif: Even now, I can feel the curse slowly permeating my entire being, becoming part of me, slowly but surely replacing me.
Dainsleif: Perhaps it may be possible to suppress the corrosive effect of the curse for a time, but cleansing it entirely...
Dainsleif: Consider it tantamount to burning away an integral part of your body. It is not a process that one could ever hope to survive.
Paimon: Huh!? Cleansing the curse costs you your life? Whoa... An irreversible curse, Paimon can't even imagine...
Dainsleif: In any case, I can feel that the water's cleansing effect is not nearly potent enough. At most, it might suppress the curse but a little.
Paimon: Hmm? So what's that contraption there? It looks kinda out of place...
Traveler: An Abyss Order device?
Dainsleif: Frankly, I have never seen a device of this design before either. It is not unreasonable to suspect that it could belong to the Abyss Order. But what could they be planning to do here...
Investigate (???): (*clunk* *clunk*...)
Paimon: Yikes! That gave Paimon a fright... So all the doors are open now?
Halfdan: ...
Paimon: Wah, Halfdan's back again...
Dainsleif: Halfdan. Do you have something to say to me?
Halfdan: ...
Paimon: He ran off... but he didn't disappear like last time!
Dainsleif: He's indicating that we should follow him. Are you coming?
Traveler: This could be a useful lead.
Paimon: True... So, uh... We going, then?
Traveler: He doesn't seem to hold any malice toward us.
Traveler: Perhaps it's the Abyss Order's secret.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: More hilichurls. And they look really well-protected.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: All these hilichurls want is to quietly fade away in peace... Paimon hopes they can get their final wish.

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Paimon's never seen such well-behaved hilichurls before. Paimon wonders if it has anything to do with being an old soul.
