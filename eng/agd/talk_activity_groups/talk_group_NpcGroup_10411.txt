Paimon: Hi there, are you here for The Crux Clash too?
Chai Yi: That's right. Nothing beats real-life combat for honing your skills. That's what our master taught us.
Chai Yi: But this tournament is more than just a chance to put training into practice â€” it's also a chance for us to obtain the Masterless Vision.
Liang: Exactly! With a Vision, we'd quickly become our master's top students.
Paimon: This master of yours must be pretty incredible, huh... Are they someone famous?
Chai Yi: Famous? He's the founder of the Lingshan Clan, and his skills are unparalleled! Liang and I are both proud disciples of his.
Traveler: The Lingshan Clan...?
Chai Yi: You probably wouldn't have heard of it, it was founded quite recently. The clan is nowhere near as famous as the master himself, anyway.
Chai Yi: He's got to be a grandmaster or something. He's created many different styles of kung fu, and countless other clans have borrowed extensively from him.
Chai Yi: To the Lingshan Clan, he teaches a special technique known as "force dispersal."
Paimon: "Force dispersal"?
Chai Yi: It's a type of breathing exercise where you can train yourself to harness the energy around you and neutralize attacks without moving an inch.
Chai Yi: For example, our master can use it to alter the path of an attacking fist, or change the direction of an incoming stone, all without breaking a sweat!
Liang: One time, he sent a challenger flying into the air without lifting a finger!
Traveler: Is that really possible?
Chai Yi: It sure is! But it's extremely difficult to cultivate this ability. We've been training for ages, and we're still getting to grips with the very basics. There's no way we could use it proficiently yet.
Liang: *sigh* We're clearly not that naturally gifted, or we would have at least gotten the gist by now... If we don't start making progress soon, we'll probably run out of money to pay the tuition fees and still have nothing to show for all our training...
Paimon: There's a tuition fee!?
Liang: Of course! This is a grandmaster we're talking about here. He doesn't have time to waste. If you want face-to-face training, you've gotta show you're sincere about it.
Chai Yi: *sigh* But here we are, having trained under him directly all this time without even a hint of improvement. Master is getting increasingly impatient with us.
Chai Yi: Recently, though, we heard that a Vision bearer joined the Guhua Clan and made pretty much instant progress in their training.
Liang: So, if we can get our hands on a Vision, too, maybe we can finally make our master proud!
Traveler: A Vision won't make you better at martial arts.
Chai Yi: Well, we have to try something new, otherwise, we're stuck in the same situation.
Liang: Exactly, it can't hurt to try. And if it turns out it does work, the Lingshan Clan will go down in history!
Liang: Folks will come from far and wide. Heck, we could even become the dominant martial arts clan in all of Liyue!
Traveler: Well... that's the spirit.
Chai Yi: See you in the arena!
Traveler: Can't fault you for trying...
Traveler: There may be other reasons why you can't seem to master this technique...
Traveler: Doesn't ring a bell.

Chai Yi: If we win... we could even start our own clan and take disciples of our own!
Liang: Keep your voice down! What if the master heard you'd been saying something like that, huh?

Paimon: Hey there... uh, but where did the other guy go?
Liang: He tried to use force dispersal to deflect a punch, but instead he took it straight to the nose. There was blood all over the place...
Liang: His opponent was pretty freaked out by it. He kept asking him "why didn't you dodge?" But he was pretty much out cold by that point and couldn't reply.
Liang: "Why don't you dodge?" they ask... Because to not dodge is the very essence of Lingshan Clan kung fu. It's just that he hadn't quite mastered it yet.
Traveler: How did your match go?
Liang: Don't even get me started... I spent all my energy helping him get from here to the boat to take him back to the harbor. But by the time I got back, my scheduled match time had already passed, and I had to forfeit.
Liang: I don't dare tell my master about this... Otherwise, I'd never hear the end of it.
Liang: Sorry, I shouldn't be complaining in front of you like this. I'm afraid I'm still a bit out of sorts at the moment, so I probably won't be able to help you with whatever you were here to ask me about.
Paimon: Oh, alright then... hope your buddy makes a swift recovery. Hang in there!
Liang: Thanks, I'll do my best...

Liang: *sigh* I missed my only chance. I guess I should be heading back to Liyue as well.
