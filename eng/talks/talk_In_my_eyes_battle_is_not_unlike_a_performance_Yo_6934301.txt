# Talk Dialog

Yun Jin: In my eyes, battle is not unlike a performance: You must remain absolutely focused to avoid any errors. But all the enjoyment of performing isn't present in battle, so it inevitably gets tiring after a while.
Yun Jin: Take a moment and allow yourself to rest. We can have a nice chat over some refreshments and tea.
Yun Jin: Once we've replenished our strength, we will begin our next act, and teach those villains a lesson they won't ever forget.
