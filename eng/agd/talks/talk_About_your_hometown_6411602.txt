Traveler: About your hometown...
Ariana: My hometown is Sumeru City. My family is still there. I moved to Port Ormos to look after the ship.
Ariana: The people back in Sumeru, especially the Akademiya researchers, all walked at a pace way too leisurely for me!
Ariana: Life here is busy, fulfilling, and more profitable â€” much better than back home.
Ariana: Even the hot curry I get after work tastes better.
