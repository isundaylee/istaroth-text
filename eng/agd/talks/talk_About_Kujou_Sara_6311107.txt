# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About Kujou Sara...
Kujou Masahito: She mentioned that both you and Sangonomiya Kokomi showed up at the signing of the ceasefire, and that you were one of the witnesses to the peace talks.
Kujou Masahito: I will be honest. While I do not disagree with the results of the peace talks themselves, I am under no illusions that the differences between the Shogunate and the Sangonomiya will be wiped away so easily.
Kujou Masahito: We of the Shogunate serve the Almighty Shogun, while Sangonomiya worships the already-slain god, Orobaxi. Such a huge gulf in our beliefs will not be bridged by a little ceasefire agreement.
Kujou Masahito: As an officer of the Shogun's army, I will not relax my vigil simply because of this brief peace.
Kujou Masahito: As for you... If you were to be on the other side when conflict breaks out again, I will have to face you in battle.
