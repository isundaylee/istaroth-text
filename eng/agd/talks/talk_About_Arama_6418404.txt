Traveler: About Arama...
Araja: Araja misses him very much. With Arama turning into the new Ashvattha, Araja's dreams have become quieter.
Araja: The time when Nara and Aranara spend time together, and walk the shades together. Araja can't recall anything like that, but stories remain.
Araja: Araja was hoping, Arama could see a similar world as a seed. But everything ends up in Sarva, where Nara and Aranara will be joined.
Araja: #Also, Araja is delighted, for the friendship between Arama and Nara Traveler.
