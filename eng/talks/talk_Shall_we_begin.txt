# Talk Dialog

Ranjit: Shall we begin?
Traveler: Let's.
Traveler: Just how are Pyro Regisvines and Natlan's Saurians alike?
Ranjit: ...Haha, I'm sure you didn't know this, but Natlan is home to fire-breathing Saurians! That excessive amount of Pyro on your skin... Now that's the flavor of Natlan for you!
Ranjit: So that's the plan. I mean, the first step of any challenge should be starting on a lower difficulty, wouldn't you say?
Ranjit: A Pyro Regisvine neither dodges nor hides, and you don't have to search for it or worry that it might escape. There could be no subject more suitable.
Ranjit: And even if negotiations with it fall through, its fruit will still make for a good ingredient for some creative cooking...
Traveler: Now that you mention it, I haven't met a single person from Natlan...
Ranjit: Well, about that... They have a lot of reservations about leaving their land... Which I don't feel comfortable talking about as a foreigner.
Ranjit: I'm not too sure about their rules and taboos, but I doubt that it's the unfamiliar environments that are the problem, haha.
Traveler: I've got other things to handle. See you around.
Ranjit: No worries. I'll wait for you here.
