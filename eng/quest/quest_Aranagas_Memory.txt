# Aranaga's Memory


## Talk 1

Khayyam: Thank you both, Javans. It must've been hard, traveling with this old man.
Khayyam: Right, if you don't mind... This is hardly anything precious, but take it as a souvenir.
Paimon: Wow... What is it? What is it?
Khayyam: You should have seen it before, this little dried flower.
Paimon: Ehhh!
Traveler: This is...
Khayyam: Yes. If I'm right... They must have gifted you the same thing, right?
Khayyam: Hehe... I knew it, our encounter is by no means coincidental... I never believe in chances.
Khayyam: I'm trusting this flower with you. Please, take it to our friends in common.
Paimon: Sure, we can do that, but...
Traveler: They might have forgotten me.
Khayyam: ...
Khayyam: I can't see them, either... I can't even believe in their existence. Maybe... they are just my childhood fantasies...
Khayyam: But I am not giving up. Take this to them, children... Before the day you can never meet, before the possibility of a miracle fades.
Traveler: They might have forgotten you.
Traveler: Aranara...

## Talk 2

Aranaga: Why come here, you two?
Paimon: Whoa!! Y—You scared Paimon!
Aranaga: Know my name, you two. But has never seen you here before, Aranaga.
Aranaga: So... why come here?
Traveler: This is hard to explain...
Paimon: Even if you have forgotten many things, you should know that we don't mean any harm! We're always on your side, and we'll always help Mawtiyima!
Aranaga: Mawtiyima... You know?
Aranaga: Hmph, don't look like bad guys, you.
Aranaga: But please don't stay, here. Leave soon. Still recovering, the forest... So, no staying here, new guests.
Paimon: Hey, wait!
Traveler: We have something for you!
Aranaga: Something, for me?
Aranaga: Give me.
Traveler: Here.
Aranaga: ...
Paimon: See? Remember? You gave us the same flower before!
Aranaga: Really... are friends with me? Very important flower, why here, with you?
Traveler: Uh...
Black Screen Text: You explain all the adventures in detail to Aranaga, as well as how you saved Mawtiyima from The Withering.
Aranaga: ...
Paimon: What about that? Rings a bell?
Aranaga: Don't understand, don't remember...
Paimon: Whaaat!?
Traveler: *sigh*
Aranaga: But, thank you. My garden, if remember. Please come.
Aranaga: Very important flower, will plant, Aranaga.
Black Screen Text: Aranaga leaves with the flower.
Paimon: Aranaga just... left.
Traveler: Yeah, he left.
Paimon: Well, Aranaga invited us to his garden, though... That means he didn't refuse to be friends with us, right? Let's pay him a visit sometime!
Traveler: But he invited us.
Paimon: Hmm... That's right. Let's visit Aranaga sometime, shall we?
Traveler: That's not unexpected...
Traveler: It's a long story...
Traveler: We're friends.
Aranaga: Friends...?

## Talk 3

Khayyam: The plants here are growing pretty nicely...
Traveler: About the plants...
Khayyam: I never thought soil that had been tainted by Marana could ever provide nourishment for plants again.
Traveler: About those "imaginary friends"...
Khayyam: Dismissing the unique lifeforms that kids call Aranara as "imaginary friends" is undoubtedly incorrect.
Khayyam: Since the Akademiya sensors couldn't detect them either, only young kids could prove that they exist.
Khayyam: Hence, Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta has classified them as "unidentified lifeforms."

## Talk 4

Khayyam: I am focusing my investigation mainly on three sites. Haha, I hope my memories of 30 years ago haven't totally faded... I should be able to identify the locations.
Khayyam: All in all, thanks for your companionship.
Paimon: Don't mention it, Mr. Khayyam! That's what we Javans should do!

## Talk 5

Khayyam: Interesting... The plants here seem to be... reviving. So Mawtiyima is back in effect... Magical.
Paimon: Eh... So Mr. Khayyam knows about Mawtiyima, too? Paimon thought only Aranara know that...
Traveler: Paimon, shush!
Khayyam: Aranara, right? So you have also seen them...
Paimon: Huh...? Um... Y—Yes.
Traveler: What's the matter, Mr. Khayyam?
Khayyam: "Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose, and Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows."
Khayyam: We should proceed to the next site.
Traveler: Have you seen Aranara, too?
Traveler: Paimon...!

## Talk 6

Khayyam: Ha! Here! Look at this!
Paimon: Eh? New plant? Why are you so excited?
Khayyam: No, not that, but even better! Look at it, our secret castle! Ha! What a mess it is now!
Paimon: Eh...? "Secret castle"?
Khayyam: Haha! Here returns Scholar Omar! He came with the celestial secrets! Irfan, Siman, where are you! Aren't you bidding a welcome to me?
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...
Khayyam: Ah... Ahem, my apologies, children. I... I was carried away.
Khayyam: Old age always does this to me, blurring the present, and endearing the past, more and more... Hehe...
Khayyam: Irfan and Siman, they are friends of mine. We built the castle together, the three of us together.
Khayyam: Back then, Irfan was the great musician, Siman was the supreme commander, and I was the astrology scholar. We switched our roles sometimes, you know... Children would play something different after getting bored.
Khayyam: Irfan was talented in music; Siman was tall and strong, beyond comparison; and me? Haha, I was just an avid reader born in a family with a little extra Mora.
Traveler: Is this where you played house in childhood?
Khayyam: No, this is our secret world — I'm serious about it. We made a promise together, saying that we will never forget each other, and will lead the Reconquest Army to take back the castle...
Khayyam: Hehe, 20 years have passed, and they might have forgotten our promise... It became my own research campsite in the forest, which was kept in operation till 30 years ago.
Khayyam: After that, even Marana had come, but the Reconquest Army never showed up. Hehe, that's understandable... How could those childish promises stand up against death itself?
Paimon: But... Since you still remember them, they must be doing the same! Please don't lose your heart, Mr. Khayyam!
Khayyam: Lose heart? No way. The childhood memories, shared "imaginary friends," and the world closed to adults. It may be a pity, but... Time won't reverse itself.
Paimon: "Imaginary friends"... Do you mean Aranara?
Traveler: Paimon, shush!
Khayyam: ...
Khayyam: Haha... I almost forgot, I asked you to help me sample these newly-grown plants, not for chit-chat.
Khayyam: Please forgive this old man for talking too much nonsense. Let's continue.
Traveler: You talk too much, Paimon!
Traveler: Did you and your friends make all this...?
Khayyam: No, not all of these. We promised that we will lead the Reconquest Army to take back the castle... Hehe.
Khayyam: I grew up to be a botanical researcher in the Akademiya, and I happened to return here for some reconstruction. I visited multiple times, bringing and taking away plenty of rubbish here.

## Talk 7

Khayyam: Look, look here... The plants are thriving! It seems that the soil devastated by Marana could still nourish lively plants!
Khayyam: Haha, Mawtiyima you old pal! Still active, aren't you?
Paimon: Wow, Mr. Khayyam seems to get younger all of a sudden!
Traveler: And Paimon seems to know what to say all of a sudden!
Paimon: Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
Khayyam: Hmm... These should be enough. Thanks for coming all the way here with me. Since we have done everything planned, we should go now.
Khayyam: Haha, this is excellent... These samples might really help my research on the secrets and weaknesses of The Withering...
Khayyam: Thanks for your hard work, let us take the same route back... I have something for you.
Paimon: Yay! Rewards!
Khayyam: Hehe, it could be.
Traveler: Yay!
Paimon: Paimon's not sure what you mean, but yay!
