Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Nobumori: Hello! Welcome to Komore Teahouse. I am a doorman for the Kamisato Clan, and I work here.
Nobumori: That being said, I really have nothing better to do than drinking tea here... It's far more relaxed compared to the days when I still had a Vision. It's not bad. Not bad at all.
