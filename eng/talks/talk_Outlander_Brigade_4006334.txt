Traveler: "Outlander Brigade"?
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's right! Striking name, eh? Don't worry, the text itself reads just as well as it sounds like it might!
Kayabuki Ikkei: Trust me, this series is going to be a big hit for sure!
Kayabuki Ikkei: At the moment, "When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai" is just the first volume in the series. As for the second and third volumes, I already have some ideas for their names...
Kayabuki Ikkei: The second shall be named "The Fatal Flowery Blade," and the third, "Blond Samurai, Go With the Wind."
Kayabuki Ikkei: Heh, I guess you could call me a prodigious talent in naming things.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That said, I haven't decided on what to write exactly... although that's not really important at the moment.
