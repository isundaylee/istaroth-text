# Missing title (4023433839)

Araja: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, we meet again. Hehehe...
Paimon: You look very happy, Araja!
Araja: Hoho... I am indeed very happy to see Vanarana so lively, with so many Aranara having returned home. Ah, I never thought that I'd be able to participate in Festival Utsava in person...
Traveler: You haven't participated in it before?
Araja: The stories say that I did participate. It was a long, long time ago...
Araja: I, Aramuhukunda, Arana, Araji... Many of us Aranara celebrated Festival Utsava together with Nara Varuna.
Araja: It was a very difficult time. But we still laughed and sang together during Festival Utsava. I like this story very much.
Paimon: Huh? Then you did participate, didn't you?
Araja: Oh, I did participate, in the stories. But I no longer remember that. Those stories were all things that Arana and the others told me later.
Paimon: Hmmm... Araja is starting to sound a lot like a grandpa. Maybe Araja's just getting too old and can't remember clearly!
Araja: #Perhaps this is for the best... Anyway, Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, will you take this?
Paimon: It's a flower...
Araja: Yes. I hope that this flower will follow you in your future travels.
Traveler: I'll accept it.
Araja: Nara time is much more precious than Aranara time, so I will not keep you from enjoying yourselves. Go look for Arakavi later. He is also preparing for the Festival Utsava ceremony.
Traveler: Thanks.
Traveler: I'm very happy too.
Paimon: Paimon's really happy too! But haven't you ever participated in Festival Utsava before, Araja?
