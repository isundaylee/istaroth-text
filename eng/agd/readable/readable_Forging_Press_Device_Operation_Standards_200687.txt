# Forging Press Device Operation Standards

1. Pre-Startup Preparation
Step 1: Before initiating the pressing process, the operator should wear protective gear at all times and perform a comprehensive equipment inspection.
Step 2: Before starting up the equipment, the operator must *ensure the stock has been placed correctly* to prevent mechanical damage to the equipment due to idling.
Step 3: *Check the equipment's energy supply system* to ensure that the equipment can run within normal parameters.
Once the above inspection steps have been completed, *the pressing process can be initiated at the terminal*.

2. Pressing Process Operation
When the pressing process is activated, the press will cause the stock to enter an *activated state*. You need *to activate the press when the stock is giving off an orange-red light*. Operating the press with the hammers can effectively induce deformation, so the operator must pay close attention to the state of the stock at all times during operation and *manually operate the press with the hammers with the right timing*.

3. Troubleshooting
To facilitate the operator's self-inspection, a fail-safe system has been installed on the base of currently available equipment models. The operator can troubleshoot system problems based on the errors reported by the fail-safe system. For more detailed instructions, please consult the *"Emergency Response Handbook: 3rd Edition"*.
