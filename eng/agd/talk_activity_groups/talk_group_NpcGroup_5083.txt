## Talk

Roialte: Work done without error is work well done.

## Talk

Traveler: Is everything going smoothly?
Roialte: Thanks to you, other than the occasional racket the Autostamper 3000 makes, everything else is going quite alright.
Roialte: It's quieter when Mr. Thales isn't around, really, like a dog tied to a post in front of a cafe.
Roialte: You see, even the most energetic little creatures know that a little rest will allow one to run further the next day.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Roialte: Take care.

## Talk

Roialte: The day is so lively with the youngsters around and the night seems ever more quiet by comparison.

## Talk

Traveler: Good evening.
Roialte: Good evening, Traveler. Seems like you've had a rather busy day yourself, hmm? Just like Mr. Iaune.
Roialte: You do seem a lot happier than he does, though.
Roialte: He's too passionate, and that exhausts him. This is quite common in the young, and they'll need some time to adjust.
Roialte: Don't worry, Semaine and I will keep an eye on him.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Roialte: See you, then. Tomorrow will be another lovely day.

## Talk

Traveler: Work-life balance, I get it...
Roialte: Well said. It could be a motto.
Roialte: Cornelia just brought some refreshments, please be my guest and have some.
