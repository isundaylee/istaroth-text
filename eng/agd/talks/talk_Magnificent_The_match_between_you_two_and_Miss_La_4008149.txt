# Talk Dialog

Souka: Magnificent! The match between you two and Miss Layla was intense but not hostile. This is exactly what a friendly match should look like!
Traveler: Thank you!
Paimon: Hehe, Layla would be really happy to hear that!
Souka: I didn't know how to portray a character that's the protagonist's competitor... but then turned into the protagonist's friend instead. But I have a very clear idea about it now!
Souka: I need to think about the structure of the story and add a character like that for the protagonist!
Traveler: Our match was friendly as well.
Paimon: Yeah, we were pretty relaxed when we were up against Souka as well. There was no anxiety or hostility either.
Souka: I know that you guys took it easy on me... but treating someone as ordinary as I am with such kindness... I don't even know how to thank the two of you!
Souka: Hmm, I'm gonna have to make some edits after I add this arc to the novel... It might be too much for the reader to handle if I were to disqualify the protagonist's rival... The tone needs to be a little more serious!
Traveler: But Miko lost.
Paimon: Yeah, Miko lost, what a shame!
Souka: Huh? Didn't Lady Yae lose on purpose?
Souka: She's probably more interested in the story of the gathering of the beast tamers â€”I wonder what kind of development would satisfy her...
Paimon: Yeah... you're right.
Paimon: But she was clearly getting to Haniyyah... A few more words and she would've been able to set Haniyyah straight...
Souka: That's probably because Lady Yae felt like her role wasn't the one that's supposed to be the close friend to Haniyyah in this story. She didn't want to steal your spotlight!
Souka: Besides, seeing how things have developed, maybe Lady Yae finds this to be "the perfect place to end the chapter"!
Paimon: Paimon can't understand any of this writer lingo...
Traveler: Let's chat again next time...
Souka: Sure! Keep up the good work! I'm looking forward to watching you guys in the finals!
