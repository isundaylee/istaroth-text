# An Art to Be Honed


## Talk 1

Asakura: I must! I must...
Asakura: Huh? Who are you?
Traveler: I accepted your commission.
Asakura: Oh, you mean my request for a training partner. That's right, I posted that. I want to find someone as my martial arts training partner.
Asakura: So you're the one who accepted it? I don't think I have ever met you in the city before.
Asakura: Sorry, I don't mean to question your strength. But I'm really not sure what your martial arts skills are like...
Traveler: I've defeated giant dragons before.
Asakura: Hahaha... is that so? Actually, I'm more curious about where you found one of those. I've only heard of them before...
Traveler: Oh, don't worry, I'm pretty capable.
Asakura: Haha, anyway, words won't prove anything. Let's put the words to test with our hands then.
Traveler: Gladly.
Traveler: Actually, why did you post that commission anonymously?
Asakura: Well, it's actually because of something that I... am not proud of...
Asakura: Ahem, since you have already accepted it, I will tell you the truth, then.
Asakura: Earlier, I went out on a mission with several Doushin. On the way back, we ran into a group of Kairagi who were getting ready to raid a merchant caravan.
Asakura: We rushed over there to rescue the caravan. In the beginning, we had the upper hand, and they quickly retreated.
Asakura: But when we were just about to have a break, another group of Kairagi suddenly came out of nowhere, and there seemed to be a leader commanding them.
Asakura: Before my colleagues and I could react, they were already overwhelming us...
Asakura: Having lost the upper hand, we could only try fending the Kairagi off while escorting the merchants back to the town.
Asakura: And when I was fighting against that Kairagi leader... he took my weapon.
Asakura: And that guy actually held my weapon up after taking it, laughing at me all the while. It was so humiliating...
Traveler: What happened to that group of merchants?
Asakura: We ran into other patrolling Doushin while retreating, so those Kairagi also retreated after seeing them.
Asakura: Those merchants were also escorted to the city by us. But their goods were all... *sigh* It's all because my skills were lacking...
Asakura: After returning, I was also issued another weapon. But I still can't get over what happened...
Asakura: Therefore, I posted that commission in the hopes of honing my skill.
Asakura: Once I am powerful enough, I'm going to defeat that Kairagi myself and take my weapon back, clearing this stain from my name!
Traveler: I witnessed the fall of a god.
Asakura: Eh, what are you talking about? You mean that you've taken part in the Rite of Descension in Liyue before, right?
Asakura: Hahaha, based on your logic, many people in Liyue have "witnessed the fall of a god" as well.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Bring it on!
Asakura: Swords do not discriminate. Here I come!

## Talk 3

Asakura: Did you hold back just now?
Asakura: Don't worry about my pride. Please bring out all you have. I... must become stronger!

## Talk 4

Asakura: *panting* You... are indeed formidable.
Asakura: I... I have learned much.
Traveler: Are you okay?
Asakura: That's... alright. I just need to catch my breath...
Asakura: But you are so powerful that I would have believed it even if you claimed to have defeated a giant dragon...
Traveler: Actually, I have defeated giant dragons...
Asakura: Hahaha... I believe you, of course. Thank you for training with me. I will remember what I have learned from this match.
Asakura: If you do not mind, please come and practice with me often from now on. Having a strong warrior such as yourself as my training partner... I am sure that I will complete that deed soon.
Traveler: "That deed"?
Asakura: Ahem... It's just a little wish I have on my mind. Thank you for your help. Please take these as payment.
Asakura: Now, I need to go back and take a break. Your moves were most mighty indeed...
Traveler: Sorry, I didn't control my strength back then...
