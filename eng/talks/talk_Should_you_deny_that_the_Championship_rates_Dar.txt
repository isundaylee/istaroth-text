Yavanani: ...Should you deny that the Championship rates Darshans based on their scores, please recall that we all entered our respective Darshans via our test scores.
Yavanani: To overlook the scores is to overlook the very basis for all assessments made by the Darshans.
Khaldun: In turn, you should remember before you overemphasize the scores, that they are only representative of how each contestant performs for specific tasks exclusive to the competition.
Khaldun: Moreover, we also need to consider other probabilistic factors such as weather, geography, morale and so on.
Yavanani: Oh? And we didn't need to consider this when we were testing into our Darshans?
Khaldun: A sophistic comparison! My test scores can represent my capabilities, but it does not showcase the totality of what a Darshan represents.
Khaldun: A foolish opinion as usual. No offense intended.
Yavanani: Disagree though you may, scores determine the rankings and results speak for everything.
