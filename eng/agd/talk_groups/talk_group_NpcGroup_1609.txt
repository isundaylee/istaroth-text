Marvin: You came to me again, my darling Marla!
Marla: Oh, Marvin; how could I ever let you go! I don't care what your father thinks about our being together, my love for you is like... like the ice at the river's source in Springvale...
Marvin: Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
Marla: I mean not that; I mean that my love will become a sweet spring of live-giving water with which to quench your thirst for a thousand â€” nay, for ten thousand years...
Marvin: Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the eyes of the eagle who soars over Falcon Coast...
Marla: Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so shrewd...
Marvin: I mean not that; I mean that I could not bear for you to disappear from my gaze, even for a moment; and if ever there came one who sought to steal you away from me, I would surely make known unto them the sharpness of my talons and the hardness of my beak...
Marla: Oh, Marvin!
Marvin: Oh, Marla!
