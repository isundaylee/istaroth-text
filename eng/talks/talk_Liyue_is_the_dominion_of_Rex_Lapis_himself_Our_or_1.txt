Master Zhang: Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
Master Zhang: Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
Master Zhang: They've found quite a fair bit of abnormal Crystal Ore lately. Some call them Magical Crystal Ores â€” ordinary Crystal Ores can't hold a candle to them in either form or quality.
Master Zhang: It's a shame that they are so hard to work with. Even I cannot make heads or tails of them...
Master Zhang: If you can find a way to work with these ores, do come and find me.
Master Zhang: I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
