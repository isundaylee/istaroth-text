# Sea Breeze Rendezvous


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's The Knave! And... Childe!?
Paimon: Hey, aren't you supposed to be in Snezhnaya recuperating? What are you still doing in Fontaine?
Childe: Oh, it's you two. I didn't expect to run into you here... *coughing*
Childe: I was unconscious for quite a while after the fight in the Primordial Sea. After I woke up, I realized I was being taken back to Snezhnaya, and well...
Childe: I couldn't have that, now could I? Not when I've still got unfinished business here in Fontaine. So, I mustered up all my strength and made the journey back on my own.
Paimon: What sort of unfinished business are we talking here?
Childe: It has to do with Skirk... My master. I really wanted to meet up with her... But, by the time I got back, she had already left.
Childe: I still have so many questions for her. Without any other leads... all I could do was ask The Knave to help me track her down. She must have left behind some traces from her time in Fontaine.
Paimon: Oh, okay... So, have you found any clues?
The Knave: Unfortunately, no. While the House of the Hearth is adept at collecting all manner of intelligence, certain existences... can still manage to escape our purview.
Childe: Basically, unless Master feels there's a need to meet with me, she's not going to be found.
Childe: But, that problem has an easy fix. I just need to become stronger, and then... *coughing*
Paimon: Uh... Paimon thinks you should focus on getting better first.
Childe: Haha, the worst of it is over.
Childe: It's all thanks to that one kid from the House of the Hearth... Heloir I think her name was. She gave me a bunch of random potions to drink. They didn't go down easy, let me tell you — pain and chills all over. But, they really did help speed up my recovery.
Childe: And that's good, because it looks like I really do have to head back this time. The old man's been putting the pressure on me. He sent someone to tell me I'm needed for some sort of project...
The Knave: "Project Stuzha"?
Childe: Yeah, that's the one. *sigh* I heard Regrator's involved too. I'm not looking forward to having to listen to all his monologuing, that's for sure. Hey, maybe you could think of a way for me to stay in Fontaine for a little longer?
Childe: Helping Lyney and the others brush up on their fighting skills would be far more interesting. If you and I could spar — that would be even better. I've been waiting for the chance to see you go all out.
The Knave: And what a sweet, little daydream that is. But, I also have a role to play in all this. I'll be leaving Fontaine shortly as well.
The Knave: Besides, considering how little they see fit to step outside the homeland, being called on to return to Snezhnaya by such illustrious dignitaries... What a great "honor," wouldn't you agree?
Childe: Haha... One I could do without, I'd say.
Paimon: Is it just Paimon? Or, does it kinda seem like they're...
Traveler: Just casually trash-talking their colleagues behind their backs...?
The Knave: So, dear guests of the House of the Hearth, to what do I owe the visit?
Paimon: Um... Well, we just, uh...
Traveler: Wanted to learn more about you.
Paimon: Right! We're super close to Lyney and the others, but we still don't know much about you!
The Knave: Is that so? Introductions have already been made, have they not?
Paimon: Oh, well, you see... There's only so much you can learn about someone from a short introduction! At least tell us something a little extra, like... Why do you call yourself "Father"?
Childe: Ooh, good question! I'd also like to know.
The Knave: The fact that you have to ask tells me our intelligence work has been quite successful. Telling you the answer to that question would only serve to undermine that success, and we can't have that, now can we?
Childe: Spoken like a true diplomat. That was some expert sidestepping right there.
The Knave: Well, if there's nothing else, I think I'll take my leave. I still have a small matter to resolve at home.
Paimon: Uh... Wait! Don't go!
Traveler: (If The Knave leaves right now, she's sure to run into Lyney and Clervie...!)
Traveler: (Should I release the bird Lyney gave us? No, we should try to get her talking about something else first.)
Traveler: About the House of the Hearth...
Childe: Oho, I'd also like to hear the answer to this.
Childe: I've met some of the members of your organization, and they all seemed like really good kids. They actually reminded me of Tonia and Teucer.
Childe: Which, by the way, if you ever betray them, I'm just letting you know — I won't let you off easy.
The Knave: And why would I betray them?
Childe: Well, you've already betrayed the House of the Hearth once, haven't you? At least... that's what I heard.
The Knave: ...
Childe: Okay, okay. I admit, that's just what the old man told me... The Rooster, I mean.
Traveler: (The Knave betrayed the House of the Hearth... So, does that mean what Clervie said was true? Does The Knave really treat her children like test subjects?)
Paimon: W—Wait... did you really do something bad to those kids?
The Knave: Never mind what I've done, I'm more curious as to what the mighty Rooster had to say. Care to enlighten me?
Childe: Ah, well, nothing much... Just some stuff about you taking out many other members of the House of the Hearth, and even going so far as to attack your own "family."
The Knave: Hmm... I see.
Childe: Based on your reaction, I'm guessing it's all a bunch of lies?
The Knave: Hardly. I don't appreciate his particular turns of phrase, but I suppose he didn't say anything untrue.
The Knave: Although, it would be more accurate to say that there is a certain level of prejudice involved... But, I don't intend to clear that up just yet. Prejudice has a funny way of concealing the real truth behind certain things — an attribute that I find to be quite advantageous.
The Knave: Call yourself a Fontainian, for example, and people will assume all sorts of things, when the real truth... is that this is simply the land where I was raised.
Paimon: Huh!? You're not actually from Fontaine!? But then, why did you try to help out with the prophecy and everything?
The Knave: I was trying to protect the children born in Fontaine. Claiming that I, myself, was a Fontainian simply made it easier to operate. People would hardly suspect a fellow Fontainian of having any ulterior motives. Who wouldn't want to save their homeland, after all?
The Knave: The Primordial Sea wouldn't have any effect on me, but it would have caused great harm to the House of the Hearth... Well, you wanted "extra information," didn't you? There you go. I hope that satisfied your curiosity.
Traveler: (So much for learning anything else about her "betrayal." She probably only revealed that other secret in order to change the subject. It seems like she's trying to avoid talking about her past...)
Childe: So, you stayed in Fontaine for the kids... I guess I was wrong to believe you'd betray them. Apologies. Looks like I was holding on to some prejudices myself.
The Knave: Good. Like I said — I like it when others have misconceptions of me.
Childe: Actually, while I was recuperating at the House of the Hearth, there was something else that really caught my attention.
Childe: I heard that members always resolve disputes and arguments with a friendly spar, and the loser has to back down. Seems pretty cool, if you ask me. Would also give them plenty of opportunities to hone their skills.
The Knave: Well, that's only a recent development. In the past, such spars weren't nearly so... friendly. The losing party would lose everything, including their life.
Paimon: They were that high stakes!? Phew, at least that's not a thing anymore!
Childe: Well, the current atmosphere's not half bad. I'm a bit jealous, actually. You've got so many family members around you, and you even get to live with them.
The Knave: Having a lot of family around means dealing with a considerable amount of bickering and scheming. Once Tonia and Teucer enter their rebellious phase, I'm sure you'll understand.
The Knave: Just imagine... Teucer becomes obsessed with plucking out strands from the Rooster's mustache, or Tonia decides to dye her hair 42 different colors...
Childe: Okay, okay! I get the picture.
Black Screen Text: As the conversation shifts to the topic of Tonia and Teucer, Childe begins to share story after story about his siblings.
Black Screen Text: It's the type of conversation that would usually leave you falling asleep, but you find yourself grateful to Childe for buying you more time.
Childe: Ah, well, would you look at the time. I should probably get going.
Childe: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, I'm not sure where our paths will cross next, but the next time we run into each other, we should definitely try and find some time to spar... *coughing*
Paimon: Again, maybe this is a conversation we can have when you look less like you're gonna keel over...
Childe: Alright, alright... Well, thanks for everything, Arlecchino.
The Knave: No thanks necessary. You also played a part in obtaining the Gnosis. I would say we can call ourselves even.
Childe: Hah, I like the sound of that... Well, I'm off. See you all some other time.
Paimon: We should probably get going too... Do you wanna head back with us?
The Knave: Oh? You want me to leave so soon?
Paimon: Oh, uh... Well, you see, um...
The Knave: I'm rather enjoying the evening breeze. If you don't mind, I think I'll stick around for a bit. I have some things to think about.
The Knave: Apologies for not attending to you like a proper host. Please, forgive the slight. I do hope you'll have a pleasant stay.
Traveler: What does the organization mean to you?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Lyney! How'd everything go?
Lyney: Well, long story short, we ran into a small issue — Clervie can't go into the sunlight.
Traveler: What do you mean?
Lyney: Everything was fine at first. She followed me up to the surface, just like I told her.
Lyney: But as I led her out of the shadows and into the sunlight, she vanished.
Lyney: I turned around, and there she was — standing at the edge of the shadows, silently watching me.
Paimon: Maybe she's afraid of sunlight, or... No, it wouldn't be her wish if that were the case.
Paimon: Well, we could always try... pushing her into it?
Traveler: Not sure "pushing" works on a non-corporeal being...
Paimon: Oh, true...
Lyney: I've pretty much tried it all already. Nothing worked. Eventually, the sun went down, so all I could do was bring her back here.
Lyney: How did it go with you, Lynette?
Lynette: Good. I've got the list. It's right here.
Paimon: Really? Well, what are we waiting for? Let's take a look!
Paimon: Woah, that's a lot of pages! It's gonna take forever to get through it all!
Lyney: We can each take a section. Here.
Paimon: Lapouyade... Landois... Jeambel... Horrer...
Paimon: Yikes, that Horrer guy has a huge scar on his face. He's kinda giving Paimon the creeps.
Lyney: Ah, I've met him before. The scar is from an injury he received during a mission. I still remember him joking with me about it. He said any future lover would take one look at him and then lose all interest.
Paimon: Did he say anything else?
Lyney: Well, I asked if there was someone he was interested in. He said no, and that's where our conversation ended.
Lyney: It was only later that I learned he really did have someone he liked. He risked everything to escape so he could be with her, but it didn't work. One day, "Father" asked to see him, and well... I never saw him again after that.
Paimon: Wait, so that means, The Knave, she...
Lyney: It may seem cruel, but it's just one of the rules of the House.
Lyney: Betrayal is not to be taken lightly. We know too many secrets to come and go as we please. So, if you do try to leave, you pay with your life.
Black Screen Text: A solemn atmosphere descends over the group as you look through the list of names. However, Clervie's name does not seem to be among them.
Lyney: Her name's not here, huh... Well, that's not too surprising. It doesn't seem like this list is complete. It only contains records dating back around five years.
Lyney: Let's shift our attention, then. Freminet, were you able to find anything out?
Freminet: ...
Lyney: Freminet?
Freminet: Ah sorry, I was thinking about something.
Freminet: I managed to talk to quite a few people, but I couldn't help but notice that the atmosphere in the House was a little... strange.
Lynette: Strange?
Freminet: Yeah. I mean, I know there have been arguments in the past, times when people haven't gotten along. Chapleau and Filliol are a good example of that...
Paimon: Oh, those are two of the people we met while delivering supplies! Paimon can see how they might not get along. They had very different vibes, and their, um... "interests" seemed to be pretty different as well...
Lyney: That's to be expected, actually. "Father" brought us all here, shared her knowledge with us, taught us how to fight — that's one thing we all share. But, that's also where the similarities end. Not all of us feel the same desire to stay here.
Lyney: As members of the House of the Hearth, we're also considered part of the Fatui. And to a lot of people, that's an identity they never asked for.
Lyney: Certain members get older and realize they want something else for themselves. But, considering the rules of the House... most people would never say that out loud.
Lyney: People like Chapleau and Foltz are loyal to "Father" and her vision. They're proud to be part of the Fatui. Filliol and Nanteuil on the other hand... Well, they aren't quite as enthusiastic.
Lynette: These kinds of conflicts have always been there. It's not like "Father" is in the dark about any of this.
Freminet: Well, that's true, but it just feels like things have gotten worse lately. Filliol and the others... It seemed like they were meeting in secret to talk about something.
Freminet: I can't say for sure, but I think they've met Clervie.
Lyney: You think she's been inciting them to act out?
Freminet: No, not exactly... But, I wouldn't be surprised if she said something to them about "the darkness in the House" and how deep it runs.
Freminet: She's told me about it before... experiments being run on children, people being used as pawns on the battlefield without so much as the strength to survive...
Lyney: And they just believed all that? Without any evidence?
Lynette: Clervie's words probably gave them the excuse they were looking for. Whether they actually believe them to be true is secondary.
Lyney: *sigh*... This is all because of "Project Stuzha," isn't it?
Paimon: Woah, woah, woah. Hold on a second!
Paimon: What's this "Project Stuzha" all about, huh? This is the second time it's come up now!
Lyney: Sorry, but I'm not sure of the details either.
Lyney: I only know what "Father" has told us, which is that it's something The Rooster and Regrator have been working on together. Apparently, it has to do with the Fatui's strategic plan for the future.
Lyney: Because the House of the Hearth was so successful in obtaining the Gnosis, we now have the honor of playing a key role in Project Stuzha.
Paimon: Wait... but isn't that a good thing?
Lyney: "Key" role is just another way of saying "dangerous" role. To us, the whole thing is an inconvenience.
Lyney: "Father" thinks so too, but she's in no position to refuse. Their plan isn't exactly unreasonable, and they've been funneling the House a lot of funding.
Lyney: It's just that... We'll lose a lot of members in the process. Participating in the plan... It's an honor in name only. What they're really trying to do is subdue us. The existence of an intelligence organization outside their control makes them feel uneasy.
Traveler: (Looks like the Fatui are plotting something big, but given how little Lyney and the others seem to know about it, I probably won't be able to learn much.)
Traveler: (I should keep a sharp eye out during any future dealings with the Fatui to see what I can learn.)
Paimon: Okay, super complicated, top-secret Fatui business aside... What does all this have to do with the conflicts you were talking about earlier? Paimon doesn't get the connection...
Lyney: External pressure has a way of exacerbating internal strife. You can't overlook the power of fear, either. People are afraid of dying, and that fear is often the impetus for a lot of stupid decisions.
Lyney: I thought resolving the Clervie situation would make everything go back to normal.
Lyney: But it looks like things are more complicated than I thought. If we leave Filliol and the others to their own devices, sooner or later, "Father" will be forced to take action.
Lynette: We can only focus on one situation at a time, Brother.
Lyney: You're right. Even if we confront Filliol and the others, it won't do any good. It might even make matters worse. We should focus on Clervie for now.
Lyney: Well, it's getting late. We should head back and get some rest. We'll try again first thing tomorrow.
Lyney: Lynette, you stick with me this time. Freminet, keep a close eye on Filliol and the others. Make sure they don't do anything they'll regret.
Lyney: Good work today, everyone. Have a good night, and I'll see you tomorrow.

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: Your mind races with all sorts of thoughts. You try to rest, but you just can't seem to fall asleep.
Paimon: *yawn*... Paimon was looking forward to an early night, but she can't sleep at all...
Paimon: Hey, you don't think The Knave will be too angry with Lyney and everyone if she finds out about all this, do you?
Paimon: #She's even scary when she smiles. If she were to actually get angry... *shudder* You have to protect Paimon if that happens, okay {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I'm also afraid of her...
Traveler: You can just hide behind me.
Paimon: Well, in that case, we should just plan on... running away! We'll grab Lyney and the others and, we can make a break for it as fast as we can!
Paimon: #Trusty as ever, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Look! Look, over there!
Traveler: Clervie?
Traveler: What's she doing over there!?
Paimon: Quick, let's catch up with her before anyone sees!

## Talk 4

The Knave: Oh? You decided to stay a little longer? Let's take in the ocean view together then.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Clervie!
Clervie: Shh!
Clervie: I opened the window while no one was looking.
Clervie: Look how pretty the outside is...
Traveler: Window?
Clervie: If only I could have more than this.
Clervie: You probably think I'm being silly, huh? All this hopeless resisting... It's better to dream of what I could have than try to make it a reality, right?
Paimon: Please help us get on the same page here, Clervie. We need you to tell us what you know. Can you do that?
Clervie: Sure! Although... after you hear all this, I think you might regret that decision.
Clervie: Everyone in this family is nothing more than a tool, something to be used and exploited. We're all expendable... including me.
Clervie: As long as you're useful, you get to stick around. Lose your value... and you're handed over to The Doctor, experimented on, and given a fate worse than death. I've seen it happen again and again, and I've had enough.
Paimon: You're saying The Knave did all that?
Paimon: It's just... That doesn't seem like something she would do. She's scary and all, but it seems like even she has lines she wouldn't cross.
Clervie: Heh, I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Clervie: Everyone thinks she's a good person. They all think of her like a real "Mother"...
Paimon: "Mother"?
Clervie: But she doesn't deserve that title. She's disgraced it and tarnished it... and if I had things my way, I'd never see her again.
Clervie: If only Perrie were here. She'd understand...
Paimon: Perrie... There's that name again.
Paimon: Also, Paimon's getting a strange feeling...
Paimon: It almost feels like she's not really "here" with us. Paimon can't tell if she's actually talking to us, or if she's mistaken us for someone else...
Traveler: I'm not sure either.
Paimon: Hmm... Well, in any case, it seems like she really needs someone to talk to. We should keep her company for a little longer.
Paimon: She looks so young, but it seems like she's been through a lot.
Clervie: It's getting windy. I should close the window...
Clervie: Ooh, look at the moon! Isn't it pretty? ...Hey, wanna hear a secret? I heard that if you look up at the night sky in Snezhnaya, you can see the aurora. It's supposed to be super pretty... even prettier than the moon tonight.
Traveler: I'd love to see it.
Clervie: Perrie and I promised each other, that once we're older, we're gonna go see it together.
Clervie: But I can't find her. I'm worried she's also been... No, that wouldn't happen to her. She's special. Mother likes her a lot.
Clervie: I should really go talk to Mother, but we just fought. She doesn't want to see me, and I'm too scared to face her.
Clervie: What should I do...
Black Screen Text: Clervie appears lost in thought. She stands there silently and doesn't say another word.
Black Screen Text: After some time, Clervie seems to come back to herself. She gives a weak smile and leaves on her own.
Paimon: *sigh*... Paimon really doesn't understand what's going on with her.
Paimon: Well, let's head back. We've got an early morning tomorrow!
Traveler: She's a spirit. It could be anything.
Traveler: There's nothing here...

Lyney: Clervie, I'd like to take you somewhere. Is that okay with you?
Clervie: Sure! Where are we going?
