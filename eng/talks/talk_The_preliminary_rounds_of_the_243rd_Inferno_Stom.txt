Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The preliminary rounds of the 243rd 'Inferno Stomach Supremo' competition will be held in each tribe's territory! The Supreme Supremo will be determined when the winners of each tribe show off and show down at our shop!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The highlights of this year have already been revealed: The Pre-Eminent Pacal, leader of the Children of Echoes, will emerge from his exile and return to write the next chapter of his legendary '71 servings of Glittering Gemstones' feat of five years ago!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Perhaps it's due to the arrival of a dark horse, that rising star of the Collective of Plenty, the fierce, the brave, the one and only Varesa! Perhaps the record of 80 servings of Blazed Meat Stew she set has set the great Pacal's blood boiling!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Rumors say that after taking the crown of Supremo in the Collective of Plenty's preliminary competition, she even joined in those of the other tribes, apparently just out of her sheer love of food..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Just how will the legendary Pacal handle Varesa's assault? After all, she is the one who can take her time munching her way through our entire store's storehouse as though enjoying a post-meal dessert!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "In order for us to handle the challenge posed by these two 'Stomach Supremos' as well as the pressure brought to bear by the numerous other competitors, the Weary Inn will double and redouble our food reserves!"
