Traveler: About the maze...
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Legend has it that it's been occupied by a horde of monsters that are now unable to truly die because of the curse, making them stronger and stronger instead. What's more is that every time you pass through a passageway, the monsters and mechanisms in the nearby rooms randomly change.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Records seem to suggest that the color of the rooms somehow correlates to the monsters within. *White rooms* generally only contain normal monsters while*blue and orange rooms* feature elite monsters, and seem to have a connection with the watcher of the maze...
