Hajime: Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
Hajime: Speaking of which, my master gave me some Magical Crystal Ore lately. It's quite different from the usual materials I work with, and I'm not as familiar as I could be with it just yet.
Hajime: Let's do it like this: I'll mark the locations of these Magical Crystal Ores on your map, and you can mine them and have a look. If you figure out a way to work with them, it would be great if you could tell me.
