# Custom Gift Envelope No. 1


## Talk 1

Mika: Huh, this doesn't seem right, either... These gift envelopes are really hard to make.
Traveler: Mika, are you making gift envelopes?
Mika: #Traveler! What a coincidence! I wasn't expecting to see you here.
Traveler: Are you here to celebrate Lantern Rite?
Mika: Oh, no, no. I came to deliver a letter, and it just so happened to be during Lantern Rite.
Mika: Klee said she really wanted a Lantern Rite gift envelope, so I thought about buying one to take back.
Mika: Imagine my surprise when I found out you have to make them yourself...
Mika: I spent a long time trying to make one, but it still feels "off" for some reason. I can't tell where I went wrong...
Mika: #Traveler, you know more about Liyue customs than me... Could you give me some advice on how to improve it?
Traveler: Hmm, let me think about it for a second...

Mika: #Whoa, it's beautiful! So well made, and you did it so fast... You're amazing, Traveler!
Mika: ...Oh no! I should really get going! I need to report back to the Knights!
Mika: #Thanks for the help, Traveler! I'm sure Klee will love the envelope.
