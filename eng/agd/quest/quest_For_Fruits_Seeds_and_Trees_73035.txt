# For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees


## Talk 1

Paimon: Arama!
Arama: #Nara Traveler, Paimon, you seem fresh, like fresh Zaytun Peaches. But Paimon looks unhappy. Did you have a nightmare?
Paimon: Paimon was afraid you'd abandoned us!
Arama: Why would you think that? I've been here the whole time.
Traveler: What's wrong, Paimon?
Paimon: B—Because Vanarana is in a dream, and the fun we had at Festival Utsava was like a dream... Paimon was afraid that everything would all go away once we woke up...
Paimon: We'd be all that's left, just like when we first started the journey...
Arama: But the things that happen in dreams are real. I have observed Nara before and found that nightmares would make them timid, and that nice dreams would make them happy, just like things that happen outside their dreams.
Arama: So when Paimon dreamed of meeting us and also dreamed of meeting Vanarana, Paimon, it was as real as doing both in reality.
Traveler: And Arama is here too.
Arama: That's right! I'm here waiting for you to go to the Fane of Ashvattha together, to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better.
Paimon: #...That's true. Bah, Traveler, you must have put weird mushrooms in the feast to make Paimon think about such stuff.
Paimon: Let's go, then!
Traveler: And we still have to help Rana.
Arama: Yes, we have to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better!
Traveler: Don't get in your own head, Paimon. Let's go.
Arama: That's right. We've got to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija so Narana can get better!

## Talk 2

Arama: #Wonderful, this place isn't corroded by Marana like Arayama and the others were! Nara Traveler, Paimon, this is the Ashvattha Tree.
Paimon: Whoa, what a weird-looking tree...
Arama: That's rude, Paimon! You'll make the Ashvattha Tree mad! This is a very, very mighty tree — the oldest Vasara Tree there is. Even older than any Aranara and their stories...
Arama: Queen Aranyani sang here — thousands of moons ago, or perhaps even more. She had just left Valuka at the time, and the woods weren't as lush as now, so there was still lots of sand on the ground.
Arama: Her Ararakalari was more powerful than any Aranara's, since her song was the closest to the Sourcesong. So Ashvattha responded to her call and sprouted from Sarva.
Arama: Queen Aranyani told Ashvattha that there were many smart, beautiful, yet lonely Nara in the woods and that the children of the forest must increase so that they might become friends with the Nara.
Arama: Therefore, Ashvattha produced a beautiful and full pomegranate with many seeds inside, the first of which to sprout was Aramuhukunda.
Arama: That made Aramuhukunda the very first Aranara. Later, all the seeds grew and Aranara spread like leaves on a tree. We and Nara were both people of the forest.
Arama: That's why the Ashvattha Tree is very powerful and very important! Just like Nara bear Nara children, all Aranara are progeny of Ashvattha and Queen Aranyani.
Paimon: So that's how it is... Sorry, Arama. The Ashvattha Tree is super impressive!
Traveler: How rude of you, Paimon, calling someone's mother weird like that.
Paimon: Paimon didn't mean to! Anyway, what do we need to do now to get the Bija?
Arama: Right. Just like trees need earth and rain to flourish, dreams and memories are what a Vasara Tree needs. As I mentioned a moment ago, the Ashvattha Tree is the oldest of the Vasara Trees.
Arama: That's why we've brought three Vasoma Fruits from Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha as offerings for the Ashvattha Tree to bear great fruit.
Paimon: Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha's Vasoma Fruits? Don't you mean the fruits of the Vasara Trees?
Arama: That's what they are, yes.
Arama: #Stand closer to the Ashvattha Tree, Nara Traveler.
Paimon: Whoa...
Traveler: That's amazing.
Arama: Yes, all Aranara are descendants of this tree. You're now connected to all Aranara, and you bear their blessings, and so the Ashvattha Tree shall bless you too.
Arama: For as long as you wear this garland, the Ashvattha Tree will recognize you as a child of the forest.
Arama: Mmm...
Arama: Something's wrong with the Ashvattha Tree. It feels a bit weak... This must be because of the Marana that's been showing up everywhere lately.
Arama: Regardless, we're going into the Ashvattha Tree's dream next, and we'll offer the Vasoma Fruits to the Tree of Dreams. That should rejuvenate it!
Paimon: #So we're doing this like we did back in Ashvattha's Concourses, right? Traveler will reach out and "Woosh," we'll be in the dream!
Arama: #Yes. Very smart, Paimon. So if you're ready, Nara Traveler, reach your hand out and let's enter the Ashvattha Tree's dream.
Traveler: No problem.
Paimon: #Arama just mentioned Marana... Paimon wonders what we'll see in this dream! Oh well, it's fine! We've got Traveler around, after all!
Traveler: (Reach out to the Ashvattha Tree...)
Traveler: Give me some time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
Traveler: Give me some time to get ready.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
Traveler: That's kinda spooky.
Traveler: About the Bija...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Finally we are here. Huh... Paimon remembers that we could see this mysterious tree in other Vasara Trees' dreams as well!
Arama: #I'm sorry, Nara Traveler and Paimon. It escaped me that Marana has also corroded the Ashvattha Tree's dream...
Arama: Countless black pests are corroding the roots of the Tree of Dreams in Sarva. I can feel Marana's hands, shaking the dream to its core.
Arama: Sorry... I should have known this would've been the case when we saw Marana in Ashvattha's Concourses before.
Paimon: #It's okay! We fixed this easily with Traveler around, didn't we?
Traveler: Then the Bija...
Arama: #The Vasoma Fruits should at least restore some of his power. I'm counting on you, Nara Traveler.
Arama: ...
Arama: Yes, I understand. I didn't think it would be so soon, but I'm aware that I'll know what to do when the time comes.
Arama: Just like the clouds know that they must release rain, and the rain knows that it must fall to the ground, seeds know that they must grow into big trees and bear lots of plump fruits.
Paimon: Something's weird about Arama...
Arama: Oh, I was just speaking to the Tree of Dreams. Huh, so you couldn't hear it.
Paimon: Paimon's seen Aranakin talking to mushrooms before... But people can't normally communicate with plants, you know?
Arama: I see! I just learned something new. Thank you, Paimon.
Arama: #Don't worry about the Bija, Nara Traveler and Paimon. Let's just leave the dream for now.
Traveler: Piece of cake.
Paimon: But... Will what happened here affect the Bija in any way?
Traveler: Well, it wasn't as easy as Paimon made it sound...
Paimon: Well, you did it regardless, right?
Paimon: But... Will what happened here affect the Bija in any way?

## Talk 4

Paimon: The heart of the Ashvattha Tree is glowing... Is that the Bija?
Paimon: It hasn't been easy, but Rana can finally be healed!
Arama: ...
Paimon: Huh!?
Traveler: Arama...?
Arama: ...
Arama: The Ashvattha Tree has been corroded by Marana and cannot bear any Bija. I have to plant a new Ashvattha Tree in order to help you.
Paimon: But won't it require a long time to grow from a seed to a tree?
Arama: Don't worry, the speed of a Vasara Tree's growth has to do with its seed. The Ashvattha Tree has given me all its power, and with the Vasoma Fruits and our shared memory, it will be fine.
Arama: Thank you, the first Ashvattha Tree. Thank you, Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha. I will utilize your memories to rebuild the path between the new Ashvattha Tree and the dreams.
Paimon: Do you get the feeling that Arama's different now...
Arama: Am I? I learned a lot of new things, figured out lots of new words, and obtained a lot of memories.
Arama: But rest assured, I'm still me, your friend. I will help you for sure.
Traveler: Then the Bija...
Arama: Old Vanarana is sealed deep within the Fane of Ashvattha. That's where we'll find Marana's Avatar.
Arama: It will imbue the land and Sarva with viper venom until everything green turns brown, every flower has withered, every brook is putrid, and every creature is dead.
Arama: We must destroy it. Only then can a tree strong enough to produce the Bija grow.
Traveler: I believe you. What do we do now?
Traveler: I understand.
Arama: #So long as you understand, Nara Traveler, it's all good.
Traveler: What's going on?

## Talk 5

Arama: #Are you ready to enter the Ashvattha Tree's dream, Nara Traveler?
Traveler: No problem.
Paimon: #Paimon believes it won't be a problem for Traveler!
Traveler: (Reach out to the Ashvattha Tree...)
Traveler: Maybe some more time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
Traveler: Give me some time to get ready.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!

## Talk 7

Arama: How did this...
Paimon: Why would The Withering be in the Ashvattha Tree's dream?
Paimon: Regardless, we've got to get rid of The Withering as soon as possible!
