# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What do you do here?
Lizzie: I'm in charge of welcoming guests, and of organizing all sorts of fun activities for everyone during the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: A lot of the events are being held outdoors due to the large area needed, so without a guide to tell them where things are happening, lots of people are going to miss out!
Lizzie: And I, Lizzie, am glad to step up to that plate!
Traveler: So what's going on, then?
Lizzie: There are three events taking place during the festival: "Bullseye Balloons," "Floral Freefall," and "Ballads of Breeze".
Lizzie: As for the details... As opposed to having me explain, I think it might be easier if you try them out yourself.
Lizzie: As long as the preparations for the activity have already been made, I can tell you where they're being held.
Lizzie: May you have a happy Windblume Festival!
Traveler: Are there any other interesting things to do?
Lizzie: I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has something special up their sleeve for the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: If you're interested, I'd advise you to look for an adventurer named Plauen. He'll tell you all about it!
