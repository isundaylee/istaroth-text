Traveler: Who are you?
Yuhua: I am Yuhua, a waitress here at the Wangshu Inn.
Yuhua: Nothing suspicious about me whatsoever.
Traveler: What's your role here?
Yuhua: I am a waitress at this establishment, or a server if you will. I'm afraid there's not much more to say than that.
Traveler: Tell me about the inn.
Yuhua: The Wangshu Inn is situated in a convenient location on one of the main thoroughfares that runs between Mondstadt and Liyue. Boasting pleasant accommodation at an affordable price, there is simply no better choice for passing travelers who need somewhere to stay the night.
Yuhua: Nothing suspicious about it whatsoever. Ahahahaha.
