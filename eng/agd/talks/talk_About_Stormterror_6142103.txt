Traveler: About Stormterror...
Michelle: Never mind my safety. I just hope that this windmill that my family has protected for generation upon generation will be fine.
Michelle: *sigh* The storm created when the dragon attacked previously was far too strong. I wonder if the windmill has taken damage.
Michelle: I wanted to climb it to have a look, but the Knights stopped me.
Michelle: They said that it was too dangerous because Stormterror could attack again at any moment...
