Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Rufina: Did you hear that noise too? Something huge must have happened!
Rufina: Maybe some secret treasure was dug up or something â€” that's what happens in the stories I've read!
Rufina: Pity that my big sister won't let me leave the village whenever I want... If not, I'd have been the first one to discover that treasure. That would've been a fine start to my adventure!
