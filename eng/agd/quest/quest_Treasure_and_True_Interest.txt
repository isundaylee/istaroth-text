# Treasure and True Interest


## Talk 1

Read Teaching Materials: (The materials cover a variety of architectural knowledge. At first glance, nothing appears to be amiss.)

## Talk 2

Adan: Hey there. Can I help you?
Traveler: Do you know a man by the name of Alkami?
Adan: Oh, Alkami? You mean that rich guy who's been making quite the name for himself? Yeah, he commissioned a set of furniture from me a while back. Paid a great deal of Mora for it, too.
Adan: I heard he earned a fortune working as a renowned architect. Now he's opened a training center so others can follow in his footsteps.
Adan: If the tuition wasn't sky-high, I'd enroll my child in a heartbeat. Architecture really sounds like a lucrative profession...
Traveler: I'm wondering if you know anything about Alkami.

## Talk 3

Aabid: Did you hear? Alkami recruited Kaveh to be an instructor!
Adil: Heh, I bet that'll boost his enrollment numbers!
Aabid: Really makes you jealous, eh? If you think about it, Alkami was never that talented himself as an architect. If we're just talking about professional skill, no one would pay for a class with him.
Adil: That's true, but you've got to admit, his advertisements are really effective... After all, the Akademiya only admits those that can pass its entrance exam, so only a few people could hope to study architecture in the halls of the Kshahrewar.
Adil: For those who can't pass the exam, or who just want to jump straight into the industry, the training center is the best bang for the Mora.
Aabid: Man, to have that kind of business acumen...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Uzayr: Mr. Kaveh looked really angry...
Waiz: Who cares about him? Maybe he's just worried that we'll take all of his commissions once we finally graduate!
Tanisha: Bâ€”But that can't be it, right? Mr. Kaveh is super famous...
Waiz: Who knows? My dad told me that the more famous someone is, the more arrogant and stubborn they become. Approachable people like Mr. Alkami are the rare ones!
