# The Truth Shrouded in Shadow


## Talk 1

Paimon: He's already out of sight, how is he so fast... Let's go head him off at Wriothesley's office!

## Talk 2

Traveler: (We often see Miss Sigewinne observing the prisoners at work near the production zone. It seems like she can perceive the general state of a person's health just by looking at them.)
Traveler: #(The research notes said that the Melusine race perceives the world very differently from humans. As a result, the Melusines have also developed a sense of aesthetics that appears rather strange and alien to humans.)
Traveler: (I've been told that the infirmary is always empty for the half hour just before lunch. But what could Sigewinne be doing during that time?)
Traveler: (According to Collins, the pankration tournament only took place because the Fonta company sponsored it. The company must want a return on their investment as well.)
Traveler: (Fonta's internal reports suggest that they're starting a new trial of an unnamed and unpackaged product. But the product has to undergo a trial because even Fonta's own employees have a lot of reservations about it.)
Traveler: (The Fonta promoter has been struggling because he doesn't recognize the real value of coupons. Meanwhile, the Duke believes that only idiots who don't understand the value of coupons will spend them on Fonta.)
Traveler (Strange Meat in Welfare Meal): (If you break the hidden rule of the Production Zone, your Welfare Meal might contain some strange meat...)
Traveler (A Package Containing Strange Blood-Colored Fluid): (If you violate the hidden rules of the Pankration Ring, you will receive a bag containing a strange blood-colored fluid.)
Traveler (The Supervisor, Sigewinne): (Sigewinne often observes the people working at the Production Zone.)
Traveler (The Empty Infirmary): (The infirmary is often empty in the afternoon. This is likely related to Sigewinne's absence during this time.)
Traveler (Research About the Characteristics of Melusines): (A Melusine's sense of sight differs from a human's. Melusines don't find this too strange.)
Traveler (Sponsor of the Pankration Tournament): (This is most likely the sponsor of the Pankration Tournament.)
Traveler (Dissatisfaction with the Duke): (The Duke believes that only idiots who don't appreciate the value of a coupon will spend them on the Fonta being sold by any promoters.)
Traveler (New Products Under Development): (Fonta Co.'s as-yet unnamed or packaged new drink is being promoted for the first time, but some employees have their doubts about it.)

## Talk 3

Paimon: There are some books here, and a few files... They all look like medical records.
Paimon: Hmm... "Advanced Nursing," "How to Raise the Spirits of Your Patients," "A Quick Guide to the Psychology of Emotions," and "The Meaning of Laughter"...
Paimon: These sure are some interesting books... Who knew Sigewinne would be interested in these kinds of things...
Paimon: She even has books on understanding people's motivations and feelings... Is it because she's a Melusine? Or does she have a need to understand her patients' emotional state?
Lyney: Seems quite normal to me. These are skills that would come in handy for a nurse from time to time.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ah, this is it, we saw it before!
Lyney: Wait, this thing...? It doesn't look like it's been disguised that well.
Black Screen Text: Lyney leans down to get close to the movable hatch, and starts tapping at several different points on it...
Lyney: The space behind it is empty. From its size, I don't think it's an entrance that is meant to be taken apart. There's probably a mechanism around here somewhere.
Lyney: Could Lynette have tried to get inside? But if that's the case, she would have contacted me for sure...
Lyney: ...
Lyney: Let's look around here some more for clues... Don't panic, just... take another look.
Traveler: (The look on Lyney's face... He's definitely beginning to panic. "Don't panic"... He probably said that subconsciously more for himself than anything else.)

## Talk 5

Lyney: None of the beds have any signs of having been slept in... except that one over there.
Paimon: That's the one Lynette must have used, right? You said she was pretending to be sick.
Lyney: Mhm. She would have said her migraine was having a particularly bad flare-up. Generally speaking, the head nurse would then ask her to lie down and rest, while she left to retrieve the medication.
Traveler: ...But this bed is still unmade...
Lyney: Which means, either the head nurse didn't return the entire time from when Lynette lay down up until she left the bed, or... the nurse intentionally left it this way.
Traveler: (Oh no... That's not a good sign...)
Lyney: ...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey, you guys, there's a slip of paper over here!
Lyney: A slip of paper?
Paimon: It's right over here, and there's a bunch written on it, too... It reads...
Paimon: "Out of respect for your usual practices, I'll use a piece of paper or card as the medium to pass on my message. You may consider this as me giving you my best regards."
Lyney: This is...!
Paimon: Is... Is that all?
Traveler: Is there anything on the back?
Paimon: The back... aaah! This... This is...
Lyney: Show me! NOW!
Lyney: ...!
Paimon: Th—That look on your face... P—Paimon's reading it now...
Paimon: "Would you care to guess where Miss Lynette of the Fatui could be right now?"
Paimon: ...No... Could she have... Is she already...
Lyney: ...Wriothesley... Did he deliberately leave the infirmary unguarded to use it as bait?
Paimon: Wait, you mean... He was aware of our goals from the very beginning? But why? We didn't run into any trouble last time, and he also never reached out to us since...
Traveler: Why would he choose to act during our second infiltration attempt instead of the first?
Lyney: ...Yes, that is a crucial question. Wriothesley... He doesn't do anything without a clear goal or reason. So, this means he had no concerns about your activities from the very beginning.
Lyney: #Traveler, you are not from the same camp as us — you were sent down here by Neuvillette, so you have no conflict of interest with Wriothesley. We're a completely different story, though...
Traveler: Why did he only go after Lynette?
Lyney: I'd like to know that, too. Why did he only go after her?
Lyney: Don't panic, just think everything over... I have to stay calm... This is not like what happened last time, the situation's different now...
Lyney: ...
Lyney: #Traveler, wait, you're right... Wait... But that means...
Lyney: ...The fact that Freminet was able to leave the grounds... Could Wriothesley have let him go as well?
Paimon: But what does he gain by letting Freminet leave like that?
Traveler: ...I get it now.
Traveler: He deliberately made them both disappear.
Lyney: ...So he's challenging me and trying to provoke me. I'm sure of it.
Lyney: Ugh, we never should have sent out Freminet! We had to go through all that trouble to find an opening to sneak him around the guards and into the pipe, and we even thought luck was on our side...
Lyney: If Wriothesley let him leave on purpose... Then he's probably in a terrible spot now as well...
Paimon: Lyney's getting more and more panicked... We have to calm him down!
Traveler: Lyney, calm down!
Paimon: Don't be like this, Lyney. Freminet wouldn't have left if we hadn't told you about Childe... That was our fault...
Lyney: No, I'm the leader of this operation, and I'm the one responsible for this team... I was the one who failed to protect them.
Lyney: ...I'll go talk to Wriothesley.
Paimon: #Hey, don't be reckless! Traveler, please talk some sense into him!
Lyney: I simply cannot allow Lynette to be abducted again...
Lyney: I have to go, I'll find a way to get them back!
Paimon: He's rushed out the door! After him!
Sigewinne: ...
Lourvine: Right, I feel like we still have some room to make changes on these details.
Jurieu: ...It's not impossible, but it'll require extensive testing.
Sigewinne: Is that so... Very well, then please be mindful of the time.
Sigewinne: ...!
Lourvine: Is someone...?
Sigewinne: Pack everything up.
Sigewinne: ...Whoever's outside is eavesdropping. They'll probably come in once we stop talking.
Paimon: #Someone, please help! He... He's sick!
Jurieu: Whoa, are you okay?
Sigewinne: (Ah, these two. As expected, they've already found this place. They're quite sharp.)
Sigewinne: What a delightful turn of events. I like smart people, but I also like playing dumb. I like the feeling of "being trusted."
Sigewinne: Oh my! What's wrong, little one? There's no need to panic — take a deep breath before you begin.
Sigewinne: Being able to read human expressions is quite the useful skill.
Traveler: Why didn't he go after you as well?

## Talk 7

Freminet: ...Pipes...
Freminet: ...Right, the pipes. It's all coming back to me now...

## Talk 8

Lyney: Come out and face me, Wriothesley!
Wriothesley: Mmm, aren't we at an administrative office space? Why don't you at least try to follow even a couple rules from the Fortress' Indoor Management Regulations?
Lyney: What did you do to my sister!?
Wriothesley: I ran into the young miss at the infirmary. I had heard that she was suffering from quite the migraine, so I decided to invite her over for a cup of tea. I do have some teas in my collection that can work wonders against such an illness.
Lyney: Stop joking around! Where did you take my siblings!?
Wriothesley: I have also heard that your performances are quite the spectacle. Miss Lynette would sometimes enter a box filled with water, only to emerge the next second from another place altogether.
Wriothesley: Maybe she'll appear behind you right now if you were to turn your head?
Lyney: (Is he trying to trick me into turning my head? No, he's probably not looking to attack me right now, all of the hostages are in his hands, and he's even in the mood for small talk. That means Lynette is probably still alive.)
Lyney: #...You knew we were investigating the infirmary from the start, so you deliberately aroused Traveler's suspicions and baited us into continuing our investigation, just so that you'd be able to kidnap Lynette.
Wriothesley: ...
Lyney: As for Freminet... No, you probably didn't even interfere with Childe's escape. You let him go, so you could purge the Fatui members that we had planted into your ranks.
Wriothesley: There was no need to do so. The Fortress of Meropide is a pretty pleasant place. Most people enjoy their lives here — the only ones who act differently are those with personal agendas. It was quite easy to identify your colleagues.
Lyney: You removed our original members, and spread the news of Childe's escape, so "Father" would assign our team to come down and investigate. Freminet has also fallen into your hands, right? If you're oh so omnipotent and so in control, why would you need hostages?
Wriothesley: One correction. Lynette is in my hands right now, but Freminet is not.
Lyney: He's not? ...What do you really want?
Paimon: Lyney!
Wriothesley: Oh, wonderful! Everyone is here, so I'll only need to say this once: thank you so much for cooperating with me.
Traveler: Where are Lynette and Freminet?
Wriothesley: #Eager and to the point, Traveler, I see. Alas, only Miss Lynette is currently having a cup of the Fortress' finest tea.
Wriothesley: Although as per your original plan, Mr. Freminet should also have returned to the Fortress by now. But he has neither shown up within my gates, nor has he been taken into any kind of custody. So where do you think he may be right now...?
Lyney: Wait, you can't mean...
Lyney: You locked him outside in the sea!?
Wriothesley: I closed the Fortress' gate to the outside world, that's all.
Paimon: Freminet's a star diver, so he should be fine, right?
Lyney: No, we're still here, so he'd definitely try to find a way to come back for us... So we can't assume he might have made a break for the surface.
Wriothesley: But why would I do this, you may be asking? To have an audience with you, of course. My intel tells me that Mr. Lyney is a great magician, so it's only natural for me to want to have some cards of my own when it comes to negotiating.
Wriothesley: Besides, I do recall you mentioning to Miss Lynette that you've always wanted to have a face-to-face meeting with the lord of the Fortress of Meropide, regardless of whether it was in a personal or a professional capacity. Well you got your wish.
Lyney: So... You've been keeping tabs on us before we even set foot in the Fortress...
Wriothesley: Some of my folks just happened to hear a thing or two, that's all. In any case, I'll be straight with you.
Wriothesley: I was willing to play dumb and turn a blind eye, so we had a pleasant few days playing games together here. But once you started focusing on the "forbidden zone," all of that changed.
Wriothesley: Mr. Lyney, the cards are stacked against you right now. Miss Lynette is in my hands, and Mr. Freminet is still slowly being pickled out there in the brine. You know just as well as I that he cannot last out there forever.
Wriothesley: You need do but one thing to guarantee their safety. I would like you to contact your superior, and ideally invite her over for a cup of tea with me.
Lyney: You want to see "Father"? Ha, but why should she bother giving you an audience?
Wriothesley: Well, if she cares for the well-being of her dearest children, she should have plenty of motivation to join me for a parents' evening.
Wriothesley: I've heard that the bonds between the members of the House of the Hearth are like the bonds of family. I don't see why she would refuse.
Lyney: Why did you think "Father" sent us to handle the Fortress of Meropide? This place is basically a no man's land. It wouldn't be fitting for anyone as important as a Harbinger like "Father" to come here in person.
Wriothesley: Oh, I see, so it's because she doesn't care for my place here. That's such a shame, after all, I've amassed quite the tea collection, and I was looking forward to sharing it with her. Both Monsieur Neuvillette and Lady Furina have already received many samples as gifts.
Lyney: ...Was this the extent of your master plan to get to "Father"? No matter how much pressure you may put on me, I won't allow you to use us to blackmail her.
Wriothesley: Your people really are difficult to get along with. All I'm asking for is a face-to-face conversation. Does she truly have no interest in the Fortress' secret?
Wriothesley: Mr. Lyney, you have one last chance to invite your "Father" here. If you refuse...
Lyney: ...
Paimon: Lyney...
Traveler: Why do you have to do this?
Wriothesley: Instead of asking why I'm doing this, why don't you try to see things from my perspective for a second? From the very beginning, the Fatui has been actively infiltrating my Fortress.
Wriothesley: I gave you a warning by cutting off the first few operatives I found, but that only caused you to double down. Had you given up on the Fortress then and there, I'd have no reason to want a talk.
Wriothesley: Mr. Freminet left the Fortress on his own, and Miss Lynette tried to pry out my secrets right in front of me. No matter how you look at it, the responsibility for this falls on you.
Lyney: I... I shouldn't ask "Father" to do anything because of us...
Wriothesley: Six, five...
Lyney: Wait, I...
Wriothesley: ...Two, one.
Wriothesley: Time's up. It really is a shame, Mr. Lyney.
Paimon: Wriothesley！
Wriothesley: Negotiations have broken down. Please leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for my afternoon tea.
Lyney: ...
Traveler: Please wait! Can we really not talk about this some more?
Paimon: #Yeah, listen to Traveler! If you can't talk to Lyney, can you at least talk to us?
Wriothesley: You do realize that I'm only letting you go because of Neuvillette, yes? You're here helping him out, and I've already done my best to stay out of your way.
Wriothesley: But that doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want. The Fortress may be small and remote, but it still has its own set of laws.
Traveler: Please spare Freminet and Lynette.
Wriothesley: ...
Wriothesley: Then how about this? Those who are capable deserve respect. You've spent quite some time investigating my home turf by now, so why don't you tell me a thing or two about what you've found?
Wriothesley: I'll ask you three questions. Answer all of them correctly, and I'll agree to your request.
Wriothesley: Question one. Regarding the "hidden rules" of the production zone... What is the truth behind the one about not being allowed to work for three days in a row?
Traveler: (I can't believe he's asking about the "hidden rules"... If I recall correctly, if you keep working without any rest, during lunch hour on the third day, you will find a portion of "strange meat" in your welfare meal.)
Traveler: (It's a good thing that we've already run a thorough investigation on this. Let's see if I can remember all the clues... I should be able to find an answer if I can piece everything together.)
Paimon: Ah, so that's what was going on... Paimon understands it now. Who would have guessed...
Paimon: The "hidden rule" of the production zone... people are not supposed to work three days in a row, and if they do, they'll get "strange meat" in their welfare meal.
Paimon: At first, we thought this "strange meat" must have something to do with the people who disappeared, but in reality, they were all... prepared by Sigewinne, the head nurse.
Paimon: She often visits the production zone to observe the workers' health, and makes a note of anyone who has worn themselves out after three full days of work.
Paimon: Out of her sense of duty as the head nurse as well as her genuine concern for the workers' health, Sigewinne visits the cafeteria right before lunch, and cooks an "extra dish" for those who can use the stamina boost.
Paimon: Sigewinne has only the best intentions with her "surprise gift," and doesn't want anyone to find out about what she does. However...
Paimon: ...Unfortunately, Melusines as a race perceive the world differently from humans, and their sense of aesthetics is even more alien to us.
Paimon: The recipients of her lovingly prepared special meals cannot taste the care within, and usually just freak out.
Paimon: Are we on the right track?
Wriothesley: Heh, not bad. You've uncovered Sigewinne's secret, and even guessed her intentions correctly as well. It's nice to know that her efforts have not gone unacknowledged.
Wriothesley: Alright, now for my next question...
Wriothesley: There are also some "hidden rules" in the Pankration Ring... Including the one that you're not allowed to support both sides of a fight. Why is that?
Traveler: (The "hidden rules" of the Pankration Ring... I remember. If someone tries to support both boxers at the same time, they'll receive a package the next morning, which contains a strange blood-colored liquid.)
Traveler: (We've also done a lot of research on this matter. Let me sift through what I've found and come up with the correct answer.)
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets this rule too now... So there really was nothing to be afraid of!
Paimon: That "hidden rule" of the Pankration Ring is about how... people are not supposed to bet on both boxers at the same time, and if they do, they'll receive a package containing a strange blood-colored liquid.
Paimon: People get scared when they see it because they've subconsciously begun to associate it with the missing boxer.
Paimon: But really, it's just a bottle of the latest yet-to-be-named-and-packaged new Fonta trial product!
Paimon: A blood-red drink... It's no wonder even Fonta's own staff were questioning the company's decision-making.
Paimon: The company, facing backlash from its own staff, decided to try to trial the product on a smaller scale, to see how it might be received by customers.
Paimon: They came to the Fortress of Meropide and offered to sponsor the Pankration tournament so they could push their new product, but the Duke completely refused to even entertain the idea.
Paimon: The Duke, knowing how valuable coupons are in the Fortress, knew that only total idiots who didn't understand their true value would bother buying a Fonta product here.
Paimon: And so, only those who proved their stupidity by being dumb enough to bet on two opposing sides of the same match were selected to receive the drinks.
Wriothesley: I acknowledge the effort you've put in to bringing the truth of this mystery to light.
Wriothesley: Although, based on your description, that Fonta promoter is a bit too careless with his words... I may just reconsider my collaboration with the company.
Wriothesley: Alright, and here's the final question. What's the secret behind our head nurse, and all of her patients in the infirmary?
Traveler: ...
Lyney: Stop your cruel and pointless games, Wriothesley! You know that we haven't finished our investigation, so there's no way we can answer the last question! The thought of sparing Lynette and Freminet never even crossed your mind!
Traveler: Lyney!
Lyney: You'll pay for this!
Wriothesley: ...!
Lyney: Argh!
Paimon: Lyney! Are you alright!?
Wriothesley: Ooh, close one. I owe you, Sigewinne. That was a fantastic shot.
Sigewinne: It was nothing, Your Grace.
Paimon: Sigewinne!?
Sigewinne: Though this gun may look like a toy, it's actually fully functional, as I just demonstrated.
Lyney: Sige...winne... You...
Traveler: Are you his accomplice in all this!?
Sigewinne: Not at all. I am merely a resident of the Fortress, and thus protecting it is my duty.
Sigewinne: When Monsieur Neuvillette asked me to come here, he told me that my job would be to take care of the well-being of everyone here. I am merely discharging my duties.
Paimon: But if you mean what you just said, then isn't Lyney someone you should be looking after as well? Isn't he a resident here just like the rest of us?
Traveler: If you're close with Neuvillette...
Sigewinne: But I really am just doing what Monsieur Neuvillette told me to do! Everything I did, I've done to protect them. Had I not, they would be in far more dire straits right now.
Sigewinne: His Grace knows it, too. Right? Your Grace? ...Mind proving my innocence to them?
Wriothesley: ...*sigh* My dear Sigewinne, what ever shall I do with you? Would it have killed you to just wait another minute or two?
Sigewinne: Well, it's nearly time, after all. The way you do things can be truly frustrating sometimes, Your Grace. I figured I should try to talk some sense into you.
Paimon: What are you talking about? What time?
Lyney: Take me if you want... But let them go...
Wriothesley: How touching. Can you just give me one more minute?
Sigewinne: Don't be like that, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: Alright, everyone, calm down. Two more visitors will be arriving any time now.
Wriothesley: I will go get a cup of tea. Miss Sigewinne, I'll leave Miss Lynette in your care.
Lyney: You... What are you doing!?
Sigewinne: I believe I hear... footsteps.
Black Screen Text: The door suddenly slams open. A familiar figure bursts into the room.
Clorinde: Some space, please.
Wriothesley: Ah, Miss Clorinde. My door.
Lyney: Freminet? FREMINET!!
Paimon: What's going on!? What is Clorinde doing here?
Clorinde: Work.
Sigewinne: I'm sorry about shooting you, Mr. Lyney. The tranquilizing effect will begin to wear off soon. Please take it easy in the meantime, though.
Lyney: ...What happened to Freminet? Wasn't he diving just outside of the fortress? Why is he looking like... Like this...
Traveler: These symptoms... It can't be...
Sigewinne: A flushed face and accelerated pulse... He must have consumed Primordial Seawater.
Lyney: What did you say!?
Sigewinne: Please make some space. I'll need to give Mr. Freminet a more thorough check-up. Your Grace, I'll leave the rest to you.
Wriothesley: I'll talk to Clorinde while you get Freminet to where he needs to be. Everything else can wait.
Traveler: Why not learn a thing or two about virtue from him?
Traveler: (We haven't collected enough info to answer that question...)
Traveler: I want to save Freminet and Lynette, too.

## Talk 9

Freminet: (The vegetation here is a bit more sparse... These traces aren't natural, a person must have left them, and recently. I should be going in the right direction.)

## Talk 10

Freminet: (There are traces here, too. I need to keep going.)

## Talk 11

Freminet: (Eh? The traces are gone? But I don't see where he could have gone from here...)

## Talk 12

Freminet: ...Pff...*cough*
Lyney: He's awake. Freminet, how do you feel?
Freminet: Lyney... Lynette...
Lynette: We're all here.
Freminet: Where... am I...
Sigewinne: The infirmary at the Fortress of Meropide, Mr. Freminet, and you are no longer in any danger.
Paimon: How do you feel? Don't push yourself if you're not feeling up to it!
Freminet: #Traveler, Paimon... It's been so long.
Freminet: ...The sea! There's something wrong with the seawater!
Lyney: Shh, it's okay. We can talk about it after you've recovered.
Freminet: No, listen to me, this is really serious! There's Primordial Seawater mixed into the regular seawater. I don't know why it's there, but no one should touch it!
Traveler: What happened after you snuck into the pipes?
Freminet: ...Pipes...
Freminet: ...Right, the pipes. It's all coming back to me now...

## Talk 13

Freminet: ...I'm in. Hmm... Seems like this pipe hasn't been used in a long time. It looks abandoned.
Freminet: Where could Master Childe be...

## Talk 14

Lyney: ...

## Talk 15

Freminet: This is where the water starts... Okay.
Freminet: (Master Childe probably dived into the water... I'll go take a look as well.)

## Talk 16

Freminet: (Wait, what the... Argh! Urgh...)
Freminet: (My heart is racing, and it's getting harder and harder to breathe. What's going on?)
Freminet: (No good, I have to get back, they still don't know anything about what's going on! If I turn back right now, I should still be able to make it...)

## Talk 17

Freminet: (I can't... die here... Ugh...)
Freminet: (This is... This is bad... I'm feeling worse and worse... And I'm still underwater...)
Freminet: (I... I have to push on...)

## Talk 18

Lyney: ...So, in other words, the trail you were following vanished, and you had no idea where Master Childe could have gone, but there was also no obvious place for him to have disappeared to...
Freminet: That's right. I tried my best to swim back, but I had already put some distance between myself and the fortress, and I just couldn't find the strength to keep going... I probably passed out sometime after that, and you know the rest.
Paimon: Miss Clorinde brought you back, but we also don't know why she just suddenly appeared at the Fortress, or why she went out to save you...
Freminet: Miss Clorinde, you say... I must go thank her in person.
Lynette: You're still too weak, Freminet. You can go after you've had some more rest.
Sigewinne: Miss Lynette is right. I believe Miss Clorinde will stay here as a guest for another few days, so there's no need to hurry.
Lyney: A guest... Then I can assume Wriothesley was the one who invited her to come down here?
Sigewinne: You should ask His Grace about that. He'll be able to explain better than me.
Traveler: Got it, I'll go talk to him.
Paimon: Yeah, it's about time he actually told us what's going on! Wanna come with us, Lyney?
Lyney: ...
Lyney: #No, please go on without me, Traveler. I don't want to leave just yet.
Lynette: Lyney...
Lyney: ...The logical part of my brain is aware that we are safe right now, but I still can't bring myself to leave. Both of you were just in danger.
Lynette: Understood. Then let's just sit together for a while.
Sigewinne: #In that case, I'll leave the infirmary to you. Traveler and I are going to head out for now — as long as you stay in here, I don't think you'll be disturbed.
Freminet: Thank you.

## Talk 19

Wriothesley: Could I tempt you with some sugar for your tea?
Clorinde: No need.
