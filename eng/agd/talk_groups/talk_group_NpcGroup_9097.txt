Traveler: Do you like it here?
Sethos: Sure do! It's great!
Sethos: I'd like to think I'm a flexible guy who can adapt to any environment, never mind one as pleasant as this.
Traveler: Well, the layout is my pride and joy.
Sethos: I can tell.
Sethos: Some people like to go out and have fun. Others prefer to create a comfy space for themselves at home where they can enjoy some peace and quiet.
Sethos: People enjoy life in different ways, but both approaches are equally valid.
Sethos: You know, this place is real roomy. There are houses and buildings, sure... But, there's also lots of open space...
Sethos: You could build a bunch of different areas, each with a unique design. That way, it'd feel like we were camping in a new place every night!
Sethos: I'd even help out if you wanted!
Sethos: Truth is, I'm fully furnished with ideas as we speak!
Traveler: This is rather embarrassing. I've neglected the place lately...
Sethos: No, no, no! Don't say that!
Sethos: I prefer being out adventuring too, so I try to keep things simple at home. But even then, my pad isn't nearly as neat as this.

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Sethos: Yeah, sure, let's do it! Things were getting quiet around here, y'know?
Sethos: Just as well. There's something I wanted to ask. In your experience, what preparations would I need to make before visiting a newly excavated desert ruin?
Traveler: Did you find something?
Sethos: Not yet. This question's purely hypothetical.
Sethos: Most of the members of the Temple of Silence spend their time at our base, researching and watching over our ancient technologies. But, there are times when we must investigate external locations.
Sethos: I try not to miss out on those opportunities.
Traveler: I don't go to the desert often. You probably have more experience than me.
Sethos: Really? Was my intel wrong, then?
Sethos: You know, so much of the desert remains a mystery, even to people who've lived there a long time.
Sethos: Sometimes, we find our path blocked by a bunch of mechanisms before we can even get inside the ruin.
Sethos: Take the area around the Mausoleum of King Deshret, for example.
Sethos: That area has the highest concentration of ruins related to King Deshret. It's also where investigation teams are liable to encounter the most trouble.
Sethos: It looks like nothing more than a swath of empty desert, but it's packed to the gills with invisible walls.
Sethos: We spent enormous amounts of effort to uncover the expanse of the ruins, only to then discover that determining their height was the real issue.
Sethos: Later on, a team member suggested bringing some of that invisible material back with us...
Sethos: And using it to build an invisible labyrinth around the Temple of Silence to ward off intruders.
Traveler: You're not talking about yourself, are you?
Sethos: Hey, do I seem like that sorta person to you?
Sethos: But, I'll admit, we were thinking along the same lines.
Sethos: It's just... I wasn't sure our people could navigate a labyrinth like that, so I didn't bring it up.
Sethos: In the end, my concerns turned out to be valid, and we scratched the idea.
Traveler: Allow me to thank you on behalf of all adventurers everywhere.
Sethos: Haha, don't mention it!
Sethos: Even if you don't count that labyrinth, I can assure you that the desert's not hurting for mysteries.
Traveler: I know the desert like the back of my hand.
Sethos: Haha, that's the "experienced adventurer" aura I expected. So, are you familiar with the differences in climate between various regions in the desert, too?

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Sethos: Oh, you bet I do. A whole list!
Sethos: But, I didn't want to step on your toes, seeing as this is your place and all.
Traveler: Wh—What were you considering?
Sethos: Um, that maybe... we could... build a campsite?
Traveler: That sounds nice.
Sethos: R—Really? Awesome!
Sethos: Let me see... First, we'll need at least two tents.
Sethos: First one's for resting. We'll put thick cloth up around the walls to keep any noise out.
Sethos: We could even use that one for research or to organize our documents.
Sethos: The other tent will be a space to chat and play games. We can put picnic supplies and chairs near the entrance.
Sethos: The weather here seems pretty nice, so we shouldn't need any rain or wind protection...
Sethos: Then, I guess the only thing left would be adding some adventure to this place.
Traveler: Eh?
Sethos: No matter how beautiful the scenery, standing back and looking at it's gonna get old sometimes.
Sethos: You've got to get out there and enjoy it!
Sethos: And if there were mechanisms that we could use to jump, run, climb, or glide around this place, that would be the cherry on top!
Sethos: Install stuff like that, and whoosh! Nothing here would be off-limits.
Traveler: I could ask Tubby about that.
Sethos: Ah, you mean that little finch with the nice smile?
Sethos: Perfect! I've actually talked to her already. All that stuff she knows about housekeeping... Super impressive!
Sethos: I couldn't get her to tell me about all of her contraptions, but I understand. Every organization has its secrets... The Temple of Silence is like that too.
Sethos: Don't worry. I'll find a way.
Traveler: Turning this into an amusement park, are we?
Sethos: Perfect! Glad to have your stamp of approval!
Sethos: Well, I'll get designing, then. I'll let you know when the blueprints are ready.
Sethos: You can invite your other friends over once it's done. The more, the merrier!
Traveler: Whatever makes you happy. I've got more than enough space.

Sethos: Good night! Hey, you're up pretty late. Still got plans, then?
Sethos: I'm not tired either. How about we go out for a bit? If we run into trouble, I'll protect you! Or, you can protect me... whatever works!

Sethos: Whenever I go to the Grand Bazaar, I head straight to the food stalls, grab some snacks and a drink, and then I take my time checking the place out.
Sethos: But, some shops are off-limits if you have your hands full... A carpet shop, for example.
Sethos: How about this... We split the snacks! That way, we can finish them off quickly and then get shopping!

Sethos: Wow, wow, wow, you've got yourself a pro-grade grill right there. Temperature, rotation speed... It all looks pitch-perfect!
Sethos: Ah, I've got it!
