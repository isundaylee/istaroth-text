Hardy Two-Blades: ...
Paimon: This person looks really serious... and mean... Maybe we shouldn't talk to him...

## Talk

Hardy Two-Blades: Oh, dang it! Why is it the two of you? Hmph!
Traveler: What do you mean?
Hardy Two-Blades: It's nothing. You'll understand eventually.
Paimon: What is this person doing at the training ground? Judging by his tone, could he also be one of the competitors?
Traveler: There's no need to be afraid, Paimon.
Paimon: You're right, we've defeated countless nasty people. This one's no different!
Paimon: Besides, Paimon has faith in Bongo-Head and the other Fungi! Someone with such a bad temper can't be good with Fungi anyway!
Hardy Two-Blades: I heard everything. You guys were pretty loud.
Paimon: Eeeek!
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm not interested in bickering. We'll settle it in the arena.
Traveler: He's a piece of cake.
Traveler: Hmph!
Hardy Two-Blades: Y—You're still feeling cocky!?
Paimon: Whoa! Let's not make this a confrontation!
Traveler: I can be mean too.
Paimon: But what if the two of you get in a fight because you upset him...?
Paimon: Wait... he's the one Paimon should be worried about if the two of you start fighting... Just... make sure you don't hit him too hard!
Paimon: #Anyway, for your safety, Mister Mercenary, you probably shouldn't agitate Traveler any further.
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm going to become a renowned beast tamer! It doesn't serve me any purpose to settle disputes through violence outside of the arena.
Hardy Two-Blades: Stop wasting time trying to argue with me and go do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing!
Traveler: Goodbye!
Hardy Two-Blades: Shut it! Just get out of here already!

## Talk

Hardy Two-Blades: How embarrassing...
Traveler: The swine is here!
Paimon: And uncultured Paimon is here too!
Hardy Two-Blades: You two! Are you trying to make me mad!?
Hardy Two-Blades: Fine! I lost. I'll apologize for the inappropriate comments I made before!
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm sorry! Go ahead, make fun of me as much as you'd like!
Hardy Two-Blades: However, you will lose to Lady Haniyyah. I have nothing to do with her victories, but at least it proves that I've placed my faith in the right place!
Paimon: Why do you have so much faith in Haniyyah? Could it be that she's helped you or saved your life before?
Hardy Two-Blades: It's a long story...
Hardy Two-Blades: Back then, a couple of Treasure Hoarders found a way to somehow anger a large group of Sumpter Beasts. They planned to use the angered Sumpter Beasts to charge and disperse a caravan to make it easier to rob them of their goods...
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm not sure how, but Lady Haniyyah noticed the Sumpter Beasts' strange behavior and calmed them before it all went down. The disaster was averted before it even happened.
Paimon: Wait, could it be that you were a guard with the caravan? So Haniyyah saved your employer's Mora... So in turn, saved your Mora... and maybe even your life!
Hardy Two-Blades: No, I was just passing by.
Hardy Two-Blades: But with my years of experience as a mercenary, I'm certain that it wasn't something I'd be able to walk away from if I were to get dragged into it.
Hardy Two-Blades: Lady Haniyyah's abilities as a beast tamer are far greater than the weapons in my hand. That's why I sealed my dual blades, left the Eremites, and began training in the way of beast taming.
Hardy Two-Blades: Do you understand now? Lady Haniyyah has shown me a path to a greater future. She is a respectable figure!
Traveler: Y—Yeah, we understand...
Paimon: Erm... the logic of it all sounds a little strange... but it kinda makes sense...
Traveler: Please continue making a fool out of yourself. We'll be on our way.
Hardy Two-Blades: Argh! Get out of here! I have nothing to say to you either!

## Talk

Hardy Two-Blades: You're... about to go up against Lady Haniyyah, aren't you?
Traveler: What is it?
Paimon: We're also feeling a little heavy about what happened with Haniyyah, so be careful of what you say next... We might get angry...
Hardy Two-Blades: I don't have the right to make any comments about you guys right now. It's just that... I saw the match between Lady Haniyyah and "Fried Tofu With All the Frills."
Hardy Two-Blades: I think something's changed inside Lady Haniyyah... This is the first time I've seen her like this. It's really quite... something.
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon has been wanting to say this to you. How could you have thought Haniyyah was a cold person? That's very disrespectful!
Paimon: You've barely spoken to her, let alone understand her! For example, Paimon doesn't know you very well, but solely from your appearance, Paimon is going to assume that you're...
Paimon: An idiot who would get drunk and dance around the bonfire with your swords in your hands and a burnt mushroom kebab in your mouth, and trip over yourself before falling face down into a pile of mud!
Paimon: Then Paimon would go around telling everyone about it. Wouldn't you get mad if you knew about what Paimon was doing?
Hardy Two-Blades: Silver Companion! How... How did you know all that!?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ...
Hardy Two-Blades: But you do make a point... It's true that I don't know how Lady Haniyyah is as a person... I may have caused her quite a bit of unnecessary trouble...
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have commented on how Lady Haniyyah is as a person... I'm sorry!
Traveler: Wow, Paimon actually got to the big guy!
Paimon: You may be overreacting a little... Paimon learned this from Miko and Layla!
Paimon: Anyways, it's good that you know what you did wrong. Just make sure you don't do it again!
Traveler: Paimon is amazing!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hardy Two-Blades: See you... I need to reflect on this a little more...

## Talk

Hardy Two-Blades: M—M—Master Silver Companion! Please! Take me as your apprentice!
Traveler: Calm down!
Paimon: Err... Yeah! Calm yourself! Did you hit your head or something this morning? What are you talking about?
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm being serious!
Hardy Two-Blades: I was shocked when I heard that you guys defeated Lady Haniyyah. I went to visit Miss Haniyyah and learned about your story...
Hardy Two-Blades: I had no idea how out of line I was before! I'll change and make up for it! Please! Master Silver Companion, show me the proper path!
Paimon: #Hold on! Why are you coming to Paimon with this!? Traveler makes most of the decisions here!
Hardy Two-Blades: I know, but the two of you have worked in harmony, and I'm sure you guys share the same ideas as well.
Hardy Two-Blades: However, Master Golden Comet is mysterious and rarely ever speaks. I highly doubt someone as dull as me will be able to understand Master Golden Comet's teachings.
Hardy Two-Blades: On the other hand, Master Silver Companion's words are straightforward and easy to understand! That's why I'd like to become your apprentice!
Paimon: #What do we do, Traveler? We've never met anyone like this before. He went from being a big meanie to this... Paimon isn't sure what to do with him.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's better to leave him alone with his thoughts for a while instead of trying to mentor him. Once he realizes what he's done wrong, he'll become a more reliable person!
Traveler: Then there is only one solution...
Paimon: Yeah, let's get as far away as we can from this weirdo!
Traveler: Run!
Traveler: Paimon, run!
Paimon: I'm not sure what happened... but this isn't something we've dealt with before... Let's get out of here!
