## Talk

Zhongli: Alright, then. Was there anything else you wished to know?
Traveler: So, about the "trial..."
Zhongli: Haha... Ah, that was a good one. Failing a divine trial? How they came up with that excuse, I will never know.
Zhongli: That said, the reason why the Qixing were so eager to resolve the incident and stop pursuing the culprit was indeed because they received news in secret that Rex Lapis was not dead.
Zhongli: I hinted as much to the adepti as well.
Zhongli: How did I accomplish that, you ask? Hmm... Have you ever heard of this particularly convenient adepti art known as "gifting dreams and visions"?
Traveler: What about Childe...
Paimon: Yeah, about that. Before the Qixing made their announcement, we listened to a lot of people talking on the way. Most of them put the blame for everything on Childe.
Zhongli: These are indeed false accusations, but it remains undeniably true that Childe did send people to the Jade Chamber to prevent the adepti and the Qixing from defeating the ancient god.
Zhongli: I've heard that Ningguang is busy milking that for all it's worth on the foreign relations front at the moment, browbeating the envoys of the Fatui...
Zhongli: Ah, those poor Snezhnayan diplomats. If it were not for Childe's exalted position as a Harbinger, I'm certain that they would have shifted all the blame to him and called for his dismissal by now.
Traveler: As for the Liyue Qixing...
Zhongli: "The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue?"
Zhongli: Keqing is absolutely right in saying this.
Zhongli: Now, though I did laud Ningguang's desire for power, believing this to be a good thing, and thought as a matter of course that she must have been behind the Qixing's plan to take governing power over Liyue from the hands of the gods and adepti...
Zhongli: Could the original person who brought up the idea of seizing power have been...? Hmm...
Traveler: Now, about Mora...
Paimon: That's right! Zhongli, now that you don't have your Gnosis, what's going to happen to all the Mora in Teyvat?
Paimon: Since Morax is "dead," are they all just gonna disappear?
Paimon: Also, isn't the Golden House the only mint in the entire continent? Will it even continue to work?
Zhongli: The Mora present now will not vanish. But the Golden House will indeed have to cease operations for a lengthy period of time, since creating Mora requires the use of the Geo Archon's power.
Paimon: Argh! This is terrible. We're all about to run out of Mora! The world is coming to an end!
Zhongli: Yes, this is indeed a major issue from a financial standpoint...
Zhongli: Uh... Well. I suppose we'll just leave such troublesome matters to the Liyue Qixing to debate.
Paimon: Then... did you at least set some private funds aside for yourself?
Zhongli: Oh, a private fund? Hmm, this does seem like a good, logical, common-sense idea.
Zhongli: Ah, it's a shame...
Paimon: What's a shame?
Zhongli: It's a shame that I didn't think of it at the time.
Traveler: There's nothing else...
Zhongli: Well then, I suppose you'll have to find a way to get inside this closed nation. Have patience... I suspect that some serendipity must first come into play...
