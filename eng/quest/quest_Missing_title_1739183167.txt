# Missing title (1739183167)

Traveler: What if it's a gift given without expecting anything in return?
Yolotli: Well... that depends on how much the Iktomisaurus trusts you.
Yolotli: After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch. The less is asked in returned for a gift, the more suspicious it is.
Yolotli: Want to give it a try? Well, I've heard the Iktomisaurs love these mushrooms, so good luck.
