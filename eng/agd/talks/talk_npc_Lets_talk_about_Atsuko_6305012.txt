# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Let's talk about Atsuko...
Yoh: Ah, Atsuko. She's never been one for restrictions.
Yoh: That she loves to roam was something that I had expected. But still, I suppose worrying is a parent's natural reaction.
Yoh: There's just nothing for it, you know? Our girl is all grown up now. She has her own way of seeing the world.
Yoh: ...Honestly, I think it's good for her. I'll be fine so long as she writes us from time to time just to let us know she's safe.
Yoh: And if she can come back to see us often like she's doing now? That would be a bonus.
