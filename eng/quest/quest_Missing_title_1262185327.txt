Sitting Tiger: Hey, keep off! This is the boss man's turf!
Paimon: Whoa, so mean!
Traveler: Who are you people?
Coiled Serpent: That's up to you. If you're nice, we can be pals. But if you get nosy, we'll have to do something about it.
Sitting Tiger: You should grow a brain and go back the way you came!
Paimon: You're so suspicious!
Coiled Serpent: Suspicious? Whoa there... We're just the doormen. If anyone's acting suspicious, it's you weirdos poking your heads everywhere!
Sitting Tiger: Whatever, we've got nothin' to say to you! Just quit bothering us!
Traveler: Who is this "boss man" you speak of?
Sitting Tiger: Who is the "boss man"...? Ha! If I told you, you'd keel over with fright!
Coiled Serpent: It's for your own good, pal! Leave well alone what you shouldn't mess with.
