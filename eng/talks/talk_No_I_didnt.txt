Traveler: No, I didn't...
Sareh: Hmm... Okay. He might have left Port Ormos.
Sareh: His name is Amandeep and he's a researcher who's lived here for a very long time. He makes a living by mentoring young researchers writing papers.
Sareh: A few days ago, I think it was the day the sea monsters were out and about, he went out and didn't come back. Without settling his bill with us.
Sareh: I'm not looking for him to settle his bill though. I'm just worried that he is in some sort of trouble because he just disappeared so suddenly.
Sareh: I've asked everyone in Port Ormos to help look for him but to no avail.
