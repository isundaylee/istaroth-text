Traveler: The previous adventure?
Baharak: The last time, the time before, and the time before before... It's always for the traces of King Deshret's kin!
Baharak: You are here at Caravan Ribat. I presume you have heard of the legend of King Deshret among the desert inhabitants?
Baharak: The true "God of Wisdom" in the ancient times who was long forgotten... I don't know if this is true or not, but sounds like King Deshret was a god with many followers, right?
Baharak: So even if King Deshret doesn't exist anymore, there could still be some kin left... Like a dragon or something?
