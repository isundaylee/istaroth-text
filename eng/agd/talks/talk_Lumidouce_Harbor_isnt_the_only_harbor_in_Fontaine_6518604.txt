Traveler: Lumidouce Harbor isn't the only harbor in Fontaine...
Kimpel: I know, I know. But Lumidouce Harbor is an essential port. A vast quantity of international trade passes through here.

Kimpel: I won't bother you with it now. I need to continue writing this advisory letter to Ms. Cassigneul. She should be able to turn things around here.
