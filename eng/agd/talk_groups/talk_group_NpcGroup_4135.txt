Traveler: Sisi?
Shapur: Oh, are you a customer?
Shapur: Sisi is my cat's name. I was just asking it a question.
Shapur: But this fellow's been capricious recently and doesn't respond no matter how much I call.
Shapur: Never mind, no need to worry. They are probably looking for trouble with Ouo again.
Shapur: I'd better ask my daughter to help you with check-in. Sareh... Sareh, are you there?

Traveler: And you are...
Shapur: Oh! You're at the door and you still can't tell who I am?
Shapur: I'm the owner of this inn, which means that this inn is owned by me.
Shapur: Ah, look, Sisi. Young people's attention span is terrible these days.
Shapur: ...
Shapur: Sisi? Sisi! Where did that furball run off to now?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Shapur: Never mind, I'll ask Ouo.
