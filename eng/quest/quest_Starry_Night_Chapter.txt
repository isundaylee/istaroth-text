# Starry Night Chapter


## Talk 1

Paimon: These guys are weird, so eager to get chummy...
Traveler: We'd better be careful.
Aranakin: Yes, yes, you should be careful.
Paimon: Well, since you both say so...
Paimon: Huh!?
Aranakin: Huh!?
Aranakin: Hey! You startled me!!
Paimon: That's Paimon's line!
Paimon: Hm... Speaking of which, little one, who are you?
Aranakin: Aranakin isn't a "little one," Aranakin is Aranakin!
Aranakin: You can't listen to those sand grains. They're liars with bad minds who are here for the Aranara!
Traveler: Bad minds...?
Aranakin: Bad minds, bad bad minds!
Paimon: What...? Paimon didn't get that at all...
Aranakin: White Floaty is silly, so White Floaty didn't get it.
Paimon: Wha— Hey!
Traveler: He's talking about those people from just now.
Aranakin: #Nara {NICKNAME} smart, that's what Aranakin means.
Paimon: Huh? You know our names?
Aranakin: #Aranakin smart. When you talked to them, I listened. I heard that Nara's name is "{NICKNAME}" and that your name is "Paimon."
Aranakin: But Floaty Paimon is silly and doesn't understand Aranakin.
Traveler: Floaty Paimon is like that, it's true.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's not silly!
Aranakin: First, we need to find Zohrah Mushroom. Zohrah Mushroom, is little shiny spots, just like my songs!
Aranakin: But to find Zohrah Mushroom, you need "Kusava."
Aranakin: Um, that's fine. You guys are great. Aranakin can entrust Kusava to you.
Paimon: Hmm... it comes again, things Paimon can't understand. Kusawan? What is that?
Aranakin: Fatty fruit, bitter fruit. Temporary home of Aranara memories. Kusava makes Aranara strong.
Aranakin: Mawtiyima is feeling sick, Marana is getting bigger. We must go quickly. Quickly!
Paimon: W—Wait a second, we don't even know where we're going!
Aranakin: Zohrah Mushroom! We need Zohrah Mushroom, to prepare Arahaoma. We need Arahaoma, to help Mawtiyima be lively again!
Aranakin: I know where Zohrah Mushroom is, I take you there!
Paimon: Alright... Hey, wait for us!
Traveler: Is there something we can do for you?
Aranakin: Yes, something very important! So very important! Mawtiyima is in great danger, the grass and trees in the forest... Everyone is worried! She asked us to find you. We waited for so long.
Traveler: They must have some sort of a scheme.
Traveler: What are the "sand grains" you are talking about?
Aranakin: Sand is Valuka, and those sand grains are a group of bad Nara Valuka. I don't like sand, it's coarse, rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere...

## Talk 2

Aranakin: #Aranakin's right to trust you. Nara {NICKNAME} is no sand grain but a mighty seed! Aranakin must sing about it and let everyone in the woods know!
Aranakin: Yay~ Kusava~ Kusava~♪
Paimon: Cool~seek~wan~♪
Traveler: Ko~se~han~♪
Aranakin: Ku! Sa! Va! Happy!
Aranakin: Aranakin is going to the Mawtiyima Forest and meet up with friends. You must come see us and join the ritual coming up!

## Talk 3

Aranakin: #Over here, Nara {NICKNAME}, Floaty Paimon!
Paimon: There's water everywhere. That "Zohrah Mushroom" you mentioned... Is it really here?
Aranakin: Here, underwater. Rocks and vines protect and cover him, so he's safe in water.
Aranakin: Rocks blessed by Nara Varuna broke apart by themselves after many many moonsets.
Aranakin: Broken rocks sealed off the path to Zohrah Mushroom and protected him.
Aranakin: Aranakin can repair the rocks and make the water leave, so we can find Zohrah Mushroom.
Aranakin: Use the Kusava to summon Aranakin's power. Aranakin... trusts you will treat the Kusava well?
Paimon: Of course. We'll cherish anything you entrust us with!
Aranakin: *humming* Kusava~ Kusava~♪
Paimon: Cool~seek~wan~♪
Traveler: Ko~se~han~♪
Aranakin: Wow, that was terrible.
Traveler: Why the singing all of a sudden?
Aranakin: Aranakin sings happy songs because there's hope for Mawtiyima, because Nara is willing to help!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Is this the Zohrah Mushroom? It looks so... mundane.
Aranakin: Mm, this is...
Paimon: Eh?
Aranakin: It is just an ordinary mushroom, very cunning. Very clever.
Paimon: Eh? So we wasted all that effort?
Traveler: But where is the Zohrah Mushroom?
Aranakin: Zohrah Mushroom is no ordinary mushroom, thus more cunning and clever. He's probably escaped by now.
Paimon: ...Mushrooms can run away too?
Aranakin: #Of course! They don't have roots but can absorb nutrients in rocks. They don't have legs but can run, for they are mushrooms, not plants! But don't fret, Nara {NICKNAME}, let me ask this fellow.
Black Screen Text: Aranakin and the mushroom speak in whispers.
Aranakin: It said, Zohrah Mushroom went to a cave that has Marana, which has dissolved in the water. It's very dangerous.
Paimon: But why would the Zohrah Mushroom go there?
Aranakin: Because Marana moves too fast and must be stopped. Zohrah Mushroom can stop Marana, but won't hold up for long.
Paimon: Mmm... Then we better get going and save the mushroom!
Aranakin: Yes, we must hurry!
Traveler: Is the Zohrah Mushroom not here?

## Talk 5

Aranakin: Oh yeah, friend Aragaru is waiting for you too. I'll tell the plants along the way to inform him that you're coming.
Aranakin: He'll be waiting for you in the cave where the moon falls. He'll guide you to the dead Nara's old home. The walking Shroom-Kin now live there. Be careful.

## Talk 6

Minum: Stop.
Ziri: You can't enter.
Paimon: Why are you people here again? Come on! What are you doing here?
Traveler: Out on a date, perchance?
Minum: ...
Paimon: Hmph, you can't even come up with an answer, that's so suspicious!
Minum: You can't enter.
Ziri: You can't enter, and that's that.
Traveler: Are you two serious?
Minum: ...
Lunja: ...It's three. Three at least.
Lunja: Pardon my boys, they're not good with words. I've already made it clear that I'd never threaten friends. It was just a warning, that's all.
Lunja: Whatever you want is not in this cave, unless it's death. Everything dies in there, no matter what it is.
Paimon: Don't try to scare us. We've experienced all kinds of danger!
Lunja: Why would I try to scare you when I'm elated to see you again? I'm just worried about your safety.
Lunja: We discovered a Withering Zone inside. That's why we've drawn a circle at the entrance to warn commoners from wandering in.
Paimon: Where's the circle then?
Lunja: ...
Lunja: Where's the circle?
Minum: ...
Lunja: Tell me now, where's the circle!
Minum: I, uh, he, uh...
Ziri: You're the boss, so there's one if you say so.
Lunja: Ahem. Regardless, my friends, the cave is treacherous and unpredictable. I suggest you leave right now.
Traveler: How come it's you again?
Lunja: "Again"? Well, I guess fate works in mysterious ways. It's got plans for us.
Lunja: Alright, alright... Don't listen to me, then. Like I said, I warned you out of the goodness of my heart. Go in if you insist... It's not like you're hiring us to be your bodyguards, right?
Lunja: Come on, boys. We're out of here.
Minum: ...
Lunja: Ahem, let's go!
Traveler: I'm no commoner.
Lunja: That's what we all thought when we picked up our first sword! Until we saw blood for the first time.
Traveler: You two think you can stop me?
Traveler: Guarding something important, perhaps?

## Talk 7

Aranakin: #I'm here! Nara {NICKNAME}, and White Floaty!
Paimon: Whoa, where have you been?
Aranakin: Some bad "sand grains" were here. They were up to no good, so I didn't want to come out.
Paimon: Are you referring to those Eremite mercenaries? Are you afraid of them?
Aranakin: White Floaty wrong! I'm not afraid! They're weak, I'm strong!
Traveler: Strong to the point of hiding?
Aranakin: #No, no! Hmph! Nara {NICKNAME} only says irritating things!
Paimon: Anyway, the water here... It's showing some strange colors. Do you think it's because of...
Traveler: The Withering.
Aranakin: Correct, it is Marana. It permeates the water and dances like mist... So you can't drink the water, and it makes the plants sick.
Aranakin: Thanks to Zohrah Mushroom, Marana has withdrawn a little. But Marana is still too much around. Zohrah Mushroom is not feeling well. He's in danger.
Paimon: But the place is all affected by The Withering. How are we supposed to get close?
Aranakin: Hmm... Look at that odd old rock over there! Repair it and the crack in the pond should open big enough... to drain the water away.
Paimon: But... even if we can drain the water, what are we going to do with The Withering here?
Aranakin: Well... We'll worry about that later! We also have to break the seal protecting Zohrah Mushroom to let him join us!
Paimon: Okay, got it. Let's get to work then!
Traveler: Marana.
Traveler: We have to be careful from now on.
Aranakin: #Nara {NICKNAME} is right. Be careful of those bad "sand grains" and their wicked thoughts.

## Talk 8

Traveler: I'll bear that in mind.
Aranakin: Oh, and... Uh, don't go yet...
Aranakin: Aranakin loves to sing and share songs with friends. But Aranakin doesn't know if Nara could hear Aranara's songs.
Paimon: Yes, we can! Paimon loves to sing too!
Aranakin: Then Aranakin will give you this song. Please take the songleaf. Follow its veins with Nara's voice and the song will come out.
Paimon: So you mean that, uh, we can follow the score and learn your song?
Aranakin: Yes, yes! Paimon the White Floaty can be smart sometimes!
Paimon: Okay, that probably came out wrong, but thanks!
Traveler: Thank you, I'll cherish it.
Aranakin: Yes, together!
Traveler: We can sing it together sometime.

## Talk 9

Aranakin: Speaking of the Mawtiyima Forest, Aranaga is waiting for you there. He presides over the Arahaoma ritual. Go see him!

## Talk 10

Traveler: Let's hear your offer first.
Paimon: Are you serious about doing business with her?

## Talk 11

Lunja: Minum, Ziri, I got it! Find a messenger to inform the client! And we're leaving now!
Lunja: Those were tough opponents. The Withering couldn't stop them, Anqa and Isan got hurt too. So before they catch up with us...
Minum: Boss...
Lunja: Didn't you hear what I said? What are you waiting for?
Ziri: #{M#He}{F#She} is here already.
Lunja: ...
Traveler: I'm all ears. Please continue.
Lunja: *sigh* I just can't get rid of you, can I...
Lunja: Sorry, my "friends," we just wanted the Zohrah Mushroom for our client. Just business, nothing personal.
Paimon: Friends? We're not friends! How can you still call us that?
Lunja: What do you mean, little one? I already apologized. Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Paimon: Aaahh!! You...!
Lunja: Seriously, you've proven you're extraordinary by giving Anqa and Isan a good thrashing.
Lunja: I admire warriors like you. It's my honor to be your friend. But... business is business. I'm sure you understand, right? I hate to break our friendship.
Lunja: It would be such a shame to let some boring business get in between us friends!
Traveler: Just get to the point.
Lunja: Take it easy, my friend. You're the ones who are cornered in this cave. You wanna risk your life for it? Not a problem.
Lunja: But I'd rather not see more of my people get hurt over a lousy mushroom. The pay's just not worth it. So, let's make a deal...
Paimon: Who would trust a scammer like you?
Lunja: Well, that depends on how much you're willing to pay.
Traveler: Hand over the Zohrah Mushroom.
Traveler: Is this how you treat your "friends"?

## Talk 12

Paimon: The Zohrah Mushroom is gone! Look, over there...
Aranakin: The awful "sand grains"! Follow them!

## Talk 13

Paimon: These guys are weird, so eager to get chummy...
Traveler: We'd better be careful.
Aranakin: Yes, yes, you should be careful.
Paimon: Well, since you both say so...
Paimon: Huh!?
Aranakin: Huh!?
Aranakin: Hey! You startled me!!
Paimon: That's Paimon's line!
Paimon: Hm... Speaking of which, little one, who are you?
Aranakin: Aranakin isn't a "little one," Aranakin is Aranakin!
Aranakin: You can't listen to those sand grains. They're liars with bad minds who are here for the Aranara!
Traveler: Bad minds...?
Aranakin: Bad minds, bad bad minds!
Paimon: What...? Paimon didn't get that at all...
Aranakin: White Floaty is silly, so White Floaty didn't get it.
Paimon: Wha— Hey!
Traveler: He's talking about those people from just now.
Aranakin: #Nara {NICKNAME} smart, that's what Aranakin means.
Paimon: Huh? You know our names?
Aranakin: #Yes, Aranakin smart. When you talked to them, I listened. I heard that the Nara's name is "{NICKNAME}" and that your name is "Paimon." But Floaty Paimon is silly and doesn't understand Aranakin.
Traveler: Floaty Paimon is like that, it's true.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's not silly!
Aranakin: Mawtiyima is feeling sick, Marana is getting bigger. We must go quickly. Quickly!
Paimon: W—Wait a second, we don't even know where we're going!
Aranakin: Zohrah Mushroom! We need Zohrah Mushroom, to prepare Arahaoma. We need Arahaoma, to help Mawtiyima be lively again!
Aranakin: I know where Zohrah Mushroom is, I take you there!
Paimon: Alright... Hey, wait for us!
Traveler: Aragaru sent us here.
Aranakin: I know. All the grass and trees, one by one, were passing the message, and it got to me. So I knew I would see you here!
Traveler: They must have some sort of a scheme.
Traveler: What are the "sand grains" you are talking about?
Aranakin: Sand is Valuka, and those sand grains are a group of bad Nara Valuka. I don't like sand, it's coarse, rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere...

## Talk 14

Paimon: They're gone... They better not try to scam us again next time. Anyway, we got the Zohrah Mushroom!
Aranakin: #The bad "sand grains" are terrifying, but Nara {NICKNAME} is even more so sometimes... Scaring people away with strange words.
Paimon: #Well, yeah, {NICKNAME} is like that sometimes.

## Talk 15

Paimon: Well, you picked on the wrong person! The Zohrah Mushroom is ours now!
Aranakin: #Impressive! Nara {NICKNAME} made those bad "sand grains" run off in a couple of moves! Pow! Smash!
Paimon: #That's super fighter Nara {NICKNAME} for you!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: (Ready for combat) I can offer you a lesson.
Paimon: Yeah, you're extorting the wrong people!
Lunja: I see. I respect your proposal.
Lunja: Hmph... Your tenacity is so infuriating! We're deep in the red for this one! All right, boys, get ready to fight!

### Additional Talk 2

Lunja: I'll make it short, then. A rich old man in the Akademiya hired us, the Eremites, to find the Zohrah Mushroom in the forest.
Lunja: The pay's very good, but the deadline's very tight. And as you can see, a young and charming woman like me really needed Mora.
Paimon: ...
Lunja: You know the rest. Sorry for using you to get this Zo... and almost killing... Uh, almost stopping you from pursuing me.
Lunja: But since you're alive and kicking, we'll still be friends and let bygones be bygones, right?
Paimon: No! That's attempted murder. Let bygones be bygones!? Someone could have gotten killed!
Lunja: Well, that's exactly what I'm worried about. They're all my family. I don't want to endanger anyone, or it's a bad deal.
Lunja: Therefore, it seems that a peaceful resolution is the way to go. But what do you want the mushroom for, anyway?

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: We need it to save the forest.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: (Ready for combat) Your losses aren't my problem.
Lunja: ...Don't want to do business, eh?
Lunja: *sigh* Get them, boys!

### Additional Talk 5

Lunja: Hmph... That old man did mention the Zohrah Mushroom is the key to eradicating The Withering, and that was why he wanted us to get it at all cost.
Lunja: But it ain't anything valuable, and The Withering in these blasted woods have nothing to do with us desert dwellers.
Lunja: The intrinsic value of the mushroom, plus labor, medical expenses for Anqa and Isan, fines for breach of contract, and... a little extra to compensate a friend.
Lunja: That comes out to 450,000 Mora and not a penny less. How's that? You're getting off cheap.
Paimon: What!? That's robbery!
Lunja: 500,000 Mora for calling me a robber and hurting my feelings! We're traders, so watch your words.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: I accept your offer.
Paimon: What!?
Lunja: Haha, all right! 550,000 Mora it is!
Paimon: What the heck!?

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Giving you guys a good thrashing seems to be the better deal here.
Lunja: Ha! Is that the so-called buyer's pride? I like it!
Lunja: Take everything valuable from them!

### Additional Talk 8

Lunja: Because that's how I like it!
Traveler: But I don't have that much Mora on me right now.
Lunja: Sorry, no IOU! Perhaps you can give me that squawking flying pet of yours as collateral?
Paimon: Eh!? Don't do that!
Traveler: That's not what I meant...
Lunja: You're kinda cute when you bargain. I'm listening.
Traveler: Give me the mushroom and I promise you'll get your money later.
Lunja: I didn't think a promise could be worth that much. But what are you going to do if I don't believe you?
Traveler: Minum's kneecaps look brittle to me.
Lunja: ...
Lunja: Don't be full of yourself. They're The Farrokhzadan and also my boys.
Traveler: I've already taken down two of you. What's a few more?
Lunja: Hmph... Interesting offer you have there. I'll believe you... this time. Let's go, boys.
Traveler: Not so fast.
Lunja: Why? You changed your mind?
Traveler: I'm pondering how you're going to compensate us.
Lunja: Interesting. And why would we do that?
Paimon: Because you laid the trap and tricked us! Plus... ahem, Ziri's nose, Minum's kneecaps, Anqa and Isan's injuries...
Lunja: Tsk, name your price.
Traveler: Mora is the best compensation.
Paimon: That's right, Mora!
Paimon: Yeah! Got to be valuable, at least!
Lunja: I see. If this would prevent my boys from getting hurt...
Paimon: Well, you should've seen it coming!
Lunja: ...That's not a good way to do business. Agha Farrokh will never forget your offense, and you will get it when the table is turned.
Lunja: Let's go, boys, and remember their faces!
Lunja: Final advice: Keep one eye open when you sleep at night. Don't forget, my "friends," you haven't paid for what you bought yet.
Traveler: It's more sincere when it's something precious.
Traveler: Now just think about how much Mora you will lose if you tick me off.
Traveler: It will be interesting to see how I smash Ziri's nose in.
Traveler: How much more do you think you can afford Anqa and Isan's medical bills?
Traveler: Please hear me out...

### Additional Talk 9

Lunja: Ha, friends! How nice to see someone alive in this dump!
Lunja: Hi, call me Lunja, of The Farrokhzadan, even though technically, I'm a Farrokhdokht, haha! These are my boys...
Minum: ...Minum.
Ziri: Ziri.
Lunja: Very good, very upbeat! As you can see, me and the boys welcome you here. Please help yourself to a hot meal!
Lunja: Ahem, right, Minum, Ziri?
Minum: ...
Paimon: Uh... Ms. Lunja, they don't look very enthusiastic...
Lunja: Ahem, show some enthusiasm, boys!
Minum: *sigh*...
Ziri: Welcome, strangers.
Lunja: My apologies! They're from the desert and haven't gotten used to the rainforest.
Lunja: It's humid and stuffy. You can wring water out of your shirt, pants, and bandana. It's such a mess after every fight...
Lunja: You probably know we have three thousand terms to classify sand, and tens of thousands of ways to deal with it.
Lunja: But moisture and plants? I'm out. They make me uncomfortable the whole time, and I feel like I'll never be able to deal with them.
Lunja: That's enough of my nagging. Job comes first... And too much complaining hurts morale! After all, life is life, but business is still business, right?
Paimon: #(Hey, {NICKNAME}, Paimon thinks we just ran into a bunch of weirdos.)
Traveler: (They are weird.)
Lunja: Ahem, excuse me, but I didn't get your names. Where did you come from and what are you doing here?
Traveler: #Just call me {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Paimon's name is Paimon! We're here to...
Traveler: We're adventurers just passing by.
Lunja: Is that so? What could be in this rainforest that is worth risking your lives for?
Traveler: That is classified information.
Lunja: Haha! You adventurers are such interesting people. May the gale and sand never blind you and may you find what you seek!
Minum: We don't mean to interrupt, boss, but...
Ziri: It's time we get going.
Lunja: ...
Lunja: All right. We've got to run, my friends. Sorry we can't extend our hospitality.
Lunja: Once we part, you're on your own. Without the desert folk watching your back, you'd better keep an eye out for wild beasts...
Lunja: The savage jungle is just like desert. In the desert, when you leave your tribe, you're on your own. You will be an easy prey for the hungry beasts.
Traveler: Is that a threat?
Lunja: A threat? Why would I threaten my friends? It's just a kind reminder! Who do you think I am?
Lunja: How irritating... Come, Minum and Ziri, let's go!
Minum: Wait...
Ziri: The pot...!
Lunja: Just leave it there for our new friends! Let's go!
Traveler: It depends on what we'll find.
Traveler: Someone sent us here.
Lunja: Someone sent you? It must be someone of high standing, or at least someone very rich, right?
Traveler: Well... I wouldn't exactly say that.
Lunja: Is that so...
Lunja: So, if, and I mean if, you're rival bounty hunters, what should I do with you?
Paimon: Eh?
Lunja: Freaked you out, didn't I? Minum, Ziri, did you see that? They freaked out!
Minum: ...Yeah.
Ziri: They freaked out, obviously.
Paimon: Uh, no, not at all! Grow up, people!
Lunja: Sorry, don't mind that, it was just a joke!
Paimon: Well, it wasn't funny at all!
Lunja: Relax. To us Eremites, daring to harm our guests is to court the wrath of the merciless desert.
Traveler: It's not what you think.
Traveler: (We should leave as soon as we can.)

### Additional Talk 10

Lunja: Ha, friends! How nice to see someone alive in this dump!
Lunja: Hi, call me Lunja, of The Farrokhzadan, even though technically, I'm a Farrokhdokht, haha! These are my boys...

Lunja: Just leave it there for our new friends! Let's go!

### Additional Talk 11

Lunja: Come, my friends, sit down and have some tea! So, did whatever it was in the cave scare you away?
Lunja: Haha, it's fine, really! You're still alive, aren't you? Nothing matters more than that. Some things you just have to let go.
Traveler: I'm not done yet.
Lunja: Is that so? That's great. Minum, Ziri, you guys heard that? Let's make a toast to this great adventurer!
Minum: To courage...
Ziri: To health.
Lunja: To the bleak paths ahead and the treacherous exits to come! Cheers!
Traveler: I'm not giving up yet.

### Additional Talk 12

Lunja: You're our guests. Make yourselves at home.

### Additional Talk 13

Minum: ...

### Additional Talk 14

Ziri: Be careful in the cave.

### Additional Talk 15

Lunja: Ha, friends! How nice to see someone alive in this dump!

### Additional Talk 16

Aranakin: Hmm... It's sealed. We need to look around for the stones that can lift the seal. Use the Kusava!
Paimon: Well, nothing comes easy...
