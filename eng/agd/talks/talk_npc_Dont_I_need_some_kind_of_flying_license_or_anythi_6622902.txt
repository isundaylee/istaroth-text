Traveler: Don't I need some kind of flying license or anything?
Pixica: No no no, even someone like me, who could never get his flying license, can still complete this with ease.
Pixica: Rather than your flying skills, what this tests is your shooting ability.
Pixica: The most important thing is to focus! Concentrate single-mindedly on your target.
Pixica: Miss Zyanya will ensure your safety throughout your experience, and you'll sometimes even be able to see a Qucusaurus patrolling nearby!
Pixica: Hot air balloons... What a magnificent invention, bringing humanity closer to the skies.
