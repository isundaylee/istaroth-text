# Missing title (352587007)

Traveler: Are you an adventurer?
Dr. Livingstone: I certainly am, though I would be the first to admit that my appearance is more that of a scholar... Nevertheless, my principal occupation is indeed adventuring.
Dr. Livingstone: I have taken a few notes from my recent studies of the Sword Cemetery. Hope you find them useful.
Dr. Livingstone: We adventurers have to look out for each other. Ad astra abyssosque!
