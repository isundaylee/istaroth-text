Schulz: Anything in the works yourself?
Schulz: Herman wants a sword for his daughter. I hear him talking about it all the time.
Schulz: He can't afford one of Wagner's, so I figured I'd make one for him myself, for free.
Schulz: I wouldn't call it an act of charity, it's not like my work is worth anything anyway.
