# The Causality of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Nahida: We don't have many more festivals to waste. Hurry and find the truth.

## Talk 2

Paimon: ...We're still in the same day!
Traveler: As expected, it's not as simple as we thought.
Paimon: Nahida, you already knew last night that we didn't break out of the samsara! Why didn't you tell us?
Nahida: Would there have been a point? You would've spent the night with new worries, with tomorrow still out of reach.
Nahida: In that case... You might as well rest within that brief moment of hope. An opportunity like that doesn't come by often, and I thought it might help you clear your minds.
Paimon: Paimon thought the dook-dook did that! Ah, whatever, guess you were looking out for us after all.
Nahida: Hehe, of course. In the time we've been together, you two have been everything to me.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon's flattered and everything, but maybe you're taking things a little fast...
Nahida: Hehehe... What I mean is, even though I had asked you to solve this puzzle, you two are still the only ones who can see me and sense my presence.
Nahida: In other words, if you weren't here, I may as well not exist. That's why you two have been everything to me. Get it?
Paimon: Uhh, Nahida's talking about confusing stuff again...
Nahida: Anyway, that's enough chit-chat. So Traveler, did the new clues yesterday help you gain a new understanding of the situation?
Traveler: The time loop theory is indeed incorrect.
Paimon: Huh? Why are you scrapping your previous theory?
Traveler: Dehya's fighting skills have been improving.
Paimon: Oh yeah, you're right. Gosh, how did we not notice that? In a simple time loop, people's physical conditions should also reset.
Nahida: So, what's your new hypothesis?
Traveler: Dunyarzad's illness has also gotten worse...

## Talk 3

Dehya: ...There you are. Really took me a while to find you.
Paimon: As expected, Dehya also didn't get hurt today.
Dehya: Get hurt? Why would I? Don't underestimate me.
Paimon: Well, you're still getting used to your new greatsword...
Dehya: Truth be told, I also think it's pretty strange. It just suddenly felt so familiar in my hands... Wait a sec, how did you know I got a new greatsword to begin with? I didn't tell anyone about it...
Paimon: Traveler, could you explain the situation to her today? Paimon's gotten a little sick of doing it...
Traveler: We don't actually need to explain everything.
Paimon: Oh, that works.
Traveler: You suddenly became proficient with your greatsword because...
Traveler: We've lived through this same day many times already.
Dehya: ...What happened to you guys while I was gone? Did you get brainwashed by some cult?
Paimon: Umm, don't think too hard about it. Just take what we're saying at face value.
Dehya: ...Alright then. Let me get this straight. You're telling me that my body's already gotten used to this greatsword, but my brain just doesn't remember it?
Paimon: Yes, your memory's being erased every day.
Dehya: Then I'd have to disagree. That's impossible.
Paimon: Oh? Why do you think that?
Dehya: If we've actually been reliving the Sabzeruz Festival day after day, then what happened to the things we used, the money we spent, the food we ate?
Dehya: Common sense says my wallet should've emptied itself a long time ago. There's no way I wouldn't have noticed that.
Traveler: I've thought about that, too.
Traveler: But if the sages were behind this...
Paimon: Right... They could use the Akasha to record what everyone did that day, and then use the city's resources to replenish everything...
Paimon: It's not very likely, but it's also not impossible.
Dehya: No, it is impossible. I've got proof.
Paimon: You have proof? Where?
Dehya: *sigh* You two are surprisingly serious about this nonsensical discussion. Fine, I'll play along for a little longer.
Dehya: Come with me. Miss Dunyarzad, please come along as well. I still can't guarantee that this area is safe.
Traveler: If they utilized the entire city's resources, as well as information supplied by the Akasha...
Traveler: And our memories of the day are erased every night.
Traveler: Let's just get straight to the point.

## Talk 4

Dehya: This is it.
Paimon: Huh? This a wooden training dummy. What about it?
Dehya: See those marks on the dummy? Those are the result of several days' worth of practice.
Dehya: Let's say the sages didn't replace it every day. Shouldn't it be hacked to pieces by now?
Paimon: That's true, but what if they did?
Dehya: Then the sages would have had to reproduce every mark I left during previous training sessions.
Dehya: I'm a professional fighter. My martial school has always emphasized the importance of refined control.
Dehya: The force, angle, and entry point of each strike is calculated and deliberate. That's why I remember every mark on the dummy, as well as my state of mind as I made each strike.
Dehya: It's just as they say: Each swordsman has their own unique style, and even the same swordsman can't make the same cut twice. It would be impossible to copy these marks.
Paimon: Is it really impossible? What if they used some fancy machine to carve every single mark?
Dehya: People often say that a Kamera's photo can never replace an artist's painting because the former has no spirit to it.
Dehya: The same thing applies here. At a mere glance, I can differentiate carved marks from the results of combat training.
Traveler: ...That makes sense.
Dehya: Phew... I hope that cleared things up for you? Hey, is this that new Brainsercise game that's been super popular with the scholars lately? It's surprisingly fun.
Dehya: Anyway, it's getting late. I should escort Miss Dunyarzad to Nilou's stage. See ya later.
Paimon: Welp, back to square one. Is our memory deletion theory also wrong? *sigh*
Paimon: But at least we've reached some other conclusions in the meantime?
Traveler: We're not in a time loop.
Paimon: Yep, that's true. So... can we think of any new ideas right now?
Traveler: Let me think...
Paimon: Strange? Paimon feels like everything's been strange lately...
Traveler: How come... we've never thought about leaving the city?
Paimon: Huh? Leaving the city... You're right! It's really strange how we never thought of such a simple solution. Many things should become clear if we can confirm the flow of time outside of the city.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe it... Did we miss this because we're tunnel-visioning too hard on our other theories, or because we're just too tired?
Traveler: It is really strange.
Paimon: How about we go back and ask Nahida? Maybe we've forgotten something about leaving the city.
Traveler: We should've thought of this a long time ago.
Traveler: I suddenly realized that something is strange...
Traveler: We're not in the real world.
Traveler: It seems we'll have to abandon this theory...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Nahida, we're back!
Nahida: You're back early today. Did you find something new?
Paimon: Sort of. We're mostly sure now that we're not in a time loop, and we also aren't in the real world. But at the same time, we have a new question...
Traveler: What will happen if we try to leave the city?
Nahida: Leaving the city... As far as I remember, you've mentioned your plans to do that twice before...
Traveler: !?
Paimon: We did? But we don't remember anything! What happened after we talked about those plans? What did we say when we got back?
Nahida: Let me think... I don't think you ever actually told me what the outcome was. Oh â€” it's probably more accurate to say that both times, you never came back the whole night.
Nahida: But you two sometimes stay out the entire night anyway, so at the time, I didn't think too much about it.
Paimon: It is true that sometimes we lose track of time during our investigations. Before we know it, it'll already be the next day. But still... neither of us remember anything about leaving town.
Nahida: Really? That's kinda strange. In theory, I should've already awakened all your memories.
Traveler: Let's try again tomorrow.
Paimon: Yup! Something here's definitely fishy. Let's get to the bottom of this tomorrow!
Paimon: *beep*
Traveler: Maybe this is the key.
Traveler: Have we ever tried leaving the city?
