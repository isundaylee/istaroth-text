Arlecchino: Before I go on a long journey, I tend to leave the children of the House of the Hearth with some homework to complete in my absence.
Arlecchino: Many of them, however, simply play to their hearts' content for most of the time I am gone, then rush to get their homework done in the final few days before my return.
Arlecchino: They believe I am none the wiser, but I have simply elected not to expose their chicanery. After all, to complete one's work in a short timeframe is a skill in its own right.
