Tribal Announcement: "You should know that tribal affairs contain certain taboos. Act in line with their strictures, and never do anything presumptuous."
Tribal Announcement: "Remember to never strike with your hands anything made out of obsidian, especially the sacred pillar and the uncarved stone."
Childish Handwriting: "Correct. It's obsidian and imbued with mystical powers. If you hit it too hard, it'll lose that spiritual element."
Unrefined Handwriting: "I'm wetting myself laughing over here. What do you think obsidian is, some kind of precision gear? I'd say Granny Itztli just put a curse on the stone to stop other people from messing around with her materials..."
Childish Handwriting: "Oh, so you think you're all that just because you know Granny Itztli? What curse are you even talking about? You don't even understand the basic properties of obsidian, so what is there to even debate?"
Unrefined Handwriting: "The applications of sympathetic spellcraft... If you'd listened in class, you'd already know the principles behind taboos and curses."
Another Person's Message: "You two are squabbling like kids..."
Tribal Announcement: "Clarification: There's no complicated reasoning behind this rule. Obsidian just has very sharp edges, and it'd be bad if anyone got cut."
