# Goddess's Manuscript (I)

...
Brave Francois mounted the haystack,
picked up a fork
and planted it tines-down atop the mountain
of grass. Behind him was a large,
bright moon.

He shouted out the names of everyone
in the village. The Village Chief
was first to be named, and so frightened
was he that he wished
to climb up the haystack
And stop up Francois's mouth.
"Are you crazy!? You're yelling so loudly
the dragon might show up!"
"You good-for-nothing!
Have you not seen how the windmill
everyone built has been destroyed
by the dragon!?
And here you are,
worrying if it'll return!?" Francois
really would have loved to kick him off
the haystack, but held back
given that the Chief, too,
was worried for the villagers'
safety.
Francois saw that nigh all
the villagers had arrived,
and so he cleared his throat.
"Dear neighbors and kin,
think you still that we must endure this?"
"No, of course not, but we cannot
do anything about the dragon,"
said the grocer.
"Who says so? Did I not leap onto its neck
from the windmill blades,
stepping on it twice, and did
it not fall down and flee?"
Perhaps everyone worked so hard
to build the mill
that was destroyed, everyone's emotions
beca█e █nflamed.
Lift█n██their fists, they decided
to tak███n the dragon!
But Francois lifted his own hands,
and calmed the crowd:
"Let us go home for today, everyone.
Everyone's present
lack of self-preservation is not bravery,
but rather wrath.
If we yet desire to face danger after
calming ourselves, only then may we
truthfully call our sentiment 'valor.'"
So everyone went home.
The next day, there were still many
youngsters who wished to follow
Francois to take on the wicked dragon.
.....
Who would have known that the valiant
possess the protection of the goddess's
Radiant Charter? Encountering true "valor,"
The dragon could neither spout fire
nor slash with claws, and was forced to
allow the other party
to call pauses and switch personnel.
And so, after several days
and nights of fierce fighting, the
wicked dragon could no longer bear it,
and chose to surrender.
