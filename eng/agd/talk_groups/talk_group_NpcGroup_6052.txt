Kuhimana: Apologies, recognizing people isn't my forte...

Traveler: Is it your eyes?
Kuhimana: It's not exactly a problem with my eyesight. I'm just bad at remembering people's faces.
Kuhimana: Sometimes, I meet people who I've met many times before, even chatted with, yet I still can't remember their faces...
Kuhimana: I find it even harder when they're wearing different clothes or accessories.
Kuhimana: But then when it comes to animals, I'm sensitive enough to always tell them apart.
Kuhimana: Hehe, I've done a lot of sketches of them, and I've given each one a special label of their own!

Traveler: It's fine.
Kuhimana: Well, I shall look forward to seeing you again next time. I just hope I'll still be able to recognize you.

Traveler: Have you tried doing sketches of people?
Kuhimana: In all honesty, I've tried. But I couldn't even sort the labels out correctly, let alone still recognize them the second time we met...
Kuhimana: Sometimes, there'll be two people who were wearing hats of a similar color, and I'll accidentally sort them into the same book.
Kuhimana: As time has gone by, everyone who knows me knows I have this issue, so they don't take it personally when I fail to recognize them.
Kuhimana: On the contrary, they're all quite happy to have someone like me around who's good at telling animals apart.
Kuhimana: In their eyes, all animals of any given species look exactly the same! Boggles the mind, doesn't it?
