## Talk 1

Traveler: Missing text (3157568258)
Flora: Ah! The dandelions! They're all flying away!
Flora: What are you doing? Do you have any idea how much effort it took for me to grow those!
Traveler: I'm scattering them far and wide...
Flora: We're in the city! They won't get far before being blocked by those walls!
Traveler: This way, we'll be able to grow many more dandelions...
Flora: Well, why don't you take some dandelion seeds outside the city and scatter them there, then?
Flora: Ugh, my dandelions! They took so much effort to grow, too...
Flora: Y—You... If you needed dandelions, couldn't you go outside to gather some?
Flora: These dandelions were the ones you helped me gather, too! It took a lot of care to make them grow... and this is how you treat them?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Missing text (2076064298)
Flora: Growing flowers isn't that easy.
Flora: ...How about this, then? Find me some more Dandelion Seeds, and I'll plant them again myself.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Missing text (3753489602)
Flora: Once I'm done sowing the dandelion seeds into the new pot, I'll have to decide on a good place to put it.
Flora: ...Well, maybe I'll just display it outside again.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Missing text (391194450)
Flora: Did you get my Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: These are for you.
Flora: ...Thanks. I'll plant a new pot later.
Flora: But I'm never, ever leaving it outside again!

## Talk 7

Flora: Missing text (4096638906)
Traveler: So, uh, did something happen?
Flora: You! Donna told me all about it — she saw you blowing my dandelions away!
Traveler: Uh, sorry about that...
Flora: I know — Donna told me all about it. You were the one who blew all my dandelions away, weren't you?
Flora: If you needed Dandelion Seeds that much, you could just have gathered some out in the wild. I was caring for these ones!
Flora: Need I mention that these dandelions were the ones you helped me gather? Is this is really how you're going to treat them?
