Dunya: I'll just go around the outskirts, and I promise not to break the rules and head inside, alright?
Juzjani: As both a researcher and a doctor, I don't recommend that you go there.
Juzjani: There used to be a hospital that the Akademiya used to study Eleazar. Entry to its ruins is prohibited now.
Dunya: I study history, so I know all about that. I just think that I'll discover something if I can actually visit the place.
Juzjani: Based on the record, no effective method of treatment for Eleazar has been found yet, and the hospital's ruins were sealed up.
Juzjani: Even people from Aaru Village that is just nearby rarely go that way.
Juzjani: I don't see the need to risk breaking the Akademiya's orders just to satisfy groundless curiosity.
Dunya: *sigh* I really can't win in an argument against you. You medical people are just too careful.

Dunya: I'll just go around the outskirts, and I promise not to break the rules and head inside, alright?
Juzjani: As both a researcher and a doctor, I don't recommend that you go there.
Juzjani: That was once a hospital that the Akademiya used to study Eleazar. Entry to its ruins is prohibited now.
Dunya: Oh, come on. I study history, so I know all about that already. I just get the feeling that I'd discover something... as long as I can actually visit the place.
Juzjani: And I think that you're trying to do something unnecessary. I mean, hasn't Eleazar essentially vanished due to Lesser Lord Kusanali's power?
Juzjani: Even people from the nearby Aaru Village rarely pass that way, so I'd wager that there's some other dangers present there too.
Dunya: *sigh* You know what? There's no winning an argument against you. The way I see it, though, you medical people are just too careful.
