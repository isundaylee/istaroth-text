# Guest from Afar


## Talk 1

Verr Goldet: This is getting so stressful...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Verr Goldet: Oh, my apologies! When did you get here?
Verr Goldet: The monster presence in this area is steadily growing, and although my husband insists they wouldn't dare set foot in the inn...
Verr Goldet: He's the only one sufficiently prepared to fight back if they ever did. That concerns me a little.
Verr Goldet: If you can spare the time, could you secure the surrounding area for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Verr Goldet: You have my gratitude.
Verr Goldet: I am grateful for your help. You will be adequately compensated.
Traveler: What is it about this inn...
Verr Goldet: Huh? There's nothing out-of-the-ordinary about the inn. It's just a little out of the way and sees a lot of traffic.
Verr Goldet: But it's worthwhile. Travelers braving the wilderness need somewhere to get a good night's sleep and eat a proper meal.
Verr Goldet: That's what my husband and I think, anyway. It's the simple truth.

## Talk 2

Verr Goldet: Is it done?
Traveler: Not yet.
Verr Goldet: Take your time... And please, be careful. Something about this area just makes me uneasy.

## Talk 3

Verr Goldet: Is it done?
Traveler: Yes.
Verr Goldet: Wonderful. I think we can all afford to relax now.
Verr Goldet: As promised â€” compensation for your trouble.
