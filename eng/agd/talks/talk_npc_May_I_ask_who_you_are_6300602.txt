Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Ogura Mio: I am Ogura Mio, the owner of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. Let me know if you need anything.
Ogura Mio: Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a family-run store that has been around for a century. We sell high-class fabrics and the latest kimonos. Those upper-class samurai often come here as well. The quality of our merchandise is guaranteed.
Ogura Mio: I see that you are not dressed commonly either. I'd wager that you've probably seen much. So, would you like to try out some Inazuma-style outfits?
