Traveler: About singing...
Aranakin: This song, it is from your story. Aranakin sang this song after obtaining the Zohrah Mushroom.
Aranakin: #Aranakin does not remember anymore, but the plants in the forest that hear this song will remember for sure. Aranakin once told them that Nara {NICKNAME} is an amazing seed, and Aranakin's friend.
