Traveler: Sounds really tough...
Moyan: Thank you for asking!
Moyan: My job's not that difficult, especially when compared to taking care of tea trees, drying tea, and stirring them in a hot pan. After all, tea is our most important commodity.
Moyan: The tea farmers get up while it's still dark and work year-round to make sure that people everywhere get to enjoy it at a fair price.
Moyan: I've never heard them complaining about their work, either.
Moyan: They love tea, and they make the most out of their days. That must have rubbed off on me, I guess, 'cause I'm pretty proactive myself.
