# In Another Land


## Talk 1

Alrani: Hey! Traveler, why are you here?
Traveler: Are you... Alrani?
Alrani: After you helped me gather some materials previously, I was preparing to write a thesis on Visions and elemental powers.
Alrani: The outline was drawn up, the materials were found, and you were a special example of someone who does not have Vision but could still use the power of the elements.
Alrani: So I wrote up the first draft and sent it to the Akademiya for my tutor to review, but...
Alrani: "The topic is shallow, the logic is unclear, the content is rambling and incomprehensible."
Alrani: My paper was summarily rejected. Again.
Traveler: So it's a rewrite for you, then?
Alrani: Yeah. Hahaha... Well, I've rewritten it twice already. What's another time?
Alrani: The first time, I wanted to go to Mondstadt to collect data and to write a paper about life in Mondstadt and The Four Winds.
Alrani: But as soon as I passed the Stone Gate, I heard that The Dragon of the East, Dvalin, who should be one of The Four Winds of Mondstadt, had suddenly started attacking the city of Mondstadt.
Alrani: I specifically went to Mondstadt to consult with Mr. Sayid, but he didn't know the reason either, and couldn't help me with my paper.
Alrani: Since I didn't have a core argument or any evidence, I had to change the topic...
Traveler: So you went to Liyue?
Alrani: Yes! I thought that since the Geo Archon in Liyue is so diligent, and personally guards Liyue Harbor, and also helps to guide its overall development...
Alrani: If I wrote a paper on the relationship between the Geo Archon and Liyue Harbor, there should be enough material.
Alrani: And then— and then, Morax suddenly... Ohh...
Traveler: No one wanted that kind of accident to happen.
Alrani: After failing twice, I had no other choice. If I couldn't put a good paper together, I wouldn't be able to show my face back at the Akademiya again.
Alrani: So I wanted to go out into Liyue's countryside to investigate and find a paper topic. But you already know what happened next...
Alrani: To tell you the truth, even when I was captured by the Treasure Hoarders and pressed for the whereabouts of the treasure, I still felt less stressed than when I was writing my paper.
Alrani: After all, I had a clear idea of what those guys wanted from me, whereas I have no idea what my tutor wants from my paper even now...
Traveler: Is writing a paper that scary?
Alrani: The writing's not the scary part, it's my tutor. My tutor is actually a very patient and knowledgeable person.
Alrani: But when it comes to "Essay-Writing Guidance," no matter what the tutor was like before, they all suddenly become super scary.
Alrani: So I still haven't been able to hand in my paper, and the deadline is getting closer and closer. My tutor must be losing patience.
Alrani: If I dare to go back to the Akademiya empty-handed, I've no doubt that he will banish me to sweep the library forever...
Alrani: As such, I came to Inazuma to find less popular topics, such as the Inazuman people's living conditions under the Vision Hunt Decree...
Traveler: Don't get caught again...
Alrani: I won't. I mean, I don't have a Vision. In Inazuma, this might actually be considered an advantage.
Alrani: I've worked out how to conduct the investigation, starting with <color=#00E1FFFF>recording the daily life of the people on this island</color>.
Alrani: If you're interested, Traveler, you could come and help me with the recording.
Traveler: Sure.
Alrani: Let's go. There are still a great many shops on this island for us to explore.
Alrani: Let's start with this one called Eipekkusu.
Traveler: Do you want me to help you again?
Alrani: No. It's just that... I came to Inazuma alone, and I don't know anyone except for you.
Alrani: It would be comforting to work with people I know.
Alrani: Is your tutor that terrible?
Alrani: Absolutely terrifying! Now, I'll have you know that my tutor is actually a very patient and knowledgeable person.
Alrani: But when it comes to "Essay-Writing Guidance," no matter what the tutor was like before, they all suddenly become super scary.
Traveler: Well, at least that didn't happen while you were writing your paper.
Alrani: Hahaha... Yeah, I think I might have lost it if that had happened...
Traveler: Have you finished your paper?
Alrani: Ugh, don't even mention my paper...

## Talk 2

Alrani: So that's what Inazuman specialties are like... Hmm...
Kaede: Hey, what are you doing?
Alrani: Hello! I'm Alrani, a scholar from Sumeru. I'm doing research on Inazuma for an academic paper.
Kaede: Investigating us at a time like this? So suspicious...
Kaede: I don't care what your purpose is. You're disturbing me, so just leave.

## Talk 3

Vahid: Hey, what are you doing?
Alrani: Hello! I'm from...
Vahid: A researcher from the Akademiya, right? I didn't expect to see someone like you here...
Alrani: How did you...
Vahid: I just had to take one look at you to know you're a researcher. There's plenty of them back in Sumeru after all.
Vahid: Did you come all the way here from Sumeru to Inazuma for this... so-called "sociological study"?
Alrani: Yes. I'm just making some preparations. Are you also from the Akademiya...?
Vahid: No, I haven't the talent to be an academic. I'm just an ordinary businessman.
Vahid: Since you're writing a paper, you can record whatever you like here if you want, but first, let me give you some advice.
Vahid: The Outlander Affairs Agency is wary of outlanders like us, so remember to be a bit more restrained while you're doing your research.
Vahid: If you get into any trouble, it would be hard for an outlander like you, who's only just come to Inazuma, to extricate themselves.
Alrani: I... I understand, thank you!
Vahid: Well, off you go then. Start writing stuff down.

## Talk 4

Vahid: *sigh* Didn't I just tell you? Don't do anything suspicious.
Vahid: The current situation in Inazuma is such that, if the Outlander Affairs Agency got involved, there would be no way to resolve things peacefully. Fortunately, I was paying attention to what you were doing.
Traveler: Are things that serious?
Vahid: Yes, they are that serious. See the checkpoint in Ritou? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.
Alrani: Oh no, does this mean that I can't go to the other islands to collect data?
Vahid: Don't worry. I've asked around at the Outlander Affairs Agency before. As it turns out, it might be easier to get a permit if you apply under me, since I'm a businessman here in Inazuma.
Alrani: Th—Thank you... but why do you want to help me?
Traveler: You're a kind soul.
Vahid: Well, I'm not going to turn down the praise...
Vahid: But really, I too wish to ask a favor of you.
Alrani: Oh? But I'm not a good salesperson...
Vahid: It's not about that. Well, this is somewhat embarrassing, but...
Vahid: Although I'm in the fertilizer business, I don't know much about these fertilizers.
Vahid: When people ask me about the special characteristics of these fertilizers, I can only refer to the instructions that came with the packaging. I don't know enough to say anything more persuasive.
Vahid: If you're willing, I'd like you to help me think about... how to market them.
Vahid: At least, help me introduce them in a more persuasive manner, such that I'll be able to attract more customers.
Vahid: In return, I promise that I'll get a permit for you from the Outlander Affairs Agency so that you can enter other places in Inazuma.
Vahid: What do you think? Do you agree?
Traveler: Huh. So Sumeru does have people who aren't researchers of some kind...
Vahid: Of course. Not everyone can, or is willing to go to Akademiya to study and become a researcher.
Alrani: Marketing... I did learn something similar to that at the Akademiya.
Traveler: You've learned that, too?
Alrani: I've just read some relevant books. It's all theory — I've never put them into practice.
Alrani: After all, the Akademiya was no place to practice marketing in any way.
Alrani: But if I study the applications of these fertilizers, perhaps I can come up with some selling points that can be used in marketing.
Vahid: That would be great!
Vahid: Ah... Let's not just stand here and talk. You're probably hungry after all of that.
Vahid: Let me make you something to eat.
Vahid: Traveler, can you please help me find some food? I'll need <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Fish</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Seagrass</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Rice</color>.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: What are you going to make?
Vahid: Hahaha, it's nothing fancy, just an old recipe...
Traveler: Seems reasonable.
Traveler: Is this what they call "fellowship between countrymen"?
Vahid: Sympathy... well, a little. It's not often that I can meet someone from Sumeru in Inazuma.
Traveler: Is the situation so tense?
Vahid: I can't be too sure from where I'm at. But judging by how tense the Kanjou Commissioners are, the situation can't be good.
Vahid: See the checkpoint in Ritou? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.

## Talk 5

Vahid: Have you found the ingredients?

## Talk 6

Alrani: What can you make with <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Fish</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Seagrass</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>a portion of Rice</color>, anyway?

## Talk 7

Vahid: Don't worry, it's more than sufficient. Just a moment. It'll be ready soon.
Alrani: Wow... It looks delicious. You're a great cook.
Vahid: Haha, if you live alone for a long time, you will naturally learn this kind of thing. Go on, dig in.
Vahid: I'm also doing this for the business. In the beginning, I was thinking about many different ways to market our fertilizer.
Vahid: One thing I thought of was to use the vegetables grown with my fertilizer as ingredients to make delicious food, which would help prove their efficacy.
Vahid: But later, I realized that the idea of cooking in a fertilizer shop was a little... inappropriate, so I gave up.
Traveler: It is a bit out of place...
Vahid: Of course, now that I have Miss Alrani's help, I won't have to come up with these terrible ideas by myself.
Alrani: I'll do my best! But about the issue with the travel permit...
Vahid: Leave it to me. If there are no problems, it should be done in just a few days.
Vahid: Still, a researcher coming to Inazuma is a rare sight. What sort of paper are you writing?
Alrani: Ah, I, um, don't know. I don't know yet...
Alrani: I hope to finish the paper while I'm in Inazuma. If I can't get it done, I'll have to go back to the Akademiya to face the music.

## Talk 8

Alrani: I've worked out how to conduct the investigation, starting with recording the daily life of the Inazumans on this island.
Alrani: If you're interested, Traveler, you could come and do some recordings together with me.
Traveler: Sure.
Alrani: Let's go. There are still a great many shops on this island for us to explore.

## Talk 9

Vahid: *sigh* Didn't I just tell you? Don't do anything suspicious.
Vahid: You still haven't gotten all your permits squared away. If the Outlander Affairs Agency got involved, there would be no way to resolve things peacefully. Fortunately, I was paying attention to what you were doing.
Traveler: Is it that serious?
Vahid: Well, they are that serious. See the checkpoint in Ritou? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.

Vahid: Ah... Let's not just stand here and talk. You're probably hungry after all of that.
Vahid: Let me make you something to eat.
Vahid: Traveler, could you help me get some ingredients? I just need a serving each of Fish, Seagrass, and Rice.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: What are you going to make?
Vahid: Hahaha, it's nothing fancy, just an old recipe...
Traveler: Seems reasonable.
Traveler: Is this what they call "fellowship between countrymen"?
Vahid: Sympathy... well, a little. It's not often that I can meet someone from Sumeru in Inazuma.
Traveler: Is the situation still so tense?
Vahid: Now, I'm not too sure from where I sit, but I'm pretty sure not having a license is a no-go.
Vahid: See the checkpoint in Ritou? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.

## Talk 10

Obata: Hello! You two, what are you doing?
Alrani: Hello! I'm Alrani, a scholar from Sumeru. I'm doing some academic research here.
Obata: Research? I'm a fisherman. What's there to research?
Obata: And do you have permission from the Outlander Affairs Agency to do... suspicious things like that?
Obata: I heard from Gonshirou that this kind of behavior should be reported to the Agency first, right?
Traveler: Never heard of it...
Alrani: Eh? Why? Is there such a thing? I've never heard that one before!
Obata: You're getting more and more suspicious by the minute... You'd better come and see Miss Kageyama with me.
Obata: She is an inspector with the Agency. She'd know how to handle your affairs.
Alrani: Wait, hold on. I'm really just an academic researcher... I'll go report to the agency later...
Vahid: Mr. Obata, what's going on here? I could hear the row from all the way over there.
Obata: Oh, it's Mr. Vahid. Well, these two have been loitering around, claiming to be doing some kind of academic research.
Obata: But when I asked, they don't seem to have permission from the Outlander Affairs Agency. I was going to take them to see Miss Kageyama.
Vahid: Alrani, what are you running around for? Shouldn't you be helping at the store?
Traveler: (What's going on?)
Vahid: You've been writing that paper for so long already. What's the point of rushing it now? Can't you see you're disturbing Mr. Obata?
Obata: Why? Mr. Vahid, this is...
Vahid: She's a scholar whom I invited from the Akademiya to work as a consultant for my shop.
Vahid: Because she is writing a paper about Inazuma, she's looking for inspiration around these parts.
Vahid: She just came over from the Akademiya, so she doesn't understand the rules around here.
Vahid: I'm still going through the procedures with the Outlander Affairs Agency, but she can't help running around sometimes... I'm sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Obata.
Alrani: Huh... Oh! I'm so sorry that I disturbed you, Mr. Obata...
Obata: Oh, it's fine. It was a misunderstanding on my part to begin with. I guess you really are a scholar.
Vahid: Alright, Alrani, come over here. We need to have a talk.
Vahid: Mr. Obata, please excuse me.
Traveler: See, told you not to run around.
Alrani: Hey... Huh?
Traveler: Why do you need a permit for such mundane things?

## Talk 11

Alrani: That was a close shave... Well, alright then.
