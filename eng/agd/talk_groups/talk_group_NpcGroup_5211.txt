Traveler: What are you repairing?
Denichere: This Gardemek. Heinry says it's the Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine's bodyguard. He even tried to install a recording device in it...
Denichere: But he should stick to making Fonta, it's all he's good at. I'm the only one who knows how to fix things.

Traveler: You know how to repair meka?
Denichere: I used to work in a project team that built meka, but the project leads kept changing.
Denichere: And every new lead would redo all the work from the beginning.
Denichere: I just couldn't stand it, so I spoke to Heinry and eventually transferred to his Fonta project team.
Denichere: Though I never thought I'd have to fix them again after all this time...
Denichere: Oh, I brought some extra parts that I'm not going to use. Take them, maybe they'll come in handy.

Traveler: You know Heinry?
Denichere: Yeah. We were both on the research team that developed Fonta.
Denichere: The Institute didn't take the project very seriously and we couldn't get any resources or support... But the work was easy and fun.
Denichere: Of course, when Fonta became a major commercial success the Institute started paying more attention.
Denichere: After that, we founded the Fonta company, with the Institute's support... Although in practice we were managed by the Institute.
Denichere: As for Heinry... All he thinks about is Fonta, so he doesn't care about any of that.
Denichere: But as for me... Ah, forget it. Let's talk about something else.
