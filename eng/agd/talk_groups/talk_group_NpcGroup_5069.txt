Traveler: I don't really feel anything.
Crossa: *sigh* Must be my old sickness acting up, then.
Crossa: I used to be a sailor, but I was injured in an accident, and ever since, I've felt like my surroundings are shaking.
Crossa: I can't go back to being a sailor, so I can only help old friends sell things they salvage underwater to make a living.

Traveler: Take care of yourself.
Crossa: Yeah... I think I should take a break for now.
