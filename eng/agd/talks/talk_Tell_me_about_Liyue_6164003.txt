Shiliu: Tell me about Liyue.
Shiliu: Ah, so you want to know about my hometown?
Shiliu: Liyue has the busiest commercial port in all of Teyvat. There's merchants from all over the world there. Hehe, growing up in a place like that, I knew I wanted to go into business from a very young age.
Shiliu: Have you heard of Lord Morax? The god who watches over Liyue?
Shiliu: At the very least, you should know that the Mora you have there is named after him!
Shiliu: Ah, I haven't been back in a long time. Maybe the reason I can't make any money is because I'm too far away from Lord Morax?
