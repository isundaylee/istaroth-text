Inoue: Traveler, what business do you have here? No outlanders are allowed to enter.

Traveler: Tell me about the headquarters of the Tenryou Commission...
Inoue: The headquarters of the Tenryou Commission is an important Shogunate facility. It maintains law and order across Inazuma, and executes every order from the Almighty Shogun.
Inoue: As such, it is my duty to interrogate every person coming in and out. Those who cannot explain their identity and intentions shall not enter.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
Inoue: Hmm? An outlander? I have never seen one. We rarely have outlanders coming in. I would have remembered, had I seen one.
Inoue: Please go to the Hanamizaka Police Station if you mean to lodge a report about a missing person.
