Nasir: You're here! Oh, you're not him...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you waiting for someone?
Nasir: Oh, yes. I am waiting for... um...
Nasir: I'm waiting for the boss lady's nephew. He can't really hold his alcohol, but he's pretty good at cards.
Nasir: I brought some nice booze to share with him, but he isn't in. What a pity.
Nasir: I was planning to have a look at... at that funky deck of his.
Nasir: *sigh* Why do people have to work? There's no time to eat, drink, and play with friends when you're working.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry if I bothered.
Nasir: Nah, it's fine. Guess I'll wait a little longer...

## Talk

Traveler: Maybe he's tied up.
Nasir: Probably. He does sometimes say "I'm not an idler, buddy." Then he would deal with the affairs of the hotel business.
Nasir: *sigh* Drinking alone is really not fun. Not to mention it's also a waste of the delicious grilled meat. Why don't you take it while it's still fresh?
Nasir: Find a friend to share this with. Don't be like me...
