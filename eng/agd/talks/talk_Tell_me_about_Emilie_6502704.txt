Traveler: Tell me about Emilie.
Calcagni: She moves much like perfume herself. You cannot reach her, nor can she be stopped.
Calcagni: She is not employed by this shop, nor does she work with any fixed brand.
Calcagni: But still, she remains the most famous perfume designer in Fontaine. The elegant, fashionable ladies of Fontaine would even give a precious gem for her perfume.
Calcagni: Too exaggerated for your ears?
Calcagni: Hmm... In that case, simply take it as if I added a "so I've heard" to that statement.
