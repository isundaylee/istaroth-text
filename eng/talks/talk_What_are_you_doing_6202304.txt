Traveler: What are you doing?
Linlang: Oh, I'm just taking a stroll nearby to relax. I'd like to admire the scenery one more time before the sun sets.
Linlang: This land has remained at peace for a thousand years now. But sometimes, I wonder — how did the people who walked this land a thousand years ago feel?
Linlang: I cannot know, yes, but our Lord certainly does — Rex Lapis, who has gently watched over this land for a millennium...
Linlang: ...I wonder, has there been anyone at all who has been privy to his feelings across this long period?
