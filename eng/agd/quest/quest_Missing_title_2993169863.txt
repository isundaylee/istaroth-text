## Talk 1

Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: ...Ah... Hero from a distant land...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Please, heed my words. I am the guiding night-raven, both a memory of our Lord of the Night's poetic musings... and merely one of a billion notions amidst the moonlight.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Incline your ear unto me, for the spirit river beneath the earth has been shattered, and I can only speak to you via this image, to urge you â€” beware the pitch-black foe.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: That broken mirror once beamed forth reflections bright. But now, dark smoke has gradually spread into three areas. Remember them well:
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: First, the east, where shadows have emerged from where they once hid, within the murals of legendary heroes.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: The west is second, where, upon a sea of mystery, darkness manifests, affecting a galling parody of the lord of deepest night.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Third lies beneath the cliffs, where a pale fog that should have dissipated now spreads as Cinder City stirs...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: O outlander hero, be wary... Tread lightly where our pitch-black enemy roams. Beware the all-corroding foe.

## Talk 2

Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Tread lightly where our pitch-black enemy roams. Beware the all-corroding foe.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Is there anything you wish to know, O outlander hero?
Traveler: Tell me about the murals with the heroes...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Find them in the east, within a cavern where glowing trees sway and flutter. There, just as storytellers holding their woven scrolls say, lies also a terror hidden in stories from the past.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Perhaps that shadow seeks to escape its imprisonment through those very stories...
Traveler: Tell me what lies atop the sea of mystery...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: To the west, an island lies obscured by fog. Once, it was a sacred ritual sanctuary, populated by those who made a pact with the Iktomisaurs long ago.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: But oozing filth emerged therein, and the holy site became a dark cesspit, sealed away and forgotten... Ah, but our cunning foe would never give up quite so easily...
Traveler: Tell me of the pale fog...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: That defiled fog was first created when the ancient city, Ochkanatlan, was destroyed. It should have been sealed away... But time and memory are against us...
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: If only... Alas... If only someone could dispel the pale fog once more...
Traveler: No, I don't need to know anything at the moment.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: Ah... Remember, remember... Be wary, be vigilant...

## Talk 3

Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: I can sense it, O outlander hero... I can sense all that you have done.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: A mighty feat indeed, O hero. The corroded power is now returned to the realm of Night, and I can hear the Nightsouls rejoice.
Will of the Mysterious Graffiti: ...Take these as your recompense, hero, for those who achieve greatness should not lack reward.
