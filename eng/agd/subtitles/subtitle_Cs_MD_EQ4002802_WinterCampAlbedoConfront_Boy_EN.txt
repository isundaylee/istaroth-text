My story...
Yes
I should have known
Master's failed specimen in the dragon's belly
This
Is where the story truly begins
If we switched places...
If you were the survivor...
Then, as the abandoned experiment
The failure of the Primordial Human Project...
I'd wanna replace you too
I would replicate your appearance
Study your alchemy
And create miraculous lifeforms
To divert your attention
I would wait for the right moment
Then dispose of you and the Traveler
The sole person to have known your secret
And then...
I could finally experience the joy
Of being brought into the world
