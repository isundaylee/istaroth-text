Traveler: Are young people so rare here?
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": They all left for Liyue Harbor. Young people always prefer somewhere a bit more exciting.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": I used to run a blacksmith's there â€” Hanfeng's Ironmongers. My apprentices would all have been around your age.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Personally, I don't like Liyue Harbor, though. All that hustle and bustle... I'm too old to work with iron now, so I thought I might as well head back to the countryside and help out where I can, while I still have strength in me.
