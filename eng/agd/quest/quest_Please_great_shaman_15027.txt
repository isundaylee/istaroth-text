# Please, great shaman!


## Talk 1

Paimon: Is this the place?
Citlali: No, further up.
Paimon: Further... up?

## Talk 2

Citlali: Oh, are you in the middle of a ceremony?
Caholom: Granny Itztli!?
Aywastin: Wh—What is she doing here?
Besuci: Did some coward not show up after challenging her to a fight?
Chogan: Or... is she here to officially take over the tribe?
Paimon: Whoa, it's like they really do see her as some kind of tyrant.
Caholom: No matter what, we'll defend our dignity as priests to the end!
Citlali: You talk a big game for someone who lost to me the most out of the entire priesthood.
Caholom: I...
Citlali: All I want is to ask some questions...
Aywastin: So, you're here to... interrogate us?
Besuci: Someone didn't sit pretty for their beating, is that it? You want their name, don't you?
Chogan: We should just run!
Traveler: Don't be afraid.
Paimon: Yeah! With the hero of Natlan here, Granny Itztli will be on her... best behavior!
Citlali: Sure, whatever you say.
Caholom: #Oh, it's Traveler and his companion... That does make me feel better. How can we help you?
Paimon: We wanted to ask about the technique you inherited from Huitzilin...
Aywastin: Heh, so you can eradicate our school once and for all?
Besuci: Disciples of our school have challenged her year after year, just as our master instructed. Sounds like she's finally had enough...
Citlali: Well, you're not wrong...
Chogan: If we want to protect our legacy, one of us needs to run!
Paimon: Not this again... Just how much did you traumatize them, Citlali?
Traveler: (She beat them in a duel. So what? There's no reason to be this terrified. Citlali is someone worthy of love and respect.)
Citlali: Hey! You can't just... say whatever you want just because it's in your head.
Citlali: I'm Granny Itztli — a mere mention of my name, and kids burst into tears. Love and respect? Heh, no one has the guts for that.
Traveler: (Well, I do.)
Citlali: Wh— You know what, forget about your duty. We really need to fix this mind-reading situation!
Caholom: Sorry to disappoint, but if you're here to question whether we're qualified to inherit our master's legacy, we... we're not going down without a fight!
Paimon: #We're not getting anywhere... What should we do, Traveler?
Traveler: Let me think...
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): !
Citlali: Huh? Oh, it's you...
Caholom: Elder Tlapo... We must have disturbed your meditation. Our deepest apologies. Please, forgive us.
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): ...
Aywastin: Did... Did Elder Tlapo just issue a declaration?
Besuci: From what I can tell... In a single word, the message was "friend"?
Chogan: Is Elder Tlapo telling us to... treat Granny Itztli as a friend?
Caholom: ...That's not possible, is it?
Biram: Oh, you forget yourselves, my friends. You are esteemed priests of our tribe. Where are your manners?
Caholom: Chief...
Biram: I didn't expect to see you here, Great Shaman. My sincere apologies for the lack of hospitality.
Citlali: ...Well, I wasn't exactly planning to come to this crowded place, so you can save the pleasantries, Chief. I'd rather get this over with.
Biram: Understood... Now, as successors of Huitzilin, I understand your friction with Granny Itztli.
Biram: However, Elder Tlapo's declarations have always showed us the correct path. You would do well to respect his counsel.
Biram: So, mind your manners and allow Granny Itztli to ask her questions.
Paimon: Phew... Good thing Elder Tlapo and Chief Biram are on our side.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hi there, Elder Tlapo!
Traveler: It's been a while.
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): !
Paimon: Hey, he seems pretty happy to see us!
Citlali: He's the one who put you in charge of the scroll, right?
Paimon: Yeah, Elder Tlapo appointed us to the task!
Citlali: Elder Tlapo, huh... He's still "Claw" to me.
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): ...
Citlali: Hey, don't pull that cutesy stuff with me. You're an Iktomisaur Elder now. You occupy an eminent and important position within the tribe.
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): ...
Paimon: So, you already know each other?
Citlali: Claw was only this big when we first met. He was Huitzilin's saurian companion back then. She kept dragging him to my place, so, over time, we got to know each other.
Traveler: Sounds like you and Huitzilin were close.
Citlali: She only came to my place to fight me. But, at the same time, she always claimed to be my friend. She was the only one who dared to try, at least.
Paimon: ...Well, you've lived a long time! You've probably made a bunch of friends over the years, right?
Citlali: The more time you have... the more friends you lose.
Paimon: Oh, um...
Citlali: Anyway, let's get back to business. I hate talking about the past.
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): ...
Citlali: Two hundred years, and you still haven't given up, Claw?
Tlapo (Elder Tlapo): ...
Citlali: #I still haven't made up my mind, so you should head back... Traveler, Paimon — let's go.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey there, Chief Biram!
Traveler: Hello, Biram.
Paimon: Oh, wait, we haven't reached out since the last time we failed the task, huh...
Biram: Haha, I'm just grateful you haven't forgotten that duty.
Paimon: Actually, we have good news! We found another clue.
Biram: I'm all ears.
Paimon: It's the Battle of Seven Colors!
Biram: Huitzilin's claim to fame? That sounds promising... But, the battle took place hundreds of years ago. An investigation is bound to be difficult.
Paimon: True, but Granny Itztli promised to help!
Biram: Is that so? I've tried seeking her help in the past, but I never managed to coax her out. You should cherish this opportunity.
Citlali: Hey, don't complain — none of the previous chiefs succeeded, either.
Biram: Ah, forgive me — that wasn't my intention. It was a comment on my own failings.
Citlali: Paimon said you've been trying to figure out how to weave the special scroll?
Biram: It is my duty, great shaman.
Citlali: Why bother? The scrolls always end up completed on time, so what's the point of figuring it out for yourself?
Biram: If I may, this task concerns the history of Natlan as a whole, and in many ways, history is the memory of a people.
Biram: Memory is sacred to our tribe. I'm sure a great shaman understands that better than a humble junior like myself. Something this important cannot be left to baseless rumors.
Biram: I know you don't concern yourself with the daily affairs of the tribe, Granny Itztli. Even so, as a priestess, I trust you wouldn't leave something like that to chance.
Citlali: I get your point...
Traveler: Something on your mind, Citlali?
Citlali: Of course, the one time I wish you could read my mind, it doesn't work...
Traveler: (The chief referred to himself as a "humble junior." Maybe Citlali's worried she looks old?)
Citlali: No, that's not it!
Paimon: Huh?
Citlali: #It's not important... Rest assured, Biram, with my help, Traveler and Paimon will definitely be able to complete the task.
Biram: You have my thanks, then.

## Talk 5

Caholom: ...
Caholom: So, are you here to test whether we're qualified to inherit Master Huitzilin's legacy?
Citlali: You've already been tested, haven't you? Frankly speaking, I don't think any of you are qualified.
Citlali: But, that's not why I'm here. All you need to do is be good and answer my questions.
Caholom: Fine... Ask away.
Citlali: You've heard of the Battle of Seven Colors, right?
Caholom: Of course! It's our master's claim to fame, an immortal legend inscribed in the very history of our tribe!
Citlali: Then, I'm sure you know there are those who question whether it actually occurred.
Aywastin: I did hear people arguing about that the other day...
Besuci: It's disgraceful! How can they question something like that?
Chogan: It doesn't surprise me. Natlan has had more tourism lately. A lot of people have started getting strange ideas after interacting with outlanders.
Chogan: After all, everyone who took part in the battle has returned to the Ley Lines. Without witnesses, it's hard to refute detractors.
Citlali: Well, it just so happens... the questions I want to ask are directly related to the legitimacy of this battle.
Caholom: Listen... We know you were rivals, but do you really have to question her legacy?
Citlali: You think she's like you — someone who can't survive a little scrutiny?
Caholom: No, of course not!
Citlali: Then, let me finish. During the battle, Huitzilin most likely used a technique powerful enough to turn the tides of war. I'm sure she was very proud of it.
Citlali: Proud enough to pass it on to her disciples. So, which one of you inherited that technique?
Caholom: Uh... I don't think any of us have heard of it.
Citlali: Listen, I'm not trying to take it for myself, so be honest! With or without it, I can wipe the floor with any of you.
Caholom: Yeah, no objections there... But, I'm telling the truth! None of us have ever heard of that technique.
Citlali: Tch, what's wrong with her? Why would she let it go extinct?
Caholom: Master's body of work is massive. No one student could hope to learn all her techniques... Mastering just a few already takes a lot of effort.
Caholom: Master had no choice but to recruit many students, split up what she knew into different portions, and pass it down through various individuals.
Caholom: So, even though we see ourselves as representatives of Huitzilin's school of shamanism, what we know isn't the sum of her legacy.
Caholom: Actually, I know of a shaman family that inherited some of master's techniques. The family fell on hard times and lost the right to the priesthood. Still, could be worth a shot...
Paimon: But, if they inherited Huitzilin's secret technique, shouldn't the family be thriving?
Caholom: Well, it's the only thing I can think of...
Citlali: ...Alright. Give me their address.
Caholom: I'll mark it out on your map.
Citlali: To be honest, I'm not optimistic about the future of this investigation.
Traveler: You're really giving it your all, though.
Citlali: That's because the request came from you. You don't know the power of your own words, do you?

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: You recount everything you learned to Montluson and the others.
Montluson: Proving the legitimacy of this battle seems more hopeless by the second.
Citlali: Nothing we can do about that.
Montluson: ...Well, even if our investigation ultimately proves the legend to be false, that's still a worthwhile result.
Montluson: Although I'm here for business purposes, I have a personal interest in this as well. I'm drawn to matters of historical truth.
Allier: That's exactly why I chose to follow you, Monsieur Montluson!
Citlali: Listen, I'm just updating you on the situation, not asking for your opinion. I don't really care whether you continue your investigation.
Montluson: Um...
Citlali: #Traveler, you came to me for help with your scroll-weaving duty, right?
Citlali: You thought looking into the Battle of Seven Colors could give you answers — that's understandable. But, based on our progress, I'd say this is a dead-end.
Citlali: Instead of wasting time, you might consider taking a different approach. I'll try to think of another way to help you.
Montluson: #Respected Traveler, let's not forget about the compensation I promised! You shall have it in full — extra, if that's what it takes!
Traveler: I think this investigation...
Citlali: What makes you say that?
Traveler: Because it has to do with Huitzilin's past.
Paimon: Yeah, based on what you've told us so far, it kinda seems like there's unresolved tension between you two.
Citlali: Y—You... think so?
Paimon: She claimed to be your friend, but picked fights with you nonstop... and never told you about her biggest accomplishment.
Paimon: By figuring out the truth behind the battle, maybe we can finally help you get closure!
Citlali: Closure? I'd say we're two hundred years too late... But, fine. If you want to keep investigating, be my guest.
Montluson: Ah, that's wonderful news!
Paimon: Alright, let's go visit the shaman family!
Traveler: Could help you, too, Citlali.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hello! Are you Etchemin?
Etchemin: Yep, that's me... Huh? Granny Itztli!?
Citlali: Get up... In a crowded market like this, the only person who should be trying to hide is me.
Etchemin: M—My apologies... Ever since my grandfather's generation, the shamans of my family have given up on passing your trial, Granny Itztli. Have we... offended you in some other capacity?
Paimon: Man, this is generational trauma at this point...
Etchemin: Whenever I misbehaved as a kid, Grandpa would tell me about the thrashing he received from Granny Itztli. I still get nightmares about it sometimes...
Traveler: (I wonder what Citlali looks like in those nightmares...)
Citlali: Hey, don't get any funny ideas! This was your idea, remember? Keep asking your questions. I'm going to find somewhere quiet to wait.
Paimon: Okay, so, your family studied under Huitzilin, right?
Etchemin: Yes, although that pretty much ended with my grandfather's generation, unfortunately.
Etchemin: The techniques my family learned from Huitzilin didn't have much practical use in terms of tribal affairs, so during my grandfather's time, we quit the priesthood.
Etchemin: Turns out, shaman techniques aren't that useful outside the priesthood, either. So, over time, we abandoned them altogether...
Etchemin: Of course, it's possible that we were just too foolish to understand the true power of those teachings...
Etchemin: After all, Huitzilin was a genius. None of her students have been able to fully reproduce her talent.
Paimon: Do you know which techniques were passed on to your family?
Etchemin: I'm not sure... As a kid, I remember hearing my grandfather talk about them, but it's not like I can use them myself.
Paimon: Just think about it for a sec... Do you remember anything about a technique that can decide the outcome of a battle?
Etchemin: Decide the outcome of a battle? No, I don't remember anything like that.
Etchemin: Besides, my family wasn't really known for our talent. If a technique like that exists, I doubt Huitzilin would pass it on to us.
Etchemin: You might have better luck asking one of the priests. They're descendants of Huitzilin's most gifted students.
Paimon: Well, looks like we're back where we started.
Montluson: Still no definitive evidence the Battle of Seven Colors took place... Allier, do you think we have enough to draw a conclusion?
Allier: All we have are non-witness accounts. We could put together an interview, but that's not going to hold up in academic circles.
Montluson: Then, we have to keep going...
Etchemin: Oh, you're investigating the Battle of Seven Colors?
Paimon: Yeah! You know about it?
Etchemin: Not a lot, but there's something special about my family — in addition to shaman techniques, Huitzilin's stories were passed down to us as well.
Etchemin: Say what you want about my ancestors' dedication to shamanism, but they definitely paid attention to those stories.
Etchemin: And of course, the Battle of Seven Colors is the most exciting story of them all.
Montluson: We don't need another story, we need something concrete! Does no one in your tribe understand that?
Etchemin: I'm not sure if this is helpful, but the story passed down in my family is a little different from the one told in the tribe.
Paimon: Really?
Traveler: How so?
Etchemin: Well, it's Huitzilin's personal account of the events, so it's a lot more detailed.
Etchemin: For example, in the version I heard, the battle took place in a location known as "Chicomostoc Cave."
Montluson: That means you can tell us where to find it! Have you ever been to this place?
Etchemin: Unfortunately not...
Allier: I studied maps of Natlan before we left, Monsieur Montluson. I don't remember ever seeing such a name...
Montluson: Hmm... Could your ancestors be mistaken, Mr. Etchemin?
Etchemin: It's unlikely. My family may have let the shamanism side of things fall by the wayside, but we're serious about these stories.
Etchemin: In the words of my grandfather... Some things deserve to be passed down more than secret arts.
Montluson: If Huitzilin's version of events differs so much from the general understanding, that makes it even more likely the battle is completely made-up...
Paimon: Yeah... That's disappointing.
Citlali: Hold on, you mentioned Chicomostoc Cave?
Etchemin: Oh, um, yes. Can I... clear something up for you?
Citlali: It's been more than two hundred years... I never thought I'd hear that name again.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Citlali: That location is now known as The Valley of Fog. Chicomostoc Cave is what it was called two hundred years ago.
Allier: Precisely when Huitzilin was alive! That means... Monsieur Montluson, we can confirm the original site of the battle!
Allier: Once we get there, the evidence we need should be at our fingertips...
Montluson: Haha... Just when we thought all hope was lost! I never doubted you, Great Shaman. Allow me to present you with a gift as thanks!
Citlali: Save it... Flattery won't get you anywhere with me.
Traveler: Just accept the gift, Citlali.
Paimon: Wait, Mr. Montluson works in publishing! You're a huge fan of light novels, right Citlali? Maybe he could get you some that are out of print?
Citlali: R—Really?
Montluson: Out of print, huh... Sure! Do you have any in mind?
Citlali: Well, if we're talking collectibles, then the first edition of "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power" is a must.
Citlali: It's the first major hit of the isekai genre. Several editions have gone to print, but copies of the first edition are exceedingly rare and valuable.
Montluson: I see...
Citlali: There's also its sister work, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?". It was Yae Publishing House's attempt at gauging the new market trends.
Citlali: It opened the door to a new genre after readers grew tired of isekais. The sales speak for themselves.
Citlali: Actually, Yae Publishing House released a limited edition not too long ago, but it's almost impossible to get. Anyway... I'll take those two.
Montluson: Sorry, I'm not sure I caught all that... What were the titles again? Reborn as... Kitsune Guuji?
Citlali: Hah! These two titles are among the most successful and well-known works in the entire industry. You're telling me, as someone who works in publishing, you've never heard of them?
Montluson: ...I'm a merchant from Fontaine, after all. Regarding this particular genre from Inazuma, I'm afraid I lack your level of expertise.
Citlali: Hah... Amateur.
Montluson: Um...
Traveler: Just leave the books to me.
Montluson: Of course — sounds like a perfect arrangement! Now, there's no time to waste. We should head to the site of the battle right away.
Allier: Once we get there, it'll take a bit more work to determine the actual location. Right now, all we have is a general idea.
Montluson: Well, I'm sure Miss Citlali can help us with that!
Citlali: Have you even looked at the time? It's already evening, and I have important plans tonight. You expect me to work through the night?
Montluson: #Um, well... What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: Let's break for the day and meet back up tomorrow.
Montluson: Okay, we'll find a place to rest for the night. When should we meet tomorrow?
Paimon: He's persistent, huh...
Traveler: What do you think, Citlali?
Citlali: Hmm... How about noon?
Montluson: Do we have to wait that long?
Citlali: Great shamans have important matters to attend to in the morning.
Traveler: (My guess is that she just wants to sleep in...)
Citlali: Th—That's only because I have important tasks to complete at night!
Montluson: Alright, as Miss Citlali instructed... Let's meet back up tomorrow at noon. We'll be waiting at the exit of the tribal settlement.
Traveler: The battlefield's not going anywhere.
Traveler: Don't forget about our pay, though.
Traveler: You've earned it.

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: Citlali leads you to a hot-air balloon.
Paimon: Whoa, this is like a secret base!
Citlali: Sometimes, I want the fresh air, but not the company, so I come here.
Citlali: Let's see if my stash is still here... Great, the Halberd-Crest Birds didn't eat my snacks.
Citlali: ...Now for the mind-reading issue. Give me your hand.
Traveler: Just like last time?
Citlali: It might take a little longer, actually. I just need to share my senses, make a clean break...
Citlali: And... that should do it, right?
Traveler: (This really is a one-of-a-kind view. That must be why Citlali likes to come here.)
Citlali: You're not wrong... Hold on! Why do I still hear you in my head?
Traveler: No idea...
Citlali: Did I not separate our senses completely? Maybe using my palm isn't enough... Close your eyes!
Citlali: (Please work! Please work! A great shaman should be able to handle this...)
Citlali: Okay, what about now?
Traveler: I think I heard something...
Citlali: Huh!? And now?
Traveler: It's gone.
Citlali: Huh, whenever I try to remove the effect, it just flips direction and gets worse...
Traveler: (Was that Citlali's forehead just now? It was really warm...)
Citlali: That was just to help with the spell... Shoot, I still hear you...
Citlali: ...For a human soul, to lose the boundaries of the mind is to drown in the sea of consciousness without a concept of self...
Paimon: Wait, that sounds bad!
Citlali: I read that in a light novel. When it comes to the real world, I think it's pretty accurate...
Paimon: Uh, is Citlali drunk? She's not making much sense...
Citlali: Anyway, we'll just have to leave it for now...
Paimon: #Hearing Traveler's thoughts isn't that bad, right? You should just tease him! That's what Paimon would do.
Citlali: It's just... I'm not good at this. I'm not used to being close to people.
Citlali: Sorry, I said we could be friends, but I guess I'm not ready.
Citlali: I'm used to being Granny Itztli — someone intimidating, someone people are scared to approach. I don't have to deal with people that way.
Traveler: Why live like that?
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon's been wondering... Why do you insist on living so far away? You could easily become a leader of your tribe, someone everyone loves and respects...
Citlali: When you live as long as me, a person is like a flower.
Citlali: The color draws you in. You water it to see it bloom. It rewards you with its fragrance...
Citlali: But, it doesn't last. With the passing of the seasons, everything withers away. You can try to water it, but it will never bloom again.
Citlali: Even if the same plot of soil is covered in flowers the following year, the one you remember won't be there.
Citlali: That's just how it is — most of the people in my life will be gone one day, just like a flower.
Citlali: Getting close means losing friend after friend for hundreds of years... until the weight of their memories crushes my soul.
Citlali: If people don't care about me, then I don't have to care about them. It's better if the people in my memories are nothing more than fleeting strangers.
Paimon: Citlali...
Traveler: My approach is different.
Citlali: You won't live as long as me, so you don't have to worry about that.
Traveler: Actually, I might have a long lifespan...
Citlali: Really?
Citlali: Then, you should understand.... Nearly everyone you know will be gone one day.
Traveler: All the more reason to remember them.
Citlali: #Traveler.
Traveler: (I have a friend who only lives in my memories now. In fact, you could say my memories are the sole proof that she existed in this world.)
Traveler: (So, sometimes I tell myself... As long as I remember every single friend, they will never truly die.)
Traveler: (Instead, they will live on in the world of my memories.)
Traveler: (When friends create memories together, there's always something to hold on to. So, if you still need time, let me choose to remember you first.)
Citlali: ...
Paimon: Is something wrong?
Citlali: Stupid mind-reading side-effect won't go away... It's not like I want to hear you complain about me all the time...
Paimon: Okay, she's definitely drunk... Uh, Citlali? Maybe take it easy. At this rate, you might sleep past noon tomorrow...
Citlali: #I'm not drunk... I remember everything Traveler said.
Citlali: Just gotta... think of a response... I'll think... of something...
Paimon: Uh oh, not this again... Is she asleep?
Citlali: I... I'm fine... can... get home... by myself...
Paimon: Is she talking in her sleep or talking to us? She seems kind of out of it...
Citlali: Bye... Gonna walk back... alone... Need some time... to think...
Traveler: She doesn't need us to worry about her.
Paimon: Alright...
Traveler: She's always been like this.
Traveler: I have some truly ancient memories...
Traveler: I choose to remember everyone.
Traveler: It sounded like your thoughts...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Montluson: Miss Citlali seems rather... reluctant to help. Maybe you could talk to her a bit more. I'll reward you for the trouble.

### Additional Talk 2

Allier: Natlan's history is full of intriguing mysteries. It's too bad I can't talk to those priests myself...

### Additional Talk 3

Grudoc: Got a problem? Like I said, take it up with my employer.

### Additional Talk 4

Caholom: Why does Granny Itztli want to question us all of a sudden?
Aywastin: Should we plan our answers in advance?
Besuci: That brutal "graduation exam"... It's all coming back to me...
Chogan: You heard the Chief... There's no running away.

### Additional Talk 5

Biram: If you run into any more problems, I'm always willing to help.

### Additional Talk 6

Caholom: I hope Granny Itztli's satisfied with the information we provided...

### Additional Talk 7

Aywastin: So... was that an interrogation?

### Additional Talk 8

Besuci: That poor coward... I should go find him and convince him to accept his fate.

### Additional Talk 9

Chogan: Ah... You scared me. I was just about to run some errands. If you have questions, feel free to ask the other priests.

### Additional Talk 10

Etchemin: Sorry, I just wanted to ask... Is Granny Itztli satisfied with my answer?
Paimon: Yeah, of course! You really helped us out!
Etchemin: Oh, good. I'm glad I didn't offend her somehow...
Paimon: You're really that scared of her?
Traveler: She's actually really nice.
Etchemin: To be honest, Granny Itztli almost never interacts with ordinary tribespeople like us. Everything we know about her comes from rumors.
Etchemin: She's a powerful shaman who's lived for over two hundred years. As a great hero, you're probably the only one who isn't intimidated by her.
Paimon: Well, thanks for today, Citlali!
Traveler: Wanna grab a meal? My treat!
Citlali: Hm, that's quite considerate of you. Alright, let's grab a few drinks, just like last time.
Paimon: Wait, didn't you say you had "important plans" tonight...?
Citlali: What did you think I meant?
Paimon: ...Does that mean you've gone drinking every night for the past two hundred years? Now, Paimon's worried about your health...
Traveler: Same place?
Citlali: No, I've had enough socializing for one day... I know somewhere quiet. We can just buy some drinks and head over.
Citlali: Which will also give us a chance to solve the mind-reading issue. Considering the necessary spell work, I'd rather do it in private.
Traveler: Think of it a thank you for today.
Traveler: She's just... awkward in social situations.
