# Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part II


## Talk 1

Azariq: Look, this is it!
Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...
Jeht: Hmph! This kind of scrap can be dug up everywhere in the desert. Why did you ask us to come here specifically? Are we gonna play at war inside or something?
Azariq: Be patient, little wildcat. This one's interior is in perfect condition! We can activate it and use it to cross those dangerous quicksand-filled areas!
Liloupar: Hmph... A tribesman who knows the inner workings of machinery? An eye-opener, to be sure.
Jeht: ...
Traveler: Azariq, how do you know how to activate it?
Azariq: The blueprints Aderfi left behind recorded the mechanical structure of this thing. It wasn't difficult to understand that structure with the basic knowledge that I have.
Azariq: Maybe those northerners from the snowy lands gave it to him in a trade... Who knows what he would've wanted this for, though...
Azariq: #C'mon, I'm here to help! {NICKNAME}, you're a knowledgeable sort. You must have seen this sort of machine before, right?
Traveler: It does look fascinating, but I can't say I understand how it works...
Paimon: Yeah, we've seen lots of Ruin Guards before, but an iron ball of this sort and size... Hmm, Paimon really has no idea what it would be for.
Jeht: I've seen similar machines in the desert before as well. But this is the first time I've seen one that's this intact.
Azariq: Huh... Interesting. Let's just go in through its arm first, shall we?
Traveler: Jeht, what's on your mind?
Jeht: Azariq, you knew all these things... But you never once told me about them.
Azariq: *sigh* Don't get mad at me, little wildcat.
Azariq: Relax. You know I won't hide anything from you! I'll tell you the full story once this journey is over.
Jeht: ...

Azariq: #C'mon, I'm here to help! {NICKNAME}, you're a knowledgeable sort. You must have seen this sort of machine before, right?
Traveler: We've seen one in the rainforest before.
Paimon: Ah, you mean that giant iron mountain! And we even studied it with Ararycan and Jazari, didn't we?
Jeht: I've seen similar machines in the desert before as well. But this is the first time I've seen one that's this intact.
Jeht: Dad once said that these are war machines left over from 500 years ago... I can't help but wonder what actually happened in that era...
Paimon: But this big guy seems... a little different from the one we saw before.
Azariq: Huh... Interesting. Let's just go in through its arm first, shall we?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...

Jeht: ...
Azariq: #C'mon, I'm here to help! {NICKNAME}, you're a knowledgeable sort. You must have seen this sort of machine before, right?
Traveler: It's a war machine left by the people of Dahri.
Jeht: I've seen some machines like this in the desert before, but they're not quite the same... This is the first time I've seen one so complete.
Jeht: Dad also once said that these are war machines left over from 500 years ago... I can't help but wonder what actually happened in that era...
Azariq: From 500 years ago? Interesting... Almost all records of that period have been destroyed, insofar as I've read.
Traveler: You could put it like that...
Traveler: It's a long story...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon can't quite explain it... Anyway, it was a long, long time ago!
Paimon: Come to think of it, this big guy does look different from the one we saw before.
Azariq: Huh... Interesting. Let's just go in through its arm first, shall we?

## Talk 4

Azariq: If the blueprint is correct, the generator room should be down there. We need to activate the power system first before we can activate this big guy.
Azariq: #{NICKNAME}, sorry to trouble you again. After confirming that the energy system has been activated, let's all head to the control cabin.

## Talk 5

Azariq: *huff* Let me see... Energy system, looks fine; engine, fine; weapons... the long-range sub-weapon is out of order, the main one isn't functioning normally; melee weapons and left arm, working...
Azariq: Hmm, it all looks pretty good, to be honest!
Jeht: ...
Paimon: Hey, Jeht, what's wrong? You look like something's on your mind...
Jeht: N—No, it's nothing... It's just that I didn't get even half of what he said just now...
Jeht: Azariq feels like a different person. I've never seen him like this before...
Azariq: What? I've become more reliable, haven't I? Hahaha.
Jeht: ...
Azariq: Autopilot... autopilot... Hmm, looks like it's been dismantled. Can't find that device at all...
Azariq: Sorry, it seems that we'll have to operate this big guy by ourselves.
Traveler: You mean I have to, don't you?
Liloupar: Worry not, my master. I shall guide you from the side.
Azariq: Oh, so you know the way?
Liloupar: Of course I do. I can sense the vibrations of my fragments, after all.
Azariq: Well, guess we'll be troubling you to show us the way, then. Let's start this machine in the meantime, shall we?
Traveler: On my way.
Paimon: Whoaaa!
Traveler: Steady yourselves!
Traveler: Where are we heading?

## Talk 6

Azariq: It's incredible to think that such a giant thing can even move...
Azariq: #What's the matter, {NICKNAME}? According to the blueprint, the generator room should be right down there. We must activate its energy system first, and I'll leave that to you.

## Talk 7

Azariq: Ugh... If only Aderfi were here...
Jeht: He's a traitor to the tribe.
Azariq: But he was also the only one who could figure out how this thing works.
Azariq: Please allow me some time to focus here... Aderfi did leave those blueprints behind... I just need to recall what those illustrations looked like.
Traveler: With an arm so massive, the amount of energy it consumes must be absurd...
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon wonders how much stuff it has to eat to work normally... Hmm. Maybe it can't move anymore because it's been hungry for too long!
Azariq: There should be a backup power source for the weapon system on each side of the control cabin.
Azariq: The imitations they made all had this structure, so perhaps this old one will be no exception either.
Liloupar: "They"? Who's "they"?
Azariq: You are interested in your own fragments, and Jeht is interested in the Eternal Oasis. Never mind who "they" are for now, would you?
Liloupar: Fair enough. I shall ask again later.
Jeht: ...
Azariq: ...Sorry, Jeht. I know I'm being a bit impatient...
Traveler: Could it be "protective interruption"?
Paimon: Hey, that could be it! Still, how do you know this kind of stuff, anyway...

## Talk 8

Azariq: What's the matter? Can't find the backup power sources?
Azariq: They should be somewhere on either side of the control cabin. Once you find one of the mechanisms, trigger it and the energy system should reactivate.
Azariq: I certainly hope that the blueprint Aderfi left behind is reliable enough...

## Talk 9

Azariq: Now you just need to operate it to open the passage.
Traveler: And why don't you operate it yourself?
Azariq: W—Well... There are just some things that have more... ceremony, when you do them.

## Talk 10

Azariq: Whoa...! *huff* Did anyone fall and hurt themselves?
Jeht: #{NICKNAME}! Are you alright?
Traveler: I'm okay.
Paimon: Whew, guess none of us were hurt then!
Azariq: We can enter that opening through the passage inside the arm now.
Azariq: We should leave some people here to stand guard while the rest of us move on.
Jeht: Wait, don't you care about the "taboo" anymore?
Azariq: Eh, I care more about your safety.
Liloupar: ...
Traveler: Almost bumped my head...

## Talk 11

Jeht: Hmm... The gate here is closed, and there seems to be no other way.
Azariq: There may be clues to open the gate around here. Let's all keep our eyes peeled.

## Talk 12

Azariq: Looks like we'll need to open that gate up there next. As per our previous experience, the pipelines here will probably have to be connected to let the quicksand drive the gate.
Jeht: But the mechanisms next to the pipes seem completely broken...
Azariq: Then we can only see if there's any way to connect the pipes in other places. Hmm... The pipes are supposed to connect the two sides, right? If the mechanism that controls the gate is on one side, then the other side...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon thinks it should lead to that room over there!
Azariq: Alright, let's go and see what's in there first.

## Talk 13

Azariq: Well? Do you want to explore here some more or go back to that big iron ball?
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go back.
Azariq: Alright! Jeht, time to go!
Traveler: I'd like to explore here some more.
Azariq: *sigh* Oh, the curiosity... But, as you wish.

## Talk 14

Black Screen Text: As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
Black Screen Text: Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a ravenous shepherd boy and a bright red pomegranate...\nYou see the pomegranate juice flowing freely, like the wine of tyrants, the infatuation of lovers, and the fresh blood of innocent victims...\nYou see the plump pomegranate being handed to the shepherd boy...
Black Screen Text: "Take a bite and use it to quench your thirst. But be careful not to let it burst in your hands..."
Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, are you okay...?
Paimon: You suddenly froze up again, and you wouldn't respond to anyone... You really scared us there!
Liloupar: #Do not fret, {M#he}{F#she} is fine.
Traveler: Don't worry, Jeht. I just zoned out for a bit.
Paimon: Phew, okay... Stop scaring us like that, though!
Liloupar: My apologies if my troubled memories bothered you. But thanks to your help, my power has been restored... partly, in any case.
Liloupar: Pomegranates... Ah, pomegranates... The sweet fruit made from the congealed blood of the victimized... Should I have the chance to share it with you, my master, I surely will.
Liloupar: How I desire to see the plump arils burst between your teeth, and how the rich juice overflows from your lips...
Paimon: Uh... That does sound delicious, but Paimon doesn't think she's talking about fruit...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Ahem, we should go. There're still many mechanisms waiting for us ahead.
Liloupar: Now, now, little girl, are you sulking again?
Jeht: I'm not! I just said we should go!
Azariq: Careful, the little wildcat is about to bite.
Jeht: ...!
Traveler: Don't worry, Paimon. I'll be fine.
Paimon: Ugh, fine, if you say so! Jeht was also really worried about you, you know?

## Talk 15

Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, have you found anything?
Paimon: Not yet! What about you?
Traveler: Have you found anything?
Jeht: Not really... But I think we just need to move along the walls as we search.
Traveler: About Azariq...
Jeht: ...What about him?
Jeht: Well... I know you may have doubts about him, but he's Matriarch Babel's most trusted subordinate, so it does us no good being suspicious all the time.
Jeht: That said, he does know a little too much, which makes me uneasy... But that's just a gut feeling, you know?
Liloupar: Ah, but intuition can be quite accurate sometimes...

## Talk 16

Jeht: Alright... Now it looks like there's only one passage left for us to open.
Paimon: What!? There's more!? Paimon's legs are already sore!
Jeht: Oh? And you know this because you walk on your own two feet?
Paimon: #Uh... Nah! Paimon was just, uh, speaking for {NICKNAME}! Yeah! Y—You must be tired, right?
Traveler: Not really.
Jeht: #Haha, {NICKNAME} is a veteran adventurer after all. You'd better exercise more, or {M#he'll}{F#she'll} leave you behind sooner or later.
Paimon: #N—No way! {NICKNAME} will definitely wait for Paimon, no matter what...
Liloupar: Hmm... My memory is gradually coming together. I can now guide you to the next location.
Traveler: Ooh, I'm beat. Super beat.
Paimon: #See? What did Paimon tell you? We've walked for so long that even {NICKNAME}'s tired!
Jeht: #Hahaha! {M#He}{F#She} was just messing with you. This much walking is hardly a challenge for a veteran adventurer, you know?
Jeht: But if you're really so tired, Paimon, why don't you let me carry you around? Hehehe.
Paimon: N—No need! That would just be embarrassing...

## Talk 17

Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, are we leaving now?
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go.
Jeht: Alright! Azariq, time to go!
Traveler: I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Jeht: Please be careful. We'll wait for you here.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Azariq: There should be a mechanism around here that can help open the gate. Let's all keep our eyes peeled.
Traveler: You sure are knowledgeable, Azariq.
Azariq: It's completely normal. Like I said, I have many friends on the outside and I've learned a lot from them... Don't you underestimate us tribespeople, alright?
Traveler: Have you found anything?
Azariq: Hmm... If I were you, I'd start from those pipelines. After all, that's the one thing we've no shortage of.

### Additional Talk 2

Azariq: Look, this is it!
Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...
Jeht: Hmph! This kind of scrap can be dug up everywhere in the desert. Why did you ask us to come here specifically? Are we gonna play at war inside or something?
