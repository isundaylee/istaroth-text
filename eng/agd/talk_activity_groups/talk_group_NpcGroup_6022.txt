Yantasar: Welcome to Xocolatl Beverages! Be prepared for a taste of the extraordinary!

## Talk

Traveler: Extraordinary?
Yantasar: Freshly squeezed with the finest fruits and balanced with the most mysterious spices for the richest flavor you could possibly conceive of!
Yantasar: And once you've tasted it, there's no going back! You'll feel like you've had all the world's blessings bestowed upon you by the Wayob, as light as a Qucusaurus feather floating up into the clouds...

## Talk

Traveler: Maybe later...
Yantasar: Don't forget to come back!

## Talk

Traveler: That sound kinda weird...
Yantasar: That's because being "weird" is precisely our selling point! I don't know about visitors from other places, but us Natlan natives go in for that kind of thing.
Yantasar: Maybe it's the part about blessings from the Wayob and all that. Sounds pretty tempting, huh?
Yantasar: To tell you the honest truth... there's actually nothing special about these drinks. But people walk away feeling like they're on cloud nine!
Yantasar: But there's nothing to knock about the drinks themselves. Our ingredients are high quality, and very healthy too.

Traveler: Do we have anything more ordinary around here?
Yantasar: ...
Yantasar: ...
Yantasar: Sorry. I was silent for a long time just now, wasn't I? I just... couldn't really imagine what an ordinary drink would look like.
Yantasar: Does... soup count as a drink? Here's one I made with an ordinary recipe. It should be fine, right?
