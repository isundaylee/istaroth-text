# Anna the Adventurer!


## Talk 1

Anna: Alright. Let's work hard today, too!
Traveler: Haha, you're all fired up.
Anna: Of course! Being an adventurer is really interesting!
Anna: Well... I still am a bit unfamiliar with what to do while undertaking commissions, though.
Anna: Traveler, would you mind coming with me again? I still have things I'd like to ask you.
Anna: Then let's set out. Today's commission is...
Anna: Huh... So we're escorting... another transport balloon.
Traveler: Want me to come along?
Anna: Would you? Hehe, sure! There's still so much I could learn from you.

## Talk 2

Anna: And we're done! Thanks, Traveler. This went pretty well, I think.
Anna: But is this the usual fare for adventurers?
Traveler: There will be others.
Anna: What's with that hapless tone...
Anna: Is that so... Nice! I'll keep working at it, then!
Anna: Once I've saved up enough Mora, I'll bring my brother and our parents out on a trip!
Anna: My brother always wanted to travel... But I fell ill, and he had to stay back to take care of me.
Anna: But I'm well now, and I've even become an adventurer.
Anna: Hehe. When the time comes, I'll help my brother fulfill some of his dreams too!
Traveler: You'll understand in time...
Anna: Hey, not that tired look...

## Talk 3

Anthony: Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
Traveler: Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
Anthony: ...
Anthony: I respect my sister's wishes.
Anthony: Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams.
Anthony: As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
Anthony: That's all I have to say.
