Clorinde (Game Master): Your search for the legendary treasure has led you to a nervous merchant. She seems guarded. Questioning her could be tough...
Navia: ...Can I use Persuasion on her?
Clorinde (Game Master): ...You convince her to show you the way. But suddenly, a vicious Sternshield Crab appears to block your path.
Navia: ...Can I use Persuasion on it?
Clorinde (Game Master): ...Following a tip from the Armored Crab, you at long last find the treasure, but standing guard above it is a cold and unforgiving Cryo Regisvine...
Navia: ...Can I use Persuasion on it!?
Furina: Wait, wait, wait! Surely you can't use Persuasion on plants!?
Navia: Yeah, I can! I got "Speak with Plants" now. And look at that â€” a natural 20!
Clorinde: ...Fine. The Cryo Regisvine sheepishly burrows back into the ground. The treasure is all yours.
Lyney: Get together with your friends. Adventure awaits!
Lynette: ...Join Tabletop Troupe today.
