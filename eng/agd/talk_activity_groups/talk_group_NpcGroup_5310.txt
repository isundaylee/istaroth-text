Xana: If you've got shiny stuff, come exchange them with Xana!

## Talk

Traveler: And what can we exchange them for?
Xana: Well, all this stuff here! If you see anything you like, just tell me!

## Talk

Traveler: Shiny stuff?
Xana: That's right. Shiny components just like this one!
Xana: As long as we've got enough of them, we might be able to create a super giant mega machine, one even larger than Elynas. Ooh, just thinking about it gets me all excited!
Xana: Sometimes, I'd go out of the village to collect little things that aren't shiny yet, and I would find ways to make them shiny!
Xana: Whatever the case, the more shiny stuff, the better! Like I said, if you've got some, you can exchange them here at Xana's!

Traveler: Huh, I haven't seen you around before...
Xana: Hmm? Oh, if you're talking about where I was then, I was at the Fontaine Research Institute â€” there's nowhere better to go if you want to learn how to make awesome clockwork meka!
Xana: There's a super cool, super huge machine there too... but one day, I will make something larger still!

Traveler: See you.
Xana: See you. Remember to come by again!
