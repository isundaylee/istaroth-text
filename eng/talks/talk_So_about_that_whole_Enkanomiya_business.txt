Traveler: So, about that whole Enkanomiya business...
Tsuyuko: Her Excellency the Divine Priestess has yet to authorize our request to open Enkanomiya. We'll just have to wait for her to make the call.
Tsuyuko: In any case, our primary task right now is the restoration of the peoples' lives... More long term plans will have to wait for a while.
Tsuyuko: Still, I can't say I'm not excited to find out what our ancestral lands deep beneath the ocean waves looks like.
Tsuyuko: In any case, the conclusion of this matter was thanks to your help as well. Allow me to express our gratitude once again.
