# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Xilonen: What I really want is to do absolutely nothing.
Xilonen: I don't usually get a chance to relax in a place where nobody can find me, so I might as well take advantage of the opportunity.
Xilonen: We can space out together. I'll teach you some tips on how to get in the zone.
Traveler: There are tips for that!?
Xilonen: Of course. The point of spacing out is to completely clear your mind. Then, you can separate mind from body and achieve a state of pure serenity.
Traveler: Sounds like some kind of ceremonial meditation from the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Xilonen: Well, I did learn a few things about meditation from Citlali.
Xilonen: There's a whole "communicate will all living things" part, but I don't have the talent or the patience for that. I was more invested in achieving inner peace.
Xilonen: Anyway, it's really not that complicated. Just do as I do.
Xilonen: First, focus your eyes on a random point in front of you... somewhere that feels comfortable.
Xilonen: Next, relax the forehead... then the shoulders. Keep your eyes fixated on that point. Focus on its location in space...
Xilonen: Now, exhale... And... Relax...
Xilonen: ... *snore*... *snore*...
Traveler: "Doing nothing" is more profound than I thought...
Xilonen: Of course. Just ask Ororon or Citlali â€” a lot of people in their tribe study the art of meditation.
Xilonen: Spacing out really isn't that different. Just like meditation, you need to clear your mind and calm your heart.
Xilonen: In the Masters of the Night-Wind, meditation is usually accompanied by some sort of action. Lucky for us, spacing out means doing absolutely nothing.
