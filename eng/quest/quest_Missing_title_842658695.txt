## Talk 1

Sumac: We meet again! How have you been?
Traveler: Not bad. You?
Sumac: Things have been pretty good lately! It was only after I came here that I realized I wasn't doing too badly in the first place. Everyone's so kind, and they've given me loads of helpful advice and encouragement.
Sumac: Hehe, seems like leaving my hometown had its silver lining after all!
Traveler: We've had some slight hitches...
Sumac: Ah, I see... Well, I wish I could give you some advice, but the truth is, you've seen far more of the world than I have, so I don't think it would help.
Sumac: Maybe you should just put aside your worries for now and have some fun. Like getting something nice to eat, a dip in a hot spring, and a good night's sleep!
Sumac: Your problems will still be there when you wake up, sure, but at least you'll face them full of energy, right?
Traveler: Anyway, about what happened before...
Sumac: I hadn't expected this many twists in the tale... In the end, it's hard to say who was right and who was wrong. Perhaps things were more complicated than I thought.
Traveler: Maybe everyone was at fault, but not completely.
Sumac: It's very hard to say. *sigh* Perhaps I'd be better off if I just stopped thinking about it. Oh, and by the way... Mr. Tenehua came looking for me earlier, so I just told him everything as it was. Would that have helped?
Sumac: As I see it, you're the one who deserves the credit here. But you must be used to running around like this, right? Anyway, take these — I'm sure they'll come in handy!
Traveler: Let's chat again sometime.
Sumac: Alright then, take care!

## Talk 2

Hampeq: If I had tried another way...
Traveler: About the Hawkwings...
Hampeq: We'd already been scattered like grains of sand, but now... Well, why bring it up again? You might as well just see it as having ceased to exist... In fact, it has indeed ceased to exist.
Hampeq: I wanted to protect it, even if it meant resorting to a few underhand tricks — that was how much it meant to me. Little did I know, however, that it was precisely this that brought about our downfall...
Traveler: About the Locusts...
Hampeq: You're not here to taunt me, are you?
Hampeq: Of course, in a minor sense, they've been affected too. But that counts for nothing compared to what I've been through.
Hampeq: Perhaps I should just be a better loser and leave this place as soon as I can...
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Hampeq: Goodbye...
