## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Hinterman: I'm sorry. I was busy with my fish stall, so if there was, I didn't notice.

## Talk

Hinterman: I have all sorts of fish here. What would you like?

## Talk

Traveler: Let's have a look.
Hinterman: Please do.

## Talk

Traveler: What is this place?
Hinterman: Welcome to Poisson, a little place for us fishermen.
Hinterman: The sights here aren't as grand as you'll see in the city, but everyone here lives a leisurely life.
Hinterman: Ah, yes. I should probably mention that the terrain here can be quite slippery, so if you're here to travel, do watch your step.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm fine for now.
Hinterman: Take care, then.

## Talk

Hinterman: Oh my, aren't you the Boss's friend? Welcome!

## Talk

Traveler: Could I buy some fish?
Hinterman: Oh, so you're really here to do that? Well, in that case, please go ahead.

## Talk

Traveler: How are things in town?
Hinterman: Normal, ever-constant, just like our lady Navia's burning passion.
Hinterman: Thanks for your concern, though, and if you should meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright?

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Hinterman: Sure. Thanks for your help!

## Talk

Hinterman: Isn't this the Boss's friend? Things haven't been so good around Poisson recently. I know you're not from around here, but I wouldn't recommend tarrying.

## Talk

Traveler: It's that bad, huh?
Hinterman: *sigh* The water rises quickly and recedes quickly. While it seems to be subsiding now, you never know when it'll be back.

## Talk

Traveler: Take care.
Hinterman: Yes, I will.
Hinterman: But someone's gotta be on guard here at all times. We can't let some random person wander in here again by accident and get themselves killed.

## Talk

Hinterman: Oh! Isn't this the Boss's friend? Welcome! Though things haven't been so good around Poisson recently, which may inconvenience you.

## Talk

Traveler: What's going on?
Hinterman: Boss said that the crisis in the "prophecy" had passed, so loads of people came back to town. We're all pitching in, so reconstruction is coming along nicely.
Hinterman: It's still a little chaotic though, and people can hurt themselves if they're not careful. That's why I'm on guard here, to stop any outsiders from wandering in by accident.

## Talk

Traveler: It's fine. I'm here to look around.
Hinterman: Well... just watch your step. You don't want to get hurt.

## Talk

Hinterman: Oh my, aren't you the Boss's friend? Welcome!

## Talk

Traveler: Could I buy some fish?
Hinterman: Oh, so you're really here for that? Well, in that case, please go ahead.

## Talk

Traveler: How are things in town?
Hinterman: It's steadily improving. Most residents have gone back to their everyday lives.
Hinterman: Thanks for your concern, though if you meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright? She's gone through a lot, she has.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Hinterman: Sure, and thanks!
