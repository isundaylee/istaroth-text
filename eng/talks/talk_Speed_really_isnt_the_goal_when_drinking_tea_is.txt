Traveler: Speed really isn't the goal when drinking tea, is it?
Hermanson: I've been doing business in Yilong Wharf for a decade, and I realized something...
Hermanson: Not everyone knows how to appreciate tea. Some aren't particular about the flavor.
Hermanson: It's unrealistic to ask them to spend a ton of time studying how to properly make the stuff. They'd find the step you need to wash the residue troublesome alone, to say nothing of the whole process.
Hermanson: My tea bags are only for those who're looking for a quick cup. The traditionalists can still make tea the old-fashioned way. No one will be hurt!
