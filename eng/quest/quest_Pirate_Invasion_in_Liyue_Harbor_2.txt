# Pirate Invasion, in Liyue Harbor!


## Talk 1

Little Meng: Lulu, how come I'm the captain again?
Little Lulu: Because it's way more fun when you're the captain.
Little Fei: Well, as long as Lulu's happy... then I'm fine with it.
Traveler: What are you doing?
Little Lulu: We're playing a game!
Little Lulu: Meng is the captain, Fei is first mate and I'm a rich merchant.
Little Lulu: All we're missing is the pirate. The pirate's supposed to come and rob us.
Little Lulu: You can be the pirate if you wanna play with us?
Traveler: ...Ahoy, me hearties!
Little Lulu: Yay!
Little Lulu: Okay, come and let us know when you're ready.
Traveler: I wanna be one of the good guys...
Little Lulu: It's just a game! Don't worry, I know you're a good person in real life.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'm ready.
Little Lulu: Woohoo! We're starting!
Little Lulu: You have to start.
Unknown NPC (): Avast ye! I be here to rob yer!
Little Meng: Hah! In broad daylight? Good luck, the Millelith men are right there watching!
Little Fei: Lulu, come quickly! We must escape...
Little Lulu: Hello Mr. Pirate. What are you here to rob?
Unknown NPC (): Er... Mora? ...Ar!
Little Lulu: But I don't have much Mora...
Little Lulu: Daddy says that on a boat, the most valuable thing is the merchants' goods.
Little Lulu: How about this. Why don't you go and find some valuable things to use in the game?
Little Lulu: Then we'll have goods for you to try and steal!
Little Lulu: Hmm... Lotus Heads will do.
Little Lulu: We three all love eating Lotus Heads. If you're being a naughty pirate, the naughtiest thing you could do is steal our favorite food!
Unknown NPC (): You, me pretty little lassie!
Little Lulu: Erm, even though we know it's just a game, we still need to be careful...
Little Lulu: See? The Millelith men are all looking at us now.

## Talk 3

Little Lulu: Have you found the Lotus Heads yet?
Traveler: Got them.
Little Lulu: Yay!
Little Lulu: Meng! Fei! Come and eat these Lotus Heads with me!
Paimon: Hey! Paimon thought we were supposed to be robbing you?
Little Lulu: Oh, yeah... Well here you are, take this Mora and stuff.
Little Lulu: You're really great at playing a pirate. Not everyone has what it takes to steal all this stuff from a little kid.
Paimon: Paimon has a feeling that this kid is subtly mocking us...
Little Lulu: Thanks for your help and it was fun playing with you. Please play with us again soon!
