## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Hanamizaka bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices regarding all sorts of matters will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: Former Tenryou Commissioner Kujou Takayuki has presently been relieved from his post. He faces charges of dereliction, corruption, endangering the nation and its people, among others, and is awaiting judgment.
Bulletin Board: Due to his age and in consideration of his accomplishments, he has been confined to his quarters indefinitely, and will not be released on bail.
Bulletin Board: If he commits any other offenses, he will be punished with extreme prejudice and without clemency.
Bulletin Board: While the Tenryou Commission discusses matters of reformation, its duties shall be performed by a personal deputy of Her Excellency.
Bulletin Board: There will be no adjustment in Doushin and Yoriki ranks. Overall command has been ceded to Madam Kujou Sara.

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! I think the entrance to Hanamizaka is a good spot for a sumo duel! Where are you!?"
Bulletin Board: "Put all that military and governance stuff aside for a day, and let's have a good match! Or did you leave your samurai honor on the battlefield where you dropped it?"
Bulletin Board: "Huh. Come to think of it, I haven't seen a single public sumo match held on any street ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect."
Bulletin Board: "Madam Kujou Sara, please assent to Mr. Arataki's challenge for once! This might be out of line, but we too would like to witness your might!"
Bulletin Board: Dear citizens, please do not join hands with those who harass public officials and vandalize public property!
Bulletin Board: Madam Kujou Sara has given us repeated assurances that she has nothing to do with this person!

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: I'm searching for my husband, Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou. He is a tall man without any facial hair and has a scar on the side of his forehead. He has yet to return home despite the ceasefire.
Bulletin Board: If any returning samurai or old friends and acquaintances know of his whereabouts, please inform me. You will be duly thanked for your help!
Bulletin Board: Yours Respectfully, Inaba Shizuko.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: We urge all citizens to remain calm. The Tenryou Commission's stability and its management of Tenshukaku's defense are now in Madam Kujou Sara's capable hands.
Bulletin Board: Rest assured that Kujou Takayuki's militant brutality, forced seizure of Visions, and suppression of the citizenry is now being reversed post-haste!

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: "Due to recent peace treaty between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya, the supply of Jade Steel has ceased."
Bulletin Board: "There will still be many days ahead, and government policy may yet be adjusted..."
Bulletin Board: "Please wait a while longer if you have any need for Jade Steel weapon restoration or forging."
Bulletin Board: "I, Amenoma Tougo, sincerely apologize, and wish for your understanding."

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: "Bantan Sango: We'll investigate anything on your behalf!"
Bulletin Board: "Missing persons, missing pets, marital investigations, criminal investigations, commercial commissions, delivery services, procurement services..."
Bulletin Board: "Just make us a suitable offer, and we'll even capture the likes of bandit chiefs Zenigata or Domeki for you!"
Bulletin Board: "Oh, and by the way, do not believe that Heizou person who calls himself a 'detective'! He's a liar and a charlatan!"
Bulletin Board: "Is this what they call intra-service rivalry?"
Bulletin Board: "We're not competitors — we're not even in the same line of work!"

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "Konda Village has a large dye field that is presently in need of re-cultivation, and we are short of manpower to accomplish this task. As such, I'd like to ask for some help from some youngsters from the city."
Bulletin Board: "Our village is far from rich, but as long as you're willing to work, I, Konda Densuke, promise that you will be well compensated!"
Bulletin Board: "Those of you with families can bring them here to Konda Village. Food and board will be provided by us, all the better to make the village thrive more!"
Bulletin Board: "Chief, wouldn't it be better just to do some paid tourism or something rather than make advertisements like this one?"
Bulletin Board: "Oh, shut it with your crazy ideas! We're not taking anyone's Mora!"

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: Returning, demobilized samurai can report to the Yashiro Commission estates to receive subsidies and indicate their preferred avenues of future employment.
Bulletin Board: Additionally, the Grand Narukami Shrine will hold sharing sessions for samurai who took part in the war and their families to help heal the traumas caused by the war.

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: "Seirai Island is being plagued by pirates once more, and the Yashiro Commissioner's reconstruction proposals have been delayed time and time again by the war..."
Bulletin Board: "Thankfully, a ceasefire has been signed. Perhaps now the Asase Shrine there can finally be refurbished."
Bulletin Board: "It's just that it's been several hundred years now. Who knows how many of the descendants of Seirai Island's inhabitants still have some impression of their homeland..."

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: Their Excellencies, the Almighty Ogosho and Watatsumi's Divine Priestess, both express their deep grief at the many tragedies that occurred at Tatarasuna and on Yashiori Island.
Bulletin Board: From this day forth, the Shogunate and Sangonomiya will begin reconstruction and redevelopment work in these lands in partnership with one another.
Bulletin Board: Together, we will pacify this war-torn land, bring the guilty to justice, and restore Inazuma's prosperity.
Bulletin Board: All the more must we follow the divine wisdom of Her Excellency the Shogun, acting as one to accomplish the great cause of Eternity.

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "The Kiminami Restaurant will only serve the freshest and most authentic Inazuma cuisine!"
Bulletin Board: "Anyone ordering take-out will be greeted with Miss. Anna's smile!"
Bulletin Board: "May a sweet smile bring you a beautiful day!"
Bulletin Board: "She's just forcing herself to smile to bring in more business, isn't she..."

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: "If any citizen discovers Ms. Yoimiya setting off restricted fireworks inside the city, please try to stop her!"
Bulletin Board: "...Or reprimand her, at least. Do not indulge her!"
Bulletin Board: "Alternatively, please refrain from accepting the fireworks she gives out. That will do as well!"
Bulletin Board: "The Fire Brigade hereby urges everyone to pay special attention. Thank you very much!"

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: "Though this is not a serious matter, I still hope that it will become more common knowledge."
Bulletin Board: "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous 'Toki Alley Tales,' written by Takizawa Kyouden."
Bulletin Board: "Though it's nothing major, Lady Yae still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
Bulletin Board: "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
Bulletin Board: "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: The signed hardcopy edition of "A Legend of Sword" by Liyue's best-selling author, Zhenyu, is flying right off the shelves!
Bulletin Board: Purchase your copy now and receive special setting notes and exquisite character badges as part of the package!
Bulletin Board: "I'm sorry, but I just had to ask: where is the author's signature? I took my copy home and I wound up spending the whole day looking for it, but without success."
Bulletin Board: *Special Note: the author's signature is quite the tortured thing, and may be mistaken for the pattern on the box set's lid without careful observation.
Bulletin Board: "Popular authors who fail penmanship... Is that the way of the world nowadays?"

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: "My young samurai friends, the doors of Shimura's are always open to you!"
Bulletin Board: "Lost your job? Not lucky in love? Whatever your troubles, come over here for a drink or two!"
Bulletin Board: "I, Shimura Kanbei, will welcome you any time!"

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: "Children and parents of the city and beyond: if you should be bullied by a red oni with long horns such that you lose toys, cards, Onikabuto, snacks, picture books, and things of this kind..."
Bulletin Board: "Please come down to Hanamizaka and look for Kuki Shinobu. I will do my best to return the lost items to you. Regrettably, I will not be able to help you with toys that have been broken or food that has already been consumed."
Bulletin Board: "Hey, hey, Shinobu, you aren't taking pity on the vanquished again, are you?"
Bulletin Board: "Those are trophies, you know? Trophies! I won them fair and square — and it was a lot of effort, too! You can't just give them all back just like that!"
Bulletin Board: "Oh, is that so? In that case, I won't drag you back the next time that tengu woman beats the snot out of you."
Bulletin Board: "Oh, come on, don't be like that!"
Bulletin Board: "You know, it's your fault that I'm more acquainted with every Doushin in the Police Station than I ever needed to be..."
Bulletin Board: "I never asked for you to get me out of there! Also, what's with that psychiatric evaluation you used to bail me out last time? Were you making fun of me!?"
Bulletin Board: Due to citizen reports, the two people who vandalized this noticeboard have been detained.
Bulletin Board: We are familiar with one another, yes, but please control yourselves.

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board: Please take note that the announcement concerning the marriage between Sir Kujou Kamaji and Lady Hiiragi Chisato has been found to have been released in error due to a miscommunication within the Kanjou Commission.
Bulletin Board: We sincerely apologize for any subsequent confusion or misunderstandings.
Bulletin Board: The staff involved have been severely reprimanded, and the Shogunate pledges to enhance communication discipline and eliminate any such incidents in the future.
Bulletin Board: Let it be known that the matrimonial ceremonies have been delayed, and that further details will become available at a later date.
