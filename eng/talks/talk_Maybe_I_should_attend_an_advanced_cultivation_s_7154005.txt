# Talk Dialog

Chongyun: Maybe... I should attend an advanced cultivation session...
Traveler: Chongyun, this gift envelope is for you.
Chongyun: A gift envelope? Thank you, I'll take good care of it.
Chongyun: Apologies... I've been busy recently, so I don't have one for you in return... All I can do is offer you my wishes in person.
Traveler: I wish you all the best, as well.
Chongyun: Yes... Considering my family, I have some understanding of exorcisms and demons. But, I'm ashamed to say I never anticipated the connection between Xingqiu's great-grandfather and the problem with the boundary of life and death.
Chongyun: If I had more knowledge, or noticed something earlier, maybe you and Hu Tao wouldn't have needed to take those risks.
Chongyun: I should attend an advanced cultivation session soon...
Traveler: But, don't worry. It's been a busy time...
Traveler: See you.
Chongyun: Bye! I wish you all the best in the coming year.
