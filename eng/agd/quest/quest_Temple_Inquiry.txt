# Temple Inquiry


## Talk 1

Aberaku: Are you fully girded up, Traveler?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'm ready.
Aberaku: Then I wish you... every success in your battle ahead.

## Talk 3

Aberaku: Ah, if only Byakuyakoku had such valiant warriors as you! Then...
Aberaku: *sigh* If this thing is done, then my wishes shall be fulfilled.
Aberaku: You must bring these offerings bearing my thoughts to be enshrined... in the place where I was held under arrest. We must do this, in order to...
Paimon: In order to what?
Aberaku: In order to... In order to...
Paimon: Ugh, there's no use talking to this guy now. Seems like his spirit's all messed up again.
Paimon: #Traveler, let's just take those items with us.
Paimon: But where was this high-up place where this guy was imprisoned?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Here comes one of those spirits...
Aberaku: My name is...
Aberaku: Aberaku, Helios-Forger!
Aberaku: How could I have been felled by your vile slander, or imprisoned by your puppet infants!?
Aberaku: I— No, wait. I was imprisoned for months and years beyond count, was I not? Then... This must be my post-life form?
Paimon: "Post-life form"? You mean that you're already dead, right?
Paimon: Takes a pretty rare spirit to realize that.
Aberaku: And yet, though it shames me to say so, I know not just how I died...
Aberaku: But I recall that I was imprisoned on orders from a child.
Paimon: A child?
Aberaku: Indeed. But till today, I can never feel any hatred for that child, only pity.
Aberaku: He was not at fault. The blame should fall upon those who controlled him like a puppet in their palms... Forget it. Such things are best left unsaid.
Aberaku: After that, I was imprisoned...
Aberaku: Imprisoned in a...
Paimon: In a...?
Aberaku: In a very high place.
Aberaku: But though it was high up, it was dark, lightless, and cold as the ice itself.
Aberaku: ...Strange. Why is that?
Aberaku: Why do I feel that a high place should have brought a person warmth and comfort?
Aberaku: Why... Why can't I remember any of this?
Paimon: Are you hungry, maybe?
Paimon: Whenever Paimon's famished, forget thinking, she can barely even talk straight!
Traveler: I don't think that's his issue...
Paimon: Come on, it's gotta be! Look at him, he can hardly speak clearly!
Paimon: #Actually, Traveler, could you check if there's something to eat amongst the offerings?
Aberaku: Wait! That's it! The offerings!
Paimon: What, do you wanna eat them?
Aberaku: No, I just remembered...
Aberaku: When I died in prison, my attire and body were enshrined in various places due to my contribution in creating the Helios.
Aberaku: But that also caused my spirit to be separated and rendered unable to rest.
Aberaku: This place should have been the resting place of my sacred crown, though it has surely decayed by now. This must surely be why my thoughts are so... stuck.
Aberaku: If this persists, I doubt that even my current state can be sustained for long...
Aberaku: But these offerings can be used to replace the remnants of my body and my attire in sustaining an ounce of my thoughts.
Aberaku: As such, please take them with you.
Aberaku: However, there are many perils on the enshrining path. So though it may seem rude of me, could you accept a certain test first?
Paimon: Test? What test?
Aberaku: Please defeat the monsters hereabouts, the prison wardens of my spirit.
Aberaku: This matter is perilous. Tell me once you are ready, O Traveler, and we shall begin.
Traveler: Well, it just so happens that we have some emergen—
Paimon: Hey!
