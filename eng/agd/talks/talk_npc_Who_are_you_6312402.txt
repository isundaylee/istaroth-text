Traveler: Who are you?
Yuuzou: I'm a worker who was rescued by the Sangonomiya troops from the Tatarasuna Mikage Furnace ruins. I now work at their camp.
Yuuzou: The Vision Hunt Decree has brought pain and suffering to many people. It's no surprise that after the Tatarasuna workers provided refuge to people bearing Visions, they'd have grievances against the Shogunate.
Yuuzou: Though the Sangonomiya resistance may seem weak, they are a hundred times stronger still than the cold, unfeeling Shogunate.
Yuuzou: My powers may be limited, but I'd like to contribute to the resistance and help teach the Shogunate a lesson.
