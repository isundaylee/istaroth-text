# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Yegor: It's actually not that big of a deal. I'm applying to travel to Narukami Island, and I'm guessing that my request should be processed soon.
Yegor: But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
Yegor: I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders on Narukami Island. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
Yegor: *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...
