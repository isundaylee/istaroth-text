Traveler: Morning, Dehya.
Dehya: You look like you're raring to go. Not surprising, given how comfy this place is. I slept like a log last night.
Dehya: I usually get woken up by random loud noises, so it was a surprise to wake up naturally this morning. To be honest, it's quite an unfamiliar experience.
