# Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering


## Talk 1

Hatim: Hm... Not bad at all...
Traveler: Looks like you've made a fortune...
Hatim: Ah, Traveler! Thanks to you, I've made a small profit this time. Looks like the "Golden Dish" proved effective.
Hatim: However, it's not much different from what I usually earn from normal trades...
Hatim: This is not how a "Golden Dish" should work. Did I eat the wrong dish...?
Hatim: Traveler, let's try this once more. Can you please help me choose a "Golden Dish" again?
Hatim: Just as always, please pick one from among <color=#00E1FFFF>Mora Meat</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>Butter Chicken</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>Pile 'Em Up</color>.

## Talk 2

Hatim: After the minor profit last time, I'm definitely making a killing this time! <color=#00E1FFFF>Mora Meat</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>Butter Chicken</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>Pile 'Em Up</color>. How about it, then? What'll your choice be?

## Talk 3

Hatim: Good! A dish of excellent quality! I'm sure the futures I bought will surge this time!

## Talk 4

Hatim: This looks to be of good quality. Will I be able to make a fine profit this time?

## Talk 5

Hatim: This dish looks a little strange... Oh well, it matters not. Work calls me.
Hatim: I can't thank you enough, Traveler! Hope we'll meet again.

## Talk 6

Hatim: Uh...
Paimon: Hi! Hatim, how have you been?
Hatim: Oh... It's you guys.
Hatim: Well, I guess you can tell from my expression, no?
Hatim: I'll be honest, my wallet has been rendered half empty.
Hatim: Strange... This isn't how things should have gone...
Hatim: But then again... I have a suspicion that this is a sign that the market's about to take off.
Hatim: It's like how people have to bend down before they can leap high.
Hatim: The same goes for the futures trading market. The entire market just fell to an all-time low and it's about to bottom out!
Hatim: In other words, now is the best time to go bargain-hunting!
Traveler: Maybe it hasn't hit the bottom yet...
Hatim: No. I am pretty sure this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and Hatim never misses any chance to gain wealth.
Hatim: That would be worthy of my name as Kalimi's exceptionally wealthy Hatim!
Hatim: Come, friend, help me out one more time, will you? Please choose another "Golden Dish"!
Paimon: Still from the original options?
Hatim: Hm... Wait, no! Since we're going bargain-hunting, I need a dish that is extra special to turn the tide on the market.
Hatim: I heard that Mondstadt has a tycoon who runs a super profitable alcohol business...
Traveler: Do you mean...
Paimon: Master Diluc?
Paimon: But how did you know about...
Hatim: Hahaha, how could I not know of him, when I even know about "Pile 'Em Up"?
Hatim: He owns a tavern where they sell something wonderful known as Apple Cider. If I down some of that, I believe I shall imbibe some of his affinity for wealth as well!
Hatim: So please, help me get a bottle of Apple Cider!
Traveler: Some people get leg cramps when they bend low...

## Talk 7

Hatim: We shall earn back what was lost, and with interest to boot!

## Talk 8

Hatim: This is that tycoon's apple cider, yes? Ah, what an extraordinary aroma. It truly clears the mind!
Hatim: Great! This is the good stuff indeed. It shall surely bring about a shift in the market!
Hatim: I won't forget the help you two have given me! I'll see you around!
