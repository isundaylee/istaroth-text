# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What else do you and the Spring Fairy talk about?
Old Finch: Oh, anything and everything.
Old Finch: When I was younger, we used to talk a lot here...
Old Finch: About the weather and the water. About the fish in the spring, and about which townsfolk were arguing again...
Old Finch: We'd talk about which kids had fallen into the water. She'd secretly help them get out, and always made sure they found a few pretty stones to make them feel better, too...
Old Finch: She's very kind, you see.
Old Finch: Of course, the townspeople don't believe in her. They think she's a fairy tale. Haha! Maybe that's for the best...
