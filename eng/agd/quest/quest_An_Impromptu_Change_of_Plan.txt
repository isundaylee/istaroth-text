# An Impromptu Change of Plan


## Talk 1

Moon Carver (???): And who might we be? Those that dare enter Jueyun Karst?
Traveler: I was sent here.
Traveler: Please take a look at this.
Moon Carver (???): A Sigil of Permission... Many a season has passed since one was last in the presence of such an item.
Moon Carver: He before you is the mighty and illuminated adeptus, Moon Carver. Speak, traveler. What business have you here?
Paimon: Actually...
Millelith Sergeant: It's the assassin! They dared to flee here to Jueyun Karst!
Millelith Soldier: Sir, we've already stepped too far into Jueyun Karst ourselves...
Millelith Sergeant: We... Argh, there's no choice. Apprehending the assassin is top priority, we must press on!
Moon Carver: ...disturbing our borders.
Moon Carver: See them gone. One will not have interruption.

## Talk 2

Moon Carver: We've digressed. State your purpose, traveler.
Paimon: Well...
Moon Carver: Preposterous...
Moon Carver: PREPOSTEROUS!!!
Moon Carver: The Liyue Qixing... utterly disappointing.
Moon Carver: How could someone possibly assassinate Rex Lapis during the Rite of Descension...
Moon Carver: And then place suspicion upon the attendees!?
Moon Carver: ...
Moon Carver: Traveler, of the unjust accusations placed upon you, one has become aware.
Moon Carver: The mind knows its answer. Though one must consult with one's fellows, lest the mind be misguided.
Moon Carver: Go. Take your Sigil of Permission, carry with you a message.
Traveler: Who should I look for?
Traveler: Where should I go?
Moon Carver: Mountain Shaper and Cloud Retainer can be found here. Only fate will decide if you shall find them â€” only fate.
Moon Carver: There exists a Conqueror of Demons, a Guardian Yaksha. Go to Wangshu Inn. There you shall seek him.
