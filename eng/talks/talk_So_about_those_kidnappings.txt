Traveler: So, about those kidnappings...
Shatha: I heard that they had something to do with the Akademiya... Hmph, even when I was working in the city as a mercenary in the Corps of Thirty, I had already seen right through them.
Shatha: Those wretched scholars are even more disgusting than those Specters that blow up before disappearing. There's no end to their corrupt schemes.
Shatha: Not that those idiots who think that "King Deshret has risen" or some nonsense like that are any better.
Shatha: I can't believe I worked with some of those idiots back when I was a mercenary.
