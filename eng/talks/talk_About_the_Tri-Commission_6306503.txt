Traveler: About the Tri-Commission...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As an outsider, what do you think of each of the Commissions?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: ...Forget it, what's the point in asking you such a question? But in light of the situation, let me speak with you frankly.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Kanjou Commission strictly enforces the Sakoku Decree, even Ritou is sealed off from the outside world. But I'm afraid this policy is only making matters worse for Inazuma.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: The Tenryou Commission aggressively uses their military might. When faced with the issue of the Sangonomiya rebels, they decided to suppress it solely with brute force. They ignore the hearts of the people, and someday will pay the price for that.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As for the Yashiro Commission... They do indeed empathize with the people in their handling of ceremonial affairs, but without any military or financial power they are relatively weak.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Distributing aid during wartime can provide temporary relief to address the problem, but it is no long-term solution. It is gradually consuming the strength of the Kamisato Clan.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Ugh... Just talking about it makes me more worried.
