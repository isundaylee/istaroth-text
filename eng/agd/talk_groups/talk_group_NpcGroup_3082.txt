Kaede: I never thought that Ritou would play host to a festival by the Yae Publishing House, nor that this many people would show up.
Kaede: Thanks to the Irodori Festival, our Inazuman products and toys have been very popular indeed, even those that aren't necessarily part of our event-specific promotions.

Kaede: Wow. The Irodori Festival hasn't started yet, and there are already so many people on Ritou...
Kaede: Well, dear customer, you'll have to wait till the festival starts to get one of our Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!
Kaede: ...Ah, you're not here about the Shogun Statues? Sorry, we've just gotten so many queries concerning those recently.

Kaede: We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
Kaede: Back then... we might have also sold statues of the Almighty Shogun and other related goods as well.

Traveler: What kinds of dolls?
Kaede: Our featured products are statues of fox spirits and porcelain tanuki dolls. Uh... tanuki dolls sell a bit better.
Kaede: They represent good fortune in Inazuma. Many business owners buy one to place in their stores, hoping for financial success.
Kaede: They look really cute as well! It's not a bad idea to gift them to your favorite girl or the children in your family.

Traveler: Statues of the Shogun?
Kaede: Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
Kaede: *sigh* It used to be our best-selling product...
Kaede: Sadly, we've lost our customer base ever since the lockdown happened. And such a delicate item is not cheap to craft, so we've had no choice but to take them off the shelves.
