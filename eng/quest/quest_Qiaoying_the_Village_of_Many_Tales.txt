# Qiaoying, the Village of Many Tales


## Talk 1

Paimon: ...See? Paimon said it was just an ordinary kitten.
Guijarro: Huh. To think that...
Confused Kitty: Meow? Meow... meow, meow?
Traveler: Do you know of any Xuanwen beasts?
Confused Kitty: Meow...?
Black Screen Text: The cat turns and leaves, looking frustrated...
Guijarro: Still... Do you think that this kitten could be the young form of the mythical beast, lying low here in Qiaoying Village till it is fully grown, and can destroy all the tea trees in one fell swoop...
Hung Fan: Ms. Guijarro, not this again... Anyway, haven't I told you before that Xuanwen beasts are hardly that gentle?
Guijarro: Ah, Ms. Hung Fan! What a coincidence. What brings you here today?
Hung Fan: *sigh* Please stop mentioning things like "criminal cases" around here — what if the children begin to take you seriously?
Traveler: You know each other?
Guijarro: Yes. When I came here, it was this lady who I hired to help me carry my baggage. I also consulted her regarding all manners of folklore.
Hung Fan: If I've told you once, I've told you countless times that Xuanwen beasts won't appear here, but you just won't believe me. What was that thing you said...
Guijarro: Even if they won't appear, I'll still have many ways to collect information on them.
Hung Fan: There you go again... I know my hopes of dissuading you were slim, but still, I must ask you not to leave the village willy-nilly.
Hung Fan: The beasts are actually quite dangerous, so if you do end up encountering one... *sigh* Anyway, please do not leave the village on your own!
Black Screen Text: Hung Fan leaves, looking even more exhausted and resigned than the cat from earlier...
Guijarro: Well, since Ms. Hung Fan said so, we're going to have to go elsewhere to get our material. Come then, follow me.
Traveler: Sorry, we've got the wrong cat.
Confused Kitty: Meow...

## Talk 2

Guijarro: What do you think? This...
Traveler: A tea cauldron.
Guijarro: That's right, and it does... something with the tea... that makes it kinda special... Whatever the case, it's been placed smack dab in the middle of this place, too! If you ask me, it must hold some special significance.
Guijarro: Hmmm. Now then, what if... our Xuanwen Beast has been using this as its hiding place all along?
Traveler: You'll be writing a fantasy story at this rate, you know.
Paimon: Feels like the next thing you know, you'll introduce some Adepti into the story...
Traveler: I dunno if that's the right kind of plot to write for a crime story...
Guijarro: ...Hmm, those are some fine expressions you've got there. Are you thinking, perhaps, that a crime story centered around a Xuanwen beast might feel too "absurd" to be taken seriously?
Paimon: Well, uh, yeah, kinda? Can you really use something like that to move the plot forward?
Traveler: Wait, don't tell me you're...
Guijarro: #Haha, aren't you a sharp one, {NICKNAME}? You sure do live up to your fame.
Guijarro: Exactly! I intend to write about a "crime too absurd to be possible." Your reactions, along with Ms. Hung Fan's, are very interesting. I'll include them into my novel for sure.
Guijarro: As for the Xuanwen beast... It shall be my "perpetrator." A creature that has never been seen, but is said to devour the village's evil-doers.
Guijarro: During a certain festival, a villager is found to have met their end at the hands of some wild beast outside the settlement...
Guijarro: But during the second festival day, the main character encounters the victim, who should be dead — only for yet another victim to soon emerge afterward...
Paimon: Wait, and then what? Then what!
Guijarro: Well, I haven't thought that far yet.
Traveler: ...I'm leaving now.
Guijarro: Oh, come on! Once I finish, I'll send you two autographed copies for sure. In fact, I've still got a big favor I'll need your help with!
Guijarro: Ms. Hung Fan has said that I shouldn't leave the village by myself, right? Well, I've taken her advice to heart!
Guijarro: But... now that you're here, I'm no longer alone! That means I can go outside!
Guijarro: We're not going to go too far off, of course! So, are you willing to help me out?
Traveler: Well, sure... We'll do it so you can tell us the end of your story.
Guijarro: Well, then! Let's head over there, shall we? There's a place I'd like to go!
Traveler: Please follow the standardized payment model, thanks.
Guijarro: Of course. Don't you worry!
Traveler: I don't think this is a crime story anymore...

## Talk 3

Guijarro: So these are "lanterns"? These ones look like fish — how very fascinating!
Guijarro: So these handles can be used to raise the lanterns up? Hmm... With this detachable structure, someone with a head for engineering design can easily have a section or two secretly added without being discovered...
Guijarro: The space within is pretty large. You should be able to insert a few...
Traveler: Stop! Jolly well keep those thoughts to yourself!
Guijarro: Eh? Oh... Right! Hahaha, sorry. I just can't stop myself from thinking aloud upon seeing these fascinating things...
Guijarro: Hmm. Yes, I'm sure of it — the addition of "lanterns" will add much to my novel.
Guijarro: Could I trouble you to go to the side, and take a picture of this "fish lantern" for me? I'd like to have a reference picture for later.
Traveler: Well, time to hone my Kamera skills some more, I guess...
Guijarro: I'm leaving the photo-taking in your hands, then... Ah, yes. Please make sure you'll grab a shot of the entire lantern — this is incredibly important to me!
Guijarro: ...Cooking up a scheme related to "dimensions" will be quite interesting... The question now is how they will solve the weight problem...
Traveler: Leave it to me.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh? Where did Guijarro go? Wasn't she here just a moment ago?
Traveler: Guess she was kidnapped by a Xuanwen beast?
Paimon: Hey, don't say stuff like that! She probably just ran off somewhere thinking about her plotline. Let's search the area.
Traveler: The tea field to the side gives us a good vantage point. Let's start from there.
Paimon: Good idea! Let's start our search from up high!
Traveler: Did her novel turn out to be truer than fiction?

## Talk 5

Paimon: Guijarro! How did you get over here?
Guijarro: ...No, no. I can't have them find the key clue just like that. Also, can someone really still think well after being tied up here all night?
Paimon: Wow, she's totally engrossed. Has she finally found a breakthrough?
Traveler: More like a real roadblock.
Guijarro: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, you've arrived just in time.
Guijarro: Could you tie me to a wooden stake?
Paimon: D—Did Paimon hear that right?
Guijarro: Yep, that's exactly what I said. Please tie my hands, and string me up by them on a... tree. Um, well, they're all wood anyway, so it should make no difference.
Traveler: I don't intend to become the suspect in your novel.
Guijarro: Oh, don't worry, I've already written up a liability document, which assigns responsibility for all mishaps that might occur to me.
Paimon: No, no, that's not the problem. Why do you want us to tie you up at all? You haven't done anything wrong...
Guijarro: But the main character of my novel will be strung up by their hands by the villagers and left in the wild for a whole night, awaiting the Xuanwen beast's judgment.
Guijarro: Later in the plot, the main character, having expected this turn of events, will somehow survive, and endure the night, before revealing the truth behind everything...
Guijarro: ...However, I have no clue how a person who has been tied up for a whole night would feel. Not how they'd sound, think, or even move!
Guijarro: That's why I need you two to tie me up and keep me here the whole night. That way, I'll be able to experience those feelings for myself.
Traveler: Nope. This is way too dangerous.
Guijarro: ...Um. Well, there is, but it probably wouldn't be as effective.
Guijarro: Instead of that, I could... raise my hands up and stay here for the whole night.
Paimon: Uhh... Or you could just not write that novel. Our actions here could be easily misunderstood...
Traveler: You're really putting your main character through the wringer...
Guijarro: Please! This is the most important step! Once I get over this hurdle, my novel will be complete! If we use this method, you won't have to commit any crimes...
Paimon: Not that we ever had to!
Traveler: We never had to in the first place!
Guijarro: Ah... Well, I mean, you really don't have to do all that much. Just stand guard by my side so that I won't be dragged off by someone... or some animal, while I gather the information I need.
Guijarro: Let me see... Considering the atmosphere we're trying to create in the novel, we still need to go further up...
Paimon: Huh? Hey! Wait for us!
Black Screen Text: You and Guijarro climb to the highest point of the tea fields...
Guijarro: Whew, I—It's... kinda c—cold, but it... really gets you into the mood of things!
Paimon: Are you really going to stand here the whole night with your hands upraised?
Guijarro: That's right. I've decided to do this. Some sacrifices must be made for the sake of writing...
Guijarro: Well, please stand guard here in the meantime. Just one night... Just one night...
Traveler: Isn't there a safer way to do this?

## Talk 6

Guijarro: ...Don't think the character would be able to return to the village alone like this...
Paimon: Guijarro!
Traveler: Let's help her up first...
Black Screen Text: You help Guijarro up so she's sitting properly on the ground.
Guijarro: So that's how it feels... It's quite awful, indeed. Not only am I exhausted... I feel like even my mind's gotten all sluggish...
Traveler: Mission accomplished, then?
Guijarro: Of course. I finally know how it feels to be tied, strung up, and left to the elements for a night.
Paimon: That protagonist of yours is pretty tough...
Guijarro: That's right. I've also figured out how the protagonist is going to chase the Xuanwen Beast away. If we conclude the story that way, it will surely... Surely...
Paimon: Ooh? Are they going to pull off a super cool trick?
Guijarro: It will surely... be really awesome...
Black Screen Text: Guijarro faints once again...
Paimon: Hey! Hey! Guijarro, you...
Traveler: Couldn't you have said how this would work *before* fainting?
Paimon: A—Anyway, let's get her to a doctor... Back to the village!
Paimon: Ms. Hung Fan was right. This lady really shouldn't have left the village...
