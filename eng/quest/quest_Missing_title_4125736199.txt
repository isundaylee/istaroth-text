## Talk 1

Panuelle: Just what is Chauvigne thinking? *sigh* He doesn't even want to talk with me.
Traveler: About Chauvigne...
Panuelle: Hello there. I'm really sorry, but... It's Chauvigne. He's still angry at me, and refuses to come out and speak with me.
Panuelle: *sigh* But the wind and sunlight can't reach him down there. What if he withers? What then!?
Paimon: Uhm... Since we're talking about a potted flower...
Traveler: We can just scoop him up.
Panuelle: I've tried! But as long as Chauvigne's upset, I can't even get close...
Panuelle: He's in such a stormy mood that I nearly got blown away!
Paimon: Wait, how can being angry blow someone away?
Traveler: That's pretty stormy, alright.
Panuelle: Maybe the reason he's so furious with me is because I refused to venture out with him before...
Panuelle: Please, dear guests, can I trouble you to check on Chauvigne? Perhaps you might even be able to reason with him.
Traveler: No problem, we'll give it a try.
Paimon: Yeah! We've traveled to so many places, and seen so many people, we'll defin... probably be able to convince him!
Panuelle: That's wonderful! You can find him in the cavern below this island. Please, if you'll head that way...
Panuelle: I... I must tidy up this place, and find a good place for Chauvigne to soak up some sun.
Traveler: That would make it hard to get close, yes.

## Talk 2

Panuelle: I... I must tidy up this place, and find a good place for Chauvigne to soak up some sun.
Panuelle: I leave the matter of persuading Chauvigne in your hands, dear guests.
Panuelle: If I were to see him, he would surely think me clingy, and become even more tempestuous...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Phew... The wind's finally stopped...
Traveler: Listen to us, please.
Chauvigne: Fine. I'll listen to what you have to say. But before that...
Chauvigne: Look how shocked the two of you are! I'm sure you're dying to ask, "How can a flower speak?"
Chauvigne: Or perhaps, "How did you turn into a potted flower?"
Traveler: Do people usually ask that?
Chauvigne: Outside, yes, many. After I returned home... No, nobody has asked.
Paimon: By "outside," do you mean outside this world?
Traveler: I've heard that you only became like this after venturing.
Chauvigne: Well well, look who's so well-informed! I suppose Panuelle must have told you?
Chauvigne: That's correct. I became like this while I was venturing. Hehe, to borrow a phrase from that Rozel... This was the "change" I chose to make.
Paimon: Paimon gets change... But why change into a potted flower?
Traveler: Could it be because you really, really like plants?
Chauvigne: No. I just... wanted to find my "place."
Chauvigne: I met many people outside this world. Some were chefs, others florists, others teachers.
Chauvigne: Almost everyone had found a "place" that made them feel at ease. That was how they'd all managed to establish themselves in life.
Chauvigne: And me? All I could do was venture. I had never thought of finding a stable "place" for myself.
Traveler: This "flower pot" is your "place."
Chauvigne: Exactly. You catch on quick.
Chauvigne: As a flower in a pot, I'll always have a "place" that puts me at ease.
Chauvigne: But... *sigh* Since I've already got myself a pot, and a "place" that belongs to me, why do I still want to go out venturing?
Chauvigne: I'm a venturer, after all. Without venturing, is there anything else of value I can do?
Chauvigne: I don't get it. The more of the outside world I see, the less I understand... Between having a "place" and "venturing," which is more important?
Chauvigne: The more I think about it, the more my head hurts... And when I talk with Panuelle, I always duck his questions.
Chauvigne: I'm afraid of misleading him. If he loved venturing, would he grow to hate it after seeing me like this?
Chauvigne: He is my friend, and always will be. I must be honest with him, and I have answered all that he has asked.
Chauvigne: Including... That the reason I became a flower is so I could have a "place" that made me feel at ease.
Chauvigne: Perhaps my answer upset him... Or perhaps, it's because he doesn't like the way I am now.
Chauvigne: We are growing apart, but as I am but a potted plant, I cannot go up myself.
Chauvigne: But it's probably for the best, I'm sure Panuelle doesn't want to see me anyway. He must be angry with me.
Paimon: Oh... So that's what's going on! You both think the other one's angry with you!
Traveler: And so they aren't willing to meet.
Chauvigne: What? Y—You mean, Panuelle isn't mad at me?
Traveler: You two are thinking the exact same thing.
Black Screen Text: You tell Chauvigne all about everything Panuelle is thinking...
Chauvigne: Skies above, how could I ever think such a thing? I have never wanted to see him upset, and even should the corners of his lips twitch downward, my heart would be utterly shattered!
Chauvigne: Dear guests! I must ask you to bring me up, I beg it of you! I must see him with all haste! I cannot wait another minute, no, not even another second!
Traveler: I was waiting for you to say that, my potted friend.
Paimon: #Hehe, Paimon was waiting for it too! Off we go, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: He actually thinks you're the one who's angry at him.
Traveler: Your dream is to become a botanist?
Traveler: Panuelle has something he'd like to tell you.

## Talk 4

Panuelle: Chauvigne! Y—You've come. Please, listen to me, I've never been mad at you, and never wanted to leave you.
Panuelle: I was only worried that you didn't want to be friends with me... I know that some venturers change, and I was worried you had too...
Panuelle: I prayed to the goddess, but... But I couldn't find a good enough gift to offer, so she naturally ignored me...
Chauvigne: No! Panuelle, such a thing could never happen. I will always, always be your friend.
Chauvigne: I must apologize to you! I was so focused on my own thoughts that I failed to listen to what you were saying.
Chauvigne: I assumed... I assumed you never wanted to see me again.
Traveler: Seems we've cleared up this misunderstanding.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon thought you two had some crazy sticking point, and were so super mad you didn't even want to try and understand each other!
Traveler: It definitely was a sticky matter...
Chauvigne: Thank you both, my dear guests. Without you, I'd definitely still be holed up in there, refusing to come out.
Chauvigne: But now, I can finally share what's in my heart with Panuelle.
Panuelle: I am always willing to listen to whatever you have to say, Chauvigne. Whether you wish to speak of venturing, or of flower pots... It's all fine by me.
Panuelle: Right, dear guests. Please, take these. I gathered them specially for you.
Panuelle: May the goddess bless you, that you may never argue with your friends, and that someone will always be willing to listen to your innermost thoughts.
Traveler: But at least it's come unstuck now.
