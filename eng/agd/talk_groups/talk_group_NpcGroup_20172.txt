Hughes: Yes... Yes! This place is good. It's a good spot for takeoff!
Traveler: Takeoff from where?
Hughes: From a suitable location, of course? Oh, hello, Traveler. Nice to meet you. I'm Hughes, an adventurer.
Hughes: Well, I say that... But I've honestly spent more time researching ways to use my wind glider than I have at the Guild.
Traveler: Ways to use your wind glider?
Hughes: Indeed. It's a real science, it is.
Hughes: Some who put on a wind glider can soar with the birds, but others... well, they don't get very far.
Hughes: Ultimately, it has to do with individual differences in one's grasp on various gliding techniques.
Hughes: The best way to refine one's technique, to whit, is via practical drills.
Hughes: Traveler, you have a wind glider too, right? I've just discovered a most excellent spot from which one can utilize wind gliders...
Hughes: So how about it? How would you like to spread your wings and soar?
Traveler: I'll do that.
Hughes: Great! Just let me mark it on your map...
Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Hughes: Sure, go finish what you have to first.
