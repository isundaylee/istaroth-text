Traveler: Big dream...
Darina: Good luck will follow only if you dream big!
Darina: Maybe one day, King Deshret will come back again... Or the Dendro Archon will work wonders...
Darina: Either will do. Upon their return, there will be no desert, no pain, no Samiel-Control Engineers, no Bimarstan doctors.
Darina: Hehehe, just saying this cracks me up.
