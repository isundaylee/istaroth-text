# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About apprenticeships...
Master Lu: *sigh* You must have overheard me grumbling then...
Master Lu: I'm getting old now, and a lifetime of toiling away in this workshop has started to take its toll on the old joints...
Master Lu: Lately I've been thinking â€” it's time for me to take on an apprentice. Pass on what I've learned. Secure the future of the Fanmu Carpenter's.
Master Lu: ...Don't s'pose you have any interest in woodwork yourself? The thought of turning a chunk of raw timber into a polished masterpiece by your own handiwork... appeal to you at all?
Traveler: Yes, Master!
Master Lu: Really? Do you mean it?
Master Lu: I don't know... You seem to me to have itchy feet. Places you have to go, things you have to do.
Master Lu: How about you do what you've gotta do first. If when you come back I'm still around, then as long as I've got strength in my bones I'll be glad to take you on.
Master Lu: When that time comes, I will devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's will be yours.
Traveler: No thanks.
Master Lu: What a pity. You'll never know the joy of working with wood.
Master Lu: Well, never mind. It's clear that you've got places to go, things to do.
Master Lu: When you've done what you've gotta do, though... do come and find me if you change your mind.
Master Lu: I'd devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's, they're yours to take if you want them.
