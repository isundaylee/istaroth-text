Traveler: How do you like it here?
Emilie: It's even better than I imagined.
Emilie: I really appreciate the way this space combines popular aesthetics with your own personal style. Such a pleasant surprise.
Traveler: Got any decoration suggestions?
Emilie: Decorating is not one of my areas of expertise, I'm afraid. Although, I could certainly give you some advice on keeping the place well-ventilated, if you want.
Emilie: The ventilation system I use in my perfume studio is one that I designed myself. As you can imagine, a perfume studio has more stringent ventilation requirements than other indoor spaces.
Emilie: Beyond that, it's worth giving some serious consideration to the position of doors and windows. Of course, these are just suggestions. If you have friends with more relevant expertise, you should ask them, too.
Traveler: Could you recommend some fragrances to suit this place?
Emilie: Hmm... For a place like this, I would recommend an herbal fragrance.
Emilie: It would fit with the overall openness of the space, and bring in some of the earthy notes of the natural environment. Also, considering your occupation, it suits you down to a T.
Traveler: Occupation? You mean, being a traveler?
Emilie: Exactly. From what I've seen, at least, that seems to be your primary occupation.
Emilie: In my experience, travelers who spend a long time on the road have a better memory for scents than the average person.
Emilie: And ultimately, it all stems from the ground beneath your feet â€” the soil. That's where you spend every step of your journey, from start to finish.
Emilie: Herbal notes capture the essence of the natural environment. They're most suited to people with the deepest connection to the land.
