Someone's Message: "Excuse me, does anyone know if there's a way to restore one's rights as a citizen in Fontaine?"
Vitruvia: "As far as I know, no such cases currently exist."
Another Person's Message: "Even if there was a way, it'd never happen to you, Colin. Why don't you take an honest look at what you did? That "boiler" prototype of yours razed the entire lab."
Someone's Message: "It's not my fault! They must have mucked up operating it. My calculations couldn't have been wrong, it can't be my fault!"
Another Person's Message: "Tell it to the Oratrice, why don't you."
