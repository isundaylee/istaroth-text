Farabi: Traveler, if you're ready, I'm going to ignite the bait and lure the Snowboar over.
Traveler: Giant Snowboar, here I come!
Traveler: Hold on, I need more time to prepare.
Farabi: It's okay, take your time. We're dealing with a chunky fellow, after all.
Traveler: Where's Edmund?
Farabi: Mr. Edmund is responsible for security in Springvale, so I told him to go back. Don't worry, I'll be careful and stay out of the way. I won't give you any trouble.
