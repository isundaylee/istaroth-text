Visitor's Message: "Um, so basically... I just arrived from Fontaine, and my guide keeps recommending the hot springs here. I'm curious — what does everyone actually think of them?"
Another Visitor's Message: "Praise be to the God of Wisdom, I can't get enough of these hot springs! It feels like I'm melting into the pool..."
Another Visitor's Message: "Finally, a place where you don't have to be constantly on the lookout for dangerous Fungi... If only we could stumble upon hot springs like this while out on recon jobs in the rainforest!"
Visitor's Message: "Eh!? M—Melting? You mean like... dissolving in the water? That sounds... pretty dangerous..."
Another Visitor's Message: "Haha... Melting, shmelting, whatever you wanna call it. Honestly though, the moment I'm in there, it's like I've forgotten all my cares, all my worries, all my... responsibilities... Although, when I put like that, it does sound quite dangerous indeed..."
Another Visitor's Message: "Anyway, we're already here, so why worry about all that? Just forget it all and let yourself melt into the hot spring... That's what vacations are all about."
Another Visitor's Message: "I found a great outdoor hot spring a few days ago that will LITERALLY melt you away. Fancy checking it out together tomorrow night?"
