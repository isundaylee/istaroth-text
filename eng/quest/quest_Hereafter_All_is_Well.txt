# Hereafter: All is Well


## Talk 1

Wang Ping'an: This is turning into quite the project...
Traveler: You're really fixing this place, huh...
Wang Ping'an: Ah, it's you. I mean, I did say that I was an upstanding citizen now, didn't I?
Wang Ping'an: I must say though, it's a much bigger project than I originally thought...
Wang Ping'an: The designer I brought in to plan the new temple got really fired up the moment I told him that this was a Yaksha's temple.
Wang Ping'an: Not only did he draw up sheet after sheet of plans, he even dragged me off to buy materials.
Wang Ping'an: If he was a few decades younger, I bet he'd insist on working on this himself...
Traveler: You haven't encountered any danger, have you?
Wang Ping'an: Danger? Oh, you mean monsters and Treasure Hoarders?
Wang Ping'an: You needn't worry. Once they got wind that I was repairing a Yaksha's temple, the Ministry of Civil Affairs assigned some Millelith to help with security.
Wang Ping'an: They've more or less chased all the nearby monsters away.
Wang Ping'an: As for the Treasure Hoarders... They seem to be lying low now that the Millelith are here.
Wang Ping'an: However, the volume of work required to fix this temple has really exceeded my expectations. Turns out we didn't prepare enough materials, so we've had to order in more supplies from the city.
Wang Ping'an: And while those Treasure Hoarders probably wouldn't make a move at the worksite itself, they might lie in ambush along the delivery route to steal the materials along the way.
Wang Ping'an: The Millelith can hold the worksite, no problem. But if the delivery gets attacked by Treasure Hoarders, there's no way they'd be able to respond in time.
Wang Ping'an: Could I ask for a favor from you?
Wang Ping'an: I know how skilled you are. Those Treasure Hoarders are definitely no match for you.
Wang Ping'an: Could you go and teach them a lesson and dissuade them from disrupting our work?
Traveler: I'll do it.
Wang Ping'an: Thank you. Thank you so much!
Traveler: Why don't you ask the Millelith?
Wang Ping'an: They're already guarding this worksite day and night. I wouldn't want to tire them out further.
Wang Ping'an: I'll leave this to you then, Traveler.
Traveler: I recall that this area wasn't the safest...
Wang Ping'an: You mean how the surrounding area is full of monsters and Treasure Hoarders?

## Talk 2

Wang Ping'an: Hey, hey! Be careful with that! Don't damage the statue!
Wang Ping'an: *sigh* Looks like the construction work won't be finished any time soon...

## Talk 3

Treasure Hoarder Boss: P—Please, stop! We've lost! Please, spare us!
Traveler: Pack it up and get ye gone!
Treasure Hoarder Boss: Y—Yes...
Treasure Hoarder Boss: But... Dare I ask what we've done to offend you?
Treasure Hoarder Boss: Did you find some treasure in this area, by any chance?
Traveler: We're rebuilding a temple nearby.
Treasure Hoarder Boss: R—Rebuilding a temple? In the middle of these mountains?
Treasure Hoarder Boss: ...There's a temple commemorating an adeptus here!? Wait a minute. Could it be that old house...
Treasure Hoarder Sidekick: Boss, we did see a statue of a bird while we were resting there previously. That must've been...
Traveler: That's Pervases, one of the Yakshas.
Treasure Hoarder Boss: Huh!?
Treasure Hoarder Sidekick: B—Boss! D—Did we really offend an adeptus...?
Treasure Hoarder Boss: S—Stop talking nonsense! We didn't know, so that didn't count! It was ignorance! I don't think the adeptus will judge us... Right?
Treasure Hoarder Boss: Anyway! Thank you for telling us of the reparations being done on the temple.
Treasure Hoarder Boss: We apologize for our previous ignorance and rudeness...
Treasure Hoarder Boss: We'll go back and tell the others to give the temple a wider berth.
Treasure Hoarder Sidekick: Boss, shouldn't we go there and light a few sticks of incense to apologize to the adeptus?
Treasure Hoarder Boss: Hey, hey, when did you become such a talker! Come on, let's go!
Traveler: Don't come near this place in the future.

## Talk 4

Wang Ping'an: Hello there. Were there Treasure Hoarders about?
Wang Ping'an: Ah, so they left. That's good...
Traveler: Is there anything else I can help you with?
Wang Ping'an: Hahaha. Thank you for your kindness. But you've already helped me so much. It wouldn't be right.
Wang Ping'an: But if you're willing, it would help if you could find us some <color=#00E1FFFF>Sandbearer Wood</color>. You can consider it your official contribution to the repair work!
Wang Ping'an: It is a good deed, after all. A little personal participation might bring you some good fortune.
Traveler: I'll go get it for you.
Wang Ping'an: Haha, alright. Just bring the <color=#00E1FFFF>Sandbearer Wood</color> you find straight back to me.
Traveler: Have other people made any donations to the repair works?
Wang Ping'an: Hmm, to be honest, not many people have. This is a very deserted place, so most people don't know that there is a temple here.
Wang Ping'an: I also suspect that few people now remember the Yaksha known as Pervases...
Wang Ping'an: But enough about that for now. Just bring the <color=#00E1FFFF>Sandbearer Wood</color> you find straight back to me.

## Talk 5

Wang Ping'an: How is it? Did you manage to find the <color=#00E1FFFF>Sandbearer Wood</color>?

## Talk 6

Wang Ping'an: Alright. I'll take this <color=#00E1FFFF>Sandbearer Wood</color> timber.
Wang Ping'an: The temple will take a while more to repair, so I'll remain here for the time being.
Wang Ping'an: If you have the time, you can come by and check on things.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wang Ping'an: *sigh* This place really is in a terrible state. The pillars are rotten, the planks are broken. At least the statue's still fine...
Wang Ping'an: Why hasn't anyone come to fix this place...
