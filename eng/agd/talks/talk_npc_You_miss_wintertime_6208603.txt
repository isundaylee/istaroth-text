Nadia: You miss wintertime?
Nadia: Winter in Snezhnaya is quite different.
Nadia: It's common in some places for blizzards to last an entire month. It can be deadly if you don't properly prepare your food reserves and don't take precautions against the cold.
Nadia: So as you cuddle up next to the warm stove with snow laden winds beating against the window, the danger that is right in front of your eyes and yet distant in the sky will make you think, "Ah, I'm alive, and I'm happy."
Nadia: If you ever come to Snezhnaya, you'll understand what I mean.
