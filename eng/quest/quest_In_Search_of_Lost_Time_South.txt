# In Search of Lost Time: South


## Talk 1

Broglie: Oh, what am I to do...
Paimon: Huh? Are you okay? Sighing so sadly alone by the water like that... Did something bad happen?
Broglie: Yes, and it wasn't any old "something bad," but something awful...
Broglie: Ah! Apologies, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Broglie, and I'm an entry-level researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, and I was previously responsible for monitoring Fontaine's hydrology data.
Paimon: Uh, what's "hydrology data"?
Broglie: *ahem* Simply put, it is all the data related to the various properties of water. For example, there's the temperature of various water layers, water level, rates of current flow and evaporation within set times, concentration of dissolved impurities...
Paimon: Whoa, that all sounds really complicated!
Broglie: It is, that's why people are needed — specifically, my colleagues and I — to collect this complex data and make observations so that we can detect changes in the water quality in advance.
Broglie: If no one does this work, by the time we discover a huge problem, it will be too late to address it.
Broglie: You know, that's one of the reasons those lovely Oceanids left Fontaine. There was a change in the water quality that made it unsuitable for them to live in—
Traveler: Really?
Broglie: Well... That's what I was told during my induction training, probably to rouse a semblance of personal responsibility in us. The point is, monitoring the hydrology data is pretty important work!
Broglie: For instance, if a change in water quality nears the minimum coefficient, it could make the taste less smooth and refreshing...
Paimon: What? That's all?
Broglie: Haha, well, that's what makes it the minimum coefficient, right? But if things got out of hand...
Paimon: What, would the water turn into Fonta?
Broglie: No, it would probably just lead to a mass extinction event all over Fontaine.
Traveler: Oh, that is scary!
Paimon: Wait a minute, does that mean you're sighing here by yourself because something terrible has happened to the water...?
Broglie: Oh, not at all. It's just that the monitoring data I gathered have sunk to the bottom along with the observation station, and I don't know how I can fish them back out. That's what's got me so worried.
Paimon: Um... the observation station, too?
Broglie: Yes. I imagine you've heard about that awful lab accident from before. You know, the one that blew the Central Laboratory sky high.
Broglie: As ill-luck would have it, that lab accident also sunk the hydrology observation station here. Fortunately, my colleagues and I were doing a study somewhere else at the time, so we weren't hurt.
Broglie: But the years of hydrology monitoring data we've collated are all still down there...
Paimon: Well, that does sound quite serious...
Traveler: We'll take care of it.
Broglie: #Really!? Aaaah! Kind {M#sir}{F#lady}, if you can help me, I'll be in your debt for the rest of my life!
Broglie: You should know that, ever since the observation station sank, the former departments had to be reorganized, and I was transferred to the newly established Department of Hydrology and Aquatic Life Conservation!
Broglie: Not only is the department head breathing down my neck all day, but there are all these new, inexplicable rules...
Broglie: We have to report for duty on time, and we still have to make this weekly report at the end of each week! We can't even openly take our afternoon naps in the office anymore!
Broglie: Even worse, there's a woman who keeps a Blubberbeast in the office. A Blubberbeast! It's bitten me three times already!
Broglie: So, if our research data from before can be retrieved, I'll be able to think of a way to persuade my supervisor to restore the Hydrology Monitoring Department...
Broglie: That way, my colleagues and I can also be transferred back to our original posts and return to happy lives of ease...
Paimon: ?
Broglie: Ahem. I mean, return to fulfilling lives of field studies!
Traveler: So after all that, you just want to slack off, don't you?
Paimon: Yeah! Why don't you just go down there and get that stuff yourself?
Broglie: Well, this is embarrassing, but even though the Fontaine Research Institute did organize diving training sessions, we strategically held a dinner each time...
Broglie: Uh, I mean, every diving training session conflicted with our dinner reservation at Hotel Debord. What a shame!
Paimon: ...
Broglie: #A—Anyway, the advancement of the science of hydrology and the future of Fontaine are in your hands, kind {M#sir}{F#lady}!
Broglie: As for your reward, worry not — as long as you can help me recover my research, I'll do everything in my power to ensure you're adequately compensated!
Broglie: So, I'm begging you, please retrieve our precious data from the central control room for me！
Traveler: Sounds like scaremongering to me...
Traveler: That's not what I heard...

## Talk 2

Broglie: #I'm counting on you to retrieve that data, kind {M#sir}{F#lady}!

## Talk 3

Broglie: So, I'm begging you, please help me retrieve our precious data from the central control room!
Traveler: Is this what you wanted?
Broglie: Aaah... Yes, this is it, this is it! But... you haven't even gone into the water yet, how do you already have the data?
Traveler: We've been to the place before.
Broglie: I see... Thank you! That's all the data from this station now recovered!
Paimon: Well, that's good... Wait a minute, did you say "this station"?
Broglie: Yes! We have three observation stations and one central processing station in total, each with their own independent datasets.
Broglie: So, in order to convey the need for monitoring to my supervisor, the data from the remaining two stations still needs to be recovered and then analyzed at the central processing station...
Paimon: Uh, alright, Paimon will bite — do you also need us to salvage the other two stations?
Broglie: Oh, of course not! The other two observation stations were spared from the lab disaster and continue to stand proudly on solid ground!
Paimon: That's a relief...
Broglie: It's just that... those two stations have been taken over by some fellows from Snezhnaya...
Paimon: From Snezhnaya... Hang on, you're not talking about the Fatui, are you?
Broglie: That's them! They claimed that they got permission from the Maison Gestion to take over the stations. They won't let us anywhere near them, let alone retrieve the data.
Broglie: As for the Maison Gestion... As you may know, verifying anything with the Maison Gestion is harder than trying to catch lightning in a bottle.
Traveler: Sounds a little suspicious.
Paimon: Yeah, since it's the Fatui we're talking about, they might actually be planning to use the observation stations to do something bad...
Paimon: #Paimon doesn't super want to help, but... *sigh* {NICKNAME}, we should take a look just in case...
Broglie: #Thank you so much, kind {M#sir}{F#lady}! I'll mark the locations of the Pate de Fruit Station and Crepes Suzette Station on your map now!
Paimon: Aren't these all food names?
Broglie: Yes! And they do sound sweet and tasty, don't they? Just the way life ought to be!
Broglie: By the way, this place is the Conch Madeleine Station. Imagine, if you would, breaking off a small piece of Conch Madeleine, steeping it in warm water or Tisane, and drinking it all up...
Broglie: That's what our tea times were like before. *sigh* I never thought the station would end up sinking like this...
Broglie: Anyway, for me to be happy and free again... I mean, for scientific advancement and the future of humanity, I'm counting on you to help me recover that old monitoring data!
Traveler: Heh, magic...
Broglie: ?
Paimon: Come on, it wasn't magic! We just happened to go there by chance previously!
Traveler: Sounds like scaremongering to me...
Traveler: That's not what I heard...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh? Wait a minute, now that Paimon's looking at these locations, it seems like we've already been to them before...
Broglie: Huh!? Really?
Traveler: We've already sent those Fatui running for the hills.
Paimon: And, we already have that data you're looking for...
Black Screen Text: You show Broglie the paper tapes you got earlier...
Broglie: Ahhhh! Yes, this is it, this is it! You two are angels, angels sent from the heavens to save me from my misery and return me to my happy life of ease—
Paimon: Hey! What about all that science stuff?
Broglie: #Anyway, there's no time to lose, kind {M#sir}{F#lady}! Please come with me to the Fontaine Research Institute to find my supervisor and request the key to the central processing station!

## Talk 5

Broglie: Yes, that's it, that's it! All the data from this station's been recovered now!
Paimon: Well, that's good... Wait a minute, did you say "this station"?
Broglie: Yes! We have three observation stations and one central processing station in total, each with their own independent datasets.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: This looks like the central control room Broglie was talking about, right?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Great! Now we can turn the console on!
Paimon: What does the instruction manual say... Okay, next, we just need to pull that lever that says "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" on it, and we can export the recorded data...
Traveler: "Do NOT touch under any circumstances"?
Paimon: That's what the manual says. Paimon guesses to prevent other people from misusing it? Weird...
Traveler: (Pull the lever.)
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever down.
After some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
Paimon: This should be the monitoring data Broglie needs...
Paimon: Paimon can't understand any of it, but all we need is to bring it back to him and we're good, right?

Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't have a clue what's on it, but it looks pretty important...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, why don't we keep this paper tape for now? Who knows, it might come in handy later...
