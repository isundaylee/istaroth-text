# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kinich: Up to you. I have no current jobs, so I'm down for whatever.
Kinich: Would you like something to drink? Some Quenepa and Cacahuatl Juice, perhaps?
Ajaw: Whoa! Hey, me first! Gimme some of that! Gimme gimme gimme!
Traveler: And how much will this "cost" me?
Kinich: Heh. This one's free.
Kinich: In Natlan, Cacahuatl is mainly used to make chocolate and a beverage called Xocoatl. The most valuable part of the plant is the fermented seeds.
Kinich: But everything has its use. The white fleshy part can be pressed to extract the juice, which makes a delicious drink when mixed with the right ingredients.
Ajaw: Are you done with the backstory? Gimme my juice, already! I can't wait any longer!
Kinich: At first, I tried mixing it with Flamegranates, which are native to Huitztlan. The resulting drink was packed full of phlogiston, suitable for both humans and Saurians alike.
Kinich: But due to some difficulties getting hold of the ingredients, I eventually switched to Quenepa Berries instead, and tweaked the rest of the recipe accordingly.
Ajaw: Kinich! You're doing this on purpose, you never talk for this long! Especially not to explain yourself!
Ajaw: This isn't a history lesson, so cut the tangents already!
Kinich: I'm just trying to help a good friend understand this drink better, so they can appreciate it more.
Kinich: Not that you'd understand that, because you can't tell one cup of juice from another anyway. That's why I've never bothered to tell you before.
Ajaw: You little...!
Traveler: Well... Your explanation's made me curious, that's for sure!
Kinich: In that case, two cups of the juice, coming right up.
Traveler: What's that?
Kinich: A phlogiston juice blend that I created myself.
