# Attaché in Another Land


## Talk 1

Hanbei: The mushrooms here don't look too bad. I'll put them on my shopping list...
Paimon: Hanbei? Now that's a familiar name. Paimon's sure we've heard that one somewhere...
Traveler: ...Was it the guy at Tatarasuna?
Paimon: Yikes! He's the guy who made a complete mess of the Mikage Furnace!
Traveler: I think he's here as a foreign attaché...
Paimon: So he really is here in Sumeru. Paimon thought that whole foreign attaché thing was just a joke...
Hanbei: #Eh? {M#Blond}{F#Blonde} hair... and a small flying thing...
Hanbei: Are you the Traveler?
Traveler: That's right.
Hanbei: Haha, so it really is you. Yousuke's letter mentioned how you helped Mr. Xavier deal with the Mikage Furnace.
Hanbei: *sigh* I feel so ashamed. I was tied up with administrative work when the two of you were fixing the Mikage Furnace.
Traveler: Is administrative work really more important than the Mikage Furnace...
Paimon: You've got your priorities all wrong!
Hanbei: The Mikage Furnace's maintenance wouldn't have progressed so smoothly without administrative work, you know.
Hanbei: I was evacuating the people nearby, prepping the materials for repairs, redirecting the appropriate manpower, and even coordinating production...
Hanbei: All these things would have been a complete mess without administrative support.
Traveler: It's just like Toranosuke said...
Paimon: You live up to your reputation...
Hanbei: Toranosuke... That man has such blatant disregard for administrative work. I always end up with extra work when working with him.
Hanbei: But I'm not in charge of the Mikage Furnace anymore. I'm serving as foreign attaché in Sumeru now, and I manage the mushroom trade.
Hanbei: Ah, Traveler, I've heard about your deeds from Yousuke, and I do believe that you are a truly reliable person.
Hanbei: If you don't mind, could you help me with something?
Hanbei: I've been searching for a reliable mushroom supplier, and I've met with many merchants here.
Hanbei: But they always select only their best to put on display...
Hanbei: I think a visit to their farms is necessary to assess the quality of their supply.
Hanbei: But as you can see, I have no experience in conducting surveys in the wild. And I don't think I'll make it out of the forest alive if I go alone.
Hanbei: So, I would like you to help me go there and gather some mushrooms...
Traveler: Well, I can do that...
Hanbei: You'll do it? Wonderful! Don't worry about your payment, I've even prepared the contract documentation.
Hanbei: Take a look at this. Yes, this document. This is your hiring contract, compensation breakdown, and a disclosure and confidentiality agreement. Oh, I almost forgot, here's a map of the mushroom farm...
Black Screen Text: You are exhausted after carefully looking through all the documents with Hanbei...
Hanbei: Good, now you're fully informed. I'll be sending a report to the Shogunate, and we can finalize everything once I have the Shogunate's approval.
Hanbei: But I'll pay you out of my own pocket until then. After all, I can't delay this any longer.
Hanbei: Of course, I'll be filing the necessary documents for this as well. Your compensation does come with tax implications.
Traveler: I... I'm going to gather mushrooms now!
Hanbei: Eh? Oh... I'll leave it to you then.
Paimon: We won't get caught up in some trouble again, right?
Traveler: We won't if I keep an eye on him.
Paimon: Really? Okay, you do have a point...
Hanbei: Eh? Why do you look so doubtful... Don't you worry, I've made very thorough preparations, so there won't be any issues during this process.
Paimon: We're not talking about that kind of trouble... *sigh* Let's just get his mushrooms for him, shall we?
Traveler: I wonder what kind of trouble he'll cause this time.
Paimon: Hey! If that really happens, we won't have anyone to help us out here!
Traveler: Let's talk about payment first...
Traveler: This is Paimon...
Paimon: Paimon's Paimon! Not some "small flying thing"!
Traveler: I think he's here for the mushrooms...
Traveler: Toranosuke and Yousuke both mentioned him...

## Talk 2

Hanbei: So, did you manage to gather the mushrooms?

## Talk 3

Hanbei: Wonderful. This is plenty. They look pretty good too...
Hanbei: Here's your payment, thanks for the help.
Traveler: Is this before or after taxes?
Hanbei: After taxes, of course. Don't worry, I wouldn't make you go all the way back to Inazuma just to pay for overdue taxes.
Hanbei: But I can't guarantee there haven't been any changes to the Shogunate's tax policies...
Hanbei: Hmm... I should write a letter to Yousuke regarding this matter.

## Talk 4

Hanbei: Wonderful. This is plenty. They look pretty good too...
Traveler: I gathered some extra mushrooms.
Hanbei: Haha, that's great! Please give them to me too. I'll count them into your payment calculations.
Hanbei: Here's your payment, thanks for the help.
Traveler: Is this before or after taxes?
Hanbei: After taxes. Don't worry, I wouldn't make you go all the way back to Inazuma just to pay for overdue taxes.
Hanbei: That said, I can't guarantee there haven't been any changes to the Shogunate's tax policies since...
Hanbei: Hmm... I should write a letter to Yousuke regarding this matter.

## Talk 5

Hanbei: This merchant's mushroom supply doesn't look very reliable either...
Paimon: Why does he look so troubled? Has he gotten himself into some kind of trouble again?
Hanbei: Traveler, you're here. The quality of the mushrooms you gathered was really good.
Hanbei: Can I ask you to gather more for me? I plan to compare them with the mushrooms from other suppliers.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Hanbei: Thank you.
Traveler: How many suppliers have you met with?
Hanbei: Um, five or six, but their supply doesn't seem very reliable, which makes me feel rather uneasy.
Hanbei: I'll look for other suppliers, and I'll leave the mushroom gathering to you.
