# No Restoring This Past Land of Beauty


## Talk 1

Zhiping: ...Ugh, now Tianqiu Valley, too?
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Zhiping: #Oh, Traveler, it's you. Pleased to see you, though I certainly wasn't expecting to run into you today.
Zhiping: Um, anyway... have you been to Tianqiu Valley or Nantianmen lately?
Zhiping: The Guild has been receiving a constant stream of reports about earthquakes in those areas recently.
Zhiping: It was just minor tremors at first, but they've been getting more and more serious since.
Zhiping: Then, not long ago, we received word of a particularly strong earthquake that caused part of the mountains and ruins to collapse, revealing a gigantic cavern.
Zhiping: The report also mentioned that some unknown monsters have been sighted in the area. Based on the descriptions, they may well be none other than the Geovishaps and Primo Geovishaps that once terrorized Liyue...
Traveler: Do you need any help from me?
Zhiping: Well, I'd like to ask you to head to Tianqiu Valley to investigate that huge cavern and report on the impact of the earthquake on the surrounding environment.
Zhiping: As for the monsters... If it's true that they're appearing in great numbers, then we cannot afford to ignore them. We must decide on what countermeasures to take.
Zhiping: Of course, this counts as official work for the Guild, and you will be compensated accordingly. What do you think?
Traveler: I'll do it.
Zhiping: Thank you very much. Please stay safe while exploring in that area.

Zhiping: Hmm, judging by your expression... Did something happen?
Traveler: Oh, I've been there, alright...
Zhiping: Have you, now? Well, you are an elite adventurer, after all. It's no surprise that you follow the scent of danger wherever it leads you.
Traveler: So, about the Primo Geovishaps and Tianqiu Valley...
Zhiping: ...A giant cavern ruin with a Primo Geovishap within it...
Zhiping: Okay. I think I understand. Thank you for coming to me with this news. I'll handle the paperwork and make an official report to the Guild.
Traveler: What's with that area, anyway?
Zhiping: Hmm, according to some texts, Tianqiu Valley was once a prosperous settlement at some point in the ancient past.
Zhiping: As to how it came to be the way it is now, it seems to have had something to do with the rampage of an ancient dragon king...
Zhiping: There aren't a lot of details available about that incident, but legend has it that Rex Lapis and his adepti eventually imprisoned it within some sort of adepti realm.
Zhiping: Its servants then fled into the depths of the earth and entered into a deep slumber, waiting for the day when the dragon king would rise again.
Traveler: Does that mean that these monsters sightings...
Zhiping: Hahaha. Those are just folktales, you know? No one knows how true they are.
Zhiping: Regardless, these constant earthquakes and the sudden appearance of those monsters are matters that demand our immediate attention.
Zhiping: Right, please take this as your payment. Thank you for the information you provided.
