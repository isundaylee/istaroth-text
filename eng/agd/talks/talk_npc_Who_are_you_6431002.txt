Traveler: Who are you...
Rudaba: Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself.
Rudaba: I'm an Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta researcher from the Akademiya, and I'm carrying out an academic study on the rainforest.
Rudaba: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I haven't been able to hire a suitable bodyguard due to financial difficulties. So I've been temporarily limited to small-scale surveys in areas protected by the Forest Rangers.
