Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Vind: For the majority to live a life of peace, a minority of people must make great sacrifices. My family belong to this minority.
Vind: But this we have known since the day that we received orders from Lady Vennessa herself.
Vind: ...Have you heard of Barbatos Ratatouille? It is said to have been one of the dishes served at the feast held in celebration after Vennessa defeated the old aristocracy.
Vind: My forebears had the honor of dining with Vennessa that day. After the feast, an accomplished chef was invited to taste the dish and infer the recipe.
Vind: The taste is like the gentle caress of the breeze on your cheeks, and you can almost feel the peace and freedom given by Barbatos welling up inside your heart... That dish has kept our family going over the centuries as we watch out for storms, day in, day out.
Vind: ...Thank you for listening to me. In fact, here, please have the recipe. It's my pleasure to share the joy of this wonderful dish with you.
