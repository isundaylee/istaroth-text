Traveler: Miss Hiiragi?
Sasaki: As a daughter that he had in his old age, the Commissioner dotes on Miss Hiiragi. He even requested that a Chief Samurai such as myself be her personal bodyguard.
Sasaki: Heh... If I must be frank, that's truly a waste of my great talents.
Sasaki: That being said, since it's an order from the Commissioner, I shall still do my utmost.
Sasaki: Hmph, I've heard that many young punks inside the Commission have also been harboring mischievous thoughts about Miss Hiiragi...
Sasaki: ...No matter who it may be, I, Sasaki, shall not show any mercy if he oversteps his bounds.
