Traveler: About the tale of the giant sea serpent...
Kavus: #Yes, the giant sea serpent in Traveler's story sounds amazing. But there's nothing more to it now that it's already been taken down.
Kavus: I wonder if there are other giant sea serpents... If so, that'll be the moment when Captain Kavus makes his entrance!
