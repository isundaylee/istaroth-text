Traveler: What's on your mind?
Tang Wen: I'm thinking of the current situation in Inazuma and the Raiden Shogun's policies...
Tang Wen: I couldn't return to my hometown to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree. But on the other hand, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. I'm presently in Inazuma to record the changes occurring here.
Tang Wen: Hmm... Still, I've yet to reach a final conclusion regarding these policies. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must first document it completely.
Tang Wen: As such, I've decided to remain here for a while yet to witness everything with my own two eyes.
