Vilca: Next time, you could try using a soft-bristled brush instead...

Traveler: A soft-bristled brush?
Vilca: Yes, something a bit softer than your average wooden comb, better suited to taking care of fur.
Vilca: But some Saurians enjoy being brushed to have their fur groomed, but because it feels like a good old backscratch to them.
Vilca: In such circumstances, you'd be better off using a wide-tooth comb.
Vilca: Trust me, if you're looking to win a grumpy Saurian over, try giving it a brush-down! You never know, it could work wonders.
Vilca: Assuming you can get to the point where you could brush it down, of course...

Traveler: Could I give this a go too?
Vilca: Huh? ...Hmm, I suppose that might work.
