Mikhail: Hey, did you hear what the informants have been saying? Apparently, the Knights of Favonius weren't working alone when they resolved the Stormterror crisis. They had other people working in the shadows!
Lyudmila: So you're telling me there's a third faction we have to worry about now? The Fatui, the Knights of Favonius, and now these guys? This is not good news...
Mikhail: I think there's an opportunity here. The people of Mondstadt don't currently know who these mysterious actors were, so...
Mikhail: ...All we need to do is dress it up a little. Run some propaganda about how the Fatui rushed to Mondstadt's aid in their time of need, resolving the Stormterror crisis once and for all... *smug laugh*
Lyudmila: That could be risky. If they saw through the propaganda, they'd end up even more mistrustful of us...
Mikhail: There's no need to worry about the Fatui's propaganda capabilities, they know what they're doing. And in any case, given how powerful the Fatui is, who would dare question us!?
Lyudmila: Hmm... Well, I wish us the best of luck...
Mikhail: I'm telling you, everything will be fine! Stop worrying!
