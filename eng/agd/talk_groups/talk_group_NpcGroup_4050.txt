Traveler: Not books?
Sulaykha: Yep, no books. I'm a law-abiding citizen, so even if smuggling knowledge could make me rich, I still wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.
Sulaykha: After all, you can't keep making money when you're pushing up daisies.
Sulaykha: Besides, making money is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the Homayanis.
Sulaykha: Heh, if the Akademiya could have made an argument to get me to enroll that was half as convincing as my own sales pitch, I wouldn't have turned them down on the spot back then.

Traveler: Not books?
Sulaykha: Eh, books are just a non-starter. With Akasha's shutdown, the Akademiya is sure to revise the way they manage books.
Sulaykha: Not like I ever like those things anyway, so nope, those waters are not for me. I'll just stick to the basics.
Sulaykha: Besides, making Mora is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the Homayanis.
