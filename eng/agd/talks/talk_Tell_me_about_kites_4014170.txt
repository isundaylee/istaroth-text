Traveler: Tell me about kites...
Granny Shan: Ah, so you're here to buy one, are you?
Granny Shan: There's lots of new designs for this year's Lantern Rite, and some of them have come equipped with devices that will let them fly more easily...
Granny Shan: As for me, I just have some traditional patterns, and all these newfangled items do rather confuse me. If you want to buy them, you might want to drop by Zhenyuan's stall.
Granny Shan: She's my niece, and she came to Liyue Harbor from Chenyu Vale this year to do business. Young people are full of energy, but they can be prone to mistakes, so please do take care of her.
