Chevreuse: What? Never thought that the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol could come from the Fleuve Cendre?
Traveler: I have to say, I'm pretty shocked.
Chevreuse: Honestly, I'm pretty shocked, too. There used to be a time when I thought I would never be able to join the Gardes.
Chevreuse: But as long as you can distinguish yourself through your accomplishments and skills, you'll eventually be recognized for your worth.
Chevreuse: If you look at it another way, my life at Fleuve Cendre has actually taught me a lot of valuable skills.
Chevreuse: Skills like... how to barter with criminals, or how to think in their shoes.
Chevreuse: Of course, I'd appreciate it if you could keep this a secret between us.
Traveler: I'm sure that wasn't easy...
Chevreuse: You mean, rising through the ranks? It was a struggle, for sure.
