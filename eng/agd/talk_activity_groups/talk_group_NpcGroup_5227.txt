Balent: Ah, it's you. I'm very grateful for your assistance earlier.

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been?
Balent: Our most recent inspections have confirmed that the pipes are in good condition. I don't think there's anything to worry about.
Balent: The assistants Mr. Estienne brought us are also very professional. They've been a great help.

Traveler: Oh, nothing. Bye.
Balent: Have a safe journey.

## Talk

Traveler: I was asking about you, not the pipes.
Balent: Oh! I see... Thanks for your concern.
Balent: After that incident, I started studying some basic self-defense in my time off. So now, even if I run into trouble while I'm working, I should be able to escape at least.
Balent: There are some risks associated with working out here. It would be a good idea to include some fitness and self-defense skills in our staff training from now on.

Balent (???): Help... Somebody help me...
Paimon: We've gotta take care of the Hilichurls here first!
