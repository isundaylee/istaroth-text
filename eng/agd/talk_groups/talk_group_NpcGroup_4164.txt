Traveler: About the Berries...
Kamla: You must have seen my post and came here to deliver the Berries, right?
Kamla: So, did you get fifteen Berries?
Traveler: Here are the berries you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Kamla: When you're ready, then. I need dry fruit and no one would dry them one at a time, after all.

Traveler: Hello.
Kamla: Hello, friend. Well, isn't the sea beautiful?
Kamla: Do not rush your pace. Slow down and appreciate the beauty in life.
Kamla: I've been watching the waves crashing since my husband sailed out. Well, except during storms, of course.

Traveler: About your husband...
Kamla: Oh, that bastard... Well... honestly, I don't know where he's sailing right now.
Kamla: Judging by what he'd sent home, he should be safe and well, and he's been to a lot of places.
Kamla: I've got clocks from Fontaine, porcelain bowls from Liyue, dried petals from Mondstadt...
Kamla: I didn't know he could be romantic.
Kamla: But things like these can only be placed indoors. I prefer the fresh air and sea waves outside.
