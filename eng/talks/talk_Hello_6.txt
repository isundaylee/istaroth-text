# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: We've got to think carefully about where we station our police officers too... Oh, are you talking to me?
Jiangzhou: ...Hi. I'm Jiangzhou, planner for the Lantern Rite festival... Well, one of them.
Traveler: One of them?
Jiangzhou: Yes... Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
Jiangzhou: Even then, Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
Jiangzhou: And of course, the number one priority of this job is to not end up creating any new problems...
Traveler: New problems?
Jiangzhou: Yes... Sometimes due to lack of communication, one planner ends up reversing a decision made by another planner, which wastes time and resources.
Jiangzhou: For instance, I had to repeatedly stress the other day that we need to add a street light here... Huh? Where's the street light?
Jiangzhou: This is no good, I'll definitely be writing a report about this!
