Baizhu: #This place is truly perilous, Traveler... Do you have any injuries or concerning symptoms you'd like to tell me about?
Baizhu: Yes, I know you're very skilled, but just because you're not black and blue doesn't mean everything is okay. If you're not careful, fatigue will accumulate over time and catch you unawares. You must remember to stretch to relieve tension and ensure good circulation of your qi...
Baizhu (Changsheng): ...Or to put it bluntly, he's worried about you! So just lie down and let us give you a quick checkup.

Baizhu: *cough*... *cough*
Baizhu (Changsheng): Hey, are you sure you can keep going? Maybe we should take things a bit more slowly?
Baizhu: ...It's nothing serious. If I let every little setback stop me, I'd never have made it this far.

Baizhu: There are a surprising number of books here. I can't help but wonder if there are any ancient prescriptions or medical texts...
Baizhu (Changsheng): Sorry to disappoint, but I already took a look. They're pretty much all children's books.
Baizhu: Is that so... Well, some fairytales may still have therapeutic benefits in treating mood-related disorders.
