# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Environs Log

Hosseini: My, as I should have expected of you, I suppose. Now the dark mud and monsters are gone, with minimal damage to the Pursina's Spike.
Hosseini: I am most glad that you were the one Khedive got to help us out. If it were anyone else, I doubt they could have solved this issue quite so handily.
Traveler: Well, I am pretty good at what I do.
Hosseini: Indeed, that is plain to see.
Hosseini: The two miners, Tu and Hao, have headed back to rest. Looks like it'll be difficult to move the Spike back right away...
Hosseini: But clearing the mud out as we go isn't a good idea either. The closer we get to the area venting the mud, the more intense the rate at which it will just keep flowing out. We have to stop this problem directly at its source.
Hosseini: ...Looks like we need another solution.
