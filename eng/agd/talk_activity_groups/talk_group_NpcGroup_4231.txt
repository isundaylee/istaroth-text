Arakarman: Golden Nara is the same color as Nara Varuna in the story. Whose story do you want to listen to?

## Talk

Traveler: Aramuhukunda's story.
Arakarman: In the most ancient stories, Aramuhukunda had already left his mark.
Arakarman: Perhaps Aramuhukunda appeared first, then there were stories.
Arakarman: In Aramuhukunda's own story, his enemies were Big Iron Chunks that could block out the sun and cut off rivers. There was also Marana that could turn Vana into Valuka.
Arakarman: But Aramuhukunda and his partner Aradasha, together with the Golden Nara Varuna, defeated the monsters that Aranara could not defeat.
Arakarman: However, after that, Aramuhukunda was just a story, and not in Vanarana anymore.
Arakarman: Perhaps he went to a place far, far away with Nara Varuna.
Arakarman: Perhaps he was summoned to the side of Queen Aranyani.
Arakarman: Perhaps he stepped alone on the path to facing the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: #But because his story still exists, Aramuhukunda is still in Vanarana. The rivers know him, the trees know him, and even Nara Traveler now knows him.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arakarman: Go, Golden Nara. Nara's time is very precious after all.

## Talk

Arakarman: #Nara Traveler brought us many, many stories. Do you want to hear other stories?

## Talk

Traveler: Queen Aranyani's story.
Arakarman: All Aranara are children of Queen Aranyani, even Aramuhukunda.
Arakarman: Queen Aranyani loves all living things in Vana equally, whether they are Aranara, Nara, Mushrooms, or Rishboland Tigers... To Queen Aranyani, all of them are green leaves on the same tree. Whether they are from the crown of the tree, or from the lowest branches, the leaves plucked from the tree all have the same shape.
Arakarman: So all living things returned the same love to Queen Aranyani.
Arakarman: But one day, the sky turned black and the streams became as acrid as blood... Big iron chunks and large ink-black monsters were everywhere. The forest started burning too, and Marana flowed out like spring water.
Arakarman: In order to heal the world, Queen Aranyani went to a place far, far away. However, she did not return. Perhaps she turned into a tree to bear fruit that can heal the world.
Arakarman: Many Aranara only knew what the taste of sadness was like for the first time when that happened.

## Talk

Traveler: The ruler of Valuka's story.
Arakarman: What an embarrassment... Even Arakarman might not know much about the ruler of Valuka's story.
Arakarman: But Arakarman knows that the Nara of Valuka are stronger than the Nara of Vana.
Arakarman: Then the ruler of Valuka must be a very amazing ruler, even if they were not as powerful as Queen Aranyani. I heard that he built stone pillars higher than the tallest trees in Valuka.
Arakarman: But after that, Arakarman did not hear much about the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: Because bad Marana appeared in Vana, Aranara were unwilling to hear anymore about Valuka.
Arakarman: After many sunrises and moonrises, very few Aranara know that even Valuka had a ruler.

## Talk

Traveler: Aradasha's story.
Arakarman: Oh! Oooh! Arakarman likes Aradasha's story the most! Many Aranara like it too.
Arakarman: Before Aradasha, only Queen Aranyani's Ararakalari was stronger than his. After Aradasha, Aradasha's Ararakalari was the strongest.
Arakarman: But Aradasha was not powerful from the time he was a seed.
Arakarman: Aradasha cultivated slowly, starting from destroying mushrooms, all the way to shattering Big Iron Chunks. He defeated eighteen bad guys in total.
Arakarman: And every time he defeated a bad guy, there would be another story, so Aradasha's stories are the most numerous.
Arakarman: Even weak Arakarman wants to cultivate Ararakalari after hearing these stories of training.
Arakarman: Later, Aradasha joined Aramuhukunda's adventure, and had the story that all Aranara know. In the blink of an eye, the big metal monsters were dealt with.
Arakarman: But soon after, the birds and the flying flowers could find no trace of him. He must have gone with Aramuhukunda, to a place far, far away.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arakarman: Go, Golden Nara. Let new stories grow.

## Talk

Traveler: The Lord of Verdure's story.
Arakarman: All Aranara are children of the Dendro Archon, even Aramuhukunda.
Arakarman: The Dendro Archon loves all living things in Vana equally, whether they are Aranara, Nara, Mushrooms, or Rishboland Tigers... To her, all of them are green leaves on the same tree. Whether they are from the crown of the tree, or from the lowest branches, the leaves plucked from the tree all have the same shape.
Arakarman: So all living things return the same love to her.
Arakarman: But one day, the sky turned black and the streams became as acrid as blood... Big iron chunks and large ink-black monsters were everywhere. The forest started burning too, and Marana flowed out like spring water.
Arakarman: The Dendro Archon went to a land far, far away to cure the world. By the time she returned, many children had already returned to Sarva. The king of the forest, who once blessed the Aranara alongside her, had also returned to Sarva by then.
Arakarman: Many Aranara only knew what the taste of sadness was like for the first time when that happened.

Arakarman: But after that, Arakarman did not hear much about the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: Because bad Marana appeared in Vana, and Aranara were not willing to listen to people mention Valuka anymore.
Arakarman: After many sunrises and moonrises, very few Aranara know that even Valuka had a ruler.

## Talk

Arakarman: *sigh* I wish I could see Aradasha's Ararakalari again.

Arakarman: Perhaps he is waiting for us in Sarva.
Arakarman: Perhaps he stepped alone on the path to facing the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: #But because his story still exists, Aramuhukunda is still in Vanarana. The rivers know him, the trees know him, and even Nara Traveler now knows him.
