Traveler: You want to learn as well?
Kaan: Of course! Don't you want to learn it too? It's just so cool!
Kaan: You can find dance competitions at Stage Tepetl every day. I really want to join one when I grow up, so everyone can cheer for me when I win too!
Kaan: I'll work hard as I grow! One of these days, I'll grow taller than the stage and stronger than the DJ, and that'll be the day I'll beat everyone on the stage!
