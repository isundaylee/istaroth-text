Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Guanhai: Yeah, that... With Rex Lapis gone, could that mean the end for Liyue?
Guanhai: Whenever I think about it, I just lose all my drive. I can't work, I get lost in my thoughts... I just can't snap out of it.
Guanhai: What? What do you mean I was already like that?
Guanhai: Huh... Guess in that case I've already sunk about as low as one can go...
Guanhai: Yep...
Guanhai: Awesome.
