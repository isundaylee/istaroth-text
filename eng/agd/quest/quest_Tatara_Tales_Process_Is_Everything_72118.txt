# Tatara Tales: Process Is Everything


## Talk 1

Xavier: Finally! At long last, it is done! Fortunately, I remember these specifications...
Traveler: So, we're going in to purify the Tatarigami energy, then?
Xavier: Well, as much as I would love to get in there and wrap this up, we must not act so rashly when faced with the Tatarigami.
Xavier: Moreover, some of the required materials I simply could not find, so I had to make do with some last-minute substitutions. The result being that the reliability of this device is somewhat...
Xavier: Hmm. Well, let me just say that "in some circumstances, it may not achieve the desired efficacy."
Xavier: It can be used normally just fine, yes, but I doubt that it can withstand any accidents. The slightest jolt will likely knock some of the components out of place...
Xavier: As such, we still require a little more preparation before we can put our new friend here to work.
Xavier: I'd like you to go near the Mikage Furnace and record some data for me.
Traveler: Consider it done.
Xavier: Thank you very much. I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: Do we really need to be so cautious?
Xavier: Of course we do. To tell you the truth, I'm already cutting out quite a few steps here compared to the proper protocol. If Mr. Flois were here, it would be another week before we'd finish working through his process.
Xavier: Anyway, desperate times call for desperate measures, and as representative of the project review panel, technically this is my call... so, I hereby authorize us to adapt our approach to suit the situation.

## Talk 2

Xavier: I wonder if Inazuma did appointed a project manager for this whole Mikage Furnace business...

## Talk 3

Xavier: So, have you scouted the situation out?
Traveler: That I have.

## Talk 4

Xavier: Great! Let me see...
Xavier: We're in luck, it seems. The Mikage Furnace is quite stable, and the energy within is not yet over-saturated.
Xavier: At this level of concentration, my device will still hold out.
Traveler: Do we need to purify all that energy?
Xavier: If this device could do that, why, I would have applied for a patent long ago. But our fine friend here can only decrease the energy level in a localized area.
Xavier: However, the reason for the deactivation of the Mikage Furnace and the failure of even its auto-restart program is the high saturation of Tatarigami energy.
Xavier: As long as we find the area with the highest concentration and purify it, we should be able to restart the core.
Xavier: At that point, the Mikage Furnace should restart, and beyond that point, any further issues will not be our concern.
Xavier: That's the plan. But before we execute it, I still have a few final preparations to make.

## Talk 5

Xavier: The Fatui are acting more and more strangely. They seem to be gathering around the core of the furnace.
Xavier: Hopefully, they aren't hatching some other dastardly plot. Or should I say, trying to do something that we won't be able to mitigate...
