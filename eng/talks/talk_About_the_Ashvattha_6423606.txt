Traveler: About the Ashvattha...
Arakavi: A long, long time later, there will definitely be new Nara friends coming to Vanarana.
Arakavi: But the future Nara will not have to go to the Ashvattha to look for the melodies of today.
Arakavi: Because all Aranara and the leaves and soil of Vana will remember this Festival Utsava, remember the golden song.
