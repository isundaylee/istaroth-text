Traveler: How's your recent catches been?
Delaroche: Ah! The God of Victorious Linebreaking! We meet again!
Delaroche: I've been steadily improving my bait recently, and think I've come a long way. I've even caught several... somewhat larger fish!
Delaroche: I still don't think I've managed to create the ideal bait, however, so I don't have anything to give you...
Delaroche: But please, don't worry! At this rate, I know I'll be able to recreate that wonderful bait sooner or later!
