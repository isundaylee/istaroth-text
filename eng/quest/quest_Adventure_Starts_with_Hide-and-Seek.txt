# Adventure Starts with Hide-and-Seek


## Talk 1

Little You: *sigh* It got away, again... Ah! Stranger danger!

## Talk 2

Traveler: I can help you.
Little You: Thanks for the offer, but I can do it.
Little You: I'm the one my whole family worries about, and I've had enough of it.
Little You: If I prove I'm as smart as my big brother then Granddad will stop worrying about me, and so will Mommy and Daddy, who work far away from home.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. What are you chasing?
Little You: My shadow. Everyone says I won't be able to catch it, including my big brother.
Little You: Little Liu, Little Xing, and Dongdong always want to play that but everyone wants to hide and no one wants to seek.
Little You: Okay, first we'll go hide and then the game will start. No peeking! ...Wait, I still need to tell the others...
Little You: #QUICK! HIDE! {M#HE}{F#SHE}'S COMING!!!

## Talk 4

Little You: Hee-hee, d'you think you'll find them all?

## Talk 5

Dongdong: Wow, you're SO good at this game! I lose...

## Talk 6

Little Xing: *sigh* Rats! I'm no good at this game...

## Talk 7

Little Xing: Is anyone still hiding?
