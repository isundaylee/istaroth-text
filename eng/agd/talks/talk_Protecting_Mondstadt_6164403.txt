Traveler: Protecting Mondstadt?
Helen: Well of course! Ever since I started performing my songs here, everything in Mondstadt has really cleared up. Obviously that's because of my efforts, right?
Helen: Maybe I'm a bard blessed by Barbatos... Hehehe...
Helen: ...You know, I bet if Barbatos was a bard, our skills would be equally matched!
