# The Gourmet Supremos: The Deep Divers


## Talk 1

Xudong: The Seagrass here is pretty good...
Parvaneh: I wouldn't call this "picking Seagrass." It's more like "pulling Seagrass"...
Julie: If we used a small knife, we'd get them all in no time.

## Talk 2

Xudong: We can't go down there like this...
Traveler: What happened?
Xudong: Traveler, we meet again! We're currently trying to figure out how to... dive into the waters in front of us.
Xudong: We're going to grab ourselves some fresh Seagrass to make something known as "Onigiri."
Traveler: Couldn't you just get those from the seaside?
Xudong: We could, but the Seagrass there generally isn't that fresh. There's always a little something missing in the flavor of dishes you make that way.
Xudong: I've asked around, and the locals say that good-quality Seagrass grows down here.
Xudong: But when we arrived today, we found that it had been completely flooded with seawater.
Xudong: Even worse, none of us have any skill in diving, so we can only watch this all play out...
Traveler: Are there any related mechanisms nearby?
Julie: There's one over there...
Xudong: But it's stuck inside that barrier again, so we can't get in.
Xudong: *sigh* We'll continue trying to figure this out...
Xudong: Still, Traveler, do tell us if you know anything about how to solve this problem.
Xudong: Of course, it would be best if you could just bring the Seagrass to us directly—
Parvaneh: Mr. Xudong?
Xudong: *cough* I mean, you will be well-compensated if you could bring us the Seagrass directly! I'll add on a great feast of Onigiri as further incentive!
Parvaneh: Onigiri, "a great feast," pick one...
Xudong: Oh, come on, we just need to make more... *cough* Oh fine, fine. Let's keep trying to figure it out, shall we?
Traveler: Must you go diving?
Xudong: Seagrass found by the seaside generally isn't that fresh. There's always a little something missing in the flavor of dishes you make that way.

## Talk 3

Xudong: Have you gathered any Seagrass, Traveler?
Xudong: Aha, yes, this is it. Thanks for your help, Traveler!
Xudong: Well, time to make that dish that they call... Onigiri, was it? I've heard that it's a simple enough dish to make...
Xudong: Alright, hang on while I prepare the food. It's going to take a while.

## Talk 4

Xudong: Now then. Seagrass... Fish... and Rice...
Xudong: This should be how it goes...
Xudong: Yup, that should be it! I present to you all, the Onigiri!
Parvaneh: How very... plain. Well, I'll take this one. I doubt I could finish any more...
Julie: Well, I say it's all good as long it tastes good! I'll have this one!
Xudong: This serving's yours, Traveler — and of course, here's a copy of the recipe.
Xudong: They seem like the most simple thing in the world, these Onigiri, but there's some real technique to making them well.
Xudong: Well then. I should have some myself. All that work's made me hungry...
Xudong: Hey, Parvaneh, I thought you said you couldn't finish!? Leave some for me, come on!

## Talk 5

Xudong: Are we really going to have to find a way to dive down there?
Parvaneh: Can't we switch locations? Do we really have to get our Seagrass here...
Julie: Oh, come on, why does that mechanism have to be inside that barrier again...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Julie: Hmm... There wouldn't be any ruins beneath this place by any chance, right?
Parvaneh: R—Ruins? Well, it certainly would be nice if there were...

### Additional Talk 2

Xudong: It looks like the area below has been flooded before...
Julie: Yup, and the water marks very obvious, too. This place was definitely flooded up till not long ago.
Julie: But why did the water suddenly retreat...
Parvaneh: Ugh, this place is all wet. The water's going to get into my shoes...
Xudong: Well, forget it. Let's just gather some Seagrass as quickly as we can.
Traveler: What are you doing over here?
Xudong: Oh? Would you look at that! So we meet again, Traveler.
Xudong: We just went down to collect some Fresh Seagrass to make a dish known as Onigiri. It was pretty tough going down there. My shoes are soaked...
Xudong: But that aside, Traveler, could you help us get some more Seagrass?
Xudong: The area below seems to have been flooded not long ago, and while the water has retreated, there's no telling when it might come rushing back in again.
Xudong: As such, I think it might be best to gather a bit more Seagrass as quickly as we can.
Traveler: No problem.
Xudong: We're counting on you, Traveler.
Xudong: Once you've gathered the Seagrass, please bring them back to me.
Traveler: Not going to pick some from the seaside?
Xudong: We could, but the Seagrass there generally isn't that fresh. There's always a little something missing in the flavor from dishes you make that way.
Xudong: The quality of the Seagrass here should be superior by far. Either way, we'll need your help, Traveler.
Xudong: Once you've gathered the Seagrass, please bring them back to me.
