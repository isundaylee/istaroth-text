# Daydream Club: Thermal Hypnosis


## Talk 1

Grispan: So this is... an Embercore Flower. Not bad, Not bad at all. It'll come in handy, I'm sure.
Grobel: Meow, meow?
Grispan: My dear President, I fear this flower isn't amenable to being cultivated in Fontaine.
Grispan: But if you insist, perhaps we could use it as a bookmark?

## Talk 2

Grobel: Meow, meow-meow-meow, meow-meow-meow, meow.
Grispan: No worries, President. I will keep the introductions short... Ah, you must forgive my mouth for prattling on and on. I do not have another to discipline it with, after all.
Grispan: #Simply put, Traveler, I would like you to help me collect objects that contain "phlogiston."
Grispan: Let me think... Um, so I've been using Candlecap Mushrooms for phlogiston extraction, so, could I get you to help me find some?
Grispan: That said, I've heard that Embercore Flowers also contain lots of phlogiston... It'd be nice if you could get me one as well!
Grispan: So long as I have enough phlogiston, I can start my research right here.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Let's go together, shall we?
Grispan: Together, you say? Even better! I've been champing at the bit to do some fieldwork. And with you here, the risks involved may as well be null and void.
Grispan: #Come then, let us go. Ah, yes. {M#Mr.} {F#Ms.} Traveler?
Grispan: #Then, Madame President... You stay right here. Do not worry! With Mr. Traveler here, my personal safety is guaranteed!
Grobel: Meow... meow meow... meow...
Grispan: Err, I almost forgot to say that I've marked a certain location on your map. The Candlecap Mushrooms there will more than do!

## Talk 4

Grispan: My, oh my, you are most famous indeed! An honor to meet you both at last!
Grobel: Meow, meow-meow.
Grispan: And Madame President bids you good day also. Had we met in Petrichor, I would have gladly treated you to a lovely cup of tea.
Grispan: But at the moment... Well, let's just say there's not even any tea to be had.
Paimon: Err, did you run into any trouble? You're pouring with sweat...
Traveler: Quite understandable. Natlan is pretty hot.
Grispan: Haha! A gladsome meeting this is! You are the first, and only, person I've met here who shares my sense of humor.
Grispan: Yet Natlan's heat cannot compare to my inner anxiety. That all my troubles should have struck at once...
Grispan: Not only have I not gathered enough phlogiston, but I have even lost contact with my hometown.
Grispan: #I know it is rude to commission someone to do a task after meeting them for the first time, dear Traveler.
Grispan: But I do need someone I can rely on — and you are, without a doubt, the best candidate I could ask to find in that regard.

## Talk 5

Grispan: Ha! Take a look at this Grainfruit! It sure is growing well... Might it, too, be affected by phlogiston? I must pick it! It shall join my samples.
Grispan: #Mr. Traveler, would you mind helping me out? Just take the stem and...
Traveler: Look out behind you!
Grispan: Ah!? H—Help!
Traveler: Let go of that! Over here!

## Talk 6

Grobel: Meow... meow meow... meow...

## Talk 7

Grispan: #Ah, my good Mr. Traveler. We meet again.
Grispan: Thanks to your help previously, my research has advanced by a leap and a bound.
Grispan: At this rate, I shall be able to reach my intended targets!
Traveler: And what were those intended targets?
Grispan: Oh, I didn't introduce my work to you? Ah, goodness, would you believe that? Come then, let me give you a quick rundown...
Grobel: Meow! Meow-meow-meow-meow. Meow-meow!
Grispan: Ah, right you are, Madame President. I shall make this as brief as I can.
Grispan: Simply put, I am planning to collect phlogiston, and use its "thermal energy" to conduct hypnosis.
Grispan: My hypnotic device is not on hand at the moment... But, if you would, imagine a box half a person in height, just large enough for a person to sit within.
Grispan: This box contains a steamer that, well, constantly generates steam, keeping the box's internal temperature at a specified value.
Grispan: The person undergoing hypnosis will sit within with their head exposed while their body is heated up inside... I believe that this will allow the hypnosis to work faster and better!
Traveler: That's just going to knock the person out with the heat!
Grispan: Well, you do have a point, but we perhaps have different definitions of "knocking a person out"...
Grispan: In any case, let us put aside the finer details for now. At the moment, I still need your help.
Grispan: The task is the same as before. I'd like you to help me collect objects that contain "phlogiston."
Grispan: Let me think... Hmm, I'd say you should bring some Embercore Flowers. Those plants certainly do contain a significant amount of phlogiston.
Grispan: Of course, Candlecap Mushrooms remain important as experimental material. You see...
Traveler: What do you need from me this time?
Grispan: Ah, very sharp! I knew that you'd be easy to work with.

## Talk 8

Grispan: Oh! This is it! The Candlecap Mushroom. H—How wonderful!
Grobel: Meow, meow... meow, meow?
Grispan: Do not fret, Madame President, I shall not be eating any of this... Not until we are done here, anyway.

## Talk 9

Traveler: This is Paimon.

## Talk 10

Grispan: Well, this place sure is a hot spot... How are you feeling, my good President?
Grobel: Meow.
Grispan: Alas, I am sorry. I fear Este and Mécantre have yet to reply in writing.
Grispan: I wonder what has befallen the town... and yet, I cannot simply pack up and go back now...
Traveler: You don't look like you're from around here.
Grispan: And I could say the same to you. Greetings. Grispan's the name, of meager Fontaine Daydream Club fame.
Grispan: And this is our club President... or would "Director" be more appropriate? Either way, this is our leader, Lady Grobel.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Are you a member of the Daydream Club?
Paimon: Eh? Wait, didn't we hear Este and the others talk about someone named "Grispan"?
Grispan: You've been to our Club? Oh sweet springs of Lucine, some luck at last!
Grispan: Do you know what's happened over there, by any chance? I've sent letter after letter, yet received no response!
Traveler: About what happened in Petrichor...
Black Screen Text: You update Grispan on what befell Petrichor in his absence...
Grispan: Oh... Wow, uh... That truly is... quite shocking.
Grobel: Meow... Meow meow. Meow.
Grispan: Indeed, Madame President. I am truly most shooketh.
Grispan: I can't believe it! I missed out on a mass hypnosis of such a colossal scale! By the sweet waters of Lucine!
Grispan: Had I been there, I'd have been able to collect a whole bunch of useful experimental data!
Grispan: Madame President, it seems that we must finish up here as soon as is humanly possible, so that we may head back to the Club to check on things.
Grispan: #Ahem... Now, then, I know it is rude to commission someone to do a task after meeting them for the first time, dear Traveler...
Grispan: But I do need someone I can rely on — and you are, without a doubt, the best candidate I could ask to find in that regard.

## Talk 12

Traveler: #Hi, I'm Traveler.

## Talk 13

Grispan: #My thanks for the helping hand, Mr. Traveler.
Grispan: Ah, this was a thrilling adventure, wasn't it? A good thing I convinced the President to remain with the tribe.
Grispan: With how much she hates such unexpected incidents, I should hate to be on the receiving end of one of her scoldings.
Grispan: Still, considering that I still managed to scrounge up sufficient materials... All's well that ends well, hmm?
Grispan: #These are for you, Mr. Traveler — thanks again for your help.
Grispan: Once my research succeeds, I'd be happy to have you be the first to experience "thermal hypnosis."

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Both species will do, right?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: How much have you gathered already?
Grispan: Me? Hahaha... We've gotten off to a "fine" start, that's for sure.
Grispan: *sigh* But there's nothing I can do about that. The Saurians swarming the wilds of Natlan are generally not the conversational types.
Grispan: Now, I can handle deactivating machines remotely, and can disable ones that have gone haywire... But there's nothing I can do about Saurians!
Grobel: Meow meow. Meow...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: There are other adventurers in Natlan, you know.
Grispan: I... Ah, I mean no offense, but I really am not good at dealing with the good ladies and gentlemen of Natlan.
Grispan: Their enthusiasm would know no shame even if compared to a volcano, but alas, I fear I should be vaporized on the spot should I get too close...
Grispan: #So you are the only one I can count on, Mr. Traveler!
Grobel: Meow meow. Meow...

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Alright, leave it to me.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Alright then, leave it to me.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: I'll do it for Garcia.

### Additional Talk 7

Grispan: Wonderful! I shall be counting on you, then! In the meantime, I shall be here perfecting my phlogiston extraction plan. There are yet many instruments that await my redesigning, too.
Grispan: Yet, it shall all be worth it! As long as I extract what it is I desire, I can finally return to my hometown and continue researching in peace.

### Additional Talk 8

Grispan: Many thanks! Once my research succeeds, I'd be happy to have you be the first to experience "thermal hypnosis."
Grobel: Meow! Meow meow, meow!
Grispan: What do you mean, Madame President? My thermal hypnosis is perfectly safe! No side effects at all!
Grispan: #Now then, Mr. Traveler — my good night's sleep and burning phlogiston are in your capable hands.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Let's go together, shall we?
Grispan: Of course. A couple of things did go wrong in our previous field study, but I learned a lot from it all the same.
Grobel: Meow, meow...
Grispan: #Um... Then you stay right here, Madame President. Do not worry! With Mr. Traveler here, my personal safety is guaranteed!
Grobel: Meow... meow meow... meow...

### Additional Talk 10

Grispan: Have you found what I need?

### Additional Talk 11

Grispan: #Now, we have enough material to restart the experiments. Thank you once again, Mr. Traveler.
Grispan: Please, take this as compensation for your help.
Grobel: Meow, meow meow, meow.
Grispan: Our dear President thanks you as well. Once my research succeeds, I'd be willing to engrave your name upon the first thermal hypnosis device.
Grispan: Alright, then! It's time for some practical tests. Now, where should we conduct those...
