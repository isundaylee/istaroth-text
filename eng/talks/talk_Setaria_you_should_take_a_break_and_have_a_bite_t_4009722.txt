Candace: Setaria, you should take a break and have a bite to eat.
Candace: Setaria?
Setaria: Ah, thank you! Sorry, I was completely absorbed in what I was doing, I didn't even hear your voice...
Candace: It's alright. I'm glad that you enjoy the work you're doing.
Setaria: Sorry you've ended up having to babysit me... I'm sure you have far more important things to do.
Candace: Well, Rahman's busy with the Eremites these days. But having me stand in as your bodyguard must be a welcome breath of fresh air for you?
Candace: It's a change for me, too â€” my first time working as a bodyguard. I'm just treating it as a chance to get a taste of Dehya's line of work.
Setaria: I tried telling Mahamatra Cyno that I can work unsupervised. Really, this ought to be the last of his worries...
Setaria: He said that educators willing to work in the desert are an extremely rare breed, so I need a bodyguard for protection at all times... I think he's being a little overprotective.
Candace: But at the end of the day, that's why we know we can count on the General Mahamatra. He and I are of the same mind in this case, so I am very happy to protect you.
Candace: While you're in Aaru Village, we're partners. We don't want to cause you any unnecessary pressure. So please, try to enjoy your time here.
