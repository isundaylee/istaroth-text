# A Guest From Liyue


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wait, isn't that Tubby? What's she doing in The Cat's Tail!?
Paimon: Tuuubbyyy...!
Traveler: Hey, Tubby!
Tubby: Ah, it's you two.
Paimon: What are you doing here? ...Wait, and how'd you get out of the Serenitea Pot? You can do that?
Tubby: Of course I can... Ah, but this is your first time seeing me outside of the teapot realm, isn't it?
Tubby: Although the adepti created teapot spirits primarily to manage and maintain their teapot realms, our movements are not restricted to those domains.
Tubby: For instance, there's Chubby— I'm sorry, "Jade Seeker," who travels far and wide to gather the rarest treasures in the land.
Tubby: *sigh* But it is true that I, in contrast, rarely leave the teapot realm at all.
Paimon: Ah. Paimon gets it now.
Paimon: Huh, well since you so rarely leave, what's the occasion today?
Traveler: I'm guessing you didn't come for a drink?
Tubby: As curious as I am to know how the drinks here differ from those in Liyue, no — in fact, I was sent here for a reason.
Paimon: What reason is that?
Tubby: #Um... and as it happens, it has something to do with {NICKNAME}, too.
Traveler: ...How so?
Tubby: Well, as I'm sure you've discovered, with the rising popularity of Genius Invokation TCG, inviting a friend to a duel in the tavern has become a fun way to pass the time.
Tubby: There's just one little problem. Many invitees currently have to travel an enormous distance to get here, turning the whole thing into quite an ordeal. I have therefore been sent here to create a little game room using the same adeptus art as is used to construct teapot realms.
Tubby: That way, anyone with an invitation will need only to think the thought, and they will instantly appear in the game room.
Tubby: You will be free to use the room whenever you wish to invite a friend to duel, and it will be far more straightforward for them to take you up on the offer.
Paimon: Wow. This'll make things much easier!
Paimon: But... What if Margaret finds out? She's not gonna get mad at you for renovating her tavern with your adeptus arts, is she...?
Tubby: Umm... That shouldn't be a problem, since the realm will not be physically located within The Cat's Tail. Besides, we obviously sought the owner's permission in advance...
Tubby: She was quite enthusiastic: "Ooh, Liyue's adepti arts sound pretty useful! Could you double the size of the tavern while you're at it?" ...Unfortunately, my mastery of adeptus arts is not sufficient to achieve this.
Paimon: Huh... Yeah, that does sound like something Margaret would say...
Tubby: Anyway, it's great that you're here — I was expecting to have to wait until your next visit to the teapot realm to fill you in.
Tubby: Right then. Let's get started.
Tubby: Okay, that should do it.
Tubby: #Over to you, {NICKNAME}. Now you can invite friends to duel with you in this room, wherever in the world they are. I hope it serves you well.
Tubby: ...Oh, and I almost forgot. A guy from the tavern wanted me to say this to you:
Tubby: Hope you'll have fun playing Genius Invokation TCG!
Traveler: Not to play cards, I'll bet.
Tubby: Indeed not, although it may surprise you to learn that the reason I was sent here still has to do with the card game.
Black Screen Text: Tubby uses her adeptus arts to remodel the tavern and update the match invitation board.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh? There's a strange new customer in the tavern!
Tubby: Hmm?
Paimon: #Look, look, {NICKNAME} it's a huge finch!
Tubby: Excuse me, I am not a finch! My name is...
Tubby: Um... Oh dear, it seems... No, I can't quite remember my name. You can just call me "Tubby," I suppose.
Paimon: Well, hey Tubby. Don't think we've seen you around Mondstadt before...
Tubby: That's because it's highly unusual for me to be in Mondstadt at all. I actually came here all the way from Liyue...
Paimon: So... How come you came all this way just to visit The Cat's Tail?
Traveler: I'm guessing you didn't come for a drink?
Tubby: As curious as I am to know how the drinks here differ from those in Liyue, no — in fact, I was sent here for a reason.
Paimon: What reason is that?
Tubby: #Um... and if I am guessing correctly, and you are indeed {NICKNAME}... then as it happens, it has something to do with you, too.
Traveler: ...How so?
Tubby: Well, as I'm sure you've discovered, with the rising popularity of Genius Invokation TCG, inviting a friend to a duel in the tavern has become a fun way to pass the time.

Paimon: Huh... Yeah, that does sound like something Margaret would say...
Tubby: Anyway, it's great that you're here. I was racking my brains trying to think how to get in touch with you after setting everything up.
Tubby: Right then. Let's get started.
Tubby: Okay, that should do it.
Paimon: Whoa, just like that? Liyue's adepti arts are pretty nifty.
Tubby: Mm-hmm... You know, I have a feeling that we will meet again someday. Who knows when — but we will find out when that time comes.
Tubby: #Over to you, {NICKNAME}. Now you can invite friends to duel with you in this room, wherever in the world they are. I hope it serves you well.
