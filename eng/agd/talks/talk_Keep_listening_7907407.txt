Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Clanche: His friends looked at each other, knowing that the north wind was shrouded in self-doubt and anxiety. But for their friend's sake, they needed to come up with something.
Clanche: And so they told the north wind to blow upon them once more as he pleased â€” that this time, they'd take care of everything on the ground.
Clanche: And thus the saddened north wind set out, still half-mired in doubt. Once more did he blow across the plains, through the forests, and over the lakes.
Clanche: As he looked down, he saw his friends waving at him. All was in order, with not the slightest spot of a mess.
Clanche: Only then did the north wind see clearly that the petals he had blown away were filled with tiny seeds, and that new shoots could grow only after the withered yellow leaves had been blown down.
Clanche: And as for that hat... Well, if nothing else, it succeeded in warning the rushing gentleman that the weather had shifted, and with it, so should his choice of clothes.
