Traveler: Tell me more about Xiao Lantern making.
Manager Xiao: Xiao Lantern making is a traditional craft form at Lantern Rite. It's quite technical, you need to cut the paper, insert the wick, add wish sticks, paint it...
Manager Xiao: ...Overwhelmed? Don't give up just yet. Fortunately, only previous generations had to make them that way.
Manager Xiao: These days, if you know how to use a Crafting Bench it makes things much easier.
Manager Xiao: Hopefully, the gods don't think that cheapens the wishes we make.
Manager Xiao: The Crafting Bench is over there. Why not give it a try? Lantern Rite only comes once a year.
