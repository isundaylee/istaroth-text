Traveler: Tell me about art...
Vaneigem: As you know, we often invite artists to perform here at our restaurant. The most popular of these are the magical performers Mr. Lyney and Ms. Lynette.
Vaneigem: "Art is the key ingredient in fine dining" â€” this is something that I believe in most strongly, and I hope that the cultural atmosphere here shall spread far and wide.
