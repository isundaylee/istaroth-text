Traveler: About the Sabzeruz Festival...
Parisa: The Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity â€” the Dendro Archon.
Parisa: It is said that in the ancient past, the Goddess of Flowers would dance at the Dendro Archon's birthday, and the Padisarahs would bloom across the stage...
Parisa: Thus, we call the Dendro Archon's birthday celebration the "Sabzeruz Festival."
