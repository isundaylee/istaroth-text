Traveler: To the desert?
Honorine: A certified engineer such as myself, repairing little clockwork meka day in, day out. What kind of sense does that make?
Honorine: The moment I think upon those magnificent Khaenri'ahn machines, my heart flies upon those thoughts into the depths of the desert...
Honorine: My regression is unbearable, but the progress of my colleagues by contrast burns my heart all the more! Ah, Hautemontagne's research in Liyue is progressing in leaps and bounds, surely!
Honorine: Ahh! I must, I must go into the desert!
