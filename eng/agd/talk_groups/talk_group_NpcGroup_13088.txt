The Cage-Maker: Elyctra... How can I avenge you...
Traveler: Another round with Paimon?
The Cage-Maker: Huh? Are you using me as some kind of free training dummy?
The Cage-Maker: How dare you! You're going down this time!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
The Cage-Maker: Hah! Don't even think about prying Grandmaster Hanakado's secrets out of me!
The Cage-Maker: All you need to know is that Grandmaster Hanakado has the ability to let people see the error of their ways, and enable them to appreciate the beauty of beetle fighting!
Paimon: "Error of their ways"? You sound so melodramatic...
The Cage-Maker: No! At that time, I was obsessed with woodworking, and completely did not consider how to bring the value of my woodworking skills into play.
The Cage-Maker: Then I saw my cousin's second cousin's uncle's childhood friend's nephew, Elyctra really get into beetle fighting. And I tried to stop him...
The Cage-Maker: Luckily, he brought me to see Grandmaster Hanakado. After listening to his speech, I saw how awesome beetle fighting is, and how naive I was!
The Cage-Maker: From then on, I started getting into beetle fighting, and put my lifelong woodworking skills into making insect cages to fully support Elyctra and Grandmaster Hanakado.
The Cage-Maker: Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon, you should also listen to Grandmaster Hanakado's speech, and then work for him!
Paimon: No way! Paimon is scared just hearing you say those things!
Paimon: Don't use such big words. Bull-chucâ€”, uhh, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King's words sound so much better!
The Cage-Maker: Ugh, why did I even bother talking to you two? Go then, wallow in your ignorance!
Traveler: Bye!
The Cage-Maker: Off you go!
