## Talk

Anaka: Mommy said that kids can't go on long trips, and forbade me from going with Daddy to Petrichor... Am I being too good a kid?

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...?
Anaka: I'm Anaka! Do you play music well? I love all things music!
Anaka: Daddy's an awesome, awesome scholar, and music's part of his research!
Anaka: He says that he'll bring me back a gift from Petrichor... Although what I really wanted was to go out there with him...

## Talk

Traveler: Petrichor?
Anaka: Petrichor's on the other side of this sea, and it's a town full of "music." I'd so love to go there, even if it was only in my dreams.
Anaka: Daddy took the boat over to that town, and Uncle Giustino also took a boat to come over here.
Anaka: I'm the only one bumming about here. Gah, it's so boring...
Anaka: Uncle Giustino's told me that kids in Fontaine can ride an aquabus and even listen to music beneath the waves. Is it true?

## Talk

Traveler: You should always listen to your Mom.
Anaka: ...Alright. Ah, if only I could wake up tomorrow and be old enough to travel already.

## Talk

Traveler: Yes, but...
Anaka: Ah, Mommy also does that a lot! Y'know, starting the second half of her sentence with "but."
Anaka: I wish I could tell her that you can mess with kids... but only up to a point.

## Talk

Traveler: Giustino sometimes tells fibs too.
Anaka: Oh, so you know him too? Has he tricked you, then?
Anaka: Huh. I didn't think he was a fibber... He seems like a good person to me.
Anaka: I guess there's just a whole bunch of things in this world that we kids don't get.
Anaka: Still, why would Uncle Giustino have come over here if Petrichor was so awesome...?
