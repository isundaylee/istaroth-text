# Missing title (3110042167)

Traveler: Are you bored?
Sharp: Of course. After chasing the monsters away, I have absolutely nothing to do.
Sharp: Earlier, the young master asked me to help him pick some flowers, but he and that young lady started getting all lovey-dovey right away...
Sharp: What need do they have for flowers? I reckon the young master's forgotten all about it already.
Sharp: Do you want them? Just take them if you do. They're no use to me, anyhow.
