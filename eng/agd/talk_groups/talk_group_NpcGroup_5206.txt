Traveler: About Welfare Meals...
Wolsey: They aren't just free. They also provide unexpected surprises to liven up our monotonous lives. Great, huh?
Wolsey: Although according to feedback surveys, people have been asking for more variety, and to increase the ratio of delicious meals...
Wolsey: And some people want a points system. Eat five bad meals in a row, get one good meal of your choice, that kind of thing...
Wolsey: But behind every bad meal, there's a chef who made that meal. And I think we should give those chefs and their subpar cooking a chance.
Wolsey: So as for those suggestions... I'll have to think on it a bit more.

Traveler: About the Fortune Slips...
Wolsey: We ask everyone to help write the fortunes. Sometimes we all need a little pep talk and a little courage from people in the same circumstances as us.
Wolsey: Although we have had problems with people trying to write inappropriate fortunes to stir up trouble... It's a real headache.
Wolsey: I'm just trying to do something nice for everyone, but now I have to waste my time checking all the fortunes.
Wolsey: Thankfully, none of them have caused any major problems... But if any fortunes end up causing me misfortune, then the cost will have exceeded the benefits.

Traveler: About Bran...
Wolsey: It was broken even before work stopped at the Geode Mine Shaft, so there was even less reason to fix it afterwards. As a result, it was just sitting there, broken, in the abandoned production zone, for who knows how long...
Wolsey: After Camden started complaining about the strange sounds it was making disturbing his naps, I brought it back here to fix it up. Then I found a job for it.
Wolsey: I'm quite the mechanic, you know. I bet I could teach those kids at the Fontaine Research Institute a thing or two.
