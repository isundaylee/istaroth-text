Traveler: Use scissors to... stab sea beasts?
Elham: Ahaha, that's... purely by accident.
Elham: One time, when I was a child, I was playing on the beach, when a sea beast attacked me.
Elham: I was playing house and making clothes with small scissors, and all of a sudden a huge sea beast charged at me.
Elham: I didn't think twice and stuck my scissors into its eyes...
Elham: The sea beast ran away immediately after getting hurt. I didn't know what was going on, but the people on the beach held me up and gave me the title of Sea Beast Killer...
Elham: To this day, people still thank me for what I did back then. Perhaps that's why they visit my tailor store so often.
