Traveler: Please be careful.
Hanayama Kaoru: Thanks. It's a good thing there are no monsters nearby.
Hanayama Kaoru: Even though there are no monsters about... I did see a strange person when I was out picking flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: He just sat there staring into space, sword in hand, and he seemed to be mumbling about something...
Hanayama Kaoru: I was a little startled, so I just peeked from a distance before leaving.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm not sure if he's still there, but he felt dangerous. Best I stay away from him...
