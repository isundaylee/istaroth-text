# Echoes of Life


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're back! We found Kachina's Ancient Name, too!
Traveler: What happened at the Stadium?
Mavuika: Well... It's fairly complicated. Let me give you the condensed version.
Black Screen Text: You learn of the Pyro Archon's battle against The Captain, as well as her sacrifice.
Paimon: The Fatui again! We can't go anywhere without them causing trouble!
Mualani: But, what if the Fatui finds out you've lost your power? Won't they try to take advantage of the situation?
Mavuika: Haha, that's why it has to be our little secret. No one else can know, or we're asking for trouble.
Mavuika: Look, I wish I could offer you some sort of consolation, but I won't lie to you — with multiple factions closing in, there's nothing comforting about the situation we're facing.
Mavuika: Still, all you need to do is to focus on your goal. You can leave the complicated matters to me.
Iansan: I can also step in on the Pyro Archon's behalf. There's a limit to what I can accomplish, but I'll help you however I can...
Mavuika: Hahaha, there's no need to be so modest, Iansan. Your incredible strength has long been a well-known fact. You're the pride of your tribe.
Mualani: Archon, I... I'm sorry about before. You have so much on your plate, so much that you have to worry about, but all I could do was focus on my own feelings.
Mavuika: You have nothing to be sorry about. We all get overwhelmed by our emotions, myself included. Your reaction to Kachina's disappearance — I understand that feeling very well.
Mavuika: Well, now that we have Kachina's Ancient Name, let's go track her down. Follow me.

## Talk 2

Mavuika: The powder still needs some time to settle, so let's wait a little longer.
Mavuika: Well, what do you think of my collection? Do you feel like you have a better understanding of Natlan's culture now?
Paimon: Yeah! If each item represents a different story, seems like Natlan's really been through a lot.
Paimon: Does every item hold a special memory, just like Atea's talisman?
Mavuika: That's right. The items in my collection actually serve a similar purpose to the Ancient Names passed down among the tribes.
Mavuika: They demonstrate the true shape of time.
Paimon: The shape of... time?
Mavuika: Most people perceive time as a linear concept, almost like a straight line that can only move forward. We cannot change the past or predict the future.
Mavuika: But, there's also a different theory, one that I believe to be closer to the truth. Namely, that the "past," "present," and "future" all exist at once.
Paimon: A—At once? Paimon's not sure she understands...
Mavuika: Let's say your journey ended right now. Thinking back on your experience in each nation, which one would you say was the most important?
Traveler: I'd have to say all of them.
Mavuika: Exactly. Even at the end of your journey, the things you experienced along the way don't cease to exist. They become part of who you are.
Mavuika: Take out a portion of that journey, and you would likely make very different decisions, and eventually arrive at a very different destination.
Mavuika: The future is the same way. It exists even though it has yet to come to pass. We just lack the means to perceive it.
Mavuika: Of course, there are those with the power to foresee the future. They simply call it by a different name — "fate." You're quite familiar with that concept, I would imagine...
Paimon: That does kinda make sense! The future hasn't happened, but it already exists...
Mavuika: Humanity excels at living in the present, but too often, we forget the past and neglect the future.
Traveler: So, Ancient Names record the past...
Mavuika: While the Pilgrimage and the Night Warden Wars lead us to a better future.
Mavuika: Only by uniting the people of Natlan across countless eras can we fight back against an enemy as formidable as the Abyss.
Mavuika: To come up with such a set of rules, the first Pyro Archon must have possessed a level of insight I can only imagine.
Traveler: So, the first Pyro Archon created the "rules" of Natlan?
Mavuika: That's correct. At first, he was a mortal man with no special power. After he ascended to the divine throne, he used it to borrow power from the heav{RUBY#[D]Ronova}ens and establish the rules of Natlan.
Mavuika: Namely, a framework through which ordinary people can ascend to archonhood.
Mavuika: By holding the Pilgrimage, we're able to determine the strongest among us, and when that person ascends to the divine throne, their inner flame will awaken.
Mavuika: In addition, the Sacred Flame will grant them significant knowledge and memory of this land. After all, that's how I came to know everything I just told you.
Paimon: So, it all comes down to the power of the divine throne and the rules...
Paimon: Wait, is that... a family portrait?
Mavuika: Ah, yes. That's my mother, father, younger sister, and the little Saurians we raised.
Mavuika: I turned a piece of my dad's leather armor into a canvas, and commissioned a famous artist to paint our likeness.
Paimon: Your sister is so cute! Looks like you two are really close!
Paimon: Paimon was having a hard time thinking of an Archon as an ordinary person, but seeing this portrait... it kinda makes sense now.
Paimon: It really doesn't look like there was anything special about you before... Oh, wait, is Paimon allowed to say that?
Mavuika: A little late for that question, don't you think?
Paimon: Sorry! Paimon's so sorry! Paimon's mouth works faster than her brain, sometimes.
Mavuika: Hahaha, it's alright. I'd never get upset over something like that.
Mavuika: No matter what others may say, my past is a precious part of my identity. I'm forever proud of the life I used to lead.
Mavuika: Becoming the Archon doesn't mean you sever ties with your family. The position just comes with a lot of responsibilities, so it impacts how often you get to see them.
Mavuika: My father made the most delicious stew, so my sister would often bring me a large pot of his cooking, and we would sit on a blanket and eat it together.
Mavuika: One time, we didn't close the door securely, and the Saurians we were raising ran into the room and knocked over the entire pot.
Mavuika: My sister immediately burst into tears. The two troublemakers were going for the meat, but when they saw my sister's distress, they froze on the spot.
Mavuika: I still remember the way they laid there, sulking like a pair of children even after making such a mess. It was frustrating, but in the end, all I could do was comfort my sister and move on.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: You forgave them just like that?
Mavuika: Isn't that what being a family is all about? Hahaha, I think about that story a lot, actually.
Mavuika: As the Archon, I made a vow to defend this nation, and experiences like that... they remind me exactly what I'm trying to protect.
Paimon: Well, what happened after that? This portrait looks pretty old. Your sister must be all grown up by now, right?
Mavuika: I believe she ended up working as an architect and artist. She built many houses, and crafted many beautiful works of art...
Mavuika: Anyway, that's enough about me... Now that the powder has settled, we can begin. Iansan, Mualani, Chasca, over here, please.
Mavuika: Place the Ancient Name up there, and then we'll begin.

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is Atea's talisman.
Mavuika: I'm sure you're familiar with this one already. Atea was rarely ever without it. The talisman brought her a lot of luck in battle.

## Talk 4

Paimon: So we're underneath Natlan right now? It looks nothing like Paimon was imagining!
Chasca: That's because in the distant past, Natlan was home to an incredibly advanced civilization ruled by dragons.
Chasca: Humans only established their own society after the fall of the dragons.
Paimon: So these are... Saurian ruins?
Traveler: I don't think she's talking about the Saurians...
Paimon: Wait, you mean like the elemental sovereigns? They had their own advanced civilization!?
Iansan: Yes... a really long time ago. Very few records have survived until now, so no one really knows what the devices here are for.
Iansan: These ruins have been abandoned for a long time, but with the recent increase in Abyss activity, the installations around here have somehow been activated again.
Mualani: So what you're saying is... We're not in for an easy trip to the Night Kingdom.
Chasca: No, it's going to be obstacle after obstacle from here on out.
Chasca: Hehe.
Traveler: Just what I wanted to hear.
Paimon: Um, why are you all laughing like that? It's creeping Paimon out...
Iansan: It's the pre-adventure excitement kicking in! Right, guys?
Chasca: Of course. I'm eager to get started.
Traveler: Adventurers live for moments like these.
Mualani: Then let's go! We won't let anything stand in our way!
Traveler: I think she means actual dragons.

## Talk 5

Mualani: This must be the entrance the Pyro Archon told us about... The one ripped open by the Abyss.
Chasca: Yes, there's something in the depths of this place that feels familiar yet also foreign.
Paimon: We actually have to go in there?
Paimon: Okay, Paimon just needs to psych herself up. Don't push her through before she's ready!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Wayna: Try not to worry your families too much. After you get back, make sure to pay them a visit and let them know you're in one piece.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: What is this place?
Paimon: Hey, isn't that Atea's talisman?
Mavuika: Haha, good eye. This is where I store all the various mementos I've collected.
Mualani: Whoa, I've never seen this place before... There are so many things in here!
Chasca: It looks like there are items from every tribe. Collecting them must have taken a lot of effort.
Mavuika: I suppose you could think of it as a hobby of sorts. In Natlan, everyone grows up listening to the stories of heroes.
Mavuika: And physical items do a far better job of preserving those stories than our own memory.
Mavuika: Like I said, I still have some preparations to make for the ceremony, so feel free to take a look around in the meantime.
Mavuika: If you're curious about an item, I'm more than willing to tell you about its origins.
Paimon: Alright. We'll have a look!

### Additional Talk 3

Mavuika: Like I said, I still have some preparations to make for the ceremony, so feel free to take a look around in the meantime.
Mavuika: If you're curious about an item, I'm more than willing to tell you about its origins.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Whoa, this weapon is huge! Which tribe did it belong to?
Mavuika: Ah, that weapon belonged to Tenoch, a hero from five hundred years ago. Strictly speaking, he didn't belong to any single tribe.
Mavuika: That's because even before the disaster with the Abyss broke out, he had already been exiled.
Paimon: Exiled...
Mavuika: It was a punishment imposed out of necessity, but he accepted it all the same. He believed it was what he deserved.
Mavuika: When the Abyss attacked, the tribes found themselves in urgent need of a powerful figure to lead them into the battle, and there was no one more courageous or resolute than him.
Mavuika: He united the six tribes and accomplished great feats throughout the war...
Mavuika: Ultimately, he perished, and because he had already lost his Ancient Name, the Ode of Resurrection was unable to bring him back.
Mavuika: And so, he was laid to rest alongside the countless warriors and civilians who lost their lives, buried in the soil of his native land.
Paimon: Wow... He sounds like a true hero.
Mavuika: Indeed. Even now, his story is told throughout the land.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: (Atea's talisman. It brought her a lot of luck.)

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: (The weapon used by the hero Tenoch five hundred years ago. The size is truly impressive...)

### Additional Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, there's a fishing rod here! It must have belonged to the People of the Springs!
Mavuika: That's right. It belongs to a legendary fisherman named Matavaru. I have his entire set of fishing equipment, actually.
Mavuika: He and I met in a tavern. He told me about a particular kind of giant fish and his meticulous plan to catch it.
Mavuika: In his eyes, I saw a hunger and a strong fighting spirit. To him, the sea was the battlefield upon which he staked his honor.
Paimon: So... did he do it?
Mavuika: The next time I saw him, he was covered in scars. It turned out, the fish he sought had been corroded by the Abyss.
Mavuika: He managed to kill the fish, but sustained a serious injury in the process, which meant he could never go deep-sea fishing again.
Mavuika: "Can a fisherman claim victory if he fails to bring back his catch?" — that's what he asked me in the end.
Paimon: Well, Paimon thinks he won...
Mavuika: That was my answer as well. The experience was far more valuable than the prize itself.
Mavuika: In the end, he didn't want his tools to go to waste, so he gave them to me.
Paimon: Wait, that means... You also know how to fish!
Mavuika: Haha, maybe we can go head-to-head sometime.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: (The fishing rod left behind by the legendary fisherman Matavaru. If the sea were a battlefield, this would have been his sword.)

### Additional Talk 9

Paimon: Whoa, that belt is bigger than Paimon's head!
Mavuika: The Collective of Plenty are known for their bodybuilding competitions and contests of strength. This belt is a symbol of great honor within the tribe.
Mavuika: The association with strength might also have been the reason the original belt was extremely heavy. It was difficult for even two people to lift.
Mavuika: And even if a warrior had the strength to put it on, wearing it for any length of time would still leave them gasping for breath.
Paimon: Sounds like it.
Mavuika: So the owner of the original belt, Kitera, commissioned a craftsman to make a copy identical in appearance but far lighter in weight. That is the belt you see before you.
Mavuika: He would often wear this version when training in order to protect his waist.
Paimon: Ooor... he made a lighter version so he could wear it all the time and show it off!

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: (The belt belonging to Kitera the warrior. This is a copy of the original. Even Paimon could lift it by herself.)

### Additional Talk 11

Paimon: There are so many jars and potions around here... Do they have anything to do with alchemy?
Mavuika: No, those belong to the Masters of the Night-Wind. They're ceremonial tools used to amplify the ability to communicate with the Night Kingdom and the Wayob.
Mavuika: Yemaya is an expert in this field, and she taught me a lot. Even though she appears stoic and serious, she actually has a keen sense of humor.
Mavuika: The tools you see here are quite traditional. Her students found them outdated, so she passed them on to me.
Mavuika: The contents of the jars aren't all that special... Oh, except the big jar in the middle. That's what she really wanted to give me.
Paimon: Oooh, must be something really cool! What's inside?
Mavuika: Grape juice.
Paimon: Uh.
Mavuika: Hahaha, it's quite tasty, although probably expired by now.

### Additional Talk 12

Traveler: (The ceremonial tools left by Yemaya, as well as the somewhat-out-of-place jar of grape juice. Paimon probably would have given it a try if she wasn't scared it was expired.)

### Additional Talk 13

Mavuika: Be careful out there. I'll observe the situation from here.

### Additional Talk 14

Mualani: This fishing basket looks familiar...

### Additional Talk 15

Chasca: This flower looks like it's thriving. You must be good at taking care of plants, Archon.

### Additional Talk 16

Iansan: Make sure to handle everything with care. This cup, for example — it's heavier than it looks.

### Additional Talk 17

Mavuika: Surely as the echoes of life resound through heaven and earth, so too shall our stories remain eternal.
Mavuika: Ancient Name, take us to your fated bearer. Allow her to answer our call.
Kachina: Ugh... Am I hallucinating again?
Mualani: Kachina! Are you okay?
Kachina: Huh!? I—I'm not seeing things, am I? Is... Is the Abyss playing tricks on me again?
Mualani: It's okay, Kachina, it's just us! We're trying to find a way to bring you back!
Kachina: Everyone, you have to listen to me...
Kachina: I've been investigating the Night Kingdom this entire time, and I've figured out what's wrong. The Wayob is being affected by the Abyss!
Kachina: I was waiting for the Wayob to send me back, but then this really strong monster came, and it almost killed me...
Kachina: The Wayob saved me, even though its power is weakening, so I've been hiding from the monsters while trying to find a way to help.
Kachina: The Night Kingdom has become a huge mess, though... I keep hearing these awful sounds and seeing really horrible things...
Chasca: Don't listen to those sounds, Kachina. The Abyss is trying to strip you of your sanity.
Chasca: All you need to do is stay safe and wait for us. We'll be there shortly.
Kachina: It's okay. I feel so much better now that I've had the chance to talk to you guys. You don't need to worry about me...
Kachina: I've never been strong or special at all, really... So, I don't blame anyone for forgetting about me or leaving me behind, hehe. Just knowing you care is more than enough.
Kachina: I'll find a way back. You don't have put yourselves in danger to come rescue me.
Mualani: You're always like this, Kachina! Now's not the time to act tough. We're coming for you, and that's final.
Mualani: I don't know what lies the Abyss has been feeding you, but I'll tell you something right now — nobody here sees you as a burden.
Mualani: You're a victor of the Night Warden Wars, a hero of Natlan. All you need to do is wait for us to rescue you, and you'll get all the applause and recognition you deserve!
Kachina: *sobbing*...
Kachina: I'm... I'm really scared. Everything's so dark and creepy here, and I want to go home...
Kachina: Still, I don't want you to put yourselves in danger because of me... I don't want to hold anyone back ever again...
Mualani: All you need to do is place your trust in us, just like you always have.
Mualani: "No one fights alone" — we're not leaving you behind, not ever.
Paimon: Yeah! We're so close! We can't call it quits now!
Kachina: Thank you...
Kachina: Be careful...
Mavuika: Looks like we've lost contact. Now comes the most dangerous part — you have to traverse the Night Kingdom in your physical form.
Mavuika: This entrance to the Night Kingdom was left behind after an Abyssal invasion. Even a brief amount of time inside could expose you to corrosion.
Mualani: I know. I'm prepared for that possibility.
Mavuika: Alright, then I wish you all the best. I'll tell Chuychu to be ready just in case — she's very experienced in dealing with Abyssal corruption.
Mavuika: That face you just made... Don't tell me you two got into another argument?
Chasca: No, I just... feel bad for creating more work for her.
Iansan: I'll go with them, too, Archon. The more people, the stronger the party.
Mualani: Thank you so much for your help, everyone. It really means a lot that you're willing to brave these dangers with me. There's no time to lose, so let's get going.
Mavuika: Now that I've lost my power, I won't be able to provide much practical support, but I can still keep an eye on the situation from here.
Mavuika: Iansan, I know it's unlikely, but if you encounter a situation you can't handle—
Iansan: That won't happen.
Mavuika: I hope not.
