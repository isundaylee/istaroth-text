# When Flowers Bloom


## Talk 1

Vardan: Ah, you're finally here.
Gurgen: Perfect timing. We're all set!
Traveler: What's got you so excited?
Paimon: Could it be that the roses are about to bloom?
Vardan: Yes, hahaha! We couldn't have done this without you, Traveler.
Gurgen: The rose hasn't reached full bloom yet, but you can see its extraordinary vitality from its appearance!
Vardan: If you're interested, Traveler, come observe more closely.
Vardan: It might just bloom right before your eyes, you know?
Traveler: Well, I wouldn't miss that for the world...
Paimon: Râ€”Really? Right now?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's getting excited too!

## Talk 2

Gurgen: Come, come, lean closer so you can see all the details clearly.
Black Screen Text: You observe the rose bud with the herb growers...
Paimon: Nothing's happening...
Traveler: I don't see anything...
Gurgen: Oh well... Maybe it was just feeling shy in front of you...
Vardan: But no worries. According to what we know of the rose's life cycle, you should see it blooming by tomorrow at the latest.
Vardan: Well then, please visit again tomorrow, Traveler!
Traveler: I can barely feel my legs anymore...

## Talk 4

Vardan: Traveler, you couldn't have come at a better time. The rose is finally in full bloom!
Gurgen: Thanks to you, it is the best growing rose I've ever seen.
Vardan: Thank you so much. Please accept these as a token of my thanks.
Traveler: Congratulations!
Paimon: Hehe, we're really happy that the rose bloomed, too!
Vardan: Phew... We can finally deliver the roses to Bimarstan on time.
Vardan: I do hope that the roses will be of help to them...

## Talk 5

Vardan: Traveler, you couldn't have come at a better time. The rose is finally in full bloom!
Vardan: Thanks to you, it is the best growing rose I've ever seen.
Gurgen: The doctors at Bimarstan will be amazed, too!
Vardan: No time better than now. Let me move this flower...
Gurgen: Wait, what was that sound?
Black Screen Text: Something is stirring in the field...
Paimon: Whoa! A Whopperflower! Why is it even here!?
Gurgen: Oh no! The field! It's ruining the field!
Traveler: I'll take care of it!
Paimon: Eh? The Whopperflower fled...?
Gurgen: How... How could this be!?
Gurgen: One of our roses, the most important of our herbs, turned into a monster and ran away!
Traveler: It didn't "turn into" a monster...
Vardan: You mean that the Whopperflower was responsible for the rose's slow growth?
Gurgen: Is that so? Then the fertilizer used on it was a waste. And it consumed double the amount of water.
Gurgen: Have we just been taking care of this Whopperflower all this time!?
Vardan: Darn! How did it even disguise itself amongst the flowers? We never even noticed it!
Traveler: Well, everyone gets played sometimes.
Vardan: We're in serious trouble now. Our field is totally destroyed as well...
Gurgen: We'll have to explain this to Bimarstan and plant new roses...
Traveler: It was likely there from the beginning...
Traveler: Get behind me!
