Cheven: Hello. Do you need any accessories or weapons today?

## Talk

Traveler: You make both?
Cheven: Yes, that's right. Is anything the matter?
Cheven: To the people of the Children of Echoes, there's little difference between forging accessories and forging weapons. Both involve using phlogiston to process ore.
Cheven: It is also extremely common to adorn weapons and accessories with gems. Any piece of equipment that doesn't have a gemstone engraved on it is of no use at all.
Cheven: On the other hand, if you see someone digging for ore with a chisel that's engraved with row upon row of crystals, you can rest assured, for that's the surest sign that you've got a real expert on the job.

Traveler: I don't need either at the moment.
Cheven: No worries at all. Take care.

Traveler: Very impressive.
Cheven: I feel the same way.
Cheven: Still, I find that practice a bit too avant garde. The way I look at it, if you want to customize your tools, engraving two or three stones is more than enough.
Cheven: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Cheven, the owner of Muhuru's Gemporium. I'm a jeweler by trade, but I know how to make weapons too.
Cheven: Most of the weapons I make are in the traditional style. They've been proven to be reliable and easy to wield.
Cheven: If you'd like to check out some newer styles, you can try your luck with Xilonen. She's not always around, though — you might have to check every tree in Natlan to find her sunbathing spot.

Cheven: Though I'm a jeweler myself, and opened Muhuru's Gemporium, I still do make some weapons...
Cheven: Though most of the weapons I make are in the traditional style. Their designs have stood the test of time, with a proven track record of being reliable and easy to wield.
