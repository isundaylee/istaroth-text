# Sashimi Platter

A seafood dish made using fresh ingredients. The fish and shellfish are cut into pieces and arranged neatly. The slices have an elegant and tender taste, providing rich and high-quality nutrition. The lingering sweet aftertaste is derived fully from the ingredients' freshness, and every bite is an enjoyment worth closing one's eyes and savoring.
