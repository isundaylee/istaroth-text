Erinle: Hi, one moment please.
Erinle: Please answer without thinking. When was your last checkup?

## Talk

Traveler: Err, probably...
Erinle: Heh, you hesitated.
Erinle: Say no more. Make some time, go find a doctor, and get yourself a checkup.
Erinle: You might think I'm saying this just to scare you, but you probably don't know that many contestants only end up being told about major health issues just moments before they are supposed to compete.
Erinle: It's a real shame when minor, neglected illnesses turn into something more serious, ruining all that hard work they've put into training.
Erinle: And even if you're not a warrior, you still need to go for regular checkups!
Erinle: You should know, a person without health is no different from a tribe without people.

Traveler: I'll go right away!
Erinle: That's sorted then!

## Talk

Traveler: Iâ€”I get it.
Erinle: Good. That's another person persuaded.
Erinle: Nothing worse than waiting until you're already reaping the whirlwind with no way out.
