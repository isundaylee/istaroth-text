# Missing title (1017683913)


## Talk 1

Jean: *sigh* Klee is no ordinary child. In fact, she holds the title of Spark Knight within our ranks.
Paimon: No way! Even Klee gets to be a Knight of Favonius!?
Traveler: Paimon sounds jealous...
Paimon: Yes! Paimon thinks this is quite unjust!
Paimon: Although... The name kinda makes sense considering what Klee's treasure does.
Jean: Yes. She causes her fair share of trouble for the Knights of Favonius, but we care a great deal about her.
Jean: As for her background...
Jean: In short, you will understand her more as time goes by.
Jean: #Please keep an eye on her in the future, Traveler.
Traveler: Sounds more impressive than "Honorary Knight."

## Talk 2

Solitary Confinement: *sob* I'll be more careful next time...
Solitary Confinement: Next time, I'll complete a big heroic adventure all by myself, and I'll do it safely!
Solitary Confinement: I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has its own set of rules. I wonder if I could get them to...
Paimon: Yeesh, if Cyrus was listening to this...
Paimon: He would be begging Jean to extend Klee's sentence!
