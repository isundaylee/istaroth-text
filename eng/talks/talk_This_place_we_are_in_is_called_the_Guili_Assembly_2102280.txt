Soraya: This place we are in is called the Guili Assembly. According to Liyue folklore, it was once inhabited by people â€” in fact, it was rather prosperous.
Soraya: But for various reasons, the whole place was wiped out. All that remains now is the countless ruins scattered across the landscape.
Soraya: Some stories put it down to the conflict between the gods, other people say it was a war between humans. And some sources talk of a sudden, catastrophic natural disaster...
Soraya: Whatever the reason was, ruins are all that remain here now. The only ones who come here are the hilichurls, the Treasure Hoarders...
Soraya: ...And masochistic scholars, like me, who in spite of all the risks just can't resist the idea of how much research value these ruins have to offer.
Soraya: In practice though, scholars like me aren't actually cut out for this kind of field work! I've hardly covered any ground yet, and I already need a rest...
Soraya: The actual ruin-exploring seems more your area of expertise. What do you say, fancy helping me out?
