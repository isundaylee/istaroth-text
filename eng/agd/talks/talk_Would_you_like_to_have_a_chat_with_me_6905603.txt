# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kujou Sara: Seeing as I have nothing better to do, I'll comply.
Kujou Sara: I suppose I have grown accustomed to spending most of my time in solitude. I seldom have the opportunity to speak with others, so perhaps it'd be better for you to start and I answer.
Kujou Sara: Alright, ask away.
Traveler: This kinda feels like taking an exam, it's making me nervous.
Kujou Sara: Hmm?
Kujou Sara: Interesting. Your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.
Kujou Sara: But I should remind you that I've never viewed you as a subordinate.
Traveler: Uh...
Kujou Sara: *sigh* It's difficult to converse with me, isn't it?
Kujou Sara: To be honest, I've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.
Kujou Sara: However, there are many subtleties in communication, it is difficult to grasp in such a short time.
Kujou Sara: If mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then I am confident I can improve with more practice.
Traveler: Yes, you will certainly get better with practice.
Kujou Sara: Hm. Good.
Kujou Sara: In that case, I select you as my training partner! You can come talk to me as often as you like. Is that alright?
Traveler: Don't you have anything you'd like to ask me?
Kujou Sara: I do, but if I ask, then you must reply.
Kujou Sara: If you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. Have you made up your mind?
