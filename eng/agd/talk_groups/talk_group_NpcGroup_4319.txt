Uncle Anpu: My old pal, what do you think? When we're too old to remember anything, will there be any young people willing to take our places?
Belkacem: Of course! Don't say things like that.
Belkacem: Our village may be small, but we've got quite a lot of decent youngsters here.
Belkacem: Never mind the people who came back from working with the Eremites, even Kazim's boy is working hard, you know?
Uncle Anpu: Ah, true, true. You're right. I must've been overthinking.
Uncle Anpu: I'm sure we'll have more reliable successors like Candace in our village.
Belkacem: Of course! Speaking of Candace, remember when she was a little girl?
Belkacem: How she'd go to the wrong house because of her poor eyesight?
Uncle Anpu: ... Yes, yes. That did happen, I believe. Hah, between the two of us, I guess you're the one with good memory...

Belkacem: Hello, what can I help you with?

Traveler: Things are going fine.
Belkacem: Ah, that is good. If you do run into any trouble, remember to call the guards.
Belkacem: Though that old fellow Anpu likes to say "come to me if you have any trouble," please, don't bother him with every little thing.
Belkacem: I've known him since we were children, then I left the village to seek out more opportunities. I've done business, made a living as a mercenary, done menial labor... I've tried just about everything.
Belkacem: When I came back, he'd already become a "do-everything-myself" kind of naggy old man. Unexpected, but still...
Belkacem: And that's why I've volunteered to become a guard. Apart from going on patrol, I also help to lighten his load somewhat.
