Nameless Tablet (I): "My son, my child... Kisra..."
Nameless Tablet (I): "Kisra. Kisra Parvezravan. Child of my engendering... Child doomed by my hands to die..."
Nameless Tablet (I): "You who once thought your rulership could liberate people from slavery, and unburden mortals from the shackles of the gods..."
Nameless Tablet (I): "You once forged a mighty palace with whistling machines, turned this oasis into expanses of farmland..."

Nameless Tablet (I): "May unquenchable arrogance flood your heart, until the heavens and earth themselves are overturned, and the meek and base are flipped over your head..."
Nameless Tablet (I): "That day, retribution for Ormazd's ambitions shall come."
