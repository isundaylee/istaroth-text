## Talk

Nabati: Some research topic on folk beliefs... What's the point of that?

## Talk

Traveler: What topic?
Nabati: It's about the belief of Children of the Forest near Vimara Village...
Nabati: According to my inference, it must be because wild vegetables grow luxuriantly here, and they were anthropomorphized... That's how the Children of the Forest came to be.
Nabati: *sigh* Jokes aside, this topic is far less interesting than studying the human body...

## Talk

Traveler: I have no idea.
Nabati: What a coincidence, me neither.

## Talk

Traveler: Studying the human body...?
Nabati: Nah, it isn't as scary as you're thinking. It's just some extended topics on fighting techniques.
Nabati: How must the body be controlled to release unimaginable strength? Aren't you all curious about that?
Nabati: But while I've suggested it a few times, not a single mentor has been willing to approve it...
Nabati: So, I had no choice but to comply with my assignment and research this topic related to folk beliefs...
Nabati: I think this can't be allowed to go on. Someone must let the Akademiya know that there are many other research directions that are worth our attention.

## Talk

Traveler: You can do it.
Nabati: Thanks for your encouragement. Knowing that there are still people who share my thoughts raises my confidence again.
Nabati: A researcher should have the courage and determination to speak their mind!
