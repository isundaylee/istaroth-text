# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Did I disturb you?
Nasrin: It's not your fault. It's just an old habit of mine that's acting up.
Nasrin: I'm used to speaking softly because I hunt frequently and sometimes meet researchers training in the forest. It's taking me some time to speak normally again.
Nasrin: Many mistake me for an introvert because of that, and they are really careful when they talk to me.
Nasrin: It isn't necessary at all. Please talk to me normally.
