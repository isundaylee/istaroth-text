Old Treasure Hoarder Notes: "Boss says if we defeat every single monster, she'll finally get what she's seeking..."
Old Treasure Hoarder Notes: "But there are too many monsters here. We strike down one and out comes another â€” there's no end to them!"
Old Treasure Hoarder Notes: "And all of the guys who've been in start acting strange once they get out. They insist that the monsters followed them out, but I don't see any monsters around them."
Old Treasure Hoarder Notes: "The guy who was in there the longest told us to run away as fast as we could, saying something about a dragon-lord... What was he on about?"
Old Treasure Hoarder Notes: "There's definitely something strange going on around here... We should report it to Boss, and we should definitely tell everyone to get outta here."
