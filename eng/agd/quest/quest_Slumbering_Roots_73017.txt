# Slumbering Roots


## Talk 1

Paimon: Oh! We finally found you! You're Arakunti, aren't you?
Arakunti: One might not be.
Paimon: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Arakunti: Because one might be a tree, or rain, or a dream of Vana, or the strings of a musical instrument.
Paimon: Uh...
Paimon: #Paimon didn't understand a word of what he just said! Did you, Traveler?
Traveler: Me neither.
Paimon: Paimon feels like she knows the meaning of each individual word, but they stop making sense once you string them together into a sentence.
Arakunti: Why are the Golden Nara and the small flying thing here to find Arakunti?
Paimon: Paimon's not some small flying thing! Wait, Paimon actually is a flying... Argh! Anyway, Paimon's... Paimon!
Paimon: #Your "Golden Nara" also has a name, and that's Traveler.
Paimon: Arapandu told us that you're in the Grove of Dreams and he sent us to check up on you.
Arakunti: You can tell Arapandu that Arakunti is fine, the Grove of Dreams is fine, and the humid dreams are also fine.
Paimon: #Okay... Traveler, let's head back and talk to Arapandu.
Paimon: ...Or maybe not! We came here to heal the Varuna Contraption! That was close. Paimon was almost led by the nose...
Arakunti: You can tell Arapandu that Arakunti doesn't want to lead Paimon by the nose.
Traveler: Arapandu probably doesn't want to know that.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want to either! What on earth is going on with this Aranara!?
Traveler: I recall Arapandu saying...
Paimon: He said, "Arakunti's more distant from Nara." Does that mean Arakunti doesn't know how to communicate with people?
Traveler: Actually, we're the ones who don't know how to communicate with Aranara.
Paimon: Oh! That's right... We're the ones who should try to follow the local customs and learn how to communicate with them.
Paimon: But now that you mention it, how do Aranara communicate, anyway?
Traveler: What do you think, small flying thing?
Paimon: If the Golden Nara doesn't know, what would the small flying thing know? Why don't we just ask the amazing Arakunti?
Paimon: Can you tell us exactly how Aranara communicate with each other? We really wanna learn!
Arakunti: Why do you want to learn? Nara is Nara, Paimon is Paimon, and Aranara is Aranara.
Arakunti: Ah, Arakunti sees. Paimon also wants to turn into a seed and be buried in the soil?
Paimon: No! Not at all!
Arakunti: Does the Golden Nara want to become a seed?
Traveler: No, thanks.
Arakunti: Too bad. Seeds are nice.
Paimon: We've almost forgotten what we came here for. It's for Festival Utsava!
Paimon: We need to heal the Varuna Contraption for Festival Utsava so that the weather will return to normal and there will be no more of those nasty spores.
Arakunti: Paimon is right. It's for the sake of Festival Utsava, and for the sake of the center of the blue earth.
Arakunti: A humid Grove of Dreams is good, but the "spores" are bad. The mushrooms that can run are bad too. There is also too much rain, so the mushrooms have become difficult to cook.
Paimon: Hey, see? You can be clear after all!
Arakunti: #We are going to heal the Varuna Contraption. Come with Arakunti, Nara Traveler and Paimon.
Traveler: If it's possible. Sure.
Paimon: Don't talk nonsense, he'll think it's for real!
Traveler: Well, how about we start from using metaphors?
Paimon: Let Paimon try! The Golden Nara is just like... like... um... like a Teyvat Fried Egg?
Paimon: ...Actually, let's just ask Arakunti directly.
Traveler: I can probably guess.
Paimon: Amazing! So what did his words mean?
Traveler: He said that he can transform into many other things.
Paimon: #Really? Don't you pull Paimon's leg, Traveler...

## Talk 2

Arakunti: The roots of a big tree. Excellent. A wet breathing can be heard, a drowsy tune.
Paimon: Huh... Paimon still can't understand what you're saying, Arakunti, but whatever!
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon didn't think this place would be so large on the inside. Guess this is what they mean when they say "more than meets the eye," huh? Also, is it just Paimon, or does this place feel very different from other places?
Paimon: Are we going to look for the "leaves" that feed energy to the Varuna Contraption in a place like this...?
Arakunti: It's here, but it's not here. One can hear its voice, smell its breath, see its veins... But Paimon can't find it.
Paimon: Huh? What was that about...
Traveler: If Paimon can't find it, then what about me?
Arakunti: The Golden Nara can see the melody, like the cool breeze of night, the sudden fall of a raindrop, the thousand dream-fragments of a lake's broken surface.
Traveler: Well, that sure sounds impressive.
Paimon: #As expected of Traveler!
Traveler: Hehe.
Paimon: #Hehe... Wait! You're stealing Paimon's line, Traveler!
Arakunti: #Nara Traveler turning into Paimon... is even scarier than dancing with mushrooms within Marana...
Traveler: Can't imagine that...
Paimon: That's why this kind of thing won't happen! Best that it never does...
Paimon: And Arakunti, can't you be more clear? Where in the world are we going to find the "leaves" of the Varuna Contraption?
Arakunti: In dreams.
Paimon: Wait... Then why didn't you say so in the first place!?
Arakunti: Because you didn't ask "where" in the first place.
Paimon: Huh... Paimon thinks that the Aranara way of communicating has hit her all of a sudden!
Paimon: Arakunti, can you tell us where each of the three "leaves" we're looking for is located?
Arakunti: Yes.
Paimon: Wow, so you really only answer questions that are asked directly, huh... Okay, so where are these three locations?
Arakunti: Over here, over there, and on the other side.
Paimon: Uh-huh... Wait, you're not describing anything!
Traveler: Aaaand Paimon is defeated.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's defeat is your defeat! They're the same thing! Arakunti's words can't be counted on... So how are we supposed to find those three locations?
Arakunti: The Varuna Contraption was made by the most remarkable Aranara, so the links between the "branch" and the "leaves" are invisible yet visible.
Arakunti: #Nara Traveler can see Aranara, and if you can see the traces of Aranara, you can find your way.
Paimon: Pâ€”Paimon can't believe she understood that!
Traveler: We'll find it if we follow the trails of Aranara, right?
Paimon: Oh, come on, at least give Paimon the chance to answer this time, would you?

## Talk 3

Arakunti: Humid dream, dry dream... Ding dong, tick tock, rustle... It's Vana's tune...
Arakunti: #Nara Traveler? The "leaves" are in the dream, and the "branch" is here.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're back!
Arakunti: Arakunti heard you. The whimpers have turned into a gentle tune, but to merge it into the great flow of sound, we still need...
Paimon: We still need your help, Arakunti! Hehe, Paimon'll be counting on you!
Arakunti: Arakunti knows.
Paimon: Oh! Then there shouldn't be any problems now, right? Paimon hopes we can heal the Varuna Contraption soon, or Apam Woods will be full of spores... Just thinking about it makes Paimon... Achoo!
Paimon: Paimon can't believe that you Aranara have no reaction to spores... How are you not affected at all?
Arakunti: Aranara are not unaffected. Aranara just cook mushrooms. But spores are too small and too many to catch.
Arakunti: When the Varuna Contraption wasn't broken, Vana didn't have so many mushrooms, so healing the Varuna Contraption could make everything better. Except Marana.
Traveler: Things will surely get better.
Paimon: Yeah, we'll help too!
Traveler: We will find a way to deal with Marana too.
Arakunti: #Is Nara Traveler Nara Varuna?
Paimon: Huh? Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
Arakunti: #Arapandu said that Nara Varuna was a golden, brave Nara. Together with Aranara, {F#he}{M#she} healed the Varuna Contraption, drove away the black rain and mud, and brought back the sun and moon.
Arakunti: #Nara Traveler has also helped Aranara to heal the Varuna Contraption, and you're a golden and brave Nara, right?
Paimon: But isn't Nara Varuna someone from a long time ago...?
Arakunti: #Did Nara Varuna not return to Vana? Is Nara Traveler a completely different Nara?
Arakunti: Can different Nara have similar melodies?
Traveler: Perhaps.
Arakunti: #Arakunti has not met Nara Varuna, but Arapandu has talked a lot about {F#him}{M#her}.
Arakunti: #{F#His}{M#Her} melody must be the same as Nara Traveler's. Listening to it will surely bring happiness.
Paimon: #Yeah, Paimon's always happy when she's with Traveler! If Traveler leaves Paimon one day, like Nara Varuna left the forest...
Paimon: ...
Arakunti: #Arapandu must be waiting for us at the "rest stop." Return with Arakunti, Nara Traveler.
Traveler: Let's go.
Paimon: Right, let's head back!
Traveler: But I have something else to do.
Arakunti: It's okay, Arakunti can go back alone.
Traveler: I don't know...
