## Talk

Uncle Gao: Would you like to buy some fish?
Uncle Gao: It's as fresh as always, Lantern Rite notwithstanding!
Uncle Gao: The price is also the same as always! One for three hundred Mora, or three for a thousand.

Uncle Gao: Would you like to buy some fish?
Uncle Gao: Get one for three hundred Mora, or three for a thousand.

Uncle Gao: Shouldn't buying more mean a better price?
Uncle Gao: It's my fish, I'll do as I wish!
Uncle Gao: These fish are as fresh as they come! Buy one and it's good for you. Buy two and that's a deal. Buy three and you're practically stealing from me! More sales means more Mora, got it?
Uncle Gao: Besides, the more fish I sell means the fewer fish I have, and fewer fish means a higher price. Don't you get the principle of "limited supply"? These are fair prices.
Uncle Gao: I have only one thing to say to people like you: either buy something or scram!

## Talk

Uncle Gao: No, thank you. Goodbye.
Uncle Gao: Just looking? Hah, your loss!

## Talk

Uncle Gao: Let's buy some fresh fish.
Uncle Gao: Fine, you've got yourself a bargain. But all sales are final!

## Talk

Uncle Gao: How was business today, brother?
Uncle Sun: Here, let's just say this is a token of my appreciation, all thanks to your plan!
Uncle Gao: Haw-haw, they won't suspect a thing. This is all going just as I planned it would.
Uncle Sun: That's my Uncle Gao! There's no way anyone would ever remotely suspect that we're in cahoots. As soon as they compare our prices, they'll surely think that I'm the only one getting any business.
Uncle Gao: Hahaha! Come now, Uncle Sun! Bottoms up!
Uncle Sun: Here, let me fill that up for ya!
Uncle Gao: Aye! Tonight will be a night that we never remember, hahaha!
Uncle Sun: Enough talking, now drink up!
