Traveler: Saurian whistles?
Mukki: A general term for any instruments used to aid in communication between Saurians and humans.
Mukki: They're not standardized and entirely depend on the habits of the user and Saurians related to them.
Mukki: So long as it can be used for communication and so long as the user calls it a Saurian whistle, then it is one â€” doesn't matter if it's a harmonica, a whistle, or any other sound-making device.
Mukki: There are always new Saurian whelps being born to the tribe, and I'm just wondering whether or not I should make some ahead of time.
Mukki: Or perhaps, we can let the Saurians pick out the sound that they like best once they're older.
