Traveler: Do you need a hand?
Toyanna: Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It's no big problem. Or rather, it's no problem at all — it's just something I'm taking issue with...
Toyanna: I'm the air traffic staff responsible for directing landing Qucusaurs.
Toyanna: It's not usually a problem when there are only a few of them. But if a large number are returning to base all at the same time, then I need to use hand or flag signals to command them.
Toyanna: Sometimes we've got all these Saurians trying to land on the same flat patch of land at the same time, which is pure chaos.

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Toyanna: It's okay. This is a "me problem"...

Traveler: I'll tell you what needs balancing. It's...
Toyanna: The scales of my heart.
Toyanna: ...Sorry, sorry. That was a corny line, I know!
Toyanna: I just... When I see a huge gap in the number of Saurians landing on one side of the high ground compared to the other, I start feeling a little... upset.
Toyanna: But if I go and disturb the resting Qucusaurus, asking them to relocate, it'd be making a mountain out of a molehill...
Toyanna: *sigh* And if that keeps happening, the Saurians will hate me...
Toyanna: So, jokes aside, I'm afraid I really will have to find balance within myself.
