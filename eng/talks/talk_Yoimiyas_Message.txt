Traveler: Yoimiya's message:
Bulletin Board: "I was surprised to find someone hosting a festival tucked away in a little corner of this island, especially a new festival that I'd never heard of. The view here is amazing."
Bulletin Board: "Although it's not the liveliest of festivals, it's magical in its own way."
Bulletin Board: "Go, go, Arataki Gang! Let me know in advance next time and I'll get you some fireworks, free of charge!"
