Traveler: About the flood...
Sandino: That was almost the worst of disasters that could've befallen a small town like our Poisson... It's a miracle that the town has been restored to such an extent.
Sandino: Seeing Ms. Navia face such an ordeal at her tender age really broke our hearts...
Sandino: She even mentioned preparing compensation. But why would a natural disaster be the Spina di Rosula's fault?
Sandino: I'm ashamed to say that at my age, just keeping myself from being a burden is difficult enough, let alone helping.
Sandino: I have the Spina and Ms. Archenoul to thank. My grandkid and I wouldn't have been so lucky if she hadn't been nearby.
