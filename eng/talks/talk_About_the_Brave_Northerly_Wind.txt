Traveler: About the "Brave Northerly Wind"...
Clanche: You want to hear the tale? Sure. But first, let me take a moment to put my thoughts together. This story is well-known in our kingdom, and there have been many spins on the narrative...
Clanche: But most begin this way: "A long, long time ago, there was a band of northerly winds learning to blow across all things..."
Clanche: Amongst those northerly winds, there was one who was especially timid. Whenever he blew across the land, he was always scared stiff.
Clanche: "I blew the flowers down, blustered the leaves a-blister... and swept hats off the heads of passersby... My goodness, I even left that lovely lake all a-stir!"
Clanche: Days passed, years went by, this north wind never again dared to blow forth, and the land he was charged with fell into an awkward, windless torpor.
