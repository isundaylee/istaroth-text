# Collector of Anemo Sigils


## Talk 1

Marjorie: Welcome. Every treasure here is unique, guaranteed.
Paimon: Hehe... Yep, there's nothing here that Paimon recognizes, that's for sure.
Marjorie: Haha, what did I tell you! These are all rare items brought back by adventurers from all corners of the world.
Marjorie: Is there anything that catches your eye?
Traveler: It's all so exquisite...
Marjorie: No need! I forgot to mention, I operate on a trading basis. Goods for goods — no Mora accepted here.
Marjorie: I've been trying to make something a bit special recently, and I need a lot of *Anemo Sigils* to decorate it with.
Marjorie: Do you have any *Anemo Sigils* with you?
Traveler: I have a few.
Marjorie: Haha, it seems the Anemo Archon approves of your adventures then.
Marjorie: More to the point, any *Anemo Sigils* you find you can trade in here for items in the shop.
Traveler: Browse items.
Traveler: What are those?
Marjorie: It's like a seal or emblem that the Anemo Archon gives to adventurers as a form of acknowledgment.
Traveler: I daren't ask about the price!

## Talk 2

Marjorie: *Anemo Sigils* appear all over Mondstadt. If you find yourself short, just keep exploring.
Traveler: Are they really just for decoration?
Paimon: Absolutely! What could be more beautiful than a gift from the Anemo Archon?
Marjorie: Haha, okay, you got me.
Marjorie: It's actually more complicated than that, but it's easier for people to understand if I just say it's for decoration.
Marjorie: Obviously the reason I need *Anemo Sigils* is because they have properties that other materials cannot provide.
Traveler: Let me see it when it's finished.
Marjorie: Haha, of course! I guarantee you will be quite surprised at the result.
Marjorie: Do come again soon — and bring me lots and lots of *Anemo Sigils* next time!
Marjorie: Please also visit if you come across any weird and wonderful treasures on your adventures!
Traveler: I feel like you're making this sound more mysterious than it actually is.
Paimon: But it's working... Paimon's curious now!
Marjorie: Haha! Well it wouldn't be much of a surprise if I gave everything away, now would it?
