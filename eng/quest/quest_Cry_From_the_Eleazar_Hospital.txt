# Cry From the Eleazar Hospital


## Talk 1

Candace: Missing text (1706120026)

## Talk 2

Paimon: Is this the place? It's in terrible shape... and there's sand everywhere.
Alhaitham: Empty and forgotten. An ideal place to hide people.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Aaah, monsters! Watch out!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ugh, but running on sand is sooo tiring...
Isak: But... you're flying, aren't you, Paimon? Is flying over sand tiring too?
Paimon: Aaagh, of course it is...

## Talk 5

Uncle Anpu: Please stay safe, everyone.

## Talk 6

Candace: I'll be awaiting your good news.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Wait a minute, that looks like Dehya! What's she doing here!?

## Talk 8

Cyno: Missing text (1279628778)

## Talk 9

Paimon: Look, there's someone over there!
Traveler: We need to be careful!
Paimon: Good idea, let's approach him slowly without alarming him...
Alhaitham: Wait...
Alhaitham: You're...
Razak: Ugh... Argh...
Paimon: He can't speak, and his eyes are unfocused... But he looks too young to be anyone's grandfather.
Paimon: Also, why's he the only one here?
Alhaitham: Didn't expect to see him here.
Paimon: ...You know him?
Alhaitham: He's Razak, a senior of mine at the Akademiya.
Paimon: He's a scholar, too? Is he the kind that holes up in a forest and mumbles stuff about training?
Alhaitham: No, and that's the problem.
Alhaitham: Razak was never involved in any of those things. He never trained in the forest, let alone reached Satyavada Life.
Traveler: So how did he become like this?
Alhaitham: Leaving that question aside for the moment... him being here alone means that we might be too late.
Alhaitham: Looks like they've already taken everyone away. For whatever reason, they left Razak here — perhaps they simply didn't have time to come back for him.
Alhaitham: Hmm...
Alhaitham: There are drag marks on the ground. They're clearer by the doorway. Someone was forcefully drawing a cart that was loaded with something heavy.
Paimon: ...Loaded with... people?
Alhaitham: That is one possibility. It looks like they were in a hurry, as if they were afraid of being caught. In their haste, they failed to notice Razak hiding in a corner.
Razak: Aah... Ugh, uhh...
Alhaitham: The symptoms are identical. Looks like we've found "living proof."
Paimon: Huh, why do you say that?
Alhaitham: Allow me to jog your memory. Recall your time at Port Ormos.
Alhaitham: Don't you think his symptoms look familiar?
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...! The Eremite guy who went mad!
Paimon: Oh! Now that you mention it... They're acting the same way!
Alhaitham: Correct. The Akademiya is behind all of this.
Alhaitham: It isn't difficult to deduce their rationale.
Alhaitham: First, the Akademiya spread a false rumor of King Deshret's resurrection, emphasizing the role of the Village Keepers — the mad scholars who were exiled to Aaru Village.
Alhaitham: These rumors were all the persuasion that the Radicals needed, and those based in Aaru Village leapt into action. Unbeknownst to them, of course, through rounding up the scholars, they were actually helping the Akademiya.
Alhaitham: As well as being able to exploit the Radicals for their own ends, this scheme has one further advantage to the Akademiya: All the risks and responsibilities are offloaded onto King Deshret's followers.
Alhaitham: Life for the desert-dwellers has been brutal ever since King Deshret's death all those years ago. Beneath the surface, feelings of desperation are widespread.
Alhaitham: Many would give everything they have for the prospect of something better. Anyone looking to exploit that for their own ends simply needs to make a few empty promises.
Alhaitham: Even if complications arise, people will see that those involved are all followers of King Deshret, and look for no further explanation than differences of belief. A deep-seated mistrust of the desert and everyone in it by the rest of Sumeru will make sure of that.
Alhaitham: The notion of an Akademiya plot wouldn't even cross their minds. It may seem like a simple strategy, but it is able to work wonders under Sumeru's current circumstances.
Paimon: Ohhh, that makes a lot of sense. It's in line with the village chief's theory, too!
Paimon: But there's still one very important question... Wasn't it the Akademiya that brought the scholars to Aaru Village in the first place? Why does it want them back now?
Alhaitham: Throughout this process, one thing has changed: the scholars' identity.
Alhaitham: First, they were "scholars." Then, they became "lunatics." After that, they were "exiles," and finally... they become "missing persons."
Traveler: I see...
Alhaitham: An exile is still patently a living, breathing human being, but when someone becomes a missing person... that is brought into question.
Alhaitham: If you can't find someone, you have no way of knowing what exactly happened to them. That makes missing people an ideal resource.
Paimon: "Resource"? For what, exactly?
Alhaitham: One possibility is that the information in their brains could be extracted into Knowledge Capsules.
Paimon: Extracted... You mean Canned Knowledge comes from people's brains!?
Alhaitham: With the technology of the Sumeru Akademiya, it's entirely possible.
Alhaitham: Perhaps the process caused them great suffering, which is why they cry out in the dead of night, when no one is watching them.
Paimon: So the human brain— Nope, nuh-uh, Paimon doesn't wanna think about this...
Traveler: How did you learn of this technology?
Alhaitham: I'm the Akademiya's scribe, after all. I'm familiar with their projects.
Alhaitham: Anyway, judging by Razak's state, the contents of a Divine Knowledge Capsule were extracted from his mind, but something went wrong in the process...
Alhaitham: Or perhaps, his curiosity got the better of him, and he used such a capsule for himself.
Paimon: Paimon's a little confused... Can they just use anyone's brain?
Traveler: (No, that can't be right. Most of the mad scholars had made contact with the "divine consciousness" in the forest... That's what the Akademiya is after.)
Traveler: (It's also safe to assume that... this knowledge has something to do with the Fatui, The Doctor, and also The Balladeer. They're using Divine Knowledge Capsules to turn The Balladeer into a god.)
Alhaitham: The look on your face tells me you've realized the answer.
Traveler: The Akademiya needs people who have been exposed to the "divine consciousness."
Alhaitham: That's right. To some scholars, gaining knowledge about the gods is their entire life's pursuit. Extracting Canned Knowledge is just one of the extreme measures they turn to.
Alhaitham: However, I can't help but wonder: What do they seek to gain from divine knowledge?
Alhaitham: The Akademiya is going out of their way to look for forbidden knowledge, but what is their ultimate goal?
Alhaitham: I've spent quite some time trying to analyze the contents of the Divine Knowledge Capsule, but to no avail. It seems like my way of thinking is too different from theirs.
Paimon: You mean, you're not even slightly interested in getting your hands on this forbidden stuff?
Alhaitham: All scholars seek to expand the horizons of knowledge. But I'm not particularly interested in gods, so I don't share their degree of zealotry.
Alhaitham: Extracting information from people as if they were lifeless objects... If this is the direction of academic progress, then the Akademiya may as well shut its doors.
Paimon: Sounds like you're really against all this...
Alhaitham: Of course. The Akademiya's actions run contrary to their rules.
Alhaitham: Whether it be academics or knowledge, everything has its boundaries. If those lines are crossed, the rules and order that govern everything in the world will be destroyed.
Alhaitham: This matter needs to be corrected, just like fixing a typo in a book.
Paimon: Wait, didn't you step in to help because you felt sympathy for those poor people?
Alhaitham: Not to be callous, but no. My criteria are a little more restrictive than that.
Alhaitham: There is no shortage of suffering in Sumeru, and the same can be said for the rest of Teyvat as well. What do you plan to do about that? Save every last person?
Paimon: Um... Probably not... Paimon's not sure...
Traveler: Your motives are more specific and personal.
Alhaitham: You can say that. Simply put, I don't blindly place my faith into strength or heroism. I do what I want.
Alhaitham: The Divine Knowledge Capsule is something I want to investigate in full. That doesn't mean I'm willing to take action for the sake of a few strangers.
Traveler: (...Though he rejects the notion of greater moral responsibility, he justifies his actions because they are true to his personal motivations.)
Traveler: (Someone like him... might actually make for a better ally.)
Paimon: Paimon's been wanting to say this for a while. There are a lot of bad guys in the Akademiya, but you're not one of them... You're their weirdo!
Alhaitham: ...You're probably right.
Alhaitham: Though I must say, I quite enjoy this feeling of being the odd one out.
Alhaitham: Uniqueness is also an asset, is it not?
Paimon: Wow, that's a great way to think about it. Paimon's really impressed! If only Miss Shani had a similar mindset, her life would definitely be a lot easier...
Alhaitham: I'm just a more likable person than her in general. There's nothing more to it than that.
Paimon: ...
Traveler: Uh, so what do we do with him?
Alhaitham: He won't last long if we leave him here. Let's take him with us.
Alhaitham: We'll work out our next step after we return to Aaru Village.

## Talk 10

Paimon: We're back!
Candace: You must be tired. You should rest, and take some water.
Cyno: What's the situation?
Candace: Hmm? Who's this?
Alhaitham: Unfortunately, somebody who is too young to take on the role of Isak's grandfather. Nevertheless, he's one of the people we're trying to find.
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone what you saw in the abandoned hospital and share your current theory.
Cyno: So, at one point in time, the abandoned Eleazar hospital served as the Akademiya's site for extracting Divine Canned Knowledge.
Paimon: Yep, pretty much.
Cyno: Their plan must have been implemented at some point before we arrived at Aaru Village, since Divine Canned Knowledge has been in circulation for a while now.
Cyno: Yet, they fled once we were headed to the village, almost as if they knew we were on their trail. Why is that?
Paimon: Hmm, yeah, why is that...?
Candace: We may have a mole in our midst.
Candace: One of us could be secretly revealing our whereabouts to the Akademiya.
Paimon: Huh? Are our friendships that shallow?
Cyno: ...
Alhaitham: Looks like none of you have realized wherein lies the issue.
Traveler: Care to share your thoughts?
Alhaitham: Cyno, you're the reason why they can predict our movements.
Paimon: Wait, what's that supposed to mean!?
Cyno: Choose your next words very carefully.
Alhaitham: It is simply a logical inference. I have my reasons.
Candace: So what you're saying is... Cyno's the mole?
Candace: Interesting. And here I thought you were the most suspicious one, Alhaitham, since you were always acting alone.
Alhaitham: I know. You have a point, but I realized something as we were returning from the hospital — Cyno isn't like any of us.
Cyno: ...What are you trying to say?
Alhaitham: Do you still remember who you are, General Mahamatra?
Cyno: ...
Alhaitham: As a matra, you are no doubt privy to certain kinds of information. Before you can take action against someone, you are required to have all the facts available, including the less-than-savory details.
Alhaitham: Simply put, the Akademiya has traditionally allowed you access to a wealth of sensitive information. Knowing their modus operandi, wouldn't you expect them to take precautions against you?
Alhaitham: If you want to raise a vicious wolf, you need to make sure that you can avoid its bite.
Cyno: The Akademiya is monitoring me?
Alhaitham: It's not that simple. The Akademiya has eyes all over Sumeru, but they have a special protocol for dealing with you.
Alhaitham: Every so often comes a Jnagarbha Day. On this day, the Akademiya enters new information into the Akasha through Knowledge Capsules.
Alhaitham: I remember seeing the thick notebook next to the control panel once. Its contents were all about the General Mahamatra — his activities throughout the day, preferred methods of enacting judgment... everything.
Cyno: You're saying that the Akademiya entered my information into the Akasha, too?
Cyno: ...But what's the point in doing that? My actions aren't important enough to be added into the Akasha.
Alhaitham: The Akasha is capable of computation.
Cyno: ...!
Alhaitham: The Akasha's algorithms are entirely capable of predicting your movements using the data entered. When you would depart, the route you would follow, your destination... it knew all of this.
Cyno: It predicted my every move...!
Alhaitham: The Akademiya has been watching you longer than you think. However, the fact that you resigned is proof that their suspicions were well-founded.
Candace: So that's how it is... Cyno adheres to his principles so strongly that he's actually a thorn in their side.
Candace: Tenacity of will and steadfast faith are worthless to the Akademiya. They need scholars who are easily pliable and mindlessly go after anything they can profit from.
Candace: Cyno, don't take it to heart. This just proves how much of a trustworthy ally you are.
Cyno: ...
Cyno: They escaped because of me.
Paimon: Don't blame yourself! It's not like any of us would've known!
Traveler: Exactly.
Cyno: ...I have an idea.
Cyno: If they've predicted my movements... then I might be able to guess where they went.
Dehya: Whoa, you bounced back fast!
Alhaitham: There is always an opportunity for safety after danger passes.
Paimon: Ooh, so that's how it is! Paimon gets it now!
Paimon: If the Akademiya is trying to avoid Cyno, then the safest place would be...
Traveler: One step behind him.
Paimon: Yep, that's right!
Cyno: They'll want to proceed in the direction opposite of where I'm going.
Traveler: You're getting smarter, Paimon!
Cyno: I must go.
Alhaitham: There's also something I want to investigate.
Paimon: Let's go, guys! After 'em!
Isak: Please, wait! I wanna go, too!
Candace: Hmm, you want to go, too? If so... you have to promise you'll stay safe.
Isak: I wanna find Grandpa! I promise I'll be careful and not cause any trouble.
Candace: Everyone, I leave him in your hands.
Traveler: Alright.
Paimon: Yay, let's go! Remember to pack some food with you!
Paimon: Paimon feels like we're missing someone though... Hmm...

## Talk 11

Paimon: So, where do we go from here?
Traveler: Cyno, do you remember the route you took?
Cyno: Yes. After leaving the village, we should head straight toward the desert.

## Talk 12

Alhaitham: Missing text (3709756698)

## Talk 13

Cyno: There's something here.
Cyno: What's this...?
Alhaitham: It's buried in the sand... Looks like we'll need to roll up our sleeves and do some work.
Paimon: And Paimon thought running around everywhere was already enough work!
Traveler: Now isn't the time for complaining, Paimon.
Paimon: Okay, okay... So we have to dig it out? Whatever's down there looks like it's buried really deep.
Black Screen Text: With some effort, you manage to retrieve the buried objects.
Alhaitham: These are likely fragments of an Akademiya-developed device, something akin to a headset.
Alhaitham: Looks like there were more than one Village Keeper. They must have been escorted this way, because there are device fragments scattered around here...
Alhaitham: Let's split up and search the area. Chances are that we'll find other things nearby.
Black Screen Text: Everyone goes in different directions and starts digging in the sand.
Black Screen Text: After a short while, you dig up another device nearby.
Paimon: Is this what we're searching for? It looks kinda scary...
Alhaitham: This is definitely a device used to extract divine knowledge.
Cyno: How did it end up buried in the sand? That can't have been part of the plan.
Cyno: They must've been attacked along the way.
Paimon: Wait, what!?
Isak: Grandpa... I hope you're okay...
Paimon: Don't worry, your grandpa's gonna be fine!
Alhaitham: Razak didn't display any signs of starvation or dehydration, which means that they left fairly recently.
Cyno: We should be able to catch up.
Alhaitham: One more thing: Given that the device had been entirely covered by sand...
Alhaitham: I believe the attack must have happened prior to the sandstorm.
Traveler: I agree.
Cyno: Let's keep going. They can't have gone far.

## Talk 14

Cyno: Don't get any closer. They'll notice us.
Alhaitham: Dehya's talking with the Eremites? Heh, very interesting... Let's listen in.
Dehya: ...If you had informed me sooner, there'd be plenty of room for us to...
Rahman: ...You're one of us... We would never lie...
Dehya: Scholars... You don't know as much as I do... Need me to...
Rahman: Haha, I knew it... That's our Dehya...
Isak: Dehya... Why would you...
Isak: Dehya!!!
Paimon: Hey! What are you doing!?
Dehya: Huh?
Isak: Didn't you say you'd help me find Grandpa!? Wh—Why are you on their side?
Rahman: Haha, well, look who's here. Ain't that something.
Dehya: Ugh, this complicates things.
Cyno: ...You've betrayed Aaru Village?
Rahman: So, this is the great General Mahamatra. Haha.
Rahman: Dehya, you'd be better off as my assistant than hanging around with this motley crew. You've seen for yourself — I have the means and methods, and my ideals are far more admirable than theirs.
Dehya: I'm not the type that's easily swayed, Rahman. You of all people should know that.
Paimon: Wait, what's going on, Dehya? Whose side are you on here?
Dehya: Shut it, Paimon.
Rahman: It doesn't matter. Whichever side you pick, nothing can deter us from the grand mission of resurrecting King Deshret. Once our lord of old returns to this land, we will have a new beginning.
Dehya: Face the facts, Rahman — it's not gonna happen. You should understand that more than anyone. Have all your years as a merc taught you nothing about placing hopes in a ruler?
Rahman: I'm a desert-dweller, and a proud follower of King Deshret. Whether I live by the edge of the sword or in peaceful comfort, my soul will always carry this conviction.
Dehya: It's not too late yet. The Village Kee— ...mad scholars aren't gonna bring King Deshret back to life.
Rahman: You don't understand, my dear lady. Pursuing our faith is our purpose in life. Even if the chance of success is one in a million, we must be willing to give everything we have.
Dehya: Even if it'll expose you to the Akademiya? Even if they end up disbanding the Eremites? YOUR Eremites, which you've worked so hard for all these years?
Rahman: Yes.
Rahman: We've waited a long time for this day to come... The sun and the moon no longer shine here. All you see now is cracks in this desiccated land. But, fate has finally dealt me a hand to play against the Akademiya.
Rahman: With these scholars in our custody, we'll stomp the Akademiya's forces and fight our way beyond the Wall of Samiel.
Dehya: ...Ridiculous. Think about it, the Akademiya controls the entirety of Sumeru. Your powers are negligible in comparison.
Dehya: If you still don't believe me, then try asking these two men. They're also against the Akademiya, but neither of them are as arrogant as you are.
Rahman: Hah, they look more like pawns of the Akademiya to me. Why would I listen to anything the people of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata have to say?
Rahman: Filthy traitors... Your god abandoned all honor and betrayed King Deshret. We desert-dwellers will never trust the likes of you.
Cyno: It's impossible to communicate with someone so hostile.
Cyno: Perhaps we should...
Alhaitham: Do you really believe that by kidnapping the scholars, you'll be able to negotiate with the Akademiya?
Traveler: Huh? Alhaitham?
Alhaitham: These people have no value as bargaining chips, but I could be persuaded to take their place as your next hostage.
Alhaitham: These scholars were exiled from the Akademiya. I, on the other hand, am their current scribe and will be a much greater asset to you.
Dehya: Wait, you can't be serious.
Rahman: So, you wanna trade places with the hostages, do ya?
Alhaitham: Precisely. Any wise person would gladly accept my offer.
Paimon: What're you thinking!? What if they decide to kill you instead?
Alhaitham: Well, that would be bad luck for me.
Alhaitham: However, I'd get the chance to observe the scholars — perhaps even find out the truth.
Cyno: ...
Rahman: Think you can talk me over with that confident look of yours?
Alhaitham: I'm not trying to persuade you. I'm using this as a means of joining forces against the Akademiya.
Rahman: You are their scribe. What do you have against the Akademiya?
Alhaitham: Not all desert-dwellers believe in King Deshret, and the same applies to the Akademiya. Why must all knowledge-seekers approve of the Akademiya's way of doing things?
Rahman: Hah... hahaha!
Rahman: You Akademiya scum! Every last one of you is nothing but a hypocrite, just like everyone else on the other side of that wall! I've made myself clear enough... I won't listen to another word from the Dendro Archon's people.
Dehya: Not so fast.
Dehya: Alhaitham, do you stand by everything you just said?
Alhaitham: I never make empty promises.
Dehya: You know you're making a dangerous decision, right?
Alhaitham: I do.
Dehya: Good! Rahman, hear me out. These people are my friends. Maybe you can't take the followers of the Dendro Archon at their word, but what about me? Do you trust me?
Rahman: We've known each other for years. Of course I do.
Dehya: In that case, I'm willing to vouch for their honesty with my right arm.
Rahman: ...
Dehya: Come on, Rahman, don't be a coward. If you're serious about taking on the Akademiya, you need to steel yourself. You can't be afraid.
Rahman: Ha! An arm from the Flame-Mane? You've piqued my interest.
Rahman: But what if you refuse to oblige? What should I do then? No one's a fool here, Dehya. We're mercs. And mercs don't tend to live long unless they have their wits about them.
Dehya: You're not wrong, but this is different. I promised my friends that we'd bring back the Village Keepers together.
Rahman: Hah! Let's do it right here then. Give me your right arm as proof of your resolve.
Dehya: ...
Paimon: Don't listen to him! He's not even trying to negotiate, he just wants to make things more difficult!
Dehya: ...That's fine.
Paimon: Are you crazy!?
Dehya: We came here to save lives. One arm for that many people is still a pretty good deal if you ask me. Rahman, I'm holding up my end of the deal here. You'd better not let me down.
Rahman: Sure. Go ahead and cut off her right arm.
Isak: No!!!
Paimon: Dehya! What are you gonna do? Think of something!
Alhaitham: ...You don't have to go this far.
Dehya: That's not for you to decide.
Rahman: Do it!
Traveler: Dehya!
Paimon: Dehya, run!
Cyno: ...Huh!
Dehya: ...
Rahman: Stop!
Dehya: ...What's wrong? Can't do it?
Rahman: Flame-Mane, you and I are both desert folk. Cutting off your arm is no different than cutting off my own fingers. Where's the sense in cutting my own kin to pieces?
Cyno: Tch.
Rahman: You've shown me that you're serious. Go on now, take your friends and leave. Meet me in the desert at noon tomorrow.
Dehya: ...Phew!
Dehya: I was really counting on him not going through with it.
Isak: Dehya!
Paimon: That was crazy! Have you all lost your minds!? What if he'd actually cut your arm off!
Dehya: Hmm, then I'd just have to hold my claymore with my left arm.
Traveler: Please don't do that ever again!
Dehya: Okay, I'm sorry... But sometimes when you're out on a limb, you gotta double down to seal the deal, you know?
Cyno: Don't ever make a promise like that again. I can deal with the likes of them.
Cyno: If it came down to it, you would not lose to them either.
Dehya: I don't doubt it, Cyno, but this is about more than me and them... There's a lot more where they came from.
Dehya: Even if we got rid of one bunch of radicals, there are others out there. Wiping them out would do more harm than good.
Cyno: Ah... As you wish.
Isak: I'm sorry, Dehya! I should've stayed put and listened... I should've trusted you...
Dehya: It's okay. I promised you I'd help find your grandpa, so I'll do whatever it takes.
Alhaitham: Whatever it takes? You just might be scholar material.
Dehya: Huh? Are you serious?
Alhaitham: The Eremites once said that I was a lunatic. Perhaps a little madness is essential to be successful in research.
Dehya: Why does it feel like he's using his praise for me as an excuse to brag about himself?
Traveler: I think he was just stating the truth.
Dehya: Okay, let's get moving. We should head back to the village and rest up. Today was just a trial run — noon tomorrow is gonna be the hard part.
Black Screen Text: You all return to Aaru Village and rest in your rooms in preparation for tomorrow's hostage exchange.
Black Screen Text: But what are the chances of success? What are the stakes? There is no way of knowing...
Traveler: That's just how he is.
Traveler: I'll be worried about you!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Dehya: You look worried. Thinking about the Village Keepers?
Candace: Yes... I'd look for them myself if I could... As members of our village, each one of them is very important to me.
Dehya: You have a strong sense of belonging here... I guess I'm the opposite. Mercs are stray dogs wherever they go.
Candace: Dehya, don't say that. You can be a part of this community, too.
Dehya: Haha, thanks. I'll let you know when I feel like joining.

### Additional Talk 2

Uncle Anpu: *sigh* I just hope everyone's alright.

### Additional Talk 3

Cyno: What scheme is the Akademiya brewing now?
