## Talk

Allan: I can't thank you enough for all of your help dealing with the meteorites.
Allan: But I still can't stop wondering... Where did they come from?

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell us about hunting techniques?
Allan: Draff is very experienced, and he's taught me a lot, like how to read the wind direction to prevent our prey from catching our scent.
Allan: He could even tell at a glance that the bow I had been using was no longer suited to my current skills. He then crafted a new one for me with his own hands...
Allan: Thanks for chatting with me. Allow me to give you my old bow, since I no longer use it.

Allan: Hi. If you're looking for a hunting partner, you'd be better off picking someone else...

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Allan: Oh, I'm Allan. I'm a hunter... in the making.
Allan: I'm trying my best to learn the tricks of the trade from Draff.

Traveler: You seem a bit worse for wear.
Allan: Oh I'm fine... It's just, I got a bit lost yesterday when I was out hunting...
Allan: I almost wound up in a hilichurl camp. Fortunately I managed to escape...
Traveler: Sounds dangerous...
Allan: I'm lucky I made it back safe and sound. But once again, I came back empty-handed...
Allan: But... *sigh* Never mind. It is what it is.
Traveler: Sounds rough.
Allan: I'm alright, really. I just always end up getting rescued by Outrider Amber...
Allan: It's so embarrassing.
Allan: She's quite the capable one. Well, she is a Vision bearer after all.
