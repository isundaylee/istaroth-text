# Hearken, Ye Who Have Returned


## Talk 1

Mavuika: Helmets on, sit tight, and don't fall!
Xbalanque: Is this a board you can use to ride on the water? And you can stick it to the back of vehicles, too! Genius!
Paimon: This is Mavuika's flamestrider! Oh, we call that board a "surfboard"!
Xbalanque: Haha, you learn something new all the time!

## Talk 2

Xbalanque: Playing with this stuff is part of everyday life, then?
Paimon: Yeah! We're livin' good!
Xbalanque: Ah, I wonder if I would've ever become Pyro Archon if we had had these gadgets around back then. I might've had too a bit much fun with them...
Paimon: What!? That would be terrible!
Xbalanque: Agreed! Good thing they were only invented after I died, huh?
Mavuika: Hahaha, looks like I really am better after all, for becoming Pyro Archon even with all this temptation around.
Paimon: Point Mavuika!
Mavuika: The hands of our friends at the Children of Echoes are as skilled as ever. They were already famed in your era, right? This bike was built by their most talented artisan in this age.
Mavuika: Speaking of which, we just passed them by.
Xbalanque: Sweet!

## Talk 3

Xbalanque: Is that Ochkanatlan? Ahh... Sure brings back memories.
Paimon: Oh yeah! That was built in your time, right?
Mavuika: It's long become a landmark. Very popular with tourists, so I hear — they think it's a lovely place.
Xbalanque: Is that so? So that's how you all see it.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too! It's especially stunning if you look at it from a Spiritway.
Mavuika: The stories of the past become things people aspire to in the future. It's just like what they say — the apex reached by those who came before will become the everyday goals of those who come after. Everything is constantly changing for the better.
Xbalanque: That's good. That's how it should be. I'll bring those words back to the Night Kingdom, and share them with everyone there.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We made it! Woohoo!
Traveler: Woohoo!
Xbalanque: Woo! Woohoo!
Xbalanque: Thank you, Mavuika. This has been a wonderful trip.
Mavuika: Lovely things are meant to be shared, after all. It's the least we could do for our friend.
Xbalanque: Hahaha, I'll admit, I didn't expect people several thousand years in the future to see me as a friend.
Xbalanque: Not that I'm complaining. This old man's had a great day today. Thank you, dear friends.
Xbalanque: I can still remember how nervous you looked when you saw me for the first time, Mavuika... I'll cherish that memory.
Mavuika: Oh. Is it almost time?
Xbalanque: Yes, it is.
Mavuika: Thank you for coming back to see us. This meeting means a lot to me as well.
Xbalanque: Mhm-hmm.
Xbalanque: Well, time to go. Don't forget to lead a happy life.
Paimon: Aw, already? Paimon's gonna miss you. See ya later, Xbalanque!
Traveler: Enjoy your life in the Night Kingdom, too!
Mausau: ...
Paimon: Ah, he closed his eyes... Did he fall asleep?
Mavuika: Mhm. I can no longer sense Xbalanque's soul.
Mavuika: Well, it's gotten quite late, hasn't it?
Mavuika: Thank you for accompanying me this whole time. Let's hurry back, you must be starving.
Traveler: There'll be a victory feast tonight, right?
Mavuika: Yes. After the end of the Pilgrimage, we hold a banquet to congratulate the champion of the tournament.
Mavuika: There will be good food and plenty of it — You guys are gonna love it. Mausau should be there, too — I'll bring him over.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Do you think there'll still be any food left over for us? It's kinda late and all...
Mavuika: I'm sure the feast has already started, but don't worry, I'm sure Iansan will save some for us.
Mavuika: She's very reliable. Leaving the tournament planning to her was a smart move.
Paimon: Ah, so she probably figured that we'd be gone a long time...
Mavuika: Yeah, I told her as much too.
Mavuika: Ah, seems like they've prepared the thing.
Paimon: What thing?
Mavuika: See that row of braziers over there?
Paimon: Oh, so that's what they are! They haven't been lit, so Paimon totally thought they were something else.
Mavuika: Here, watch this.
Paimon: Whoa! They're beautiful...
Traveler: Were they left for the three of us?
Mavuika: This particular kind of brazier is called a "signal flame," and is reserved for those coming back late at night. The others set up an entire path using these signal flames to await our return.
Mavuika: Those returning to the tribes must light them with their own hands. The flames will illuminate the path ahead, and show the tribe that the person has made it back.
Mavuika: "Even if you're surrounded by darkness, never forget — your friends wait for you in the distant light." Remember that feeling when the exhaustion of your journey creeps up on you.
Iansan: Ah, you're back.
Mualani: #Archon, Traveler, Paimon! You were really gone a long time. We've already started grilling the meat.
Mavuika: We had a long talk with Lord Xbalanque. It was pretty time-consuming.
Iansan: Did it all go well?
Mavuika: More than well. Xbalanque... He is a very good man. He far surpassed even my expectations.
Black Screen Text: The people at the feast all gather around you, Paimon, and Mavuika. Mavuika gestures for everyone to move over and sit down at the drinking table, before beginning to tell the story...
Black Screen Text: She reveals everything without reservation, holding nothing back and hiding no secrets. As a part of the deal made millennia ago, the ancient sun could only rise again for one day. Still it was enough time for her to recount all the people's achievements and hard work to him.
Black Screen Text: As night fell, the sun disappeared once more. She returned with joy in her heart, and a child of the tribes on her back.
Black Screen Text: The sun arose in that child's dream, and quietly set in his deep sleep.
Kachina: So the only reason Lord Xbalanque didn't win the tournament is because he was limited by the physical body he was in...
Mavuika: That's right, but don't feel disappointed on his behalf — he himself was not upset about that turn of events.
Mavuika: He had many revelations during this journey. And as he said, strength of mind is as important as the strength of the body. He realized that after failing to make it to the final 32.
Paimon: No matter how many times Paimon hears it, it's still so funny to think that Xbalanque didn't even make it that far...
Traveler: You'd have never expected to hear those words next to each other.
Ororon: Strong in both body and mind, huh...
Chasca: I'd say our champion, Kinich, fits the bill, don't you think?
Mavuika: Indeed. Everyone, let's raise our cups — let's celebrate our champion!
Mavuika: Kinich, you've proven yourself a true warrior and athlete. Congratulations on your triumph in the Pilgrimage!
Mavuika: A toast to our champion!
Ecstatic Audience Members (Crowd): Cheers!
Kinich: Thank you, everyone.
Citlali: Hey, look, the kid's awake!
Mausau: Uhh... Huh? Where am I...
Mavuika: Hello, Mausau. You're awake. This is the celebration feast for the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. You participated in the tournament, too.
Mausau: Huh? M—Me?
Kinich: It's a long story.
Ajaw: It's so long, even my lowly servant couldn't manage to give a simple summary, heh!
Mausau: I see... I remember... Lord Xbalanque, our Archon, Mavuika, and... the Pilgrimage.
Mausau: I feel like I dreamed a very long dream. I was super strong in that dream, too... I could jump up onto the roof with one leap, and I could climb, fly, and glide...
Mavuika: It wasn't a dream. Your body did go through all the motions of the tournament. You are already an outstanding contestant.
Mausau: I... I'm a... contestant?
Mausau: You know, Mom and Dad always say that my health isn't the best, and I might not be able to do all the things everyone else can... But right now, I feel like I can fly!
Paimon: Really? Like Paimon?
Mausau: Yeah! I feel amazing... It's like I'm filled with power from head to toe. I... I wanna feel like this next time, too!
Citlali: Then go and train hard, then come back next year and show us what you've got.
Mualani: Yeah! As long as you put in the work, you'll do great, I know it! That's how it is for all of us.
Ororon: Yes. You'll turn out to be a truly beautiful vegetable, I am sure of it.
Kinich: Vegetable...
Mausau: Yeah, I will!
Mausau: Oh, but the Pilgrimage was only half of the dream. I think, after that... I somehow got into a fight...
Kachina: Really? Against who?
Mausau: ...Ah... Uhh...
Mausau: I think it was... our Archon.
Mavuika: That wasn't a dream, either. I did have a duel with Xbalanque.
Ecstatic Audience Members (Crowd): Huh!?
Mavuika: Haha, I was hoping to save this until later, but since we're already on this topic, I've got another piece of good news to share.
Mavuika: Namely, that we crowned another champion today. Lord Xbalanque and I engaged in an all-out duel, as worthy rivals from across the millennia.
Mavuika: In the end, I won by the slimmest of margins, defeating our legendary hero.
Ecstatic Audience Members (Crowd): Woooooow!
Iansan: I can't believe it. You beat THE Xbalanque?
Mavuika: This is no lie, and I have our best friend here to back me up. You were the arbiter for our duel, yes?
Traveler: *clears throat*...
Traveler: Mavuika is right. Paimon and I witnessed her victory with our own eyes.
Ecstatic Audience Members (Crowd): Yeah!
Ecstatic Audience Members (Crowd): Amazing! What an achievement!
Mualani: C'mon, everyone, let's have another toast, for our Archon this time!
Mavuika: Very well. Acknowledge my victory, recognize my valor, and drink this wine of victory for me!
Ecstatic Audience Members: Woo-hoo! Yay!
Mavuika: Phew.
Paimon: Today's been a super long and exciting day, yeah?
Mavuika: Yeah. It's been quite some time since I've done so much in a day, or felt that it's gone on for so long.
Traveler: But you've also got a sense of accomplishment to match, right?
Mavuika: Of course.
Paimon: #Oh right, Mavuika, Traveler said there was something to ask you.
Mavuika: Hmm?
Traveler: I was just thinking... You were fighting Xbalanque for such a long time...
Traveler: Did you ever falter, or wonder if you might lose to him, even for a second?
Mavuika: ...
Mavuika: No. In battle, there is no time for that. So, it never crossed my mind.
Traveler: (Huh? That's the same answer as last time...)
Traveler: (...How come she knew what I was thinking?)
Mavuika: The night is still young. Cheers.
