# Return to Days of Winter


## Talk 1

Viktor: Well, I guess I'm finally heading home...
Traveler: Leaving us, Viktor?
Viktor: Eh? Oh, it's you...
Viktor: That's correct. I received orders from above recently that I can return to Snezhnaya.
Viktor: Something about me being transferred to another Harbinger, and no longer needing to standby in Mondstadt for any new orders.
Viktor: I've got no clue which of them I'll be under this time, but I'm just praying that it's not Lord Scaramouche...
Traveler: When will you be leaving?
Viktor: The higher-ups didn't mention that. I was just told to pack my things and be ready to leave at a moment's notice.
Viktor: I mean, that's great, right? Finally, I'll be free from the judging gazes of those Sisters!
Viktor: Ah, right, Traveler. Seeing as how we've had dealings for so long... Won't you do a man one last favor?
Viktor: Like before, you'll do the deed, and I'll cough up the payment. You'll never work for free when you work with me.
Traveler: What stories will you tell me this time?
Viktor: Haha. To tell the truth, I'm all out of Fatui stories to tell you.
Viktor: The payment this time will be Mora for sure. Sounds good?
Viktor: Well, unless you'd like me to tell you the same fairy tales I tell Lily...
Traveler: What do you need help with?
Viktor: You know what? I'll come clean. The request this time also has something to do with her.
Viktor: She's... well, the only person in all of Mondstadt who'll listen to anything "the evil Fatui uncle" says — other than you, of course.
Viktor: I doubt I'll be returning to Mondstadt ever again... So I just wanted to send Lily one last memento.
Viktor: But as you know, I'd be walking into a shooting gallery if I were to just walk out there and buy something.
Viktor: So I can only leave this task to you.
Viktor: Just head over to Marjorie's and help me see if she's got any gifts that a child might like.
Traveler: You still keep Lily company?
Viktor: Err... Well... Sometimes...
Traveler: Aye, never a lack of Fatui stories with you around...

## Talk 2

Marjorie: Hello there, Traveler. What can I do for you?
Traveler: Do you have any gifts for kids here?
Marjorie: A gift for a child... Let me think.
Marjorie: Hmm, actually, I've been attempting to fashion some small toys recently.
Marjorie: The only catch is that they need a lot of Wolfhook dye, and I'm all out of Wolfhooks.
Marjorie: I asked Schuster to help me gather some more, but he hasn't returned yet.
Marjorie: Could you help me look for Schuster, Traveler?
Marjorie: Once we have enough Wolfhooks, I should be able to make those toys for you.
Traveler: Alright. Leave it to me.
Marjorie: He said that he'd be going <color=#00E1FFFF>near Wolvendom</color> to gather Wolfhooks. You can head over there to look for him.
Marjorie: In that case, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: Where has Schuster gone?

## Talk 3

Viktor: Did you get the present?
Traveler: What will you do once you get back home?
Viktor: What will I do? Well... I suppose I'll have to wait for my transfer orders.
Viktor: *sigh* If things go ill, I might get transferred to some archon-forsaken place and put on standby again.
Viktor: But I'm fine with whatever, so long as they don't toss me over to Inazuma...
Traveler: Why the sudden move?
Viktor: Why, you ask? It's because of Lady Signora's... Well... her sacrifice.
Viktor: Actually, you know what? I'm just a joiner. I listen to orders. There's no need for me to think too much.
Traveler: Where's Lily?
Viktor: I heard Rudolf mention that he was going to take her out to the square or something like that.
Viktor: Heh. I suppose he's got to keep his precious daughter away from the evil Fatui, eh?
Traveler: See you.
Viktor: Alright. I leave the matter of the present to you, then.

## Talk 4

Terrified Schuster: Th—Thank you, Traveler.
Terrified Schuster: These monsters just kept coming after me, even after I ran all the way here...
Traveler: You came to gather some Wolfhooks, right?
Terrified Schuster: Eh? Yeah, it was Marjorie's request...
Traveler: Couldn't you have brought someone else with you?
Terrified Schuster: ...Come on, who would've agreed to come with me to work on a commission as simple as "gathering plants"?
Terrified Schuster: I know how that's supposed to work, of course, but you can only find Wolfhooks here, you know?
Terrified Schuster: And the Wolfhooks that grow in safer areas have all been picked.
Terrified Schuster: So I had to go further in to gather Wolfhooks...
Terrified Schuster: But let's not talk about that now. Could you help me pass these Wolfhooks to Marjorie?
Terrified Schuster: I need a moment to rest. I thought my legs were going to give out on me back there...
Traveler: Please don't go out so far by yourself.

## Talk 5

Marjorie: Did you manage to find Schuster, Traveler?
Traveler: He asked me to take these Wolfhooks back to you.
Marjorie: Ah! Thank you very much. I'll take these, then.
Marjorie: Once Schuster gets back, I'll make sure he gets paid.
Marjorie: Right, you wanted a gift for a child, yes? Well then. Coming right up...
Black Screen Text: Marjorie starts to make the present...
Marjorie: Well, that's a wrap! Here, take this. Thanks for bringing those Wolfhooks back, by the way.
Marjorie: This doll has a light scent to it, too. I'm sure the kid you're sending this to will love it.

## Talk 6

Viktor: How did it go? Did you get the present?
Traveler: I did.
Viktor: Huh, I guess you're pretty good. Now let me see...
Viktor: What is this...
Viktor: This doll's all gangly and crooked, and its dye-job looks ridiculous... Well, it certainly smells nice, though.
Viktor: Are you sure this is suitable for children?
Traveler: This was Marjorie's recommendation.
Viktor: This gift will have to do. But where do I put the letter... Eh, you know what, I'll just put it underneath...
Traveler: You wrote Lily a letter?
Viktor: Just some nonsense. Never you mind.
Viktor: Alright. Here, take it, and help me deliver it to Lily. She should be <color=#00E1FFFF>near the square</color>.
Viktor: Heh. I can picture the stares I'd be getting from Rudolf if I were to give it to her myself already...
Traveler: What did you write to her?
Traveler: You could always buy one in Snezhnaya and have it shipped here.
Viktor: Oh, I'd love to. But just think about it. If a Fatuus were to send anything to Mondstadt, wouldn't it get stopped at the city gates by the Knights of Favonius?

## Talk 7

Rudolf: Lily, you shouldn't be talking to that Fatui.
Lily: But why not? Mister Fatooey's told me loadsa stowies!
Traveler: Hey there, Lily, Viktor got you a gift.
Lily: Wow! Mister Fatooey got me a pwesent? Thank you!
Rudolf: Wait, why would that Fatuus send Lily a present? Don't tell me that he...
Lily: That's becoz I gave Mister Fatooey lots of stuff to eat! That's why he sent me a gift!
Rudolf: Lily, he's not a good person...
Lily: But he tells me stowies! He's a good guy!
Traveler: You can consider this Viktor's farewell gift.
Lily: Eh? Why does he have to go...
Rudolf: *sigh* He's leaving? Fine. I was beside myself with worry every day, what with that fellow talking to Lily every day and all.
Lily: Dadda, I wanna say bye bye to the Fatooey man!
Rudolf: *sigh* Lily, you shouldn't get too close to that man.
Lily: But why? That Fatooey... He's been really nice to me!
Lily: He tells me stowies. Lots of stowies! He's nice!
Rudolf: Lily, listen to Daddy. Things aren't that simple... *sigh* You know what? Daddy will tell you more when you're older.
Traveler: Viktor's going to leave Mondstadt soon.

## Talk 8

Viktor: Did you send the present to Lily?
Traveler: She's as pleased as punch.
Viktor: That's good. I suppose Rudolf had his own two Mora's worth to say on the subject?
Viktor: Hmph, you don't even have to say it. No one trusts a Fatuus here in Mondstadt.
Traveler: When are you leaving?
Viktor: The official order hasn't come down yet. I've just packed my things in advance, and I'll be staying at the Goth Grand Hotel for the time being — ready to leave at a moment's notice.
Viktor: Come on, what's with that serious expression? Are you going to formally bid me farewell?
Traveler: No.
Viktor: Hah, that's right. That's how it should be. We're not friends. We're just ad-hoc partners.
Viktor: If you should ever come to Snezhnaya, you can look for me there. We can continue doing business.
Viktor: Alright, enough small talk. Here's your payment. Take it. I suppose this will be our last "equivalent exchange" here in Mondstadt.
Viktor: *sigh* I just hope my next assignment isn't as troublesome...
