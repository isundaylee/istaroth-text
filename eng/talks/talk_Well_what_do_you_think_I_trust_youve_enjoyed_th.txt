# Talk Dialog

Venti: Well, what do you think? I trust you've enjoyed this year's Windblume Festival?
Venti: I'm happy to see you find the time amidst your busy adventures to return to Mondstadt and celebrate the winds of freedom with us.
Venti: And if you have a moment now, would you care to hear a new love poem I wrote this year?
Venti: Ahem! Allow me to recite it for you.
Venti: This world has never seen such vibrant color / it bestows upon everyone a brilliant hue
Venti: A shade more ethereal than white / yet more radiant still than gold / it eases into your eyes / and restores to light a solitary soul
Venti: Hmm... maybe a bit too somber? Maybe I should write another one on Sweet Flowers instead...
