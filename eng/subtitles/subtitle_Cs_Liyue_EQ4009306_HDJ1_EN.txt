In times gone by, one quarreled oft with Guizhong concerning mechanical principles
We each had our ideals, and neither would yield
Under the pretext of a social gathering
One invited the impartial Rex Lapis
To judge the quality of our creations...
But Rex Lapis declared
That Guizhong's Obscuro Vulpes Mechanism was superior
Though one was too proud to acknowledge it, in one's heart, one knew
That Guizhong was indeed the superior talent in the mechanical arts...
As for the story between Guizhong and Streetward Rambler
That begins with a certain bell
In Guizhong's opinion, while mechanisms were no substitute for human composers
They were yet capable of producing simple but fine melodies
But Streetward Rambler believed music to be an expression of the soul
An emotional enterprise that could never hope to be replicated by machinery
They argued endlessly, until one asked Rex Lapis to intercede
He confiscated the bell, and designated it for ceremonial use
Thereafter, one would often find them convening in the mountains
Discussing music, mechanics, and all the affairs of the mortal world
But these good times were not to last
War broke out between the gods, and soon engulfed the Guili Plains
Guizhong was overpowered by the enemy, and fell in battle
When Streetward Rambler and I arrived at the scene at long last, all that remained among the ruins... was her lifeless body
After this, at Streetward Rambler's request
Rex Lapis granted her the Cleansing Bell for safekeeping
To honor our friend's memory
One made a few finishing touches to her ballistic device...
Many Lantern Rites have passed since then... many greetings and goodbyes
Upon what do you gaze? The Guili Plains?
No, it's... everything
We think of human life as like a lantern that's lit one minute and extinguished the next, but are we adepti so different?
Perhaps, as dust settles after a storm
We too must one day return to the world below
