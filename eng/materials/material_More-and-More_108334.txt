# More-and-More

A snack grilled on an iron plate. Water is added to flour and stirred into a slurry, vegetables and meat are added, and the mix is grilled well on an iron plate before taking on a splash of sauce and a sprinkle of dried bonito flakes. This tastes delicious no matter how many ingredients one adds, and indeed it makes people feel like "the more ingredients, the merrier," hence the dish's name.
