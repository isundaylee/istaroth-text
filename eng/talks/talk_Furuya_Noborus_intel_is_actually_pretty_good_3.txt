Traveler: Furuya Noboru's intel is actually pretty good.
Yuzu: About him... if it weren't for me pushing hard on the issues about the Sakoku Decree back then, I wouldn't even have realized that he was a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
Yuzu: But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
Yuzu: He's not a bad person, but I just wish he'd help me out more in my attempts to leave the country. I mean, couldn't we at least go to some mysterious place like Tsurumi Island?
Yuzu: It was covered in fog before, so I get that it wasn't allowed. But now that the fog's gone, he should just let us go!
Yuzu: But he's always like, "oh, new people should learn from the basics" this, and "don't just go after short-term gains recklessly" that...
Yuzu: He's so droll!
