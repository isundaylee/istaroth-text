# About That Time We Saved the Tanuki Photo Board


## Talk 1

Thoma: What a nice surprise meeting you guys here.
Traveler: What brings you here?
Thoma: Well, I heard that a certain well-known individual had made an appearance at the festival and taken quite a liking to the Tanuki photo board.
Thoma: Since the Yashiro Commission is the host of this festival, I felt I simply had to come and meet them in person.
Thoma: Red horns... If I'm not mistaken, you must be the esteemed Arataki Itto, leader of the widely renowned Arataki Gang, is that right?
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Thoma, my bro, your eyes do not deceive you!
Arataki Itto: And you are the housekeeper extraordinaire of the Kamisato Clan! You're quite the celebrity yourself, you know.
Thoma: Well, I'm flattered, Itto. And it's nice to meet you too, bro.
Paimon: Whoa, there's a serious bromance developing here.
Thoma: I didn't expect to run into both Itto and the Traveler here.
Thoma: Speaking of which, I kind of count as the host here. So is anything wrong? Don't worry, you can tell me anything.
Paimon: It's all Itto! He wants to—
Arataki Itto: Ah, no no no, it's no big deal. We were just about to have a duel, and we're trying to think what format it should take.
Thoma: Oh... a duel...
Thoma: In that case, I have a suggestion. Since your duel is taking place at the Irodori Festival, why don't you have a volunteering competition?
Thoma: Then you can both do your part for the Irodori Festival while settling your duel at the same time. What do you think?
Arataki Itto: Volunteering competition? Hmm, sounds a little low-key. Not quite hard-core enough for the Arataki Gang...
Arataki Itto: #I give this idea an interest rating of two points. One for Traveler, one for Thoma.
Mamoru: Boss means, uh... two points out of a hundred.
Thoma: Haha, yeah, this job isn't the most high-stakes, that's for sure. It just takes a little patience and responsibility.
Thoma: Also, since it's volunteering, by definition there's no remuneration. All you'll get is this special-edition drink from Sailing Breeze as a small token of appreciation...
Thoma: On second thought, this is nowhere near enough for the prestigious Arataki Gang. I don't know what I was thinking.
Arataki Itto: Wait, wait, wait a sec... What was that part about the, uh, token of appreciation?
Thoma: Oh, it's just a special-edition drink produced by Yae Publishing House and Sailing Breeze. It's really nothing special.
Akira: Boss! That's the one!
Genta: If we take this gig, we'll get that drink!
Arataki Itto: Oh... so uh, Thoma, my bro, my guy, my dude, maybe I didn't explain properly. When I said two points, that's out of a total of two.
Arataki Itto: If there's one thing the Arataki Gang is known for, I kid you not, it's our patience and responsibility!
Arataki Itto: It's an awesome idea, totally hard-core. Practically tailor-made just for me! Hahahahaha!
Arataki Itto: #Traveler, let's do this for our duel, it'll be amazing! Whoever volunteers the hardest wins! What do you think?
Paimon: You didn't seem too interested in it just a second ago.
Traveler: There's actually no need for the duel after all.
Arataki Itto: Hey, this is the mighty Arataki "Above All, Bold-Blooded" Itto you're talking to here! I'm a say-what-I-mean, mean-what-I-say, might-sound-mean-but-I-say-it-anyway kinda guy. And I say, we're gonna have this duel!
Paimon: AKA, doesn't-want-people-to-know-he's-only-doing-it-for-the-drinks kinda guy.
Thoma: If it's decided, then allow me to take the role of your judge.
Thoma: The volunteer work is simple. You just need to give your help to people who need it during the festival.
Thoma: I will assign some job requests that I've already received to you.
Thoma: If you're ready, we can begin.
Traveler: If you want that drink, just ask Thoma.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look! Well, if it isn't Arataki Itto and his gang!
Paimon: Paimon knew it was gonna be them! Let's go and see what all this is about.

## Talk 3

Hiraizumi: Are you the festival volunteers?
Hiraizumi: Great. I was just wondering what to do about these goods. It's been really busy lately, and all the workers at the port are swamped.
Hiraizumi: But I have to get all this fresh soy milk delivered to the warehouse as soon as possible. It'll go bad if it's left outside too long.
Hiraizumi: Can you please help me take it to the warehouse? My coworker, Takeuchi, will be waiting for you there. Thank you so much.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Okay, one last job!
Paimon: We need to help move some goods at the port. Let's go.

## Talk 8

Takeuchi: Ah, you must be the volunteers here to save the day.
Takeuchi: You must be tired. Put down the goods and have a rest.
Takeuchi: I heard the Yashiro Commission has arranged for Sailing Breeze to prepare some special drinks for the volunteers as a way of saying thank-you.
Takeuchi: Soy milk is actually one of the ingredients for the drink. It's freshly made every day!
Takeuchi: In fact, the last batch of soy milk we processed has just been sent over. You'll get to try it very soon.
Paimon: What!? So Sailing Breeze's special drink... has soy milk in it!?
Paimon: Itto won't be able to drink that!
Paimon: Hurry, we've gotta get to Sailing Breeze before he does...

## Talk 9

Ishida: I'm so grateful to have you helping out...

## Talk 10

Kid Kujirai: *crying* Where'd my Temari go?

## Talk 11

Ishida: Are you the volunteers? Perfect timing.
Ishida: As you can see, there's a lot of dust and dead leaves around my stand.
Ishida: I've just been so busy with my customers these past few days. I keep meaning to sweep up, but I just haven't found a spare moment...
Ishida: Can you help me clean up the place, please? Thank you so much!

## Talk 12

Ishida: I'm so grateful to have you helping out...

## Talk 13

Kid Kujirai: Did you find my Temari yet?

## Talk 14

Kid Kujirai: Great! Now I can play the Temari game again!
Kid Kujirai: #Thanks, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}!

## Talk 15

Kid Kujirai: #Hey, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}! Come and help me!
Paimon: Hey, Kujirai, fancy meeting you here at the festival. But we don't have time to play games with you right now.
Kid Kujirai: I'm not playing games! I'm in trouble!
Kid Kujirai: I heard they were selling a new kind of Temari at the festival, so I came to check it out...
Kid Kujirai: But I couldn't find it anywhere, and then I went and lost my current one...
Kid Kujirai: *sobbing* It's gotta be nearby. I still had it a moment ago...
Kid Kujirai: #Can you help me, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}?
Paimon: So basically, every time we run into you, we have to go Temari-hunting...

## Talk 16

Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! What took you so long? I've been here ages — completed my tasks a long time ago.
Arataki Itto: So there you have it, when volunteering's the name of the game, no one volunteers harder than Arataki Itto! Hahaha!
Arataki Itto: #You lose, I win, Traveler, and to the victor go the special-edition spoils....
Arataki Itto: Behold, the drink of champions, created by Sailing Breeze in collaboration with Yae Publishing House, and as featured in the popular work, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"!
Arataki Itto: All this talk's making me thirsty — don't mind if I do! Hahahaha!
Arataki Itto: Drink of champions, it's time to come home!
Traveler: Wait! There are beans!
Black Screen Text: Glug, glug, ahhh... Itto downs the drink in one go.
Arataki Itto: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! Wooh! That's the good stuff...
Arataki Itto: That was a mighty fine drink... Although maybe it was a little past its prime...
Mamoru: Boss, they said they think there might be, uh...
Akira: B—Beans in the drink!
Arataki Itto: Huh!?
Black Screen Text: A mighty figure falls to the ground.
Genta: Ah! The boss is down! The boss is down!
Mamoru: Quick! Get him to a doctor!
Thoma: What's wrong? Can't Arataki Itto drink soy products?
Akira: He's allergic to beans!
Thoma: Oh, my goodness... Okay! Quick, grab Itto and follow me. I'll get a doctor — I sure hope it's not too serious...
Thoma: #I'm sorry, Traveler. I didn't even consider this possibility. It was all my fault.
Thoma: Leave Itto to me. I'll make sure he stands again.
Thoma: Don't worry. I'll see you later.
Karpillia: So, your friend is allergic to beans. It's a very rare condition, though I have heard about it.
Karpillia: I'm so sorry that our drink caused such a problem. I feel terrible.
Karpillia: If you don't mind, please take this. This is a special drink formula with no soy milk.
Karpillia: I could see that your friend enjoyed this drink a lot. Although it tastes slightly different without the soy milk, I'm sure this version will be more suitable for your friend.
Karpillia: Please accept it, along with our sincere apologies.
Traveler: There are soybeans in the drink!
