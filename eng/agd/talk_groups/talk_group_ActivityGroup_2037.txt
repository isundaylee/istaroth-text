# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2037

## Talk

Kirara: Komaniya Express, at your service! Oh, it's you!
Traveler: What are you doing...
Kirara: Festival delivery! Let's say you buy a bunch of stuff at a stall... Who wants to carry it around for the rest of the night?
Kirara: That's where Komaniya Express comes in! Entrust your stuff to us, and we'll deliver your festival purchases straight to your door!

## Talk

Chiori: #Nice to see you again, Traveler.
Traveler: You made the trip from Fontaine?
Chiori: Yes. The news spread far and wide. A festival for humans and youkai alike is a grand occasion, after all.
Chiori: Ayaka happened to send me an invitation, as well, so I came to check it out... I have to say, the atmosphere in Inazuma seems much improved since I left.

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: Blossoms in the sky, intoxicating the clouds, in drunken stupor...
Traveler: No games for you, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, well, you were drawn to this place, too, weren't you? I did come for the festival, but the cherry blossoms on Mt. Yougou are as arresting as ever.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I like to take things slow, stopping to appreciate the mountain views or the sound of the rain... A vacation should be a bit spontaneous, don't you think?

## Talk

Thoma: ...You three feeling alright? No side-effects?
Youko: All good! That Yumekui-Baku lady already looked us over!
Kappa: We woke up once the Nightmare Fragment was gone... It felt like one big, long dream.
Hitotsume Kozou: Sorry we couldn't help you with the game, Boss.
Thoma: Don't worry about it! Besides, there's still time! Why don't you try out "Akitsu Harpastum" and tell me what you think?
"Shousei": Let's kapow together!

## Talk

Sayu: Huh... We finished the game, but it feels like I'm forgetting something, like our original goal...
Yoimiya: Well, if you can't remember, it must not have been that important!
Kamisato Ayaka: Just let it go and enjoy the festival! All the games are super fun!
"Kichiboushi": Haha! Bake-danuki spell, pip pip!

## Talk

"Gyoubu Koban": Hm! Next time, slash slash, kapow...
Gorou: That's weird... I can't seem to understand the bake-danuki anymore...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, some kind of spell must be wearing off... Although, I think I got the gist.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's play together again next time.

## Talk

Ei: ...Though there were misunderstandings, wariness, and even hostilities along the way, we still ended up with a celebration in the end.
Ei: Seeing the bake-danuki together with all these humans and youkai... It's a moving sight indeed.
Traveler: Speaking of the bake-danuki... Where are Kinkaku and the others?
Ei: Miko took them to Mizuki so she can check them over. We needed to make sure the disappearance of the Nightmare Fragment did not have an adverse impact on them.
Ei: ...After all, you claimed striking down the nightmare could endanger the bake-danuki. Unless... that was a lie?
Traveler: O—Of course it wasn't...
Ei: ...Heh.

## Talk

Hirotatsu: So many congratulatory letters and gifts from everywhere... Gotta make sure to keep a record of them all.
Hirano: Dandelion Wine from Mondstadt, Cor Lapis from Liyue Harbor... Hmm? These... are marked for delivery to the Yashiro Commission and Amenoma Smithy.
Hirotatsu: Huh. They look like forging blueprints, and none I've ever seen before... But they are of Inazuman style. Could they be schematics that were lost at some point in the past?
Hirano: I'd guess Akademiya historians recreated and collated them. Couldn't have been easy, I'll say that. The sender has signed off as... the Vahumana school?

## Talk

Takuya: ...
Traveler: Wait, aren't you...
Takuya: *cough* That's right, I'm the Blue Oni descendant who was arrested in that previous incident. I didn't expect to meet you again under these circumstances.
Takuya: A kitsune lady came to the Police Station the other day, saying that an oni-related incident had come up, and that I might have the chance to make amends for my crime.
Takuya: But as it turned out, everything had been taken care of before I could even arrive... and I see humans and youkai staging such a grand festival together...
Takuya: ...Could it be that she just wanted me to see with my own eyes that both youkai and oni are already getting along with humans just fine...?
Takuya: *cough* Anyway, help me keep this outing of mine a secret, alright? Especially from that Crimson Oni descendant.
Takuya: He'll start pestering me to join the Arataki Gang again... which is a decision I'd rather put off until my sentence ends and I've spent some time living as a free man... I mean, oni.
Traveler: He'd go to the Police Station to look for you if he had to.
Takuya: ...On that count, I guess you'll just have to keep a better eye on him.

## Talk

Yukio: Fresh fried tofu! Hot kitsune ramen! Need a break? Come have a bowl!

## Talk

Tomoki: Dango Milk! Dango Milk! Everyone's favorite Dango Milk! Better grab one before they're all gone!

## Talk

Aratani: "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power," "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"... Looking for best sellers? We sell them here!
Aratani: And we also have Miss Leucade's new work, "Glimpses of Mysterious Inazuma." Where does the enigmatic dream-eating Baku come from? Grab this limited-time print while stocks last!

## Talk

Yata Kouki: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign. Greetings. I have been assigned as a guard for the Mikawa Flower Festival. Madam Kujou has given orders for extra caution in this matter of grave importance.
Yata Kouki: ...Well, I say that, but would anyone dare try anything funny while you're around?

## Talk

Watanabe: Our rookies lack vigilance, I say. If they were to encounter some crisis... Eh, what am I saying? A crisis, at a festival?

## Talk

Shigeru: Junkichi, I only pushed your manuscript deadline back and came with you to the Mikawa Flower Festival because you said you'd find some inspiration here... So what are you doing eating and drinking all day?
Junkichi: *cough* H—How could you besmirch the search for inspiration with the phrase "eating and drinking"? If I'm drinking anything in, it's the festive atmosphere! The sights and the sounds, the humans and youkai at play...
Junkichi: ...And in their midst, an Onimusha, a master of the "Ten Thousand Transformations"! How's that for inspiration, huh?

## Talk

Inagi Hotomi: #Hmm? Have you noticed this little youkai as well, Traveler?
Traveler: This is a youkai too?
Inagi Hotomi: That's right, though it only seems to have become one very recently — it lacks the power and intelligence to speak just yet. Still, it appears to have been attracted by the festive atmosphere.
Inagi Hotomi (???): ♪~
Inagi Hotomi: Hmm? This little one... seems to want to see the Mikawa Flower Festival with you. If I'm not mistaken, it sees you as a powerful elder youkai.
Traveler: Then let me do my duty as a "representative"...
Inagi Hotomi (???): ♪~♪~♪~
Traveler: And what might it mean this time?
Inagi Hotomi: Hmm. If I had to guess, it'd be... "I'll be in your care!"
Traveler: And show my little "junior" the sights!
Traveler: Huh, and here I thought it was a street lamp...

## Talk

Komura: Gah, I'm so full... Shouldn't have taken a kitsune on in a Kitsune Ramen eating contest, of all things...

## Talk

Asari: Were all these decorations and items created by bake-danuki? Youkai sure are awesome!

## Talk

Takeshi: Glory to— Err, I mean, glorious day we're having! How may I help you?
Traveler: ...
Takeshi: *cough* I guess nothing gets past you, huh? Anyway... since the Almighty Shogun is no longer at Tenshukaku, the areas that we, the Okuzumeshuu, must protect have... also shifted.
Traveler: I swear I've seen you before, at Tenshukaku...

## Talk

Inoue: Glory to— Err, glory to creative food, am I right? Come try some! Milk Tea Medley, Colorful Dango, and everyone's beloved, uh...
Traveler: Dango Milk?
Inoue: Right, that! Yeah! Thank you for the reminder. Goodness, memorizing such uncommon foods sure is tiring...
Traveler: Dango Milk.

## Talk

Hitomi: #It has been a while, conquerors of the Test of Courage — or should I call you "Traveler and Paimon"?
Paimon: Ah, you're that... Shrine Maiden from the Test of Courage! The one who likes saying all sorts of weird stuff! So what brings you to the Yae Publishing House's stall?
Hitomi: Hehe... O'er the land, a darkness falls, and only those our Guuji call, may search the waves of blackest night, and find within a thread of light...
Traveler: Can I request a translation?
Hitomi: Heh. Our Lady Guuji said that a brave — and relatively idle — shrine maiden was needed to guard this place, so I volunteered.
Paimon: Heh. Guess your "boldness" does mean that you fit the bill! You did experience that Test with us, after all.
Hitomi: And more importantly, my hands have indeed been quite idle since then.
Traveler: Miko sent you here again, didn't she?

## Talk

Yata Kouki: Madam Kujou wants us to act normally and keep a discrete vigil... But what, precisely, counts as "normal?" One-hundred-twenty-percent vigilance, as per usual?

## Talk

Watanabe: #*sigh* And that's what I've been telling our rookies this whole time... Ah, greetings, sir! I've been keeping an eye on this area. I'll inform you if anything happens!

## Talk

Kamen: Ah, me... I only came down for a little jaunt because they said humans and youkai were holding a festival together. But it seems there are fewer guests than I imagined... Ah, me, oh dear.

## Talk

Masuku: Hoohoo, Akitsu Harpastum sure is fun! ... Now, if only more people could play it with me...

## Talk

Senga: ...Do you think this could be some kind of youkai mischief?
Wakana: What? No, come on. I was playing with the youkai I just met yesterday, and we were getting along great...
Takitoh: And it's not like humans are all good or bad either... Maybe some youkai just don't like the Mikawa Flower Festival much...

## Talk

Takeshi: We've been informed of the situation. As an Okuzumeshuu member, it shames me to think that we can do nothing but watch while you and the Shogun go to meet the foe...
Takeshi: Our thoughts and prayers go out to you, however. And if you should need a bowl of Kitsune Ramen to replenish your strength, just say the word!

## Talk

Inoue: Finally, I'm free from having to cook all these weird creative dishes... Ugh, but I do miss them now, somehow...
Inoue: *cough* Anyway, should you fancy it, do come back and have some Dango Milk once you and our Almighty Shogun return victorious!

## Talk

Hitomi: Our Lady Guuji has instructed us to prepare for the ritual. Let us scatter this dark haze — for a bright future lies ahead!
Hitomi: Conquerors of the Test of Courage, the Mikawa Flower Festival's representative and the representative's representative... For all our sakes, may you emerge victorious once more.

## Talk

Yata Kouki: Alright, Tenryou Commission, let's give this a hundred twenty percent! We shan't fail Madam Kujou Sara this time!

## Talk

Watanabe: Well now, looks like our rookies are all fired up — and I didn't even have to try. Based on this momentum, now might be a good time to lock our future training schedule in...

## Talk

Kamen: With the nightmares banished, the Mikawa Flower Festival should be all a-bustle again! Speaking of which, I should go grab myself a prayer slip...

## Talk

Masuku: Huh, so nightmares are to blame for there being less people around to play with? Bah, what killjoys!

## Talk

Yukio: Phew... The Yashiro Commission said they'd take care of my stall for a few days... and what do you know? They've done pretty spiffing work. Everything's spick and span — why, it's like nothing was touched at all!

## Talk

Tomoki: Ugh, I've been eating food prepared by the Yashiro Commission for days and days... The horror, the repetitive, samey, monotonous horror! That's it! I'm going to show them just what the spirit of creative cuisine is all about!

## Talk

Aratani: Hmm, we've got to write proper replies to all these...
Traveler: What are these letters?
Aratani: Well, you see, the Yashiro Commission just sent over a set of congratulatory letters addressed to us specifically. We've got commemorative artwork from Mr. Calx, a handwritten letter from Mr. Zhenyu...
Aratani: And this one too: "Hey, Auntie Aratani! Hey, Lady Guuji! I hope Yae Publishing House's festival goes super great! Also, say hi to Big Sis Yoimiya for me, okay?"
Aratani: There was no marked sender, but I think I can just about guess which little miss might've had it delivered to us, heh...
