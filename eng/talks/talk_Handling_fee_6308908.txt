Traveler: Handling fee?
Yurika: Of course. If you need to get something done, a handling fee is necessary.
Yurika: It will be 500 Mora per visitor.
Yurika: Hmm, is that very little? ...Oh, this is the first time I've seen anyone complaining about the low prices, despite the large number of people arriving to set up shop here.
Yurika: But this is indeed the official fee. If you don't believe me, please check the latest regulations issued by the Kanjou Commission.
