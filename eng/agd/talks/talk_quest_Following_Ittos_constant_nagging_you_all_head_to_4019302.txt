Black Screen Text: Following Itto's constant nagging, you all head to Aisa Bathhouse once again...
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! This has gotta be the hottest one! Let's see who can last the longest! Who's in?
Thoma: Hehe, if you're that excited about it, how can I refuse?
Kuki Shinobu: Listen... This isn't a sauna...
Sayu: Ahhh... so warm... *snore*
Paimon: Hey, don't fall asleep in the tub!
Gorou: Uh... My fur is so heavy. I almost feel dizzy...
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! If you can't handle the heat, Gorou, get out of the... tub!
Kujou Sara: Hey! Stop being so loud!
Black Screen Text: On the other side...
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, Itto is as energetic as ever.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's not good to get distracted during a match, brother.

Traveler: (Be aggressive!)
