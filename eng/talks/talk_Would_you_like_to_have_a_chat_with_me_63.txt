# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yanfei: Chat? Oh, I don't know about you, but I can chat, for sure! Good luck trying to get me to stop talking...
Yanfei: You seem like the quiet type, are you sure you won't find me too... animated?
Traveler: I'm sure I'll manage...
Yanfei: Oh... good!
Yanfei: I'm not sure why, but it's nice to hear you say that.
Yanfei: In that case, why don't you choose a topic?
Traveler: Well then... let's chat about difficult clients of yours.
Yanfei: Huh? Of all the interesting topics you could choose, that's what you wanna talk about?
Traveler: Most of the time you successfully win them over.
Yanfei: Oh... I—I see.
Yanfei: Thank you...
Yanfei: Ahem, then I'll start with a client who came to me with a civil case recently...
Traveler: This way, we can figure out any outstanding issues.
Traveler: I'm quite happy just to listen.
Yanfei: Uh... Just to listen?
Yanfei: I don't think one person talking technically qualifies as a chat, per se...
Yanfei: I'm no storyteller after all — I already found my calling in life. I don't plan on spinning yarns for a living any time soon.
