Traveler: Your husband?
Momoko: My husband is a soldier in the Sangonomiya forces. He's currently stationed near Yashiori Island.
Momoko: I'm not all too familiar with the situation out there. My husband's letters don't mention the war at all. His letters are full of assurances that he's well and that there's no need to worry...
Momoko: But to tell the truth, how can I not worry about him, as his wife?
Momoko: *sigh* I miss the days when we had no such cares. When times got busy, we would be busy together. When we were free, we would watch the flowers together...
Momoko: May Watatsumi Omikami watch over my husband and ensure his safe return.
