# Light Guiding Ceremony

Venti: Looks like we're right.
Venti: There are three more halos circling the tower...
Jean: Which means, there are three more corresponding <color=#00E1FFFF>light actuators</color> to activate.
Jean: I can see one from here.
Jean: The rest must be scattered within the ruins around here. Let's go find them.
Paimon: ...Why did Dvalin pick a place filled with puzzles and seals as his lair? Doesn't he get annoyed coming back home?
Venti: He doesn't walk in, he flies in.
Paimon: ...You do have a point.
