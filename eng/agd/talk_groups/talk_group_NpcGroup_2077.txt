## Talk

Atsuko: Hello, hello... Uh, I mean...
Atsuko: Ahem. Happy Lantern Rite! May you stay healthy and hale, and may all go well with you!
Atsuko: Haha, I guess I've finally gotten used to the festive greetings that locals give one another...

## Talk

Atsuko: Hello, hello. Oh, ah, I mean, good fortune! I'm still not accustomed to using the local greetings.

## Talk

Traveler: About the letter to your family...
Atsuko: Ah, you've delivered it to my parents, have you? Thank you very much. It's a relief to know that they're doing well.
Atsuko: My mother would most likely keep worrying, while my father would try to comfort her while keeping his own worries in his heart...
Atsuko: *sigh* It was only after leaving that I realized how much they must miss. I'm... really sorry for making them worry.

## Talk

Traveler: About your homeland...
Atsuko: Sometimes I miss the sights that I used to see in my home... The tranquil Chinju Forest, the lovely Sacred Sakura... I grew up with them.
Atsuko: But after the Sakoku Decree was implemented, Inazuma really became such an oppressive place. For someone who loves freedom like me, it was simply unbearable.
Atsuko: If we wanted to leave, we'd have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people would never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: That's why I eventually just grabbed the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: The journey was tough, but thanks to the intervention of some locals from Liyue, I now have my freedom!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Atsuko: Okay, stay safe!

## Talk

Atsuko: We meet again! It's great to see you here in Inazuma...

## Talk

Traveler: Hello there, Atsuko.
Atsuko: It has been a long time, Traveler.
Atsuko: Previously, we would only meet in Liyue Harbor. I never expected that I would run into you again here.
Atsuko: It seems that you travel between nations quite frequently. That's very impressive.

## Talk

Traveler: You've returned home, I see.
Atsuko: I heard from the Crux Fleet's sailors that the Almighty Shogun has abolished the Sakoku Decree.
Atsuko: So I thought to myself, maybe the samurai at the Police Station might give me a pass and let me return home.
Atsuko: So I boarded a ship bound for Inazuma. I found upon my return that many things have changed.
Atsuko: But the biggest change was... Well, my parents had aged a lot. They had been concerned for my safety this whole time...
Atsuko: Still, they were all smiles when they greeted me. That was something that didn't change.
Atsuko: That's why I've decided to stay for a while longer to accompany them.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Atsuko: Goodbye. Safe travels.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you heard about that other "you"?
Atsuko: Oh? You mean the one who was staying with my parents at one point?
Atsuko: Um, how should I put it... It's such a strange story...
Atsuko: That said, I'd love to meet "her" if I have the chance.
Atsuko: Who knows, "she" might be able to help me out a bit.

## Talk

Traveler: Still want to travel the world?
Atsuko: Haha, you remember that? Thanks for the concern.
Atsuko: I'm still serious about that dream. I'm sure you understand me as only a fellow traveler could.
Atsuko: Now that Inazuma's policies have changed so much, going out to travel is no longer such an arduous task... So if a suitable opportunity comes along, I'll continue my journey.
Atsuko: But for now, I'll continue to stay with my parents.

## Talk

Traveler: That's not great, surely...
Atsuko: What's wrong with it? You mean, breaking Inazuman regulations?
Atsuko: I think it depends on the person. Some people are quite content to spend their whole lives within the fences of their farm...
Atsuko: But not me! If there's anything that can fence me in, it's somewhere beyond these lands, beyond the seas, beyond the stars!
Atsuko: If you can't understand the value of freedom, let me be the one to explain it to you!

## Talk

Traveler: Freedom...
Atsuko: Perhaps everyone has a different understanding of and way of pursuing freedom...
Atsuko: Some people are quite content to spend their whole lives within the fences of their farm...
Atsuko: But not me! If there's anything that can fence me in, it's somewhere beyond these lands, beyond the seas, beyond the stars!
Atsuko: Only by breaking through these boundaries and going out into the world can we understand the value of freedom!

## Talk

Traveler: I wish you the best of luck.
Atsuko: Thanks!
Atsuko: Though this has been quite the bumpy ride, it does not seem so hard while freedom yet stirs in my heart.
Atsuko: I hope that your future journeys will go smoothly as well!

## Talk

Atsuko: I wonder how mom is doing, and dad as well...
Atsuko: Oh? Traveler? What are you doing here? I remember you asked me how to go to Inazuma last time...
Traveler: I've been to Inazuma.
Atsuko: You did go. And you managed to come back...
Atsuko: You live up to your reputation as a warrior. Your abilities are far beyond those of ordinary folks like me.
Atsuko: Oh right! If you don't mind, can you do me a favor?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Atsuko: When I left Inazuma, I left without saying goodbye.
Atsuko: Ever since I was little, I've longed for the world outside of Inazuma. I liked to travel and I disliked being controlled by my parents.
Atsuko: After they issued the Vision Hunt Decree, the atmosphere in Inazuma has become increasingly suffocating. That's why I decided to leave my hometown.
Atsuko: When I came to Liyue, although I managed to find a way to survive. I couldn't find a reliable person to send a message to my family back home.
Atsuko: Can I ask you for a favor to help deliver a letter to my parents?
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Atsuko: Thank you! Well, I'll leave the letter to you.
Atsuko: By the way, my father's name is "Yoh," and my mother's name is "Michiru." I'll mark the address on the map for you.
Atsuko: After leaving my hometown, I've experienced a lot. Now I know that if I want to become an independent and strong woman, I can't just rely on my parents like before.
Atsuko: I've decided that I won't go back to my hometown in the near future. If I encounter any difficulties outside, I will face them by myself.
Atsuko: I think my parents will be proud of me if I can do that.
Atsuko: I also wrote about my determination in the letter, so please take it to my parents.
Traveler: Do you want to go back and have a look?
Atsuko: Although I miss my parents, if I go back now, I'm afraid I won't be able to leave anymore.
Atsuko: I don't have the ability to come and go freely like you. No matter what, I wouldn't dare to go back.
Atsuko: I'll be happy if you can take this letter to Inazuma. I really wouldn't ask for anything more.
Traveler: Is anything bothering you?

Traveler: Do you want to go back and have a look?
Atsuko: I miss my parents, that's true, but there are still things that I need to do here in Liyue...
Atsuko: I don't have the ability to come and go freely like you, either, so though I'd love to return, I can't.
Atsuko: I'll be happy if you can take this letter to Inazuma. As for what comes after... we can talk about it afterwards.
Traveler: Is anything bothering you?

Atsuko: Hello, hello. Oh, ah, I mean, good fortune! I'm still not accustomed to using the local greetings.

## Talk

Traveler: You are...?
Atsuko: Haha, I'm so sorry, my name is Atsuko, it's lovely to meet you.
Atsuko: I've never seen this many outlanders before back in Inazuma.

## Talk

Traveler: Hi there! You don't seem to be from around here either.
Atsuko: That's right, I'm from Inazuma. It's been a long road getting here.
Atsuko: Facing the crashing waves before me, whilst trying to escape the forces behind me... My raft sank, my money got swept away by the sea...
Atsuko: Was a good thing the locals helped me, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here today. I've decided I want to get a job on a boat and travel all around the world.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Atsuko: Okay, stay safe!

## Talk

Traveler: Inazuma?
Atsuko: Yes, my home, back on the other side of the ocean.
Atsuko: Though I don't wish to speak ill of my homeland, the pressure back home is just too much.
Atsuko: If you want to leave, you have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: So... One day when I was gazing out to see, something in me just snapped. I just took the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: So if you see anyone wearing clothes similar to mine, they're probably from Inazuma. Please, if you see such a person, you cannot breathe a word of this to them, they cannot know I'm here. Please, I beg of you.
