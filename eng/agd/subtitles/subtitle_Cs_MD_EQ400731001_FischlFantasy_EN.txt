One stormy night
A girl found a way to the future in the library
She said to herself:
I shall create my dream kingdom
I'll carve mountains and oceans, and erect castles and towns
Then she spoke to those who shared her dream:
Please be proud of all that is unreal
For we are greater than this world!
For our magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise
