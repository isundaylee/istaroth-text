Charlotte: Lantern Rite was simply amazing! I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight!
Traveler: About the "Mechanical Vertical Lifting Device"...
Charlotte: Oh, that? Yeah, interesting story.
Charlotte: It was invented by a guy from Fontaine. His name is Ildesson.
Charlotte: He's always tinkering away at some mechanism or another. He's even asked The Steambird to write about his inventions on more than one occasion.
Charlotte: I believe I have a direct quote from him about this particular one. Ah yes, here it is.
Charlotte: The device is powered entirely by mechanical components without the need for any additional energy source...
Charlotte: Basically, it's a manually operated cranking device. How high it can fly entirely depends on how much force you can exert...
Charlotte: Combining this invention with a kite... What a great idea, right!
Traveler: About the interview and working together with Gaming's father...
Charlotte: My conversation with Mr. Yip went really well. I've already sent the first draft of my article back to The Steambird.
Charlotte: It's a piece that contains all the pertinent information while also telling a story. I'm quite proud of it.
Charlotte: Oh, that reminds me, I should thank everyone who made this possible for meÔºÅEspecially that spirited lady with those peculiar turns of phrase... Miss Xianyun was her name, right?
Charlotte: It was all thanks to your connections and creativity. I would have never thought I'd be able to bring such a special gift back to Fontaine with me.
Traveler: About Lantern Rite...
Charlotte: This was my first time experiencing a foreign holiday in person. It was... so exciting!
Charlotte: The festive atmosphere, the contagious holiday spirit, the profound, storied cultural traditions steeped in symbolism...
Charlotte: Ah, I almost forgot! Keqing even gave me a kite with a poem on it that she wrote herself!
Charlotte: It goes, "Dreams are like paper kites, with them do our hopes take flight, sailing high above the clouds, they yearn for something more profound, yet try we may and try we might, a deeper truth waits in plain sight, though we hang our hopes in skies abound, many joys lie on the ground."
Charlotte: I want to include this poem in my special feature on Lantern Rite. I'm sure a lot of people will love it!
Traveler: Until next time, Charlotte.
Charlotte: Yep! And Happy Lantern Rite to you!

## Talk

Jiehu: Given your present countenance, one presumes you are missing some old friends again?
Houzhang: One cannot help but be reminded of them...
Jiehu: Pray, speak. Unburden yourself of these sentiments.
Houzhang: One simply wishes Menogias were alive to witness such peace alongside us.
Houzhang: He was so skilled in matters of craftsmanship. Kite-making would scarcely prove to be a test of his capabilities. Were he yet amongst the living, he could have opened a kite stall. One is certain it would have been an establishment rich not only in profit but also esteem.
Houzhang: And if, as in the past, he were unable to involve himself in matters of the mortal realm, we could sell the kites in his stead. When we finished, we could bring him back wine and partake in drink and good company...
Jiehu: Moon Carver. Those are now but fond moments in our memories.
Houzhang: ...Indeed. The dead are gone, so, as the representatives of the living...
Houzhang: Let us take in the sights for a bit longer, if just for his sake.

## Talk

Shenhe: I don't get it...
Ganyu: Is something wrong, Shenhe? Tell me. Perhaps I can help.
Shenhe: The color black doesn't get dirty easily, so I thought this outfit would be acceptable to wear to work. But Xiangling told me it was inappropriate.
Shenhe: But inappropriate... how?
Ganyu: ...She probably just meant the outfit isn't suitable for that particular environment and occasion.
Ganyu: But for a festival gathering with friends, a nighttime stroll, or an important banquet... your outfit is more than appropriate, Shenhe.
Shenhe: So you're saying it's only something I should wear in front of important people.
Ganyu: Hm... I suppose that's another way to think of it.

## Talk

Yip Tak: So you're still a big fan of Winter Melon Cake then?
Gaming: Eh? Oh, I guess you heard everything Paimon was saying, huh?
Yip Tak: Hehe... Of course. She was talking about you. As your father, how could I not listen?
Yip Tak: Remember back when you were a kid and you would sit on my shoulders to watch the Wushou dance? On our way back home, you would beg me to buy you some Winter Melon Cake.
Yip Tak: We would only buy two at a time, but before long, we'd tried the Winter Melon Cake from every vendor that street had to offer.
Yip Tak: There was also that one time you used your pocket money to treat me! Do you still remember?
Gaming: Yeah... I remember.
Yip Tak: That was the best Winter Melon Cake I ever had...
Gaming: Let's go back sometime. The shop's still there, and I remember the way. My treat, just like before.
Yip Tak: ...Are you sure?
Gaming: Absolutely!

## Talk

Qiqi: Our kite is so high up.
Qiqi: Thank you for inviting me, Yaoyao. I am having... a lot of fun.
Yaoyao: I'm glad!
Yaoyao: If you want, we can go fly kites some other time too. The fun doesn't have to end today!
Qiqi: Really?
Yaoyao: How about we do it during the day next time? That way, we can see the design better! When it flies super high up, it will look exactly like a real finch.
Qiqi: Okay.
Qiqi: Can I... take this kite to bed with me?
Yaoyao: Hehe, but of course!

## Talk

Xianyun: One may have won the kite-flying competition, Yuheng, but this prize should truly be reserved for another.
Keqing: You need not be so humble, Honored Adeptus. Among all the kites, yours was quite literally a cut above the rest. Please accept this prize. You deserve it.
Keqing: Besides, I'm quite certain we owe a fair share of the success of this year's Lantern Rite to you...
Xianyun: ...Hm, if you insist, then one can hardly continue to refuse. However, there is another matter with which one would ask your assistance.
Keqing: Of course.
Xianyun: One would be much obliged if you could distribute this case of Sunglo Tea among the Millelith on duty. The security of the festivities rests entirely on their shoulders, after all. One presumes they could always benefit from something to invigorate their spirits.
Keqing: (Cloud Retainer is so thoughtful and attentive to others' needs! I would expect nothing less of an esteemed adeptus such as herself.)
Keqing: Understood. I'll get on that right away.
Xianyun: (Phew... a fortuitous result indeed. One's tea surplus has hitherto resolved itself.)

## Talk

Xiao: #Traveler.
Traveler: It's just as I thought... You stopped short of stepping into the city again.
Xiao: Being in the city isn't the only way for me to appreciate the lights and beauty of Lantern Rite. Look... Liyue Harbor lies just beyond this mountain.
Xiao: As long as I stand at this vantage point, I may freely behold the sight of all the kites slowly ascending into the sky.
Xiao: ...For me, that is enough.
Traveler: Alright.
Xiao: I invited you here because there is something I would like to do.
Xiao: ...I want to release a Xiao Lantern, and... I'd like you to be there for it.
Traveler: Did you make it yourself?
Xiao: Yes.
Xiao: I apologize for its crude appearance... I have little skill in that regard.
Traveler: No, no! It's amazing.
Xiao: ...You are very kind, as usual.
Xiao: Alright. It's time.

## Talk

Xiao: ...
Traveler: (As the Xiao Lantern slowly disappears into the tranquil night sky, Xiao's expression softens.)
Xiao: #Traveler.
Xiao: ...Thank you.

## Talk

Linlang: Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... How may I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: About kites...
Linlang: They carry peoples' thoughts into the skies. Don't you think that's quite similar to how Xiao Lanterns work?
Linlang: This year's theme is kites, which connects with the idea of those lanterns in interesting ways.
Linlang: I wonder if there're any legends that also link the two... Should there be any link to ancient relics, that would make for a most captivating story.

## Talk

Nervous An: Hello there, friend. Have you decided on the sort of kites you'd like to make?
Nervous An: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I just wanted to perhaps use your work as reference material.
Nervous An: I've been waiting for this holiday for so long, but now that it's here, I can't figure out which patterns I like...
Nervous An: I mean, there's no way I'll be sewing expired documents into a kite, surely?
Nervous An: I'm kidding. It's fine even if I don't have my own kite, really. It'll still be interesting watching others fly theirs.

## Talk

Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask for a Suanni kite?
Changchang: I saw one, a glowing one, while playing by myself!
Changchang: Hmm... I wonder if Daddy could buy me one?

## Talk

Musheng: Heh, doubtless, the city is more festive.
Musheng: The heroes we commemorate during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: Do you know which adeptus the Mingxiao Lantern commemorates this year?
Musheng: I asked around for information, and a gentleman who looked very knowledgeable told me that the adeptus' name is Menogias, also known as General Kapisas.
Musheng: I've heard that although he was most famous for being a deadly yaksha warrior, he was also well-versed in clothing design and tailoring.
Musheng: An adeptus of artistry, sounds like! I'm sure he will bless us with novelty!

## Talk

Vlad: Do you ever think that there might be some kites that can no longer be retrieved after being sent up into the sky?
Nadia: I guess so? Even if you could control the line, the wind might decline your commands all the same.
Nadia: Speaking of that, should we go buy one? I mean, I haven't flown one before, so I'm not sure if it'll work out...
Vlad: Or... What say we make one together? I've seen kids discussing the patterns they want to draw on theirs, so it might not be that difficult.
Nadia: The two of us... Sure, let's give it a go!

## Talk

Ivanovich: I never knew kites came in so many styles...
Ivanovich: Ah, don't worry, I didn't mean anything untoward by that.
Ivanovich: Variety and novelty are a merchant's great loves, after all!
Ivanovich: If we could use such stylizations in other products... Hmm, perhaps bring in some of those Fontainian machines we're importing... Yes, that could be a promising new market.

## Talk

Yiran: Manager Kuan! Thanks for the kite you bought me! Now, let's go fly it!
Manager Kuan: Firstly, for the umpteenth time, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: Also, since I bought that kite, could you call me "Daddy"?
Yiran: Well, if you're "Daddy," why don't you take me kite-flying?
Manager Kuan: This... Well, Daddy's been working, so he doesn't know how to fly kites.
Yiran: In that case, maybe you should learn, Manager Kuan!
Yiran: You always tell me to study hard, Manager Kuan, so now it's your turn!
Yiran: You've gotta set a good example, right, Daddy?

## Talk

Granny Shan: Happy Lantern Rite, youngster! See any toys you like?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about kites...
Granny Shan: Ah, so you're here to buy one, are you?
Granny Shan: There's lots of new designs for this year's Lantern Rite, and some of them have come equipped with devices that will let them fly more easily...
Granny Shan: As for me, I just have some traditional patterns, and all these newfangled items do rather confuse me. If you want to buy them, you might want to drop by Zhenyuan's stall.
Granny Shan: She's my niece, and she came to Liyue Harbor from Chenyu Vale this year to do business. Young people are full of energy, but they can be prone to mistakes, so please do take care of her.

## Talk

Jiayi: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
Jiayi: Have you flown any kites lately?
Jiayi: I saw many kids around these parts flying kites together...
Jiayi: I wonder if you could see them from atop the hills of Qingce Village...
Jiayi: *sigh* Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...

## Talk

Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.
Kun: If it wasn't for the fact that I need to stick to my post, I'd have bought a kite to fly already.
Kun: I mean, hearing them talk, you'd know that with that new mechanical propulsion thingamabob, any kite can fly with ease!
Kun: ...Hmm. Does that mean that I could fly a kite while working?

## Talk

Linling: The kites follow the wind into the sky, across the heavens do they fly ‚Äî save those that into lanterns crash, that burn to ashes in a flash.
Linling: Yes, yes...

## Talk

Andrei: Why, hello there. How may I help you?
Andrei: If this is about work, please allow me to decline for now. This festive season is quite hard to come by after all. Feeling the sea breeze, watching the kites... It is all ever so pleasant...

## Talk

Hongyu: New year, new horizons!
Hongyu: I mean, look, the kites this year have mechanical devices on them. Next thing you know, we'll be mounting compasses on our Xiao Lanterns!
Hongyu: That way, we can get them to send letters just like our pigeons.
Hongyu: Hmm? You think I'm kidding? Well, maybe I am!

## Talk

Clerk Zhao: Phew. Lantern Rite sure is a tiring time. Best get some rest...
Clerk Zhao: But a strange anxiety seems to take me whenever I stop...
Clerk Zhao: After all, Lady Yuheng has assigned us a new task for international cooperation, so I still can't rest...

## Talk

Yong'an: Hello. I... you... cat... ATCHOO!
Yong'an: Sorry, sorry... But you know how this year's theme is kites, right? Well, people sometimes come to the docks to test theirs out...
Yong'an: And sometimes, they fail to fly, only to be snatched away by cats...
Yong'an: And then I need to help them retrieve those lost kites... the cats... ATCHOO!

## Talk

Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite just to see me?
Ying'er: It's been a while, but you still look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: Would you be interested in trying my new fragrance?
Ying'er: You could even daub some on the kite you're flying. That way, it'll carry far and wide.
Ying'er: I imagine such a kite would make a fine decoration in your home, too.
Ying'er: It's sure to leave a lasting impression.

## Talk

Zhenyuan: Welcome! We've got all sorts of new kites here! Feel free to take a look!

## Talk

Traveler: I'll have a look at those kites.
Zhenyuan: Right over here, then. Take your time ‚Äî I'll even give you a discount.

## Talk

Traveler: So, about the kites here...
Zhenyuan: Oh? Are you wondering where I got them from? Well, they're all home-made by myself and my family!
Zhenyuan: Don't you worry, I've been learning this craft from my aunt Granny Shan since I was a kid. I've been in this line for over a decade now, so rest assured, my handiwork's fine as fine can be.
Zhenyuan: Ah, she was pleased as punch to hear that this year's theme was kites.
Zhenyuan: But she also told me in her letters of how she couldn't wrangle with those new Fontainian devices, so I came over to help her out.
Zhenyuan: You could say that kite-making's a family craft. If you like 'em, feel free to buy a few more!

## Talk

Traveler: About the art of making kites...
Zhenyuan: Ah, guess I haven't told you all that much about my aunt, Granny Shan, have I?
Zhenyuan: Everyone in my family can at least sorta make kites, but she's the best at it by far. You could even call her love for making 'em an "obsession" of sorts.
Zhenyuan: How her eyes would sparkle when she taught me the traditional lantern patterns! I listened and studied hard... but I couldn't tell you if I'd ever catch up with her.
Zhenyuan: Hehe... Now, she might look old, but you should see the smile on her face when she's working with those kites!
Zhenyuan: If my kids are willing, I'd love to hand this craft down to them, too...

## Talk

Unknown Role (None): See you around.
Zhenyuan: See you! Have fun now, and have a Happy Lantern Rite!

## Talk

Xiaqing: #Dude of legendary deeds, you're positively glowing. Looks like you're rarin' to go! Ready for a round of "Just Wushou Dance!"?
Traveler: Yes, I will have this dance.
Xiaqing: Rock on, have fun!
Traveler: About the props and venue for "Just Wushou Dance!"...
Xiaqing: Not bad, eh? All the mods were made by yours truly!
Xiaqing: I added several kinds of special talcum powder to the dance suit, and it all gets mixed together when you pull the rope! The mixture releases a bunch of gas, which helps the outfit suddenly stiffen, solid as a rock and proud as a lion!
Xiaqing: So no matter how much you jump and dance, or bump and prance, you won't get hurt none! Fun and safety, all in one!
Xiaqing: The technique's been used on ships for a long time now, y'know. Sailors use it to protect cargo! No matter how the waves toss around the boxes, the stuff inside won't get smashed to smithereens.
Xiaqing: Anyway, as for the venue, I rented it from the shop! A big ol' empty basement like that, just sitting there unused and wasted. Well, it's sure being put to good use now!
Xiaqing: The boss of this shop is pretty dope, too! Me promoting the Wushou Dance game helps bring in big business, so he didn't ask for much rent!
Xiaqing: Depending on how things go, maybe I'll even be able to get Gaming over to put on a real show here!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite! Don't forget to rest!
Xiaqing: No prob! Play hard, eat harder!

## Talk

Xiaqing: Just bit more prep, and this event will be even doper!
Traveler: (This person seems to be busy preparing an event, and doesn't have much time for idle banter...)

## Talk

Wenxun: Round and fluffy, soft and bouncy... Now that's coming along nicely, almost done!
Traveler: (She seems quite happy, concentrating so single-mindedly on prepping something... Best not to disturb her right now.)

## Talk

Juanshu: I need to consider the route more carefully. we must maximize the number of people who will witness their passing radiance...
Traveler: (She seems to be thinking about something very important. She hasn't even noticed our presence next to her.)
