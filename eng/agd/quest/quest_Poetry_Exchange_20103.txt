# Poetry Exchange


## Talk 1

Ella Musk: Good to see you again! You remember me, right? ...Surely you at least remember our friendship-building with the hilichurls?
Ella Musk: Don't give me that look... This is the nature of learning a language. You have to practice, practice, practice!
Ella Musk: Rest assured, your efforts were not wasted! My spoken Hilichurlian has improved by leaps and bounds since that day...
Ella Musk: But I also had to get my written Hilichurlian up to scratch. So, after an intense period of research, I have now composed a series of original Hilichurlian poems!
Ella Musk: That said, there are still a few lines I'm not sure of. I need to check the meaning... Could you go and test them out for me?
Traveler: ..."Test them out"?
Ella Musk: You know, like... Read them out to a hilichurl and see how they react!
Ella Musk: Don't worry! I've *marked* the lines where I'm not quite sure of the meaning. And anyway, I'm sure I can't be too far off...
Ella Musk: I've already got a place in mind. The hilichurls there look friendlier than most. Just read out the individual lines I've queried to them.
Ella Musk: Thanks for your help! Come back here after you've read them the poetry, I want to know everything!
Traveler: ...Reading to hilichurls? Again?
Ella Musk: That's right! You're experienced at it, after all. And don't worry, I've *marked* the lines where I'm not quite sure of the meaning. I'm sure I can't be too far off though...
Ella Musk: I've already got a place in mind. The hilichurls there look friendlier than most. Just read out the individual lines I've queried to them.
Ella Musk: Thanks for your help! Come back here after you've read them the poetry, I want to know everything!
Ella Musk: And, um, if it doesn't go quite as planned, I'm sure you'll have no trouble resolving the situation...

## Talk 2

Paimon: She was right, these hilichurls do seem a bit different...
Paimon: Let's get this recital over with. Paimon doubts you'll find any friendlier hilichurls than these!
Paimon: Which line should we start with?

## Talk 3

Traveler: Celi dada, mimi nunu!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Muhe ye!

## Talk 5

Traveler: Ye dada!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Ya yika!

## Talk 7

Traveler: Nini zido!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh... That seemed to go well...
Paimon: What do you know — the hilichurl seems to like it! Go on, read the next one.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Huh? What is it doing that for? ...It seems to be enjoying this a little too much, if anything. Is Ella Musk really that good of a poet?
Paimon: Oh no... Ah! Watch out, over there! Hilichurls, incoming!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Whoa... So hilichurls dance now. Paimon guesses they really liked that one.
Paimon: Paimon thinks that's enough Hilichurlian poetry reading for one day. Let's head back and see Ella Musk.

## Talk 11

Ella Musk: How did it go? Did you recite those lines to the hilichurls?
Traveler: I did indeed.
Ella Musk: So how did they take it? From the looks of it I'm guessing... it went well?
Traveler: It went pretty well!
Ella Musk: So my understanding of the vocabulary was correct after all. Great news!
Ella Musk: Another step forward for the field of Hilichurlian Studies.
Ella Musk: One day, I'll be able to converse freely with the hilichurls, and hear all the secrets they have to share right from their own mouths. When that day comes...
Ella Musk: I'll finally be able to say that I have lived up to the Musk family name.
Ella Musk: Oh, but before all that — this is for you. Thanks so much.

## Talk 12

Ella Musk: How did it go? Did you recite my poetry to the hilichurls?
Traveler: I did indeed.
Ella Musk: So how did they take it? From the looks of it I'm guessing... uh, not so well...?
Traveler: There was an issue.
Ella Musk: Did you make sure to follow my notes? Or were even they wrong?
Ella Musk: I'm... so sorry. It seems I'm not as proficient as I thought I was... Guess I need to study a bit harder. Thanks for the help anyway, and please take these for your trouble.
Ella Musk: ...I need to get a handle on this. I cannot let down the Musk family name.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Hmm, not much of a reaction. Seems it isn't interested in talking.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Guess we'll just have to guess what it's saying from its body language...

## Talk 15

Ella Musk: I wonder if the hilichurls will like my poetry...
Traveler: What inspired you to write Hilichurlian poetry?
Ella Musk: Honestly, it's because I want to improve my language skills. There's certain grammatical rules, sentence structures, lexical collocations and so on where I haven't quite grasped everything.
Ella Musk: I put an enormous amount of hard work into writing these lines, but who knows — they might still sound clumsy and unnatural to a native speaker.
Ella Musk: Sometimes just one wrong word choice creates the wrong connotation, and then you've changed the meaning of the entire sentence... There's only one way to learn little nuances like that, and that is to talk to an actual hilichurl.
Ella Musk: Most people find the idea of learning Hilichurlian directly from the hilichurls to be intolerable.
Ella Musk: But not me. If I'm serious about getting proficient in Hilichurlian and understand their culture, this is something I have to do.
Ella Musk: And what could be a more fitting way to communicate with Mondstadt's hilichurls than through the medium of poetry?
Traveler: What are these comments?
Ella Musk: Oh, the ones at the very end? Yeah... So, all the vocabulary in these poems I have definitely seen before in other texts...
Ella Musk: And with each word, I did try my best to take cues from the original usage conditions as I pieced the sentences together...
Ella Musk: ...But languages are complex things. Sometimes, even the most benign-seeming word can change meaning when used in a specific context, enough to affect the meaning of the entire sentence...
Ella Musk: Anyway. These verses are the ones I'm most confident on in terms of comprehension. Relatively speaking.
Ella Musk: I've got other verses that I still don't know how to translate into Common, even though I wrote them... I'll spare you those ones.
Traveler: Seems to me you've more or less figured it out already...
Ella Musk: Well... "more or less" is still a far cry from "completely." And even though I set out to achieve a friendly interaction with the hilichurls...
Ella Musk: ...I doubt they would give me the chance to explain if something didn't come across as I intended. More likely, they'd get riled up and I wouldn't make it back in one piece...
Ella Musk: So. That's where you come in! Hehehe. ...You'll be fine, honest! Just follow my notes and you will almost certainly have no problems whatsoever.
Ella Musk: Almost certainly...
