# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About your research topic...
Iris: I come from a family of academics. Everyone has either worked at the Akademiya or continued their studies there. So, research has become an essential part of my life.
Iris: I'm from Vahum{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}ana, and am currently conducting research on the history of the desert and King Deshret.
Iris: One of my younger sisters also happens to be researching the semantics of the ancient King Deshret runes, so occasionally we'll discuss our findings together.
Iris: But she has to instruct new students during the day, so we can only talk at night.
