Manager Xiao: Hmph. Young people nowadays have no work ethic worth mentioning!
Manager Xiao: They slack off at key times and care so much about the holidays, yet know nothing of enterprise or responsibility.
Manager Xiao: If everyone was this lax in their duties, we wouldn't have managed to construct a single small fishing boat, let alone the Jade Chamber!

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Manager Xiao: Not now. I can't let myself be distracted while I'm at work.
Manager Xiao: I'm getting old myself, and the thought did once cross my mind: Will the dockyard collapse into dysfunction after I die?
Manager Xiao: But the answer is no! The orderly functioning of the dockyard, and of Liyue, is based on centuries of tradition. Things like that do not simply disappear overnight... I, for one, will not allow it!
Manager Xiao: In the same way, if the Lord of Geo is truly deceased... Well, I will simply continue to do my job. Just as I have always done. To do otherwise would be to dishonor his legacy.

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Manager Xiao: Hmph. There's nothing to be said. Someone did once ask me if Liyue would descend into chaos should Rex Lapis pass away...
Manager Xiao: My answer then was "no" — and now that the Rite of Parting has ended, Liyue Harbor's present state proves that I was right!
Manager Xiao: Liyue Harbor has become a well-oiled machine over many years of development, one that will continue to run even in the absence of its creator!
Manager Xiao: That's all from me. There's still much to do! Manning our posts and doing our duty — that's how we will honor his memory!

Traveler: You are...?
Manager Xiao: I'm the Dockyard Manager here in Liyue Harbor. Name's Xiao. Is there something I can help you with? If not, I need to get back to work.
Traveler: Actually, about your work...
Manager Xiao: Work? Bah! Don't get me started! Young people these days... No expertise, zero sense of responsibility, they don't bother to tell you when they aren't going to show up, and when they do show up... Half the time they do more harm than good, and the other half they expect you to applaud every word that comes out of their mouths... Honestly, if we old folks weren't hand-holding them every step of the way...
Manager Xiao: I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Liyue's ships are the face of the nation. We should be aiming for perfection every time! Each spot you miss with the paintbrush harms not just my reputation, but that of Liyue itself!
Manager Xiao: Bah, I'm wasting my breath... You outlanders wouldn't understand anyway...

Traveler: You seem to be in a good mood.
Manager Xiao: I certainly am! I'm out with my wonderful granddaughter — she's such a good kid. When I spend time with her I just forget all about the stress of the workday.
Manager Xiao: Also... To see the ships safely leaving the harbor and safely returning, it makes me feel like all my efforts are not in vain... Like it's all worth it.

## Talk 10

Manager Xiao: I am Dockyard Manager Xiao. Is there anything I can help with regarding Xiao Lanterns?

### Talk 10 related talk 0

Traveler: I want to trade Xiao Lantern materials.
Manager Xiao: It's a pain in the neck when you're missing odd bits and pieces, isn't it? There's plenty of stock in the dockyard warehouse. Feel free to look around for anything you might find useful.

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me more about Xiao Lantern making.
Manager Xiao: Xiao Lantern making is a traditional craft form at Lantern Rite. It's quite technical, you need to cut the paper, insert the wick, add wish sticks, paint it...
Manager Xiao: ...Overwhelmed? Don't give up just yet. Fortunately, only previous generations had to make them that way.
Manager Xiao: These days, if you know how to use a Crafting Bench it makes things much easier.
Manager Xiao: Hopefully, the gods don't think that cheapens the wishes we make.
Manager Xiao: The Crafting Bench is over there. Why not give it a try? Lantern Rite only comes once a year.
