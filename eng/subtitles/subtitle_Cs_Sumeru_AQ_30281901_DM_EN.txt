We all nestle under the great tree of wisdom
Peering out to perceive the world
From the earth
And from the rain
We perceive its wonders until we become a white bird
To perch atop a branch...
And finally snap off the most important leaf
Once upon a time
I alone dreamed in this world
In my dreams
Everybody would also dream after they fell asleep
Wild and wonderful thoughts would emerge from their minds
Some tumbled to the ground
And others floated to the sky
Connecting all things in the world
Into one dazzling net
Among a plethora of worlds
Were numerous smaller worlds
All of fate
Finding within the tapestry their brilliant glow
I gradually understood
That these indescribable
And constantly changing things
Are the most profound things in the world
Only they
Can completely repel the madness
Only dreams
Can awaken consciousness
From the deepest darkness
I'm the one who posed this question
Yet also the one who sought a solution
Saving the world with the dreams of the people
Used to be my answer
And now
You've also found your own answer
And I shall return all the dreams
To the people
Goodbye
People of Sumeru
May you be blessed tonight
With the sweetest of dreams
