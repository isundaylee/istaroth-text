# The Truth Shrouded in Shadow


## Talk 1

Paimon: ...!
Lyney: ...
Lyney: Did you two run into any trouble over the past few days?
Paimon: No, we just worked our shifts according to the schedule. Nothing weird happened.
Lyney: Mmm, that's good. That means you didn't raise any suspicions when you infiltrated the infirmary.
Lyney: We've taken a look at the slip you've sent. Freminet successfully left the grounds via the pipes two days ago, and as of last night, Lynette has also infiltrated the infirmary after faking an illness.
Paimon: Wait, why is she getting involved as well?
Lyney: You already went above and beyond when you scoped out the infirmary. To put it more bluntly, even if we were to view that as something you did in exchange for Freminet's help, you've already done more than enough.
Lyney: Infiltrating a guarded stronghold is a different kind of job from a one-off investigation. We want to avoid using the same faces over and over, and reduce the amount of suspicion that will fall on any given person.
Lyney: Lynette also felt like you have already taken the first step for us, so she should be the one to finish the job.
Paimon: So that's what Lynette thinks... Paimon hopes everything's going well for her.
Traveler: ...Yeah.
Lyney: Then... Let's go check on Lynette before Freminet returns. If everything went well, then she should be wrapping up her investigation right about now.
Paimon: Is now really a good time to go over?
Lyney: According to my observations, Sigewinne always spends around half an hour away from the infirmary right before lunch. Lynette knows this as well, so this should be a good time to meet up with her.
Traveler: Oh yeah, we heard about that too.
Lyney: Also, I'm her brother, remember? It's only natural for an older brother to care about his younger sister's well-being.
Paimon: Okay, then let's head over right away!
Traveler: ...I'm not opposed to helping you.
Lyney: Perhaps that's true. You are both very good people, and we've come to appreciate that more than anyone else. Unfortunately, there's still one thing that could get between us, lest you've forgotten... The matter of our respective loyalties.
Lyney: You've mentioned before that you've had some run-ins with the Fatui. I can understand that feeling, so I assume you're just helping us out of the kindness of your hearts?
Paimon: Well, everyone could use some more friends! We'll be counting on you to help us in the future too.
Lyney: Mhm. Since I see you as friends, then it's even more important for us to protect you from any peril. Freminet and Lynette feel the same way.
Traveler: ...I get it now.
Lyney: Glad to hear it.

## Talk 2

Lyney: Lynette should be here right now...
Lyney: ...
Lyney: Strange... Lynette?
Paimon: As expected, Sigewinne isn't here, but... why isn't Lynette here?
Traveler: Could she have found a lead...
Lyney: ...No, Lynette rarely deviates from the plan. We agreed that if she were to make changes on the fly, she'd find a way to let me know.
Lyney: Unless...
Paimon: Let's see if there are any clues around here, we can look while we wait for her. Who knows, maybe she'll be back soon!
Lyney: Okay.
Traveler: And left to follow it?

## Talk 3

Paimon: There are some books here, and a few files... They all look like medical records.
Paimon: Hmm... "Advanced Nursing," "How to Raise the Spirits of Your Patients," "A Quick Guide to the Psychology of Emotions," and "The Meaning of Laughter"...
Paimon: These sure are some interesting books... Who knew Sigewinne would be interested in these kinds of things...
Paimon: She even has books on understanding people's motivations and feelings... Is it because she's a Melusine? Or does she have a need to understand her patients' emotional state?
Lyney: Seems quite normal to me. These are skills that would come in handy for a nurse from time to time.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ah, this is it, we saw it before!
Lyney: Wait, this thing...? It doesn't look like it's been disguised that well.
Black Screen Text: Lyney leans down to get close to the movable hatch, and starts tapping at several different points on it...
Lyney: The space behind it is empty. From its size, I don't think it's an entrance that is meant to be taken apart. There's probably a mechanism around here somewhere.
Lyney: Could Lynette have tried to get inside? But if that's the case, she would have contacted me for sure...
Lyney: ...
Lyney: Let's look around here some more for clues... Don't panic, just... take another look.
Traveler: (The look on Lyney's face... He's definitely beginning to panic. "Don't panic"... He probably said that subconsciously more for himself than anything else.)

## Talk 5

Lyney: None of the beds have any signs of having been slept in... except that one over there.
Paimon: That's the one Lynette must have used, right? You said she was pretending to be sick.
Lyney: Mhm. She would have said her migraine was having a particularly bad flare-up. Generally speaking, the head nurse would then ask her to lie down and rest, while she left to retrieve the medication.
Traveler: ...But this bed is still unmade...
Lyney: Which means, either the head nurse didn't return the entire time from when Lynette lay down up until she left the bed, or... the nurse intentionally left it this way.
Traveler: (Oh no... That's not a good sign...)
Lyney: ...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey, you guys, there's a slip of paper over here!
Lyney: A slip of paper?
Paimon: It's right over here, and there's a bunch written on it, too... It reads...
Paimon: "Out of respect for your usual practices, I'll use a piece of paper or card as the medium to pass on my message. You may consider this as me giving you my best regards."
Lyney: This is...!
Paimon: Is... Is that all?
Traveler: Is there anything on the back?
Paimon: The back... aaah! This... This is...
Lyney: Show me! NOW!
Lyney: ...!
Paimon: Th—That look on your face... P—Paimon's reading it now...
Paimon: "Would you care to guess where Miss Lynette of the Fatui could be right now?"
Paimon: ...No... Could she have... Is she already...
Lyney: ...Wriothesley... Did he deliberately leave the infirmary unguarded to use it as bait?
Paimon: Wait, you mean... He was aware of our goals from the very beginning? But why? We didn't run into any trouble last time, and he also never reached out to us since...
Traveler: Why would he choose to act during our second infiltration attempt instead of the first?
Lyney: ...Yes, that is a crucial question. Wriothesley... He doesn't do anything without a clear goal or reason. So, this means he had no concerns about your activities from the very beginning.
Lyney: #{NICKNAME}, you are not from the same camp as us — you were sent down here by Neuvillette, so you have no conflict of interest with Wriothesley. We're a completely different story, though...
Traveler: Why did he only go after Lynette?
Lyney: I'd like to know that, too. Why did he only go after her?
Lyney: Don't panic, just think everything over... I have to stay calm... This is not like what happened last time, the situation's different now...
Lyney: ...
Lyney: #{NICKNAME}, wait, you're right... Wait... But that means...
Lyney: ...The fact that Freminet was able to leave the grounds... Could Wriothesley have let him go as well?
Paimon: But what does he gain by letting Freminet leave like that?
Traveler: ...I get it now.
Traveler: He deliberately made them both disappear.
Lyney: ...So he's challenging me and trying to provoke me. I'm sure of it.
Lyney: Ugh, we never should have sent out Freminet! We had to go through all that trouble to find an opening to sneak him around the guards and into the pipe, and we even thought luck was on our side...
Lyney: If Wriothesley let him leave on purpose... Then he's probably in a terrible spot now as well...
Paimon: Lyney's getting more and more panicked... We have to calm him down!
Traveler: Lyney, calm down!
Paimon: Don't be like this, Lyney. Freminet wouldn't have left if we hadn't told you about Childe... That was our fault...
Lyney: No, I'm the leader of this operation, and I'm the one responsible for this team... I was the one who failed to protect them.
Lyney: ...I'll go talk to Wriothesley.
Paimon: #Hey, don't be reckless! {NICKNAME}, please talk some sense into him!
Lyney: I simply cannot allow Lynette to be abducted again...
Lyney: I have to go, I'll find a way to get them back!
Paimon: He's rushed out the door! After him!
Sigewinne: ...
Lourvine: Right, I feel like we still have some room to make changes on these details.
Jurieu: ...It's not impossible, but it'll require extensive testing.
Sigewinne: Is that so... Very well, then please be mindful of the time.
Sigewinne: ...!
Lourvine: Is someone...?
Sigewinne: Pack everything up.
Sigewinne: ...Whoever's outside is eavesdropping. They'll probably come in once we stop talking.
Paimon: #Someone, please help! {M#He}{F#She}... {M#He}{F#She}'s sick!
Jurieu: Whoa, are you okay?
Sigewinne: (Ah, these two. As expected, they've already found this place. They're quite sharp.)
Sigewinne: What a delightful turn of events. I like smart people, but I also like playing dumb. I like the feeling of "being trusted."
Sigewinne: Oh my! What's wrong, little one? There's no need to panic — take a deep breath before you begin.
Sigewinne: Being able to read human expressions is quite the useful skill.
Traveler: Why didn't he go after you as well?

## Talk 7

Freminet: ...Pipes...
Freminet: ...Right, the pipes. It's all coming back to me now...

## Talk 8

Lyney: Come out and face me, Wriothesley!
Wriothesley: Mmm, aren't we at an administrative office space? Why don't you at least try to follow even a couple rules from the Fortress' Indoor Management Regulations?
Lyney: What did you do to my sister!?
Wriothesley: I ran into the young miss at the infirmary. I had heard that she was suffering from quite the migraine, so I decided to invite her over for a cup of tea. I do have some teas in my collection that can work wonders against such an illness.
Lyney: Stop joking around! Where did you take my siblings!?
Wriothesley: I have also heard that your performances are quite the spectacle. Miss Lynette would sometimes enter a box filled with water, only to emerge the next second from another place altogether.
Wriothesley: Maybe she'll appear behind you right now if you were to turn your head?
Lyney: (Is he trying to trick me into turning my head? No, he's probably not looking to attack me right now, all of the hostages are in his hands, and he's even in the mood for small talk. That means Lynette is probably still alive.)
Lyney: #...You knew we were investigating the infirmary from the start, so you deliberately aroused {NICKNAME}'s suspicions and baited us into continuing our investigation, just so that you'd be able to kidnap Lynette.
Wriothesley: ...
Lyney: As for Freminet... No, you probably didn't even interfere with Childe's escape. You let him go, so you could purge the Fatui members that we had planted into your ranks.
Wriothesley: There was no need to do so. The Fortress of Meropide is a pretty pleasant place. Most people enjoy their lives here — the only ones who act differently are those with personal agendas. It was quite easy to identify your colleagues.
Lyney: You removed our original members, and spread the news of Childe's escape, so "Father" would assign our team to come down and investigate. Freminet has also fallen into your hands, right? If you're oh so omnipotent and so in control, why would you need hostages?
Wriothesley: One correction. Lynette is in my hands right now, but Freminet is not.
Lyney: He's not? ...What do you really want?
Paimon: Lyney!
Wriothesley: Oh, wonderful! Everyone is here, so I'll only need to say this once: thank you so much for cooperating with me.
Traveler: Where are Lynette and Freminet?
Wriothesley: #Eager and to the point, {NICKNAME}, I see. Alas, only Miss Lynette is currently having a cup of the Fortress' finest tea.
Wriothesley: Although as per your original plan, Mr. Freminet should also have returned to the Fortress by now. But he has neither shown up within my gates, nor has he been taken into any kind of custody. So where do you think he may be right now...?
Lyney: Wait, you can't mean...
Lyney: You locked him outside in the sea!?
Wriothesley: I closed the Fortress' gate to the outside world, that's all.
Paimon: Freminet's a star diver, so he should be fine, right?
Lyney: No, we're still here, so he'd definitely try to find a way to come back for us... So we can't assume he might have made a break for the surface.
Wriothesley: But why would I do this, you may be asking? To have an audience with you, of course. My intel tells me that Mr. Lyney is a great magician, so it's only natural for me to want to have some cards of my own when it comes to negotiating.
Wriothesley: Besides, I do recall you mentioning to Miss Lynette that you've always wanted to have a face-to-face meeting with the lord of the Fortress of Meropide, regardless of whether it was in a personal or a professional capacity. Well you got your wish.
Lyney: So... You've been keeping tabs on us before we even set foot in the Fortress...
Wriothesley: Some of my folks just happened to hear a thing or two, that's all. In any case, I'll be straight with you.
Wriothesley: I was willing to play dumb and turn a blind eye, so we had a pleasant few days playing games together here. But once you started focusing on the "forbidden zone," all of that changed.
Wriothesley: Mr. Lyney, the cards are stacked against you right now. Miss Lynette is in my hands, and Mr. Freminet is still slowly being pickled out there in the brine. You know just as well as I that he cannot last out there forever.
Wriothesley: You need do but one thing to guarantee their safety. I would like you to contact your superior, and ideally invite her over for a cup of tea with me.
Lyney: You want to see "Father"? Ha, but why should she bother giving you an audience?
Wriothesley: Well, if she cares for the well-being of her dearest children, she should have plenty of motivation to join me for a parents' evening.
Wriothesley: I've heard that the bonds between the members of the House of the Hearth are like the bonds of family. I don't see why she would refuse.
Lyney: Why did you think "Father" sent us to handle the Fortress of Meropide? This place is basically a no man's land. It wouldn't be fitting for anyone as important as a Harbinger like "Father" to come here in person.
Wriothesley: Oh, I see, so it's because she doesn't care for my place here. That's such a shame, after all, I've amassed quite the tea collection, and I was looking forward to sharing it with her. Both Monsieur Neuvillette and Lady Furina have already received many samples as gifts.
Lyney: ...Was this the extent of your master plan to get to "Father"? No matter how much pressure you may put on me, I won't allow you to use us to blackmail her.
Wriothesley: Your people really are difficult to get along with. All I'm asking for is a face-to-face conversation. Does she truly have no interest in the Fortress' secret?
Wriothesley: Mr. Lyney, you have one last chance to invite your "Father" here. If you refuse...
Lyney: ...
Paimon: Lyney...
Traveler: Why do you have to do this?
Wriothesley: Instead of asking why I'm doing this, why don't you try to see things from my perspective for a second? From the very beginning, the Fatui has been actively infiltrating my Fortress.
Wriothesley: I gave you a warning by cutting off the first few operatives I found, but that only caused you to double down. Had you given up on the Fortress then and there, I'd have no reason to want a talk.
Wriothesley: Mr. Freminet left the Fortress on his own, and Miss Lynette tried to pry out my secrets right in front of me. No matter how you look at it, the responsibility for this falls on you.
Lyney: I... I shouldn't ask "Father" to do anything because of us...
Wriothesley: Six, five...
Lyney: Wait, I...
Wriothesley: ...Two, one.
Wriothesley: Time's up. It really is a shame, Mr. Lyney.
Paimon: Wriothesley！
Wriothesley: Negotiations have broken down. Please leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for my afternoon tea.
Lyney: ...
Traveler: Please wait! Can we really not talk about this some more?
Paimon: #Yeah, listen to {NICKNAME}! If you can't talk to Lyney, can you at least talk to us?
Wriothesley: You do realize that I'm only letting you go because of Neuvillette, yes? You're here helping him out, and I've already done my best to stay out of your way.
Wriothesley: But that doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want. The Fortress may be small and remote, but it still has its own set of laws.
Traveler: Please spare Freminet and Lynette.
Wriothesley: ...
Wriothesley: Then how about this? Those who are capable deserve respect. You've spent quite some time investigating my home turf by now, so why don't you tell me a thing or two about what you've found?
Wriothesley: I'll ask you three questions. Answer all of them correctly, and I'll agree to your request.
Wriothesley: Question one. Regarding the "hidden rules" of the production zone... What is the truth behind the one about not being allowed to work for three days in a row?
Traveler: (I can't believe he's asking about the "hidden rules"... If I recall correctly, if you keep working without any rest, during lunch hour on the third day, you will find a portion of "strange meat" in your welfare meal.)
Traveler: (It's a good thing that we've already run a thorough investigation on this. Let's see if I can remember all the clues... I should be able to find an answer if I can piece everything together.)
Paimon: Ah, so that's what was going on... Paimon understands it now. Who would have guessed...
Paimon: The "hidden rule" of the production zone... people are not supposed to work three days in a row, and if they do, they'll get "strange meat" in their welfare meal.
Paimon: At first, we thought this "strange meat" must have something to do with the people who disappeared, but in reality, they were all... prepared by Sigewinne, the head nurse.
Paimon: She often visits the production zone to observe the workers' health, and makes a note of anyone who has worn themselves out after three full days of work.
Paimon: Out of her sense of duty as the head nurse as well as her genuine concern for the workers' health, Sigewinne visits the cafeteria right before lunch, and cooks an "extra dish" for those who can use the stamina boost.
Paimon: Sigewinne has only the best intentions with her "surprise gift," and doesn't want anyone to find out about what she does. However...
Paimon: ...Unfortunately, Melusines as a race perceive the world differently from humans, and their sense of aesthetics is even more alien to us.
Paimon: The recipients of her lovingly prepared special meals cannot taste the care within, and usually just freak out.
Paimon: Are we on the right track?
Wriothesley: Heh, not bad. You've uncovered Sigewinne's secret, and even guessed her intentions correctly as well. It's nice to know that her efforts have not gone unacknowledged.
Wriothesley: Alright, now for my next question...
Wriothesley: There are also some "hidden rules" in the Pankration Ring... Including the one that you're not allowed to support both sides of a fight. Why is that?
Traveler: (The "hidden rules" of the Pankration Ring... I remember. If someone tries to support both boxers at the same time, they'll receive a package the next morning, which contains a strange blood-colored liquid.)
Traveler: (We've also done a lot of research on this matter. Let me sift through what I've found and come up with the correct answer.)
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets this rule too now... So there really was nothing to be afraid of!
Paimon: That "hidden rule" of the Pankration Ring is about how... people are not supposed to bet on both boxers at the same time, and if they do, they'll receive a package containing a strange blood-colored liquid.
Paimon: People get scared when they see it because they've subconsciously begun to associate it with the missing boxer.
Paimon: But really, it's just a bottle of the latest yet-to-be-named-and-packaged new Fonta trial product!
Paimon: A blood-red drink... It's no wonder even Fonta's own staff were questioning the company's decision-making.
Paimon: The company, facing backlash from its own staff, decided to try to trial the product on a smaller scale, to see how it might be received by customers.
Paimon: They came to the Fortress of Meropide and offered to sponsor the Pankration tournament so they could push their new product, but the Duke completely refused to even entertain the idea.
Paimon: The Duke, knowing how valuable coupons are in the Fortress, knew that only total idiots who didn't understand their true value would bother buying a Fonta product here.
Paimon: And so, only those who proved their stupidity by being dumb enough to bet on two opposing sides of the same match were selected to receive the drinks.
Wriothesley: I acknowledge the effort you've put in to bringing the truth of this mystery to light.
Wriothesley: Although, based on your description, that Fonta promoter is a bit too careless with his words... I may just reconsider my collaboration with the company.
Wriothesley: Alright, and here's the final question. What's the secret behind our head nurse, and all of her patients in the infirmary?
Traveler: ...
Lyney: Stop your cruel and pointless games, Wriothesley! You know that we haven't finished our investigation, so there's no way we can answer the last question! The thought of sparing Lynette and Freminet never even crossed your mind!
Traveler: Lyney!
Lyney: You'll pay for this!
Wriothesley: ...!
Lyney: Argh!
Paimon: Lyney! Are you alright!?
Wriothesley: Ooh, close one. I owe you, Sigewinne. That was a fantastic shot.
Sigewinne: It was nothing, Your Grace.
Paimon: Sigewinne!?
Sigewinne: Though this gun may look like a toy, it's actually fully functional, as I just demonstrated.
Lyney: Sige...winne... You...
Traveler: Are you his accomplice in all this!?
Sigewinne: Not at all. I am merely a resident of the Fortress, and thus protecting it is my duty.
Sigewinne: When Monsieur Neuvillette asked me to come here, he told me that my job would be to take care of the well-being of everyone here. I am merely discharging my duties.
Paimon: But if you mean what you just said, then isn't Lyney someone you should be looking after as well? Isn't he a resident here just like the rest of us?
Traveler: If you're close with Neuvillette...
Sigewinne: But I really am just doing what Monsieur Neuvillette told me to do! Everything I did, I've done to protect them. Had I not, they would be in far more dire straits right now.
Sigewinne: His Grace knows it, too. Right? Your Grace? ...Mind proving my innocence to them?
Wriothesley: ...*sigh* My dear Sigewinne, what ever shall I do with you? Would it have killed you to just wait another minute or two?
Sigewinne: Well, it's nearly time, after all. The way you do things can be truly frustrating sometimes, Your Grace. I figured I should try to talk some sense into you.
Paimon: What are you talking about? What time?
Lyney: Take me if you want... But let them go...
Wriothesley: How touching. Can you just give me one more minute?
Sigewinne: Don't be like that, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: Alright, everyone, calm down. Two more visitors will be arriving any time now.
Wriothesley: I will go get a cup of tea. Miss Sigewinne, I'll leave Miss Lynette in your care.
Lyney: You... What are you doing!?
Sigewinne: I believe I hear... footsteps.
Black Screen Text: The door suddenly slams open. A familiar figure bursts into the room.
Clorinde: Some space, please.
Wriothesley: Ah, Miss Clorinde. My door.
Lyney: Freminet? FREMINET!!
Paimon: What's going on!? What is Clorinde doing here?
Clorinde: Work.
Sigewinne: I'm sorry about shooting you, Mr. Lyney. The tranquilizing effect will begin to wear off soon. Please take it easy in the meantime, though.
Lyney: ...What happened to Freminet? Wasn't he diving just outside of the fortress? Why is he looking like... Like this...
Traveler: These symptoms... It can't be...
Sigewinne: A flushed face and accelerated pulse... He must have consumed Primordial Seawater.
Lyney: What did you say!?
Sigewinne: Please make some space. I'll need to give Mr. Freminet a more thorough check-up. Your Grace, I'll leave the rest to you.
Wriothesley: I'll talk to Clorinde while you get Freminet to where he needs to be. Everything else can wait.
Traveler: Why not learn a thing or two about virtue from him?
Traveler: (We haven't collected enough info to answer that question...)
Traveler: I want to save Freminet and Lynette, too.

## Talk 9

Lyney: ...
Traveler: (Lyney's expression looks disgusted... It seems like he'd rather not have Sigewinne touch Freminet. Still, he didn't stop her, since it's obvious that Freminet does require urgent medical care.)
Traveler: (Sigewinne's examining Freminet carefully. She doesn't look too upset, which is a good sign. I hope Freminet will be okay.)
Lyney: ...How is he?
Sigewinne: These symptoms are probably caused by an acute ingestion of a large amount of Primordial Seawater. Still, his condition is not critical.
Sigewinne: Of course, it would be best if he stayed for further observation. Let's leave him here for now, and move him to the infirmary once he's recovered a bit more.
Sigewinne: ...Sorry, I am aware that the infirmary may not be your favorite place in the world at the moment. We do only have a single clinic in the fortress, however.
Lyney: ...
Lyney: ...Why would he ingest a large amount of Primordial Seawater after leaving the Fortress? How could that possibly happen...?
Sigewinne: Please look after Mr. Freminet for the moment. I'll go fetch some medicine and a respirator. I'll bring Miss Lynette back with me.
Lyney: Where is she!? How is she right now!?
Sigewinne: Oh, she just took a nap in an empty room after I tranquilized her. If my calculations are correct, she should also be waking up right around now. You might not believe me, but His Grace and I actually made some snacks and tea for her.
Traveler: (Lyney has finally begun to stop tensing the muscles on his face. It seems that he trusts what Sigewinne just said.)

## Talk 10

Clorinde: What's that look on your face? I thought I made good time on the way back.
Wriothesley: Oh, I'm just admiring your punctuality. Had you arrived just a few minutes later, Sigewinne may have been forced to shoot Mr. Lyney again.
Wriothesley: How's the situation out there?
Clorinde: The water has changed. It's pretty much as expected. The concentration of Primordial Seawater has increased significantly.
Clorinde: I was only out there a short time, so it wasn't too bad. But if one were to stay for any significant amount of time... Well, you can see how that boy is doing.
Wriothesley: Where was he when you found him?
Clorinde: The abandoned zone at the end of the pipes. A good distance into the water.
Wriothesley: Closer than I thought. He must have recognized it early on, and tried desperately to swim back.
Clorinde: Locking the door was necessary. I don't think we could have saved two.
Wriothesley: Well, I did try to convince them that I had my reasons... Never seems to work, though.
Clorinde: It would probably work on Neuvillette. He has a knack for picking out who had good intentions even when the outcomes were all terrible.
Wriothesley: Eh... It's a bad sign if you're having to plead your case to Neuvillette.
Wriothesley: Want some tea?
Clorinde: Not particularly. If you want to drink some that badly, just say so.
Wriothesley: Fine, I'd like to get some tea. Want me to get you a cup too, since I've already made it?
Clorinde: Eh, might as well then, I suppose. Actually, do you have a towel? I would like to dry my hair.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Lyney, are you okay...?
Lyney: ...I'll be fine. They're all here now. Don't worry about me.
Paimon: Are you sure? You don't look alright...
Lyney: My hands and feet are still a bit weak, but that's probably just the residual effects of the tranquilizer shot.
Sigewinne: I'm back, everyone.
Lynette: #Lyney! Oh! {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you're here too!
Lynette: ...Freminet? Is he...
Sigewinne: He'll be fine. But for now, please help me lift him up.
Black Screen Text: Lyney and Lynette immediately come to lift Freminet up. With their help, Freminet also manages to swallow a dose of Sigewinne's medicine.
Freminet: ...Ugh...
Lyney: His breathing's beginning to slow down.
Sigewinne: Give me a hand and help me get him to the infirmary.
Lyney: Yeah, I'll take him from this side. Lynette? Together?
Lynette: On it.
Sigewinne: #{NICKNAME}, you seem pretty worried about him. Want to come with us?
Traveler: Very well.
Paimon: The Duke and Clorinde are gone...
Sigewinne: They probably went to get some tea. The Duke will explain the truth in just a bit. Miss Clorinde will need a break, since she only just returned from rescuing Freminet out of the sea.
Traveler: (Clorinde saved Freminet from the sea... Just what happened there?)

## Talk 12

Freminet: ...Pff...*cough*
Lyney: He's awake. Freminet, how do you feel?
Freminet: Lyney... Lynette...
Lynette: We're all here.
Freminet: Where... am I...
Sigewinne: The infirmary at the Fortress of Meropide, Mr. Freminet, and you are no longer in any danger.
Paimon: How do you feel? Don't push yourself if you're not feeling up to it!
Freminet: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon... It's been so long.
Freminet: ...The sea! There's something wrong with the seawater!
Lyney: Shh, it's okay. We can talk about it after you've recovered.
Freminet: No, listen to me, this is really serious! There's Primordial Seawater mixed into the regular seawater. I don't know why it's there, but no one should touch it!
Traveler: What happened after you snuck into the pipes?
Freminet: ...Pipes...
Freminet: ...Right, the pipes. It's all coming back to me now...

## Talk 13

Freminet: ...I'm in. Hmm... Seems like this pipe hasn't been used in a long time. It looks abandoned.
Freminet: Where could Master Childe be...

## Talk 14

Lyney: ...

## Talk 15

Freminet: This is where the water starts... Okay.
Freminet: (Master Childe probably dived into the water... I'll go take a look as well.)

## Talk 16

Freminet: (Wait, what the... Argh! Urgh...)
Freminet: (My heart is racing, and it's getting harder and harder to breathe. What's going on?)
Freminet: (No good, I have to get back, they still don't know anything about what's going on! If I turn back right now, I should still be able to make it...)

## Talk 17

Freminet: (I can't... die here... Ugh...)
Freminet: (This is... This is bad... I'm feeling worse and worse... And I'm still underwater...)
Freminet: (I... I have to push on...)

## Talk 18

Lyney: ...So, in other words, the trail you were following vanished, and you had no idea where Master Childe could have gone, but there was also no obvious place for him to have disappeared to...
Freminet: That's right. I tried my best to swim back, but I had already put some distance between myself and the fortress, and I just couldn't find the strength to keep going... I probably passed out sometime after that, and you know the rest.
Paimon: Miss Clorinde brought you back, but we also don't know why she just suddenly appeared at the Fortress, or why she went out to save you...
Freminet: Miss Clorinde, you say... I must go thank her in person.
Lynette: You're still too weak, Freminet. You can go after you've had some more rest.
Sigewinne: Miss Lynette is right. I believe Miss Clorinde will stay here as a guest for another few days, so there's no need to hurry.
Lyney: A guest... Then I can assume Wriothesley was the one who invited her to come down here?
Sigewinne: You should ask His Grace about that. He'll be able to explain better than me.
Traveler: Got it, I'll go talk to him.
Paimon: Yeah, it's about time he actually told us what's going on! Wanna come with us, Lyney?
Lyney: ...
Lyney: #No, please go on without me, {NICKNAME}. I don't want to leave just yet.
Lynette: Lyney...
Lyney: ...The logical part of my brain is aware that we are safe right now, but I still can't bring myself to leave. Both of you were just in danger.
Lynette: Understood. Then let's just sit together for a while.
Sigewinne: #In that case, I'll leave the infirmary to you. {NICKNAME} and I are going to head out for now — as long as you stay in here, I don't think you'll be disturbed.
Freminet: Thank you.

## Talk 19

Wriothesley: Could I tempt you with some sugar for your tea?
Clorinde: No need.

### Additional Talk 1

Noelle: Overall, I think this task was a success...
Noelle: Oh no! Sucrose's lab equipment! I should go help her carry it!

### Additional Talk 2

Haniyyah: Great, you've now collected all four Fungi. The next step is to use the "Floral Jelly" provided by the organizers to boost your Fungi's abilities. That way, they'll be able to unleash powerful skills during combat...
Paimon: Paimon can't believe we're making progress so quickly. It's all thanks to your help, Haniyyah! Alright, let's all return to the arena now...
Paimon: Huh? Look, someone's staggering along with a Fungus running circles around her... Is she being attacked?
Paimon: She's collapsed! Let's go see what's happening!
Layla: *whimper*... I can't go on... too weak...
Paimon: Are you hurt? How bad is it?
Traveler: Watch out!
Haniyyah: Pyro-1, take it out!
Layla: Wait... it's not an enemy! It's my shroom buddy!
Layla: I'm j—just a little too tired to walk right now... But I still need to find three more shroom buddies to qualify for the tournament...
Traveler: "Shroom buddies"?
Paimon: You mean... you're a contestant too?
Layla: I wasn't counting on running into other contestants here... Maybe this is the end of the road for me. Twirly-Whirly on its own is no match for you...
Layla: Look after Twirly-Whirly for me... take him with you to the top!
Paimon: Hey, don't give up! It's not like we're a bunch of Eremites trying to steal your Fungi... uh, your shroom buddies. We're better than that!
Paimon: You should at least hang in there until we're in the arena, so we can compete against each other properly!
Paimon: Haniyyah over here is a professional beast tamer. And despite knowing that we might be her fiercest competitors, she still gave us lots of help and advice!
Haniyyah: ...Was that supposed to be a compliment?
Traveler: Take it as a compliment.
Paimon: State your name and mission! Golden Comet and Silver Companion shall gladly come to your aid!
Layla: R—Really? Then... could you please help me collect the rest of the four shroom buddies I need? Does this mean my luck is finally starting to change...?
Layla: Um... my name is Layla. I'm just a student in the Rtawahist Darshan, so I don't have any impressive titles or anything... And my goal is to, uh... to make it into the quarterfinals.
Layla: If I can make it to the quarterfinals, I'll get to take my shroom buddies home and delegate some of my physical labor to them. Of course, I'll take good care of them too.
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon read that in the rules somewhere. All quarter-finalists get to take home any Fungi of their choice...
Paimon: But, what do you mean, "physical labor"? You're a student. Shouldn't you be busy with coursework and writing papers?
Layla: Aah, this is pretty embarrassing, but uh... so I must have some sort of congenital sleep disorder or something, 'cause I can never seem to get enough sleep, and I'm always really low on energy.
Layla: Even the smallest amount of exercise makes me... Well, you saw me just now. I get so tired, I collapse from exhaustion. So when I said "physical labor"... I just meant basic stuff like moving books around or fetching things I need from the store...
Paimon: #Ah, you don't need to be embarrassed about that, it's totally normal! Paimon delegates chores to {NICKNAME} all the time.
Haniyyah: First she calls them "buddies," then she talks about wanting to live with them... Ridiculous. She sounds just like Elchingen.
Traveler: (I wonder what Haniyyah's so annoyed about?)
Haniyyah: Well. Looks like you've mastered everything already, and moved on to helping others. I'm delighted for you.
Haniyyah: I'll see you around. Good luck.
Paimon: Huh? Why is Haniyyah leaving all of a sudden?
Paimon: We haven't thanked you or Pyro-1 yet, Haniyyah! Let's at least go get something to eat together...
Layla: What's wrong? That beast tamer, is she... angry?
Paimon: Hmm... probably not? She's pretty blunt and doesn't make a great first impression, but she's definitely not a bad person! Otherwise, why would she have helped us?
Traveler: Maybe she has something urgent to do...
Paimon: Yeah, we'll see her again, and when we do, let's give her some gifts to show her our gratitude!
Paimon: In the meantime, let's follow her example by doing our best in the tournament, helping other contestants, and making sure Layla gets to compete!
Layla: Thank you so much! I'll try my best to contribute, too. I don't want to be a burden to you guys.
Black Screen Text: You help Layla find three more shroom buddies to complete her set...
Paimon: Nicely done! Now that we've put together Layla's team, she should be eligible to take part. Let's head back to the arena and confirm with them.
Traveler: We'll see her again at the tournament...
Traveler: Paimon's really getting into this.

### Additional Talk 3

Haniyyah: What are you doing here?
Paimon: Haniyyah? You saved the children?
Haniyyah: I happened to be nearby. The children were mimicking what they'd seen the contestants doing, and ended up getting surrounded by wild Fungi. Fortunately, I heard the commotion and got here in time to save them.
Paimon: That's so dangerous! Why are they trying to approach wild Fungi without a Wisdom Orb!?
Haniyyah: It's hardly their fault. I was almost drawn in by the Fungi's cute appearance once, too... Luckily, I remembered my family's stern warnings, and the suffering that previous generations once endured, so I kept my distance.
Haniyyah: People never used to be under any illusion about how dangerous the Fungi can be. But this Nilotpala Cup is changing people's perceptions, and now they're letting their guard down against the Fungi... a consequence that Elchingen failed to foresee.
Traveler: The tournament's become too popular for its own good...
Haniyyah: I'm putting an end to this debacle, first chance I get.
Haniyyah: The Wisdom Orb is the perfect tool for exterminating Fungi on a large scale. And once I win the tournament, they'll be mine to do with as I please.
Paimon: What are you talking about, Haniyyah? "Exterminating Fungi"? Not in front of Pyro-1... Don't you care about its feelings?
Paimon: You're taking part in the tournament too, aren't you? You even taught us a few tips and tricks. You're clearly enjoying the event...
Haniyyah: I'm quite certain Pyro-1 would back me up if it was capable of realizing the past mistakes of its kind. But regrettably, it is just a pawn controlled by a gadget. It will never understand human sentiments.
Haniyyah: As for why I taught you guys a few things... Don't you realize? I saw your potential, and wanted you to help me reach my goals.
Haniyyah: Yet here you are now pleading the Fungi's case! You've gotten too deep in this absurd game. Looks like "Golden Comet" and "Silver Companion" don't deserve such a stellar reputation after all...
Paimon: Wait, don't go! We turned off our Wisdom Orb just now, and we were playing with the Fungi and everything!
Traveler: Looks like she's made up her mind...
Yae Miko: Ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy... I sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
Paimon: Miko? Layla? Oh, you heard the cries for help too, huh...
Yae Miko: We were just talking about her, as it happens. Little Layla told me that Haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. But after you met Layla, she very abruptly left.
Yae Miko: Looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. Blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence...
Yae Miko: She takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
Traveler: Seems she's had some bad experiences with Fungi.
Layla: Fungi can definitely be aggressive and damage their environment, but some research also suggests that they're only acting in accordance with their nature, just like any other wild animals...
Layla: The Fungi have existed for a long time. No one knows what the ecological implications for the rainforest would be if they all got killed off suddenly.
Paimon: Right! We shouldn't resort to extreme measures. No matter what Haniyyah has been through, we can't let her do this just because she wants to!
Yae Miko: You intend to stop her achieving victory? I can't say I didn't expect that response from you. But I hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament... Are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
Traveler: We will train harder.
Paimon: That's what you brought us here for, right? To get acquainted with our Fungi friends so we can cooperate better with them?
Paimon: Wait... Did you know all this was gonna happen?
Yae Miko: Hehe, it would be rather boring if I had arranged every last detail in advance. The chance encounter between you and Haniyyah came as quite a pleasant surprise.
Yae Miko: Today's training ends here. The qualifiers should be over now. We should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
Traveler: We will keep bonding with our Fungi.
Traveler: She definitely has her reasons.
Traveler: In trying to solve one problem, it's created another...
