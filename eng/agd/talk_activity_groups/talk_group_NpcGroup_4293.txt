## Talk

Aderfi: Hmph. Strange... And what are the scouts even doing? Did they just let you in?

## Talk

Traveler: What is this place?
Aderfi: This is the campsite of the Tanit tribe... Heh, we are new here as well. The original camp was unsuitable for hunting, so the elders led us here.

## Talk

Traveler: What do you do here?
Aderfi: Business. As you may have noticed, I am a merchant, and am in charge of striking deals on behalf of my tribe.
Aderfi: Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools... If you want it, I can get it.

## Talk

Traveler: You have so many books...
Aderfi: And you have so many words, young one.
Aderfi: Stop staring at those books... Let me tell you a tale. A tale regarding a most meddlesome and naive wayfarer who wanted to report our tribe to the Matra. Can you guess what happened?
Aderfi: ... What happened was someone discovered the foolishness he was about to commit, and that someone helped us fix his long and loose tongue.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Aderfi: Don't let me get in your way.

## Talk

Traveler: Elders...
Aderfi: ...
Aderfi: That doesn't concern you, outsider. In Tanit, when a Matriarch dies, matters will be deliberated by the "Nine Elders."
Aderfi: When that happens, well, imagine nine mouths quarreling endlessly... Quite a spectacle, I assure you.
Aderfi: Hmph. At least the flowing winds are changing their paths... Far quieter now. A little more peace is always welcome.

## Talk

Traveler: Can I buy anything?
Aderfi: Apologies. According to tribe rules, we cannot sell to outsiders.
Aderfi: Understand, this is not due to xenophobia or some kind of base prejudice. It's more like... Our tribe and the merchants in the cities don't share economic spheres, if you can glean my meaning?

## Talk

Aderfi: Ah, it's you.
Aderfi: Matriarch Babel mentioned you previously, honored guest. Please, have a look around.
Traveler: Are you a merchant?
Aderfi: Hmm? You've got a good eye, I must say. Yes, I am indeed a merchant. I sell the various things that the tribe lacks. Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools...
Aderfi: What would you like? If you should need something, I'll have it. And if I don't, just tell me what you need, and I'll get it for you, whether it's from the city, or even from Fontaine!
Aderfi: Ah... Right, you're an outsider. Well, in that case, you have my apologies, but my shop is not open to you.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: You've got lots of books here. May I read them?
Aderfi: The books? Oh! Right, those are here at the request of Matriarch Babel. I'm sure you've heard, and seen, that the city people have taken to using this thing called the Akasha, which they mount on their ears.
Aderfi: Their libraries have been emptied of a great number of obsolete books, and the Matriarch had me purchase and safe-keep them for everyone to read free of charge. Hmph... I operated at a loss there.
Aderfi: As for the Akasha, we did ship a set in from another tribe, but it was... very inconvenient to use, not to mention quite arcane indeed. We could not disassemble or repair it, for the wiring was too centralized...
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I'd say that reading books on your own is far better than relying on some strange machine to stuff information into your brain.
Aderfi: After all, who knows what back doors you might open if you just let people into the door of your mind?
Traveler: See you.
Aderfi: Don't let me get in your way.
Traveler: What are you selling here, anyway?
Aderfi: Straight to the point, hmm? I like buyers like you. Unfortunately, I don't sell to outsiders.
Aderfi: Um, this is not due to xenophobia or some kind of base prejudice. It's more that... Our tribe and the merchants in the cities don't share economic spheres, if you can glean my meaning?
Aderfi: I only serve the Tanit tribe, you know, as our exclusive distributer of goods. All trade and other transactions have to go through Matriarch Babel, and I take a small cut of that.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: About Benben...
Aderfi: Benben... Ah, you mean the little machine that follows Jeht around.
Aderfi: I've examined it before. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but as for how it can be restored to its former, energetic state...
Aderfi: I have my ways... but I don't think I could tell you.
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I think it's best that it stays with me till the repairs are done.
Aderfi: Anything else you'd like to ask me?
