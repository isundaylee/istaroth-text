# Talk Dialog

Tighnari: What should I get...?
Traveler: Tighnari, this gift envelope is for you.
Tighnari: #Ah, I didn't expect to see you here, Traveler. Thank you for the envelope — it's lovely.
Traveler: Enjoying the festival?
Tighnari: Cyno and I have had a great time. We ate a lot of delicious food and bought quite a few gifts.
Tighnari: Unfortunately, the Harbor is a little too busy this time of year. If I stay around the commotion for too long, my ears start to hurt.
Tighnari: So, I came over here for a break.
Tighnari: Cyno said he needed to be alone for a while to think about something.
Traveler: He... came up with another joke...
Black Screen Text: You tell Tighnari all about Cyno's envelope joke...
Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: *sigh* No surprise there...
Tighnari: #Thanks for the warning, Traveler. At least I can mentally prepare myself this time...
Tighnari: Thanks again for the envelope — it's lovely. I'll take good care of it.
Traveler: See you.
Tighnari: Bye! I'm going to look for Cyno. *sigh* Let's hope he's not feeling too inspired today...
