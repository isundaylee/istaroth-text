Traveler: About the Cleansing Ritual...
Maki: Ah, yes. Lady Yae said that you're the Traveler who completed the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
Maki: You have my thanks. Now that the Cleansing Ritual has been completed, the Sacred Sakura is now thriving more than ever before.
Maki: The Sacred Sakura roots are connected to one another, and together they bless the land of Inazuma. You too shall be blessed as you walk upon this land.
