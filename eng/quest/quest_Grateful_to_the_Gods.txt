# Grateful to the Gods


## Talk 1

Jilliana: *sigh* I wonder what state the Statues of The Seven must be in by now...
Traveler: The Statues of The Seven? What's happened to them?
Jilliana: Let me explain... In the past, I would go and pray to a Statue of The Seven every week, and while I was there I would wipe the dust off.
Jilliana: I have the archons to thank for all the blessings in my life — cleaning their statues was my way of giving something back.
Jilliana: But since having Lily, I rarely have the chance to go out.
Jilliana: The statues must be filthy with no one cleaning them in so long.
Jilliana: I know this must seem like I'm trying to avoid taking responsibility, but... Do you think you could go and wipe the dust off of the Statues of The Seven for me?
Traveler: Of course!
Jilliana: Thank you ever so much! May the Anemo Archon protect you.
Jilliana: One more thing. The Statues of The Seven are imbued with the power of the archons.
Jilliana: The dust they collect cannot be simply wiped off in the usual manner.
Jilliana: But you have elemental abilities. It should be easy for you.
Jilliana: Unlike me — it's a whole day's work for me to clean a single statue.
Traveler: Surely the wind would just blow it off?
Jilliana: Barbatos and the winds he commands have far too many other things to attend to day-to-day.
Jilliana: In any case, we mustn't rely on the archons to provide for everything while we laze around.
Jilliana: Let us work together to lighten our Lord Barbatos' load just a little.

## Talk 2

Jilliana: Have you finished cleaning the Statues of The Seven?

Jilliana: I see. Well, there's no rush — take your time.
