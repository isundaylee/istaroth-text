# Talk Dialog

Shohre: Hello, what do you need?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do, huh?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, that's a good thing. The fewer people who come to talk to me about work, the better â€” that means our academic environment is a healthy one.
Shohre: Honestly, I expected a great deal of problems to follow the Akademiya's celebration. I was even ready to head back to the office and prepare for overtime.
Shohre: But there really haven't been that many people seeking me out. Even the General Mahamatra is on break... Hm. I'm just going to keep resting here.
