## Talk 2

Jack: Whoa! You're even better than Cyrus...

## Talk 3

Jack: Yeah! My training has paid off!

## Talk 4

Jack: Darn... I must continue my training...

## Talk 5

Jack: It is what it is! My card training has finally paid off!

## Talk 6

Jack: This is bad... This is really bad...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Jack: Oh, you're... the traveler. *sigh* You must have seen the storm that hit us, too. All of Mondstadt's a mess right now.
Jack: Cyrus said that we need to stop monsters from taking this opportunity to attack us. So he put out commissions for adventurers to scout their movements out.
Jack: My next commission was to observe the monsters around the Thousand Winds Temple, so I confirmed my tasking and left.
Jack: At the Temple, I saw a large group of monsters gathering together, and I tried to get a closer look...
Jack: But I didn't expect to be discovered almost immediately upon getting closer. If a passing adventurer hadn't come to my rescue, I wouldn't have made it.
Jack: We left the Thousand Winds Temple for fear of being attacked by more monsters, and came back to Mondstadt.
Jack: And that's when I realized... that I had left my Adventurer Handbook and map at the Temple.
Jack: But there's no way I can go to get it back like this...
Jack: Traveler, would you be willing to help me go to the Thousand Winds Temple and retrieve my map and Adventurer Handbook?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Jack: Thank you so much. *sigh* Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing...
Traveler: Why were you there in the first place...
Jack: Ugh, this is a bit embarrassing... Do you know of the Adventurer Rank Rating?
Jack: I thought that if I could show my stuff a bit more, I could get through the rating process safely.
Jack: But I never thought that... *sigh* Please, help me get my map and Adventurer Handbook back.
Jack: I need to be more careful in future...

## Talk 7

Jack: Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my adventure team?

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Jack: To tell the truth, I was worried at first. But I was also excited.
Jack: This was my first time seeing a dragon. Just thinking that I might be able to face such a fearsome opponent gets me pumped up!
Jack: If I could finish a commission of that rank, I would definitely rise to prominence throughout the entire Adventurers' Guild.
Jack: *sigh* But as it stands, I can only take some commissions to clear out a few slimes here and there. I'm going to have a work a lot harder if I'm to take a dragon on...

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about the Arcadian Ruins
Jack: Should I go look for it as well...? Oh, haha! I'm just joking. I hope you guys find it!

### Talk 7 related talk 2

Traveler: I'd like to ask...
Paimon: Hey! Do you have any intel on the Arcadian Ruins?
Jack: Arcadian... Can't say I've heard of it. Sorry, I'm still new here, so...
Paimon: Really...
Jack: But you can try posting a commission and see if there are any adventurers who know about it.
Paimon: That's a no-no! No way.
Paimon: We can't afford them beating us to the treasure!
Traveler: (Now she's done it...)
Jack: Really!?
Jack: Well then, I'll keep a lookout for your treasure â€” I mean, your Arcadian Ruins.
Paimon: Great! Thanks!

### Talk 7 related talk 3

Jack: Tell me about yourself.
Jack: I'm Jack. Just Jack. No need to be formal with me, since we're all friends here.
Jack: I joined a few months ago, and people here helped me out lots.
Jack: Especially those stories! Oh, they are so exciting and always get me pumped up!
Jack: Hahaha... So far, I've only completed small commissions like clearing the sewers of a few slimes...
Jack: *sigh* When can I be like the others...

### Talk 7 related talk 4

Jack: Adventure team?
Jack: Yeah, people here usually band together in groups of four to go on adventures.
Jack: You seem to be in good company.
Jack: I once belonged to a rather nice team... But "Unlucky Bennett" was also there...
Jack: We all thought it was just a joke about him being "unlucky," but...
Jack: All the commissions he took on, somehow always failed in the least expected way...
Jack: Come to think of it, it is rather strange.

### Talk 7 related talk 5

Jack: Goodbye.
Jack: Ad astra abyssosque! May Lady Luck smile upon you, friend.

## Talk 8

Jack: Hey, I'm doing some adventurer's training... alcohol tolerance training, to be precise... Wanna join me?

### Talk 8 related talk 0

Traveler: You seem to have had one too many.
Jack: Really? Let me see... eight beers, five wines, seven ciders... Not so much!
Jack: I'm no match for those legendary Mondstadt adventurers who can drink half of Cider Lake's worth of wine...
Jack: ...Only a figure of speech? Really? No wonder... I could never figure out how they could afford so much wine on an adventurer's income...

### Talk 8 related talk 1

Traveler: What kind of liquor do you prefer?
Jack: Me...? Beer. I don't like it that much though...
Jack: It's just that... beggars can't be choosers...
Jack: As long as it gets me drunk, it's all good... Don't you agree?
