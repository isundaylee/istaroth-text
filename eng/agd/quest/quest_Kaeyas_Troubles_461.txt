# Kaeya's Troubles


## Talk 1

Kaeya: This is bad... Such a hassle... What am I going to do...
Traveler: What's wrong, Kaeya?
Kaeya: #Oh, thank the Thousand Winds! Traveler, your arrival must be the grace of the gods!
Kaeya: If I may ask — envoy sent by the Anemo God to save this mere mortal — could you spare a moment?
Paimon: Ewwww, cut it out!
Traveler: Can't say I don't have time...
Kaeya: Marvelous!
Kaeya: I cannot let my peers hear about this! I cannot seek help from anyone else but you.
Kaeya: Please, let us move to somewhere more fit for such conversations...
Kaeya: Let's talk in the courtyard just outside headquarters. Come with me.
Paimon: What's with the sneakiness...
Traveler: Tell me what happened.
Traveler: You don't usually lose your chill.

## Talk 2

Traveler: We're looking for...

## Talk 3

Kaeya: This place will do.
Paimon: Tell us what it's about already!
Kaeya: How should I begin... Oh, right, let me tell you a secret first.
Kaeya: It's a secret of my past, and I confide in you to keep it.
Paimon: Don't worry, Paimon's lips are sealed.
Kaeya: As a matter of fact, my grandfather was a pirate!
Paimon: Oh.
Kaeya: ...Wait, why do you sound so blithe? Do you think I'm making it up?
Kaeya: Look at my eye patch! I inherited it from my grandfather and this is solid proof that we are related by blood!
Traveler: I never knew you could inherit eye patches.
Kaeya: #My! Traveler, how could you not know such common knowledge!
Kaeya: This is no different from children inheriting their hairstyles from their parents!
Kaeya: Yesterday I was glancing through the notes my grandfather left and stumbled upon records that spoke of a *treasure*...
Paimon: ...Treasure!?
Kaeya: According to his notes, the treasure is buried in the "Lost Arcadian Ruins."
Paimon: Treasure...
Kaeya: But the location of the ruins is currently unknown. I've tried searching for clues...
Paimon: Treasure!
Paimon: Kaeya! What kind of treasure is it? Gold? Or better yet, gems!?
Kaeya: Hmph! Treasures that consist of nothing but gold and gems are third-rate treasures...
Kaeya: My grandfather's treasure is a sword!
Kaeya: A magic sword that grants the wielder unrivaled power!
Paimon: Oh wowwwww!
Kaeya: The sword was dropped from Celestia into the sea by a god. It was later salvaged by my grandfather's crew by pure coincidence.
Kaeya: The moment he gripped the sword, thunder roared, billows howled, and the clear skies were suddenly swallowed by raging winds...
Kaeya: With the might of the magic sword, my grandfather went on to defeat a hydra, a silver-haired banshee, a wicked abyss dragon...
Kaeya: But the immense power of the sword enticed many more greedy pirates.
Kaeya: To avoid meaningless conflicts, my grandfather hid the magic sword.
Traveler: Eight-headed hydras, silver-haired banshees... Do they really exist?
Kaeya: The world we live in is fascinating, full of unknown and inexplicable wonders.
Kaeya: These incredibly thrilling adventures are romances that could only be told by pirates.
Paimon: Holy moley! That's just insane!
Kaeya: A gang of *Treasure Hoarders* has been very active lately and many ruins have had their relics stolen by them.
Kaeya: I'm afraid that they will soon discover the Arcadian Ruins and the magic sword will be lost...
Paimon: We won't let it fall into the wrong hands! We must get the sword before them.
Paimon: #You just rest assured that Paimon and Traveler are here to help!
Kaeya: Wow~
Kaeya: Great! Please keep it a secret. I'll wait for your good news!
Paimon: #Hey! So whatcha think, Traveler? Isn't it exciting? We're talking about a super-duper powerful sword!
Traveler: Is it true?
Paimon: Well... let's go to the *Adventurers' Guild* and see if we can find out more.
Paimon: The adventurers should know more about the ruins, right?
Traveler: Is it really, really true?
Traveler: ...
Traveler: How surprising.

## Talk 4

Kaeya: I'm a bit busy right now. Do try to find more... clues... You know what I mean.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hmph! We're not here for something that boring!
Paimon: We're looking for a sword that fell from Celestia... One that can kill eight-headed banshees and silver-haired hydras.
Traveler: It's eight-headed hydras and silver-haired banshees...
Traveler: You've said too much.
Paimon: It's super, mega, uber powerful!
Paimon: That's what Paimon said! It's a super epic sword!
Paimon: Anyway, it's fine as long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
Paimon: It's fine! As long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
Traveler: (Now she's done it...)
Paimon: So, Cyrus, do you know where the Lost Arcadian Ruins are supposed to be?
Cyrus: Arcadian Ruins... Never heard of them.
Cyrus: Thanks for your intel anyway. If you do find these ruins, I'd love to see them.
Paimon: Uh... my... intel...?
???: ...

## Talk 6

Traveler: No. We're here for...
Paimon: Nope. We just want to know if you've been to the Arcadian Ruins?
Stanley: Arcadian Ruins? Imagine that... So there are places that I haven't been to...
Paimon: Oh? Even the great Stanley doesn't know?
Stanley: Never mind this Arcadia... You need to know what happened to me on the Mare Jivari and in the Geyser Realm...
Paimon: We don't have time for your stories. Think hard, please. We need clues.
Stanley: The Mare Jivari... It was a place of death...
Paimon: Gosh...
Paimon: When we find the Arcadian*treasure*, our story will definitely be better than your stupid stories!
Traveler: (Now she's done it...)
Stanley: Treasure...? Even Tales too?
Paimon: Hmph! It's a waste of time talking to him. Let's go already.

## Talk 7

Traveler: I'd like to ask...
Paimon: Hey! Do you have any intel on the Arcadian Ruins?
Jack: Arcadian... Can't say I've heard of it. Sorry, I'm still new here, so...
Paimon: Really...
Jack: But you can try posting a commission and see if there are any adventurers who know about it.
Paimon: That's a no-no! No way.
Paimon: We can't afford them beating us to the treasure!
Traveler: (Now she's done it...)
Jack: Really!?
Jack: Well then, I'll keep a lookout for your treasure — I mean, your Arcadian Ruins.
Paimon: Great! Thanks!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kaeya: Oh, you're back. Do you have news for me?
Paimon: Listen, we asked around the Adventurers' Guild and found... Well, nothing.
Kaeya: Haha... That much is expected.
Paimon: Why is that?
Kaeya: Oh, I only mean that, what's the fun in finding it without the hard work?
Kaeya: However, I do have some clues.
Kaeya: I sent someone to collate black market intel. It seems that someone does know about the Arcadian Ruins.
Paimon: Really? Where's the guy?
Kaeya: Now, now, as per the black market's rules, they will send someone to meet us to prevent leaks.
Kaeya: We will be meeting the informant at the Whispering Woods.
Paimon: Then, what are we waiting here for?
Traveler: It's not ideal for Kaeya to show his face.
Kaeya: That's right. You read my mind.
Kaeya: I am a knight... so I shouldn't have any dealings with the black market.
Kaeya: You have my thanks.
Kaeya: Of course, you'll be compensated for your troubles... by the Knights.
Paimon: Ooh, no problemo!
Traveler: We'll get the intel back to you.
