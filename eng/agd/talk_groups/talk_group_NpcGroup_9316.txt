Diluc: Sometimes, a throwaway comment in a conversation outside of the battle can be the decisive factor in who wins and who loses.
Diluc: So even in the downtime between battles, I intend to stay alert and ready.

## Talk 1

Diluc: How are you coping with the battles so far?
Diluc: I can't always check how you're faring in the middle of a fight. Hopefully you're not pushing yourself too hard.
Diluc: If any of our foes give you a hard time, send them my way.

Diluc: I had a phase once where I did exactly what you're doing now. Constantly exploring dangerous domains and confronting powerful enemies.
Diluc: But what drove me to do it wasn't any of the rules from the Knights of Favonius Handbook. It was my personal convictions.
Diluc: Conviction helps you rise above your wounds and fatigue, and guides you forward into the light of dawn.
