Traveler: How did you come to own this shop?
Marjorie: Why did I open this shop, you ask? It's because of my dad.
Marjorie: He's the Master of the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch. He always brings tons of treasures after each adventure.
Marjorie: He'll then tell me the story behind each of the treasures... He was my hero when I was little.
Marjorie: I wanted to share these stories with everyone, so I opened this shop—
Marjorie: But not long after opening, my dad became a bit more doddery and talks to himself all day...

Traveler: Did I hear you talk about Wolvendom?

Marjorie: Perhaps I was mistaken. I was quite a distance away, after all, and it was only a glimpse.
Marjorie: I mean, how could humans live alongside wolves? How strange...
