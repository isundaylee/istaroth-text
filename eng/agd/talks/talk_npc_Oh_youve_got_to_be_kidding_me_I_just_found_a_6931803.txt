Mona: Oh, you've got to be kidding me...! I just found a fairytale in one of these books that the old hag told me once...
Mona: She said that she was the one who wrote it, and no one else in the whole world knew the story...
Mona: So... that was just another one of her tall tales, hmm? Ugh, and you know what else she did? She handed it to me, saying she wanted to give her disciple a gift that was the only one of its kind in the whole world... I cannot believe that woman!
