Traveler: And you might be...?
Kuroda: My name is Kuroda... I'm actually the executive editor of Yae Publishing House. But the author I'm handling has yet to come up with any updates yet, so I'm pretty idle right now, so I figured, why not come down to the bookstore to help promote some books?
Kuroda: Have you found anything that strikes your fancy? Feel free to let me know.
