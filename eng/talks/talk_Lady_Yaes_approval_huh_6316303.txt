Traveler: Lady Yae's approval, huh...
Miyuki: Yes! Lady Yae praised me after I completed my mission in Tatarasuna. That was the happiest moment of my life!
Miyuki: That's why from that day on, I've decided to work even harder to serve Lady Yae. I want to become a shrine maiden whom Lady Yae can count on even more than Kano Nana!
Miyuki: *sigh* I really don't understand why Lady Yae and Kano Nana are so close. She even shares her secrets with her...
Miyuki: Hmph. I mean, I can outperform her in many ways, for sure!
