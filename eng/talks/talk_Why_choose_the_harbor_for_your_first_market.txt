Traveler: Why choose the harbor for your first market?
Debal: There are always people coming in and out of Lumidouce Harbor, including quite a few first-time visitors to Fontaine. I want this beverage to give them a positive first impression of this place.
Debal: If we acquaint enough people with our knockoff... Who cares about Fonta, our drink will be the most popular in all of Fontaine!
