# Through the Looking Glass


## Talk 1

Canotila: Hey, we meet again. Hmm? You're with Paimon this time?
Paimon: Huh? Paimon was here when we meditated here the last time...
Canotila: Is that so? I don't remember.
Canotila: No matter. It's all thanks to you that I found the location of the Looking Glass and the flowers that are about to bloom, and deepened my understanding of this place.
Paimon: Hmm... Talking to Canotila is as confusing as ever.
Unknown NPC (21098): Woof!
Canotila: Hmm? But...
Unknown NPC (21098): Woof, woof!
Canotila: Okay, okay! I hear you.
Paimon: (Hmm...? She's talking to the puppy? Could it be that Melusine can generally communicate with dogs?)
Traveler: (How incredible.)
Canotila: Well, I guess that's that. I'll see you next time. Hmph! Even if you said that, I'm still coming back to play with you.
Canotila: #Let's go, Mr. Traveler, Paimon!

## Talk 2

Canotila: Well. Here we are again...
Paimon: What is it?
Canotila: I feel really bad for saying this since everyone's so nice to me, all of you, but...
Canotila: Don't you feel the real world is so frighteningly dull? Don't you think the world in the Book is far more beautiful?
Traveler: I think so, too.
Paimon: Really? You think so too, huh?
Canotila: I still feel the world in the Book of Revealing is much more appealing. There are dew-covered petals everywhere, and I've finally made friends with the puppy.
Paimon: That puppy... Uh, Canotila, can you communicate with dogs?
Canotila: Hm? Of course not. However, the puppy in the Book of Revealing is special. Or maybe, I'm special?
Canotila: I've been meditating to travel to the world in the Book, and then one day, the puppy's usual barking turned into something I could understand.
Canotila: As for what we talked about... He asked me to go and never come back.
Canotila: But... I still want to see the sunflowers bloom...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Iâ€”Is that so... Take care, Canotila! We'll be going!
Traveler: I don't think so.
Canotila: Is that so...? Maybe that's right. I'm not normal.
Traveler: There's no difference to me.
Canotila: #Looks like Mr. Traveler is the toughest of all.
