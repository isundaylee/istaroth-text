*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Khedive: Let's get to the serious topic.
Khedive: You've done me a big favor the past few days. I really don't know how I can repay you.
Khedive: Considering our amiable collaboration so far, it wouldn't be enough to pay you with Mora.
Traveler: Actually, if you insist...
Khedive: Be serious! Am I so vulgar as to humiliate you with mere gold?
Khedive: Wouldn't that be a sheer insult to you?
Khedive: Here, take this letter. If you ever run into any trouble or need some help in your future journey in Sumeru, bring it to the House of Purbiruni.
Khedive: We'll spare no effort in helping you.
Khedive: "Connections are far more precious than gold."
Khedive: This Sumeru saying rings quite true.
