# Kaedehara Yoshinori's Letter

A blank piece of paper that was hidden in an old flower pot. When dipped in water, it reveals a long-sealed secret.
After telling everyone about the truth that was concealed within, Kazuha said that "this letter may still be of use to you," before handing it over to you.
