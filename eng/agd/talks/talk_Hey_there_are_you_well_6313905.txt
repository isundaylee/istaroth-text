Traveler: Hey there, are you well?
Hiroyuki: Yes, and I hope you're doing well, too! Now that the war's over, I can finally enjoy the scenery here on Watatsumi Island again.
Hiroyuki: Have you been to the Sangonomiya Shrine? The huge coral really is something, isn't it?
Hiroyuki: The flora unique to the island is also definitely worth a few extra long looks.
Hiroyuki: *cough* Well, I might be getting a bit too relaxed, yes. The war is over for now, and the Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, but our differences with the Shogunate remain...
Hiroyuki: Still, that's not going to stop me from taking this opportunity to relax a little.
