Collingwood: Hey there! Are you the one who's assisting me with the Dreamscape Therapy? To be honest, I don't know what my dream's going to be about.
Collingwood: I'm from Mondstadt, and I don't really have any hobbies... You know, except drinking.
Collingwood: And I'm the type to mess up sometimes when I get sloshed, so... I'm counting on you.

### Additional Talk 1

Collingwood: The more I look at this tavern, the stranger it seems. Urgh... It... seems like some things are just different from normal, like they're crooked?

### Additional Talk 2

Youguang: A pleasure to meet you. We're about to enter a dreamscape together, I believe.
Youguang: I'm Youguang, a guard from Liyue. I touched something... unclean while at work recently, and I haven't had a good night's sleep since. That's why I sought help.
Youguang: If I can dispel my nightmares through this Dreamscape Therapy, that would truly be amazing.

### Additional Talk 3

Youguang: O demons, great divine beings, and honored adepti, please, shower us with your mercy! Do not hide in objects, please, show yourselves, before I die of fright!

### Additional Talk 4

Higuchi Tetsuya: Nice to meet you. Higuchi Tetsuya's the name, a youkai novel writer from Inazuma.
Higuchi Tetsuya: I've been under lots of pressure lately, so... I'll try anything, do whatever it takes, to get back on my feet.
Higuchi Tetsuya: By the way, my dreamscape might have a rather... personalized look, considering that it's a world of my making â€” with all the issues that entails. Apologies in advance for any strange things you might see.

### Additional Talk 5

Higuchi Tetsuya: Where are all our Inazuman youkai hiding? Come on out, show your faces!

### Additional Talk 6

Nitesh: Ah, so the qualified volunteer for the Dreamscape experiments is one so young? My, aren't young people impressive nowadays.
Nitesh: Call me Nitesh. I am a traveling Spantamad scholar, presently working long-term in Fontaine.
Nitesh: We older folks tend to come by all manner of problems more easily. I'm counting on you to help me get to the heart of things, youngster.

### Additional Talk 7

Nitesh: Why, I never! Each piece of lab equipment is more disobedient than the last. Hey! I don't care how much energy you have, stop messing around and behave yourselves!

### Additional Talk 8

Piyush: So you're the fine friend that Dharmakirti's introduced? Piyush, pleased to meet you. I work in architecture.
Piyush: I've heard Kaveh mention your name before, but I haven't had the chance to say hello yet, so this is a happy coincidence.
Piyush: I'm guessing I'll dream about a project I just submitted. It was an absolute nightmare... It's just a shame we have to first meet in such a formal fashion... Oh well.

### Additional Talk 9

Piyush: I can't take it anymore! Why didn't you follow the design!? Pavilions, pools, fountains, greenhouses... The slopes, and even the greenhouse interiors, not one has spared a thought for symmetry!
