# Golden Apple Pastry

A little dessert made from apples. After being sliced into evenly sized pieces, the apples are mixed with sugar and other spices. The mixture is boiled until it thickens, then wrapped in square puff pastry and baked until it turns golden and puffy. The crispy puff pastry envelops a soft filling within, a delicious treat suitable for anyone.
