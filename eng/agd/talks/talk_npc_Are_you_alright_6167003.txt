Traveler: Are you alright?
Knotty: This place is terrifying... I went up the mountain once â€” not only did I find nothing, but I've basically turned into a popsicle to boot...

Knotty: There's a campsite just ahead, and the chef there is always making soup. I can smell it from all the way over here...
