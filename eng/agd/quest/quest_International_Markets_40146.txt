# International Markets


## Talk 1

Atefeh: Hello there. The potions from earlier have sold out.
Atefeh: I've organized the sales data for you. Feel free to have a look.
Atefeh: Let's skip right to talking about this deal, shall we?
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!

## Talk 2

Atefeh: Hello there! The name's Atefeh. I'm a traveling merchant from Sumeru. Great to meet you!
Paimon: Woah, you've made quite the journey! Guess news of our humble shop has already spread to all four corners of Teyvat!
Traveler: It's all thanks to you, Paimon.
Paimon: Paimon's practically a sales whiz. She could sell water to a fish, hehe!
Atefeh: Haha, I have to agree! This venture of yours is becoming quite well-known. In fact, many well-informed merchants have heard word of your potion-selling endeavor.
Atefeh: But most people are still not willing to take a risk on such a rare commodity.
Atefeh: If you ask me, though, when opportunity knocks, you've got to be ready to answer. That's how you make the big Mora.
Atefeh: Although the general public still doesn't know much about alchemical potions right now, with a little effort and marketing on your side, you can carve out a nice space in the market for yourself. Once that happens, the Mora will just keep on flowing!
Atefeh: Once you've generated enough demand, you could even increase your prices ten fold... Hehe, with that kind of profit, you could even take the rest of the year off if you wanted.
Paimon: Ten fold! Are you serious?
Atefeh: Hehe, as long as the demand is there, people will pay anything. You could say it's a sort of mutual agreement between consumer and supplier.
Paimon: With the way you talk, Paimon can't help but be reminded of a certain other Mora-obsessed merchant...
Paimon: Wait, you did say you were from Sumeru. Maybe you know her. Ever met Dori?
Atefeh: Wait, you mean Lord Sangemah Bay? One of the most famous merchants in all of Sumeru？That Dori? You know her?
Traveler: She's a friend of mine.
Atefeh: Wow! Lord Sangemah Bay is one of my biggest idols. Her business sense and dedication to making Mora has always been one of my greatest inspirations!
Atefeh: I was even lucky enough to visit the Palace of Alcazarzaray once. It truly is a magnificent sight.
Atefeh: One day, I hope to be just like her — up to my ears in more Mora than I can count, hehe...
Paimon: Uhh... looks like we've lost her... Should Paimon snap her out of it, or...
Traveler: We wish you all the best!
Atefeh: Thank you, that means a lot!
Atefeh: Back to where we were, then. I believe I was telling you how we could make some big Mora together.
Atefeh: The idea's actually pretty simple. You produce the potions, provide me with a regular supply, and I'll help you sell them across Teyvat!
Atefeh: If that sounds good to you, then we should talk more in depth about what kinds of potions to sell this time around.
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!
Traveler: Let's get back to business.
Atefeh: *ahem* You're right. I seem to have strayed off topic.
Traveler: We've met a couple of times.
Traveler: All our hard work is paying off!

## Talk 3

Atefeh: So, are you ready to make more Mora with me?
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!
