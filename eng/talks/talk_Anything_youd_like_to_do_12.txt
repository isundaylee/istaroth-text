# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Thoma: Actually, I was hoping to find a nice, open area and invite you to do some skygazing together.
Thoma: Something about the sky here seems clearer than anywhere else. It makes me feel... peaceful inside.
Thoma: Don't get me wrong, sunset in Inazuma is impressive, too, but somehow it feels a little more... somber than what you have here.
Traveler: Well, we are inside an adeptus' teapot, after all.
Thoma: Huh, you're right... which is already pretty astonishing. To think that the two of us along with a whole expanse of sky can be packed inside a tiny little teapot.
Thoma: Ahhhh...
Thoma: Even if this crystal-blue sky is just a teapot's illusion, a moment of pure tranquility is a great thing all the same.
Thoma: Haha, I guess I always try to see the positive side of things.
Traveler: I appreciate that about you, Thoma.
Thoma: Haha, thanks for that.
Thoma: On a more serious note, though you may not want to show it... I can see the tiring toll of your journey in your eyes sometimes.
Thoma: Since we're already here, why not try to leave your worries behind and put your mind at ease for a while?
Thoma: And if you ever feel lonely, don't worry â€” you've always got me here to keep you company.
Traveler: That's why you can live a happy life.
Traveler: I know what you mean.
Thoma: Really? You do? It's great that you know how I feel.
