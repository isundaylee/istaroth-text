# Antigonus


## Talk 1

Ooshima: Forget the book, forget whether we were falsely accused or not. Go find Antei!
Paimon: Antei?
Ooshima: Yes, he's the third guy who was locked up together with us. I'm Ooshima, and as for that guy, his name's Antigonus, or Antei, if you want the Narukami Island-ized version.
Ooshima: He was an apprentice Jibashiri as well. Fierce temper, and super strong to boot. He escaped by grabbing the tiny bumps in the cliff and climbing right out of here.
Ooshima: That's just horrifying. Is that even possible for normal people?
Traveler: Actually, I can do that too.
Ooshima: Ugh, forget it. You people who volunteer to become Jibashiri, I bet you've trained so hard that you've ceased to be human anymore.
Ooshima: I've heard that the test to become a Jibashiri involves the candidate lifting one foot with both hands and standing in a circle.
Ooshima: Then they get 12 other Jibashiri to stab at them with spears, and if they can go an entire night without being injured, they pass.
Ooshima: I mean, you're a Jibashiri candidate. Is that rumor true?
Traveler: Not as far as I know...
Ooshima: Seriously? Are you telling me that it's even worse?
Ooshima: C'mon, tell me!
Traveler: Isn't the issue with Antei more important?
Ooshima: Oh... Right. Yeah. *cough*
Ooshima: He said that he would leave us a picture of a "byrde" as a sign to mark his path.
Ooshima: It's an animal you can't find here in Enkanomiya. It can fly, it has wings, and it symbolizes freedom. Or something.
Paimon: Isn't that a "bird"?
Ooshima: Right. That's right. "Bird."
Ooshima: He told me his plan was to climb up, retrieve a set of official-issue exploration gear that he'd hidden there beforehand, and then set off in the direction of the Serpent's Heart. Said he was following some leads about a delegation from Khaenri'ah.
Ooshima: He said that he'd prove our innocence, even if that was the last thing he did, and that if any officials or shrine maidens came to look for us, we should tell them that he was headed for the Serpent's Heart.
Ooshima: So yeah, even if he doesn't make it, he'll leave a bird picture behind as a clue to lead people to the proof that we're innocent.
Ooshima: As long as nothing goes wrong, you should be able to find him by following the bird pictures.
Ooshima: Our lives are at stake here, so please, go!

## Talk 2

Antei: You two are...
Paimon: Are you Antei?
Antei: That's right. That's me. I feel... a little strange...
Antei: I remember chasing those scoundrels... ripping a core out and throwing it into a camp. Then after that, I got a little woozy from my own injuries... I was hurt pretty bad...
Antei: But then I woke up, and then I met you, and now I feel fine. Tell me, am I going to die soon or something?
Traveler: ...
Antei: ...No, that's not important right now. Are you here to arrest me again? I've already proven my innocence.
Antei: It was those people from Khaenri'ah. They were the ones who stole that library book. I was assigned as one of their bodyguards, sure, but there's no way I would have been in cahoots with them!
Antei: I tracked their diplomatic team to this place and beat them all.
Antei: But I spent a long time dealing with some giant mechanical creature they had with them. Finally, I was able to tear its core out, but I was wounded seriously in the process.
Antei: The disabled machine crashed on top of the lost book. There's no way to retrieve it now.
Paimon: Wow, Byakuyakoku's Jibashiri are pretty tough...
Antei: Wait, you aren't Jibashiri or candidates yourselves? *sigh* Whatever. The Jibashiri started out as heroes who fought against the Bathysmal Vishaps. It was only later that they became law enforcement — the judges of the nether.
Antei: The machine's core is in the camp. Go there and have a look if you don't believe me.

## Talk 3

Antei: I once heard a Narukami Island envoy talk about this creature named a "bird." It has wings and it can fly through the skies.
Antei: That's just amazing, can you imagine it?
Antei: Some people believe that they are messengers from the gods who carry word of human fates.
Antei: And if some exiled person finally expires out in the wild, the very same creature will come to peck and consume their mortal flesh.
Antei: These animals fascinate me, to be honest. If I should see the light of another day, I will definitely keep a bird.

## Talk 4

Antei: Did you get the book?
Paimon: We did. You're indeed innocent, Antei.
Antei: From how you spoke earlier, you aren't Jibashiri... Which is a shame. You could've declared me innocent on the spot otherwise.
Antei: That would have saved me some time.
Antei: Again, I feel really energized, but I'm quite sure that I was exhausted from losing too much blood just a while ago. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to die shortly...
Paimon: Uh...
Antei: *sigh* Let me ask you a question, stranger. Does a man sin who has been wrongly convicted by Byakuyakoku?
Traveler: ...
Antei: If I, due to my disturbed state of mind, was left here by Tokoyo Ookami as a Sinshade. Is this transgression?
Antei: Am I guilty?
Traveler: No, you aren't.
Paimon: #Be careful {NICKNAME}. If he realizes that... you know, then he's gonna disappear.
Traveler: You're just an afterimage that Antei left behind.
Antei: ...
Traveler: You are innocent, and I will make sure the world knows that.
Antei: Haha. So that's it? So, I'm just a shadow, left behind after my death.
Antei: And... I am innocent.
Antei: Antei's afterimage starts to recite some broken passages—
"What divine law have I broken... Why do the unfortunate rely on the gods?
Do my deeds have meaning, now that my earnest deeds have earned me a sinful name?"

## Talk 5

Ooshima: Go look for Antei and bring him back here, then get us all out — legally, of course.

## Talk 6

Oogura: Come on, we're innocent!

## Talk 7

Oogura: Are you the Jibashiri they've sent to release us?
Oogura: Nah, you're too young, must be an apprentice or something.
Oogura: Pfah, but you know what? I'm not shocked. I'll bet those high-and-mighty Jibashiri couldn't stand the loss of face from accusing three innocent people, so they sent some youngster down to do their dirty work and apologize in their stead. Isn't that right?
Paimon: Are you the people who've been suspected of stealing "Before Sun and Moon"?
Oogura: What "suspect"? The name's Oogura, and we were falsely accused, alright?
Oogura: But never mind that. You're not here to let us out, are you? Well, if not that, I suppose you're after that guy?
Paimon: "That guy"?
Oogura: The third guy! I don't know him well, but the fellow next to me does — just a bit, but it counts! Go on, ask him.
Oogura: The guy who escaped is a rather fierce character. But I can guarantee that he, like the two of us here, is innocent.
Oogura: I mean, come on, it's Enkanomiya's last day. Let's not endanger human lives now, shall we?

## Talk 8

Oogura: Are you the Jibashiri they've sent to release us?
Oogura: Nah, you're too young, must be an apprentice or something.
Oogura: Pfah, but you know what? I'm not shocked. I'll bet those high-and-mighty Jibashiri couldn't stand the loss of face from accusing three innocent people, so they sent some youngster down to do their dirty work and apologize in their stead. Isn't that right?
Paimon: What in the world are you talking about?
Oogura: You're not officials? ...Well, this is troublesome. They can't have forgotten all about us, have they?
Oogura: My name is Oogura. I was falsely accused and locked up in this place — all three of us were, really!
Oogura: Well, not all hope is lost just yet. Since you were able to make it in here, you must be pretty capable yourself. Go save that guy, would you?
Paimon: That guy?
Oogura: The third guy! I don't know him well, but the fellow next to me does — just a bit, but it counts! Go on, ask him.
Oogura: The guy who escaped is a rather fierce character. But I can guarantee that he, like the two of us here, is innocent.
Oogura: I mean, come on, it's Enkanomiya's last day. Let's not endanger human lives now, shall we?
