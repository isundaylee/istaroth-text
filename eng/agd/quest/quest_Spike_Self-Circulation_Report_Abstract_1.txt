# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Abstract

Hosseini: The effects are better than I thought! We've recorded all the phenomena we've seen and the data we've collected...
Hosseini: And most importantly, the dark mud was completely cleared.
Hosseini: It's just that, hmm...
Paimon: Huh, why do you look so unhappy? Is it a bad thing that the mining complex is all clean?
Hosseini: Let me think... Well, when Khedive and I analyzed the situation previously, we believed that the opening in the Ley Lines through which the dark mud came should be here.
Hosseini: I don't think that such an opening would have been this easy to clear out, so the true entry point must be elsewhere...
Hosseini: And in this case, the affected areas also include...
Traveler: The front-line mines.
Hosseini: Exactly, this means that the point through which the dark mud is flowing in is in the tunnels. Such areas will be far more narrow, allowing for greater buildup of the mud, and making it easier for monsters to swarm in, thus worsening our problem.
Hosseini: Still, I have full faith in the Pursina's Spike.
Hosseini: It is, after all, Pursina's great creation.
Hosseini: Just let me do a bit of maintenance work on it first. I'll call the miners who've agreed to move the Spike into the tunnels over.
