# Suspicious Blubber Profiterole

A cream-filled dessert. It's been sitting out way too long, and the once-flaky crust is now soft and mushy. It is... quite different from the crispy texture you imagined. After trying a single bite, you want to just pass the "death sentence" on this erstwhile dessert.
