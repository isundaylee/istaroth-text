Traveler: About Melusines...
Paimon: Apparently, every Melusine gets their own special token when they're born. They treat it as a symbol of their very being.
Traveler: If you were a Melusine...
Paimon: Definitely a fork! To represent Paimon's lifelong mission to taste all the delicious food in the whole world!
Traveler: Not Mora, then?
Paimon: Ooh, good point... Yeah, if it were Mora, it'd mean that Paimon's destined to be a super rich person. Then Paimon could buy anything she wants!
Paimon: Hmmmmm... Argh, Paimon's so torn! Both are so tempting...
Traveler: How about a fork made from Mora?
Paimon: Wow, that's a great idea!
Paimon: Anyway, enough about Paimon. Your token would probably be... a cooking pot, to represent being Paimon's personal gourmet chef!
Traveler: No no no, my token would be Paimon.
Paimon: Aw, really?
Traveler: With Paimon as my token, everything that you have would ultimately belong to me.
Paimon: Huh... Okay sure. Friends share everything, right?
Traveler: Haha, yeah... My stuff would still be mine...
Paimon: Hey, no fair!
Traveler: Then you can have your cake and eat it, so to speak.
Traveler: What would your token be?
