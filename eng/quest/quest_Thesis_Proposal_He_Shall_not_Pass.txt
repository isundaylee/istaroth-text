# Thesis Proposal: He Shall not Pass


## Talk 1

Jami: Ugh... My academic career has been sunk before it could even start...
Jami: A scholar? Why bother being a scholar? If I had learned to draw in the Akademiya and became an illustrator, I wouldn't have ended up here... Haha... Hahahaha!
Paimon: Y'know, when we first heard that there was an Akademiya researcher in Port Ormos who groans all day... Paimon thought it was some kind of strange tale.
Paimon: But hey, guess he's real. Hey, "groaning Akademiya researcher"!
Jami: What...? "Groaning Akademiya researcher"? Are you talking about me?
Jami: *sigh* If you'd met me in the past, I would debate the veracity of such a slanderous title. But now... forget it.
Jami: Go back to where you came from, little one. Don't disturb a young man, mired, adrift, without a future. People like me should just shrivel like a silent mushroom in the dark corner of the forest...
Jami: At least the Akademiya's resources wouldn't be wasted then. I might even be taken back there as some special mushroom sample to be dissected by some real scholar...
Jami: "Jami the Mushroom Sample." Wouldn't it be funny if that's how I wound up being remembered by history...
Paimon: Jami? Oh, so that's your name.
Jami: Yeah. What about it, little one?
Paimon: The name's Paimon! Not "little one"!
Traveler: #And I'm {NICKNAME}.
Jami: #{NICKNAME} and Paimon. Right, noted. So, how may I help you...?
Paimon: Well, we just heard about the rumors of "groaning Akademiya researcher" in Port Ormos and wanted to know what was going on.
Jami: *sigh*... What's going on, you say? Well, have you heard of this thing that happens for us researchers called "publishing our research"?
Jami: Publishing independent research is how we prove that we are capable, self-sufficient scholars. That's how we graduate from under our mentor's tutelage and enter the academic world, where we can then gain renown...
Jami: That way, we can travel to places in Teyvat in the name of collecting research material, with research grants sufficient to cover even fine food and drink!
Paimon: Fine food and drink, huh... Say, you wouldn't mind elaborating on that, would you?
Traveler: Hmm...
Jami: Uh, I was just saying... In truth, I dream of doing great things in the academic world.
Jami: Good food, traveling, fame, things like these are just side benefits. I wouldn't reject them, of course, but... *cough* Either way, we're getting off topic.
Jami: Anyway, I'm stuck at the "publish your research" part. The courses at Akademiya have a tight schedule already, and I have to get my thesis proposal passed in time.
Jami: My proposals have been rejected twice. "The Edibleness of Mushrooms on the Back of Shroomboars" was the first one. I actually thought that one was pretty good...
Paimon: Well, it certainly sounds like a good subject. One that warrants a couple hundred experiments, for sure!
Jami: I know, right? But my mentor just said "is this even worth looking into?" and refused my request... Absolutely ridiculous.
Jami: The second time, I applied to research "The Ecological Environment and Aquaculture of Floating Hydro Fungi," but got rejected again by my mentor, who called the topic too unambitious...
Jami: The deadline for submitting the thesis proposal was drawing near, and so I wrote up a very ambitious proposal in a fit of pique... You know, as a way of saying "you old man, how dare you call me unambitious!"
Jami: I didn't think that my mentor would let it pass or that it would get praise in the Akademiya. But there was no way back from there, so my report became...
Paimon: Became what?
Jami: Heh... a "Study on the Defense Deficiencies of Biological Structures in Response to Hostile Stressors"...
Traveler: Sorry, Hostile Stressor-what again?
Paimon: Nope, Paimon doesn't know what you're talking about. Doesn't sound delicious or interesting either.
Jami: The research topic of your study should ideally be a bit obscure. To put it in simple terms, creatures in combat will more or less reveal some weaknesses in their defenses.
Jami: Some weak spots, which should have been well protected, will end up exposed when they make certain movements. And those are the Weaknesses I'm collecting for my research.
Paimon: It's still kinda hard to understand... but it sounds awesome!
Jami: Well, being awesome doesn't help you fight monsters or take pictures of research materials. I'm just a fragile researcher. This subject is way too dangerous for me!
Jami: How am I supposed to finish this whole thing...? And with an unfinished thesis, I won't be able to graduate...
Jami: Fighting monsters... Hah, whatever. Let's just do it. I might get heavily injured, but maybe my mentor might take pity on me and grant a pass to this poor student...
Paimon: Please don't do that!
Jami: But my thesis proposal has already been submitted. There's no time to switch topics. What can I do?
Jami: I was too impulsive for my own good. Some researcher I am! I should just go feed myself to a Rishboland Tiger! Wait, no. That might hurt. Maybe I should drown myself in the river near Vimara Village instead. The water's cool and clean there...
Paimon: Whoa, poor guy! It's partially his fault for ending up like this, but still...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's just help him, shall we?
Traveler: Well, now that you've said this much...
Jami: Râ€”Really? But it's a very dangerous job...
Paimon: No worries! We're pretty good at fighting monsters!
Jami: Ah, thank you! Thank you! Does this mean I can finish my thesis now? I'd even sell myself to you if you can help me do that!
Paimon: Uh, you totally don't have to! And we don't wanna buy you, anyway...
Jami: Sorry... apologies for my lack of composure. How about this, then? Let's go to the testing ground I've prepared.
Traveler: Defense... Deficiencies...?
Traveler: Looks like he has some ulterior motives...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Paimon didn't realize that we had walked all this way here...
Jami: There's no other way around, I fear.
Paimon: This is too far from Port Ormos...
Jami: Well, this is about my test subjects after all. You know, my mentor wanted me to observe every living being in Teyvat. An impossible task, I tell you!
Jami: And that's why I started by researching creatures from Sumeru and Liyue...
Jami: By the way, please hold this. It's a special potion for my research that works within the testing grounds.
Jami: It's called the "Fayz Potion," and it was formulated by my seniors at Amurta. It's expensive and complicated to make, so I've only managed to make a few...
Paimon: What's this potion gotta do with your experiment?
Jami: Here's how it works: you will subjectively feel that time will slow down in a very extreme manner after taking the "Fayz Potion." It'll feel like one moment is eternal.
Jami: This way, you can do more detailed photography and observations!
Paimon: Wait a moment, couldn't you just do that yourself?
Jami: I thought so too, but it's not that simple.
Jami: As I said, you will subjectively feel time slowing down... But your body may not be able to keep up if you aren't agile enough...
Jami: For example, if you quaff a Fayz Potion as a Spinocrocodile pounces on you but you aren't agile enough to dodge its lunging attack...
Jami: Then you will see how its claws are ever so close to your face, yet your body just won't move out of the way...
Jami: "Why can't I move my body!?" You may think to yourself. But it will be of no use. The paws will still stay so close to you that you can even see the dirty water and mud-stains on it.
Paimon: Yikes...
Jami: So, don't underestimate your opponents just because you feel that time is moving slowly.
Traveler: Will do!
Jami: The fate of my research is in your hands...
