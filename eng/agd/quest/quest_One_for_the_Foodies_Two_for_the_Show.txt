# One for the Foodies, Two for the Show


## Talk 1

Paimon: You know, this is starting to feel like chili pepper weather. Mmm, Paimon's hungry for some fresh and fiery spicy food that let your taste buds have a blast!
Paimon: #And if there's one dish that fits the bill, it's Black-Back Perch Stew! C'mon, Traveler, let's pay a visit to Wanmin Restaurant!

## Talk 2

Sheng (???): Help! I'm being robbed!
Keqing: Hmm? It came from that direction. Come on!

## Talk 3

Paimon: That should do it!

## Talk 4

Paimon: There's Yanxiao!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hi granny, we need your help with something!
Paimon: Are there any old books around in Qingce Village? You know, from a really long time ago.
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, looking for ancient texts, are we? Let me think...
Granny Ruoxin: There is an old warehouse over there, property of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Many books are stored inside — those that they have no room for at home. In fact, their youngest comes over this way to read sometimes.
Keqing: The Feiyun Commerce Guild's youngest? You must be talking about Xingqiu.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon didn't know they had a warehouse here. Let's go take a look!

## Talk 6

Sheng: Ugh... I've come here to clean the book warehouse plenty of times before, but this is the first time I've run into these crooks...
Xiangling: Are you alright?
Sheng: I am, thanks to all of you. Hey, wait a minute — you're the Traveler, aren't you? And you're with... Lady Keqing! An honor, truly an honor!
Keqing: We'll try not to take up too much of your time. I understand that this book warehouse is the property of the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Could you advise whether we might find any texts relating to the Stove God in this collection?
Sheng: The Stove God? Uh... I heard that's the Lord of Geo, right?
Paimon: Huh? Really?
Sheng: Yeah, a friend of mine who conducts research mentioned it once before. We use stoves for cooking, and stoves are built from rock.
Sheng: Some people think that the stove is a gift from the Lord of Geo, and that's why they call him the Stove God.
Keqing: Seems logical enough...
Keqing: But do you have any books on the topic?
Sheng: Um... I, uh... I'm sorry, I'd have to ask the young master about that...
Xingqiu: Any questions? Please, ask away!
Paimon: Hey, it's Chongyun and Xingqiu!
Chongyun: Hello, one and all.
Xiangling: Hey guys, what are you doing here?
Xingqiu: I was bored with nothing to do and thought I'd come out this way for a bit of reading. And then I thought, why not bring Chongyun along, too.
Chongyun: Yes, I'm just along for the ride really...
Xingqiu: I see the Yuheng, Keqing, is with you. Whatever brings you here must surely be a matter of grave importance.
Keqing: Master Xingqiu, if I may be so bold — do you happen to know if there are any texts on the subject of the Stove God among this collection?
Xingqiu: Since I personally selected which volumes to store here, I do have some recollection of their contents.
Xingqiu: If my memory betrays me not, there is one volume among them called "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," which mentions the Stove God.
Keqing: Might I take a look?
Xingqiu: Certainly. If it pleases my lady, I shall lead the way. Sheng, I will take care of things here. You're free to go about your own business.
Paimon: They're back! So, did you find it?
Keqing: Yes. Master Xingqiu has quite an exceptional memory, "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue" does indeed mention the Stove God. However...
Keqing: It says the following: "The body of the dragon wielded a tail that could eclipse the sun, and claws to command fire and teach the ways of wisdom. Receiving the gift bequeathed unto them, humankind cooked food with fire, and thus did they prosper."
Xiangling: The body of a dragon? The stories about Rex Lapis say the same thing.
Keqing: That much is true. But this is the only passage in the whole book. If we want to find out more, we'll have to continue our investigation.
Keqing: There's nothing further to discover here. It seems we'll have to look at other options.
Chongyun: I come from a long lineage of exorcists, and our family too has amassed a number of ancient texts. Now that you mention the Stove God, I seem to recall reading somewhere that this god once appeared at the Guili Assembly. Of course, I can't say if it's true or not.
Xingqiu: Books are penned by people. All they can do is show what the author was thinking. Everyone's mind is different, so every book on a given topic will give a different account.
Xingqiu: I apologize that we could not help in a more substantial capacity.
Keqing: Your help thus far is quite ample. Liyue is a vast and rich land, all things that existed here in the past have left their trace. So long as we do not abandon our search, it is sure to bear fruit eventually.
Keqing: Thank you all. We will continue our investigation elsewhere.
Xiangling: Ah, hold up! I had a question too! Xingqiu, Chongyun, could you tell me what kind of food you like?
Chongyun: Food? Oh no... Y—You're not thinking of taking part in Masterful Chefs, are you!?
Xiangling: Uh, yeah, I totally am! What's wrong... You look like you've just seen a ghost!
Chongyun: Xiangling, this is a major event. I beg you, please don't cook anything strange for this competition...
Xiangling: What do you mean, "strange"!?
Xingqiu: Mushroom Slime Stew, to give one example.
Xiangling: Okay, fair enough, that dish isn't my most popular... but that's why I'm doing all this research, so I can create some really special dishes to win everyone over.
Chongyun: Well, in that case... I like cold food.
Paimon: That's 'cause you can't handle hot and spicy, right?
Chongyun: Haha, yes, you're absolutely right.
Xingqiu: My tastes are on the mild side — I prefer gentle dishes with minimal seasoning. Soups and stews, vegetables in broth, seafood or freshwater fish, either boiled or steamed... These kinds of dishes I am most partial to.
Paimon: No surprises from Guhua Geek.
Xiangling: Okay, another mild child... Got it.
Chongyun: These are just personal preferences, and everyone's are quite different... Are you sure this eclectic mix of opinions will be of any use?
Xiangling: Of course! You're my customers, and putting a smile on customers' faces is my calling as a chef!
Xingqiu: Though Xiangling's market research blade stabs often into the dark, her heart never strays from the noble path.
Paimon: If anyone can win hearts and minds with their cooking, it's gotta be someone like Xiangling. She's got pure intentions and really cares about the customers.
Xiangling: Where's all this praise coming from...? Knock it off guys, you're embarrassing me...
Xiangling: Ah! Sorry for holding you all up — that's all I needed to know! Shall we carry on with the investigation now?
Paimon: Over to you, Keqing. Where to next?
Keqing: Hmm...
Keqing: So we've learned the Stove God allegedly made an appearance at the Guili Assembly. But today, that place is largely a wasteland, with few traces of human activity.
Keqing: Wangshu Inn is close by, so let's stop off there on the way over and see what we can find out.
Xingqiu: Forgive us, for this is where we must part ways. May your journey be a smooth one.
Chongyun: Yes, best of luck! If you run into any difficulties, come and find us. We'll be only too glad to help!
Traveler: Thanks everyone.
Paimon: Let's go! Next stop, Wangshu Inn!

## Talk 7

Smiley Yanxiao: Huh? Oh, Traveler. Who are all these people?
Paimon: Friends of ours. Allow Paimon to introduce Xiangling, Guoba, and Keqing.
Smiley Yanxiao: Keqing? Of the Qixing!? She's the, um... the, uh...
Keqing: Hi.
Traveler: No need to be so nervous, Yanxiao.
Smiley Yanxiao: It's not that, it's... I mean, I'm just your typical commoner, I've never met someone as high up as the Yuheng before in my whole life!
Xiangling: (Look at that strong body, those powerful hands, and honest eyes... this guy must be a really great chef!)
Smiley Yanxiao: So, is there something I can help you with? You've come a long way out to end up at Wangshu Inn.
Keqing: Let me fill you in...
Smiley Yanxiao: Okay, I see.
Keqing: Legends claim that the Stove God once appeared at the Guili Assembly. As Wangshu Inn is the oldest extant building in this area, any historical texts from around these parts are likely to have ended up here.
Keqing: Is there a room in this inn for storing books? And if there is, do any of them mention the Stove God?
Smiley Yanxiao: Now that you mention it, we do have a fair few ancient texts here. I remember looking through an old recipe book once... I just need to remember where they're all stored.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you're happy to wait here for a few minutes, I'll go have a look right away!
Smiley Yanxiao: Oh, Traveler, there's something I need to discuss with you.
Paimon: What is it? We need to pay up or something?
Smiley Yanxiao: What? No, I wouldn't take your money! We're all friends here. I just wanted to ask if you had the time to make a Satisfying Salad for me?
Paimon: A Satisfying Salad? What for?
Traveler: Could it be...
Smiley Yanxiao: Guy who hangs out on the roof terrace, you know? Good looking fella, not too tall...
Paimon: Shh! Don't you think he can hear you!?
Smiley Yanxiao: Oh, right! Uh, yeah, maybe. Anyway, you know who I mean.
Smiley Yanxiao: The boss told me to take care of him, but this guy, let me tell you — he is one tough nut to crack. He usually turns his nose up at everything that isn't Almond Tofu.
Smiley Yanxiao: But the boss tells me you once made him a Satisfying Salad and it all went down so well. So I was thinking... Could you teach me how to make it too? That way, I'll have something else in my arsenal.
Paimon: Oh, so this is for Xiao! You guys really look after him, huh.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, that's life, right? You've gotta look out for your own people.
Traveler: Sure, I can help.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright then — wait right here, I'll be just one minute!
Paimon: Clock is ticking! 59, 58...
Keqing: Sorry for the trouble, Traveler.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Keqing: Okay.
Smiley Yanxiao: Here you are.
Keqing: Thank you ever so much.
Paimon: While Keqing's reading her book, let's make that Satisfying Salad! Xiangling, what are you gonna do?
Xiangling: I'd love to come watch too, but I don't wanna get in the way. So I'll just stay here with Keqing.
Paimon: Okay. Shall we go, then?
Smiley Yanxiao: Go ahead and get started, I'll just watch from over here! I only need to watch you make it once to have it committed to memory.
Traveler: We're all friends here.
Traveler: Thanks for agreeing to dig out that book.
Traveler: A certain person comes to mind...

## Talk 8

Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, thanks for that. I think I've got it now.
Paimon: You got all the steps down, right?
Smiley Yanxiao: Of course. Don't forget, I am the best chef around these parts.
Paimon: Let's go see what Keqing and Xiangling are up to.
Paimon: Keqing, Xiangling, we're back!
Keqing: You've finished cooking? Good timing, we've finished our reading, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: And? Useful, or no?
Keqing: Useful. There is a passage concerning the Stove God, and it's not what we were expecting.
Keqing: I quote: "60 miles to the northwest is the Guili Assembly. Many were settled there, where they hunted in groups, farmed the land, and made their living from what the soil yielded."
Keqing: "When the Stove God descended, one god became many, all of which were the height of children. As does a star when it descends into the world, so the Stove God went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire. With fire, the people at last learned to make hot food, and they dined on rice congee and cooked meat thereafter."
Keqing: This is a radically different account from the one given in "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," and also a conflicting one.
Paimon: "One god became many"... Does that mean there was more than one Stove God?
Keqing: Taking the text at face value, that is what it says.
Xiangling: "Went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire"... So, did the Stove God really go and teach people how to cook firsthand?
Smiley Yanxiao: Now that's a god who truly cared for their people.
Paimon: So we've got two leads, but they contradict each other. How do we know which one to believe?
Keqing: By continuing with our investigation, and reserving judgment for now.
Keqing: Thank you for this text, Yanxiao.
Smiley Yanxiao: It's my pleasure, really. Think nothing of it. If anything, I should be thanking the Traveler.
Smiley Yanxiao: Listen, you've helped me an awful lot — not just today but in the past, too. I wanna make it up to you properly, and as it happens, things are pretty quiet here today. So I'd like to take the chance to treat you all. What do you say — will you stay for a meal?
Xiangling: Wow, he sure sounds confident in his cooking! I like that — confidence is one of the best ingredients a chef can have!
Xiangling: I really wanna try his cooking. I say we take him up on his offer!
Traveler: Keqing, can you spare the time?
Keqing: It's hard to refuse a generous offer like that... Yes, I think we can fit this in.
Keqing: Yanxiao, we await your culinary creations with great anticipation.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haha, I won't disappoint!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Everybody, please be seated!
Keqing: You'd think you own the place.
Xiangling: I'll sit here, with Guoba!
Guoba: ♪~♪
Smiley Yanxiao: Here we are. That's everything you ordered.
Xiangling: (!!!)
Xiangling: (It all smells amazing... I think I've met my fellow finalist!)
Paimon: Mmmm~! It smells beauuuutiful!
Keqing: Strange, I never would have guessed that such a gifted chef worked here. This inn isn't particularly known for its food.
Smiley Yanxiao: Everyone likes a good meal, whether they're staying the night or just stopping by for a bite. We call it an inn, but the fact is, it's much more than that. We have to cater to all aspects of daily life to make this a true home away from home.
Smiley Yanxiao: Please enjoy your meal at your leisure. I should get back to work now.
Xiangling: Yanxiao... are you taking part in this year's Masterful Chefs?
Smiley Yanxiao: ...!
Smiley Yanxiao: Y—You too...?
Xiangling: Yep, I've signed up already, and I've got my eyes on the prize! Your cooking's delicious, Yanxiao. I'm really looking forward to seeing you in the final!
Smiley Yanxiao: Hah... interesting. Alright, I'll see you there!
Paimon: What was that? Some kind of power move?
Keqing: No, it seemed more sportsmanlike than that.
Xiangling: Yep! He's a really talented chef. His food was excellent, and it showed he has a level-headed personality. That's the kind of chef that could be a match for me.
Xiangling: I haven't had any competitive cooking experience since my cook-off with Brook in Springvale.
Traveler: When the heat is on, you'll rise to the challenge!
Xiangling: You're too kind... Ah!!! Guoba, what are you doing!?
Guoba: ♪~
Keqing: Oh! Guoba's eating the...
Xiangling: Those were Keqing's! How could you steal them while she wasn't looking!?
Keqing: Ohh... my Golden Shrimp Balls...
Paimon: Bad!
Guoba: ?
Xiangling: You ate every last one... *sigh* Guoba, we've been through this. When we're with friends, you gotta be on your best behavior, okay?
Xiangling: I'm so sorry, Keqing, I promise I'll make it up to you!
Paimon: What's the big deal? We can just get another plate. After all, it's Yanxiao's treat today.
Xiangling: It's not the same, though! The moment's gone. Sure, you can eat something else, but you can never go back and change that feeling of despair as your food is snatched away from right under your nose...
Xiangling: The dining experience is a trinity of emotion, food, and atmosphere, and you've gotta have all three to make it work!
Keqing: I have to say, now that you mention it, that is a very accurate appraisal of the situation...
Xiangling: I'm gonna make it up to you, Keqing. Is there anything you wanna eat? Anything at all! Whatever it is, I'll make it for you!
Keqing: Hmm...
Keqing: (I don't have high hopes for this, but equally I don't want her feeling guilty... Okay, I'll let her do this for me.)
Keqing: If you insist, there is one dish that perhaps you could try making for me. It's an old recipe from my grandfather's notes.
Xiangling: No problem. May I see it?
Keqing: I'll get it to you when we're back in Liyue Harbor.
Keqing: Traveler, have you finished eating?
Traveler: Yep.
Keqing: Before we do anything else, let's head back to Liyue Harbor. I need to fetch something.

## Talk 10

Keqing: I need to go home to fetch my grandfather's notes. Let's meet at Wanmin Restaurant later.
Paimon: Great!
Xiangling: I'll go get everything ready! Traveler, what about you? Are you gonna do your own thing for a while, or do you wanna come in and have a seat?
Keqing: #I actually have something to discuss with {F#her}{M#him}. You go ahead, we'll join you later.
Xiangling: Okay, gotcha.
Keqing: Traveler, come here for a moment.
Keqing: I need your advice on something... What do I need to do to get along with Xiangling?
Traveler: ...Hmm?
Paimon: ...Seriously? That's what's stressing you out?
Keqing: What's so strange about it? Why are you looking at me like that...?
Paimon: You're super smart and you're always so sure of yourself. Paimon thought you'd never need advice from anyone about anything.
Keqing: Well that's just ridiculous...
Keqing: Xiangling's always so warm and friendly with me, this time especially, and now she's desperate to do me a favor... So is that supposed to mean... uh, we're friends already?
Keqing: I'm just not used to dealing with people who are so warm right from the get-go. How exactly am I supposed to respond to that?
Traveler: Just smile back once in a while.
Keqing: Oh... um, okay...
Keqing: Ahem! Noted. Thank you, Traveler, I'll see you again shortly.
Paimon: What's making Keqing so self-conscious? Paimon thought nobody would be able to get under her skin.
Traveler: I'd like to hear what Xiangling thinks.
Traveler: Just grin and bear it.
Traveler: You seem to be getting along fine already.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey, we're here!
Xiangling: Hey, grab a seat. I'm just running through my ingredients to see what I'm missing.
Traveler: Xiangling, can I ask you a question?
Paimon: Oh... we're gonna do this now?
Xiangling: What is it?
Traveler: Paimon can explain.
Paimon: But this was your idea! Why you gotta dump it on Paimon!? Urgh...
Paimon: Okay, so, back at Wangshu Inn, we noticed you and Keqing were getting along pretty well. So you really like hanging out with her, huh?
Xiangling: Yep! Keqing's good-natured and easy to be around. The kind of person everyone wants to know, right?
Paimon: You're a braver person than Paimon... The first time we met Keqing, Paimon found her pretty intimidating...
Traveler: She does have a formidable presence.
Xiangling: You think so? I remember thinking straight away that she was really easy to get along with. Didn't you see her sneaking treats to Guoba back at Wangshu Inn?
Paimon: Yeah, she's great, we know that now! We're just talking about first impressions.
Xiangling: First impressions? Oh, okay — Hey, have you guys eaten grilled shellfish before? They can be hard to crack at first. But they taste amazing that way.
Paimon: We've eaten shellfish before, but... nope, don't think we've tried eating them grilled.
Xiangling: Oh, you're missing out! I'll grill some for you another time. But anyway, Keqing's like a shellfish. Maybe a little closed-off at first, but once you get to know her, she's got a soft and squishy side, too!
Xiangling: Not to mention that even after her favorite food was stolen away, she was still happy looking after Guoba. I'm really grateful for that.
Paimon: You make a good point.
Paimon: #You know, Traveler, Xiangling's intuition for people seems really spot-on. Is that why she took a liking to Keqing so quickly?
Traveler: I think so.
Xiangling: Alright, let's see... We're okay for Carrots and Crab, and we still got some Ham and Mushrooms... Hmm, I wonder what Keqing's recipe is gonna be?
Paimon: Huh? What was that noise!?
Xiangling: What's going on?
Xiangling: What the! That bird is huge!
Paimon: Ah, it's the lady bird!
Cloud Retainer: Excuse me! One shall not be addressed in such a manner!
Cloud Retainer: One shall be known as an adeptus, whose name, should you care to mention it, is Cloud Retainer.
Xiangling: Cloud Retainer... that does sound like an adeptus name.
Cloud Retainer: Well spoken. One shall let this young lady's enlightened words atone for the ignorant ones of her friend.
Traveler: It's been a while.
Cloud Retainer: A while it has indeed been, Traveler. Does one surmise correctly that you hasten hither to partake in the Moonchase Festival?
Traveler: You could put it like that, yeah...
Cloud Retainer: Ah so, even the illustrious Traveler has been summoned to attend the Moonchase Festival. As expected, this year's theme stands proud against the test of public scrutiny.
Xiangling: The theme? You mean "Feast of the Bounteous Land"?
Cloud Retainer: The very same. Moonchase Festival falls during the season when many cooking ingredients are ripe, hence it is a fitting time to enjoy the finest of foods. One noticed the relative pomp and ceremony with which this year's affairs are being conducted, and could not abide to stand idly by.
Cloud Retainer: Let it be known that one's culinary proficiency and ingenuity is uncontested in all the world! Thus does one now appear in this realm, that those who inhabit it might witness one's latest creation: a supreme cuisine machine.
Xiangling: A... a supreme cuisine what?
Paimon: What's a... supreme cuisine machine?
Traveler: Is it a new invention?
Cloud Retainer: Patience! One's purpose here today is to meet and to greet, nothing further. All shall be revealed before your very eyes when the time arrives.
Cloud Retainer: Traveler. You are one who has witnessed much of the culinary world. When the day comes, one would be most pleased to see you in attendance, offering your most vociferous ovations.
Paimon: Ooh, so we're officially invited?
Cloud Retainer: Hmph. That which is implicitly understood needs not be made explicit, let alone official.
Cloud Retainer: I shall say no more, and dwell here no longer. Await my word! Be there or beware!
Paimon: This bird always disappears just as quickly as she shows up. Wait, not bird — adeptus! ...Hey, wait, isn't she technically an illuminated bird, though...?
Xiangling: She seemed like someone very prestigious, and very talented at cooking.
Paimon: She definitely, definitely loves her food.
Keqing (???): What are you all huddled together over here for? The adeptus left already.
Paimon: Yay, Keqing's back!
Keqing: Sorry I kept you waiting. Xiangling, this is the recipe from my grandfather's notes. They're not in the best condition, so rather than bring them out of the house, I just transcribed the recipe.
Keqing: Unfortunately, the texts my grandfather worked with were very old — usually faded, damaged, or both. Some parts are missing from this recipe, too. Do you think you'll still be able to work with it?
Xiangling: Oh, okay! Lemme take a look... Hmm... Mm-hmm... Mm, mm.
Xiangling: Gimme some time, I need to look into it!
Keqing: Sorry for the trouble.
Ganyu (???): Oh, uh... you're all here...?
Paimon: That voice sounds familiar...
Traveler: Ganyu?
Ganyu: Sorry to interrupt your conversation... I was in the area buying a few things and I heard the disturbance, so I felt compelled to come take a look...
Keqing: You mean Cloud Retainer? I saw her too. She just suddenly showed up right in the middle of the street... Whatever adeptal power that was, she certainly knows how to make an entrance.
Ganyu: Lady Keqing, you saw her too? ...Ahh!!!
Ganyu: Do you, uh, have a moment? I need to... discuss something with you.
Keqing: What is it, Ganyu? Has something urgent come up while I've been out?
Ganyu: No, it's nothing work-related. I wanted to ask about... um, something personal. Is that okay?
Keqing: (A personal matter... involving me? Surely I haven't done anything improper recently, have I?)
Ganyu: Please, Lady Keqing? This is really important to me...
Keqing: Oh, uh, okay.
Ganyu: I noticed Cloud Retainer was here for quite a while. Did she say anything about... m—me? When I was young?
Keqing: About your childhood? No, nothing at all.
Ganyu: What? Really!? Phew!!! Thank goodness...
Ganyu: I was getting really worried... Once she gets talking to people, she tends to go off on all sorts of tangents... so I was worried she might have bored you with some stories about me, heh...
Keqing: Your name didn't even come up. So you've nothing to worry about.
Paimon: Keqing, how are you not asking a bunch of questions right now? There's obviously some juicy gossip here, aren't you curious to find out what it is?
Ganyu: Ah! P—Please, no, don't do that to me...
Keqing: Of course not. Whatever it is, I'm not curious, and I'm not going to ask.
Keqing: If Ganyu has a secret and she wishes to keep it that way, nobody should make it their business to try and get it out of her. That's just basic decency, is it not?
Paimon: Y—Yes, Ma'am... Paimon'll never bring it up again...
Ganyu: ...Keqing, I...
Ganyu: Thank you. You're so kind and considerate... I've always seen that in you.
Keqing: Wh—What's that got to do with... Honestly. Go on, you should be getting back now.
Ganyu: Oh my, you're right, I should. Okay everyone, please excuse me, I should get back to work now. Take good care of Keqing for me.
Keqing: Hey! What are you trying to say!?
Paimon: Aw, don't worry, Ganyu, we will!
Ganyu: Thanks. Hope to see you again soon.
Traveler: At the end there, she sounded like your big sister.
Keqing: Ehh... just ignore her.
Xiangling: Hey everyone! I just had an idea!
Xiangling: It only occurred to me when that adeptus showed up. Do you think the Stove God could be an adeptus too?
Paimon: Ooh! Could be!
Keqing: I don't want to assert either way... but it seems highly likely.
Xiangling: In that case, we should go ask the adepti about it. I think my master might be able to help.
Keqing: Master? You mean, your teacher is an adeptus?
Xiangling: Uh-huh, she's over at Yujing Terrace. C'mon, I'll introduce you!

## Talk 12

Xiangling: Master!
Guoba: ♪
Madame Ping: Hehe, hello Xiangling.
Paimon: Madame Ping is Xiangling's master!?
Keqing: I did not expect that...
Xiangling: Master, how are you keeping these days? Are you well?
Madame Ping: Very well, thank you. What a surprise it is that you all had the time to come and visit me today.
Traveler: Hi, Madame Ping!
Keqing: Hello.
Xiangling: Master, we came here because we have a question for you. Do you know about the Stove God?
Madame Ping: Of course I know the Stove God.
Keqing: Does this mean... you know them personally?
Madame Ping: Ah, I see... it's the Moonchase Festival, isn't it.
Madame Ping: How interesting... Haha, so, you came to hear some stories about the Stove God?
Keqing: That's right, we're investigating something that happened recently.
Madame Ping: I see... The great stone surfaces, and so you open an investigation. Hehe.
Madame Ping: I must commend your guesswork this far. I did indeed know the Stove God of whom you speak. But it was a great many years ago.
Madame Ping: Moonchase was originally a rite observed by the adepti — not something in which the ordinary people of Liyue would ever partake. But over the years they have sought to emulate it for themselves many times, giving rise to various festivals bearing the Moonchase name.
Madame Ping: On nights when the moon shone bright, everybody would get together for joyful reunions. There would be fine food, fine wines, and choice teas.
Madame Ping: Later, Rex Lapis unified all of these various festivals under the Moonchase name, to honor an old friend of his. In short, the heavens were our witness as we vowed to the moon to come together in joyful solidarity, to remember the past and reflect upon the present. That is the meaning of the Moonchase Festival.
Keqing: Rex Lapis... *sigh*
Madame Ping: Hehe... That friend made many contributions to Liyue, and Rex Lapis would not have them go unrecognized. Turning this season into a commemoration of his old friend was also a way to honor that friendship.
Madame Ping: I can only presume that the Stove God Festival was one of the many subsumed into the Moonchase Festival.
Keqing: In the hands of Rex Lapis, our nation's traditions were faithfully upheld... It is to their detriment that we must now be the ones to inherit this duty.
Traveler: Aww, Keqing...
Madame Ping: Oh, Keqing, I simply won't allow you to be so down on yourself. Nothing would delight Rex Lapis more than to know that those who follow in his footsteps continue to value these traditions and are working tirelessly to do them justice.
Keqing: ...Thank you.
Xiangsheng: Lady Keqing!
Keqing: Hmm?
Xiangsheng: Lady Keqing, Lady Ningguang wishes to speak with you.
Keqing: Ningguang's looking for me?
Keqing: Must be important... Please excuse me, everyone. If I'm not back soon, you'll find me at Ningguang's office.
Xiangling: There she goes... Keqing's a lot more serious when she's got her work face on.
Madame Ping: Do you want to know who Rex Lapis' friend was?
Paimon: Oh... Paimon does!
Traveler: The Stove God is the friend, right?
Madame Ping: Yes, precisely. There are few genuine coincidences in the world... the story of the lost festival and the old friend are indeed one and the same.
Madame Ping: The Stove God was a good friend of mine too. What a pity it is that the god is now gone both from the world and from people's memories.
Xiangling: How could that happen...
Madame Ping: It is to everyone's regret that the Stove God passed. But gods cannot be fully destroyed, and we made a pact to wait until the land became fruitful once more, for perhaps the Stove God would then return, albeit in a new form.
Xiangling: Really? ...Master, you must miss the Stove God a lot, right? From the way you talk about it all, it sounds like you were the best of friends.
Madame Ping: Yes, thinking back on it all, there are many fond memories.
Madame Ping: I'm pleasantly surprised to find that Keqing is investigating this. She is a tenacious child, and anything she sets her mind to, she will diligently pursue. It warms my heart, and makes me want to give her a helping hand.
Madame Ping: Unfortunately, however, I cannot simply give her the answer, for the process is of great importance to her.
Madame Ping: Keqing's grandfather once researched the Stove God, and now she follows in his footsteps... Since Keqing has inherited this conundrum, so too she must inherit the journey to its resolution.
Paimon: You knew Keqing's grandpa?
Madame Ping: Of course! I count all the people of Liyue among my good friends. I remember when he was the same age as Keqing is now.... Ah, so young. Hehe.
Madame Ping: Grandparent and grandchild are definitely made from the same mold. Both diligent enough to take on anything, and bold enough to see it through to the end.
Madame Ping: I like to think of Liyue as my own little potted plant. I've watched it grow and blossom, and it grows more beautiful all the time. In the blink of an eye, the buds of yesterday are in full bloom today... It's wonderful to see.
Madame Ping: For new blossoms must bloom on the branches if the tree is to remain evergreen and ever young.
Madame Ping: My dears, you are absolutely right to focus your investigation on the stone. It is, as you suppose, the lost Statue of the Stove God, and within it lie all the answers that you seek.
Madame Ping: I should like to see the stone for myself, if you would lead me to it. Perhaps the truth will emerge even as we watch on.

## Talk 13

Keqing: Ah, you're all here! I was just about to send someone to fetch you.
Madame Ping: Keqing, has the stone undergone any changes?
Keqing: A crack has appeared in one corner. But we still can't tell what's inside.
Paimon: What happened? Did someone chip it while no one else was looking?
Keqing: More likely a natural occurrence. Our weapons have had no effect on it.
Xiangling: How would a "natural occurrence" crack it open?
Madame Ping: This is because the Stove God draws power from the actions of the masses. The heat of a busy kitchen, the joy of a reunion... Haha, keep up the good work and the truth will rise to the surface soon enough.
Paimon: All the books say that the Stove God is the deity of food. So is this stone opening up because everyone's cooking for the festival?
Keqing: Statues draw power from their people... so if the Stove God has dominion over cooking, could it be that the passion people put into their cooking gives power to the Stove God?
Keqing: Ningguang and I chose "Feast of the Bounteous Land" as this year's theme, and now every chef signed up for the competition is busy preparing... Paimon's theory is not an unreasonable one.
Xiangling: Plus, a lot of families have reunion feasts around this time. With everyone back home, the whole city's bustling with people, and that adds a lot to the festive atmosphere.
Paimon: So if the stone cracked because Liyue started getting festive, that must mean that when the festive fever peaks, it'll bust right open! Right?
Xiangling: That's gotta be it! Right, Master?
Madame Ping: Hahaha, well, we'll have to see then, won't we?
Keqing: Okay. The fact that cooking is involved gives us a perfect opportunity.
Keqing: The selections phase of Masterful Chefs will be held indoors and seen by only a few people, but the finals will be held outside, in public. Everyone who wants to will be able to come and watch it. The atmosphere will be incredibly lively, no question.
Paimon: And when the finals end, boom! We'll get to see who the Stove God really is. Right?
Keqing: It's definitely a possibility.
Xiangling: Well I've already signed up, so I should be able to help!
Keqing: Yes. For a chef as accomplished as yourself, getting to the finals should be a breeze.
Paimon: All this talk of cooking competitions is making Paimon hungry... Ah, Paimon can't wait! It'd be great if Paimon could take a nap and then wake up when it's the finals!
