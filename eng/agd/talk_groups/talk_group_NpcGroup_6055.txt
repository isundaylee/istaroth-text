## Talk

Amina: Nice weather we're having, eh? Have you had a hot spring bath today?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a little about yourself...
Amina: I'm Amina, the chief of the People of the Springs.
Amina: Hey, what's with that shocked face? I'm doing my job with all seriousness, mind you!
Amina: Know this â€” seriousness is a rare virtue among us.
Amina: The other are either still bathing, or on their way to take a bath.
Amina: If you find someone lazing about without awareness of the situation, just come find me. I'll take responsibility as chief!

## Talk

Traveler: Hello there, Amina.
Amina: Hehe, here to see me, are you?
Amina: Everything's going great here. No accidents reported, and the kids have... mostly stopped throwing stones into the hot springs...
Amina: Forget it. No point dwelling on sad affairs. As my grandfather said, positivity should be our guiding star!
Amina: In truth... I've been pretty busy lately, designing a new stage, reinforcing patrols, and such.
Amina: A crazy amount of ideas have been coming to mind, to be honest. I'm just hoping Manua doesn't come up with any more!
Amina: Ah, right! While I'm sure Mualani would invite you over anyway, let me just say: Don't forget to swing by often!

## Talk

Traveler: I'll go take a dip shortly.
Amina: That's what I'm talking about!

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been lately?
Amina: Thanks for asking. With everyone's help, I'm sure it'll all start taking a turn for the better.
Amina: After the war ended, many people were gone... I just hope they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea. The more the merrier, after all!
Amina: ...Sorry, that probably sounds a bit naive. But I really believe that people from Natlan will be reunited in the Night Kingdom after they've passed.
Amina: This explains how Ancient Names are forged from the memories of heroes and passed down through the ages.

Traveler: How have you been lately?
Amina: Quite well. Thanks for asking. Thanks to everyone's hard work, this place is as busy as ever, hehe!
Amina: Many people left us when all was said and done... I just hope they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea. The more the merrier, after all!
Amina: ...Sorry, that probably sounds a bit naive. But I really believe that we, the people of Natlan, will be reunited in the Night Kingdom after our passing.
Amina: That's how Ancient Names are forged from the memories of heroes and passed down through the ages.

## Talk

Traveler: Reliable indeed.
Amina: And I'm not just bragging, y'hear? If you come up with any comments or suggestions while having fun here in our land, feel free to tell me any time.
Amina: Who knows? We might have already exactly what you're looking for by the time you come back around.
Amina: By the way, do take these souvenirs with you as mementos of your time here.
