Traveler: And you are...
Sheikh Zubayr: I'm a playwright and manager. I run the Zubayr Theater in this tree hollow.
Sheikh Zubayr: In addition, I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction.
Sheikh Zubayr: It's a small troupe. Pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats.
Sheikh Zubayr: So if it isn't about anything important, I'll have to ask that you not bother the staff here, including myself.

Traveler: About Kourosh...
Sheikh Zubayr: Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than Swoof's.
Sheikh Zubayr: His only strength is his determination. To this day, he still hasn't given up his job as an actor.
Sheikh Zubayr: I'm a person with high standards, but I don't give up on persistent students. As long as he can still accept criticism, I'll continue to instruct him.
Sheikh Zubayr: After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as Nilou.
Sheikh Zubayr: Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...

Traveler: How have things been going for you recently?
Sheikh Zubayr: Well, quite the same as always. I am the resident playwright and manager, and so I am... managing, haha!
Sheikh Zubayr: We are a rather small troupe, so pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats. I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction on the side.
Sheikh Zubayr: However, we have had new joiners recently, which has given me some time to focus on something... And of course, one can't complain about the added bustle.

Traveler: How are Nilou and Inayah doing?
Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou is teaching her to dance as we speak. However, I must say that it hasn't been easy. Dance is something that is best learned from young, I fear.
Sheikh Zubayr: Still, Inayah works so hard. Beyond the tasks that Nilou sets her, she trains independently as well.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daresay that with her current progress, she may be good enough to take the stage in but a few years.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daren't imagine, however, how many times longer that period would have been without the tutelage of someone as gifted and patient as Nilou.
