## An Appellative Stroke

The brush with which you may bestow a new name upon a certain person.
Once the new name has been given, it cannot be changed.

## Reaffirmed Accord of Appellation

Just like when you first met and tied a scarf around his tail, now give him a new "name."
After giving him a new name, it cannot be changed again.
