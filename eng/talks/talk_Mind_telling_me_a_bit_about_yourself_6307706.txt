Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Obata: This island is my hometown. My whole family has been fishermen for generations. Naturally, I am a fisherman myself as well.
Obata: Due to the Sakoku Decree limiting our ability to go out to sea, we fishermen temporarily became a rare sight indeed...
Obata: But those problems are all in the past now! The Sakoku Decree's gone for good â€” not only have the restrictions on fishing been lifted, but our Ritou clientele's grown, too!
Obata: It's time! I shall once again answer the call of the ocean, hahaha!
