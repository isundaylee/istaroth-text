Traveler: How do you like it here?
Xianyun: It brims with adeptal energy, the views are expansive... Yes, it is most to one's liking.
Xianyun: Speaking of adeptal energy... mortals cannot wield the power of Sub-Space Creation with which this abode was made. Whence did you procure this treasure?
Traveler: It was a gift from Madame Ping.
Xianyun: Ah, I see.
Xianyun: Streetward Rambler has always been fond of natural scenery, and often laments its transient nature, for the most pleasant sights tend to disappear with the change of seasons...
Xianyun: Small wonder, then, that she utilized the power of Sub-Space Creation to preserve her favorite sights within this teapot.
Xianyun: Yet it is you, through your furnishing endeavors, who have transformed this sub-space into the most homely of lodgings.
Xianyun: The next time one feels reticent to seek sustenance in the outdoors... perhaps one shall invite oneself over for dinner.
Traveler: You're always welcome.
Xianyun: Oh? You accept the idea with such alacrity...
Xianyun: Then it is settled. One looks forward to your cooking.
Traveler: I'm not always in the mood to cook...
Xianyun: Well then, since one presumed to issue one's own invitation, you may leave the cooking to one's new and improved Supreme Cuisine Machine.
Xianyun: We can eat anything that you desire. Whatever your imagination can conjure, one's machine can surely cook.
