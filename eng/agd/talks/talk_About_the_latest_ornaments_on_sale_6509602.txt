Traveler: About the latest ornaments on sale...
Chesil: That's got to be the Wings of Oscillation.
Chesil: They are modeled after the slim wings of Crystalflies. The metallurgical process used to make them is quite unique, and they are encrusted with dazzling gems...
Chesil: They say that even the gentlest breeze will cause them to flap like real Crystalfly wings. To say that the Wings of Oscillation have taken high-class society by storm would be an understatement!
Chesil: But though everyone loves chasing fads, I'd say that ornaments should be chosen according to their ability to bring out our unique characters.
