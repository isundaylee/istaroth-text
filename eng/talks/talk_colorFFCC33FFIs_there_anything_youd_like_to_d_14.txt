Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Noelle: Huh? You're asking me...?
Noelle: I... I want to take your measurements and make an outfit for you.
Traveler: Where has that idea come from?
Noelle: If you wore clothes that I made for you...
Noelle: It'd most certainly be a wonderfully momentous occasion...
Traveler: Well, if you insist... Much obliged!
Noelle: Okay... Alright then...
Noelle: Excellent! Time to get busy-busy again!
Noelle: Only, this must be the happiest kind of busy in all of Teyvat.
Traveler: I'll be sure to get you something in return.
Traveler: So you even know how to sew, too?
Noelle: Oh, of course... They... don't call me the, uh, "Wondermaid" for nothing...
