Traveler: Is something troubling you?
Michelle: Yes, actually, but it isn't a serious matter... Well, do you know about Philanemo Mushrooms?
Michelle: These mushrooms just spring up all over the windmill when we're not looking. I've cleaned a portion of it, but there are just too many.
Michelle: I'm racking my brains as to how to go about cleaning at the moment. If you could take a few with you, that would be great.
