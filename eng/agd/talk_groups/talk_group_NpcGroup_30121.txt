Yun Jin: #Oh, Traveler! I didn't expect to run into you in Qingce Village, of all places.
Traveler: I was a little worried when I couldn't find you in the city...
Yun Jin: Thanks for your concern. I'm touched.
Yun Jin: A few days ago, Granny Ruoxin invited me to come out here and give a performance. It's mostly old folks and children who live out this way, so I didn't know whether it would be to their tastes. But everyone seemed to enjoy it, so I'm very proud of myself.
Traveler: How do you know Granny Ruoxin?
Yun Jin: She was a famous opera singer in her youth, too. She's still got it, if you ask me.
Yun Jin: In show business, while you're onstage, you constantly have to be in control of everything you're doing to manage your image. So when you're offstage, it's a relief to finally loosen up a little.
Yun Jin: I have some excellent tea here. Would you care to stay for some refreshments before you depart?
Yun Jin: Watching the Xiao Lanterns from the village is quite a unique experience in its own right. If you'd like, I can tell you all about it.
Traveler: How have you been lately?
