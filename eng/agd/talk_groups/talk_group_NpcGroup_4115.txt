Xiaodong: How come it's still not here after all this time...?

Traveler: What are you waiting for?
Xiaodong: Cargo I ordered.
Xiaodong: The tea and ore I brought are all sold out. I'm just waiting to load the blankets and spices from Sumeru so I can get back to Liyue Harbor.
Xiaodong: It's just those spices I ordered a long while ago that still haven't showed up...
Xiaodong: My contact could only say they're on the road. I think he's just trying to stall me.
Xiaodong: It's better to wait at the dock myself.

Traveler: See you.
Xiaodong: Yeah, hope I'll get my shipment soon.

Traveler: Good luck to you.
Xiaodong: Thanks, hope it'll work out as we expect.
Xiaodong: I've got some leftover materials after my last deal. Not that they're of poor quality, they're just a few extra pieces. You can take them if you don't mind.
