# Lost in the Woods


## Talk 1

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rawr!
Paimon: #Hmm, {TMPVALUE(TMP_VALUE_KEY_TYPE_LITTLE_DRILL_TMP_NAME)} isn't a bad name either... and it's a name Paimon came up with too, right?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey, hey, big guy... You okay? Can you stand?
Paimon: Oh no, it looks really weak. Ugh, seriously! Those floaty ghostly dogs are always up to no good... In fact, make that all things floaty!
Traveler: You're fairly floaty, as floaty things go...
Paimon: Paimon's nothing like those guys!
Paimon: Anyway, forget that for now. Let's see if we can get this guy something to eat, and then... We'll let it rest for a while.
Paimon: It'll be feeling better soon, Paimon's sure of it!
Traveler: It's too late...
Paimon: No...
Big Guy?: ...*heavy breathing*
Paimon: #Oh no. It must be in so much pain, Traveler...
Traveler: We've defeated your foes.
Big Guy?: ...*heavy breathing*
Traveler: Is... there something else that's on your mind?
Traveler: Is there... Something you'd like to tell me?
Black Screen Text: Stretch... out your hand... Chosen of... Dragons... Reach out to me...
Black Screen Text: Join... strengths, and then... Witness all... and thus, liberate all...
Paimon: #What's going on, Traveler? This is no time to zone out!
Traveler: It's nothing. Just a bit of a daze...
Big Guy?: ...
Big Guy?: ...Hrooo... Rrooo...
Traveler: Is that your desire, or...?
Traveler: (Reach out to the dying beast...)
Paimon: What are you doing... Err...
Paimon: #Traveler, you...!
Traveler: You can rest now, big guy. You did good.
Traveler: It's been holding out for far too long...

## Talk 3

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Ehrr... Rawr!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let's go with that!
Paimon: Alright, hehe!

## Talk 5

Paimon: #Then let's call this little fella {TMPVALUE(TMP_VALUE_KEY_TYPE_LITTLE_DRILL_TMP_NAME)}, shall we?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Let me think about this some more...
Paimon: Alright. Names are important, after all, so give it all the thought you need!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ah... Are you alright there, little guy?
Little Guy?: Rawr...
Paimon: Whâ€”What's wrong? You don't look so good. Is it your tail? Did you injure it when you fell from that barrier?
Little Guy?: Rawr...
Traveler: If only we could bandage it...
Paimon: Hehe, it's Paimon's time to shine! Your backpack's so full that even when it's an emergency, it still takes all day to find anything.
Paimon: Let's use this scarf from Paimon's Emergency Backpack instead!
Traveler: I have no clue where that backpack of yours is even supposed to be...
Paimon: Hmph! Somewhere secret, somewhere safe, of course...
Paimon: Anyway, do you wanna use the scarf or not?
Traveler: We'll use it. Thank you kindly, Paimon.
Little Guy?: Errr?
Paimon: Alright, little guy, don't move...
Paimon: #Hehe. Our little guy sure is well behaved, eh, Traveler?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rawr!
Traveler: That should do the trick.
Paimon: Alright. Feel better now?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Roar...
Paimon: Hehe, looks way better now. That's a relief... Still, how did you end up in that barrier? And those Rifthounds...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Errr?
Paimon: So you don't know either, huh. Now, we don't really get what you're saying... But now that we've rescued you, you can go home.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Ehrrr?
Paimon: Wait, do you not know where your home is?
Paimon: What about relatives, then? ...Oh, wait... That big guy from earlier...
Paimon: #What do we do, Traveler? We can't just leave it here all by itself, right?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Wrroh...
Traveler: It might be better if you stay with us for a while...
Paimon: Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe we'll find this little guy's family when we reach Natlan... But we've never seen anything like it...
Traveler: Ah. "Chosen of... Dragons..." Could that mean...?
Paimon: Huh. You mean you heard something like that?
Paimon: Now that Paimon thinks about it, Natlan is the "nation of dragons"... So, does that mean that... wait, they call little guys like this 'Saurians' around here, right?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rawoo...
Paimon: Come to think of it, Paimon does see some resemblance to vishaps. Y'know... Two legs, one tail, and all.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rraaa?
Traveler: We're happy to have it travel with us...
Traveler: But we should ask our friend here if that's what it wants to do first.
Paimon: True, true. Hey there, little guy. Would you like to travel with us?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): ...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rrawr!
Paimon: #Hehe! Looks like we're all agreed then. Anyway, Paimon's Paimon, and he's Traveler!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Wrraa? Rawr...
Paimon: Oh, yeah, you need a name too... Let Paimon think. Right! Since you're yellow and brown all over, let's call you "Hash Brown"!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Hash Brown?): Rroooo... Rraaaa...
Traveler: I suspect that would only go down well at Good Hunter...
Paimon: You mean people wouldn't like it anywhere else?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rroo...
Paimon: #Would you like Traveler to give you a name, then? Well... not that Paimon can vouch for his naming sense, though.
Traveler: All the names I've come up with so far have been perfectly normal, I'll have you know.
Traveler: Poor little thing... to suffer such a calamitous fate.
Traveler: Looks like it doesn't like that name...

## Talk 8

Paimon: So, what should we call this little guy?

## Talk 9

Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. That'll be your name from now on, little guy!
Traveler: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ...Rawr!
Paimon: #Looks like our little friend loves this name! Well, with any luck, we'll solve the mystery that surrounds you while we're in Natlan... Ah, and maybe we'll get some clues as to why Traveler was able to suddenly enter that Saurian's body...
Paimon: #Oh yeah, are you okay, by the way, Traveler? You suddenly turned into a Saurian back there... Are you feeling uncomfortable in any way?
Traveler: Oh, just a little Saurian-sick.
Paimon: What's that even supposed to mean!? This isn't the time for jokes!
Paimon: #Still, Traveler, Paimon's never heard of anyone in Natlan who can turn into a Saurian... This is kinda weird.
Paimon: Seriously, we only just got here, and it feels like so much has already happened... Anyway, how do we get outta here?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Hmm? You know where the exit is?
Traveler: Becoming a Saurian for a bit was alright.
Paimon: Well, it'd best stay that way! Things could go south real fast if some day you were to turn into a Saurian and be unable to transform back...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey, hey! Don't just suddenly go running off like that...

## Talk 11

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} (Little Guy?): Rawr...
Paimon: #Hmm, this name feels like it's piling the pressure on... Let's go with something else, Traveler!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Ah, we're back here... Strange... the shining pillars from before are gone!
Paimon: #Hmm... Paimon's heard that there's a place called the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, and it's a major hub in Natlan. Maybe someone there might know what's happened to {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Paimon: Let's head there if we get the chance, shall we?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
