Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Chisseray: I was. But since quitting Bossuet's team, I'm an honorary researcher at best. Of course, that means I rank below you, as you're an Honorary Senior Researcher.
Chisseray: Anyway, I don't do that now. I just help Mr. Raimondo by organizing files and documents.
Chisseray: Looking back, I should have quit way earlier and let that old fool Bossuet write his own boring papers... It's the only thing he's good for anyway.
