# Another Home There May Yet Be


## Talk 1

Nahida: They've been here for a very long time...
Nahida: I really want to do something for them so that they'll have a chance to meet again...
Paimon: Yeah, and apart from these two Fungi, Paimon's also a little worried about the Floating Anemo Fungus's camp.
Nahida: Mm-hmm. I feel the same.
Nahida: I have an idea. Why don't we bring them over to live with the other Fungi?
Nahida: Both sides have previously lived in the presence of an elemental life-form, so their habits should be similar.
Paimon: Yeah, so they can look out for each other!
Nahida: Would you like to come with us?
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...?
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Paimon: Looks like it's been convinced.
Nahida: Okay, let's go.

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: After arriving at the camp, the two Fungi receive a warm welcome.
Paimon: Ooh, seems like the Fungi here recognize us. They're so friendly and gentle.
Nahida: That elemental life-form must've been held in high regard by everyone living here.
Paimon: Huh? Are you trying to play with Paimon?
Floating Anemo Fungus: ♩~♩~
Paimon: #Well, okay then! Traveler, Paimon'll be over there playing with the Fungi!
Traveler: Off you go.
Nahida: I owe you an apology. When the Fire Seed shattered while we were inside Apep... I had planned to sacrifice my power.
Nahida: Did Paimon tell you that?
Traveler: Yeah, and I was a little worried.
Nahida: I wasn't calm enough. I should've given it some more thought and made a better judgment of the situation.
Nahida: When I realized that the Dendro Dragon was in danger and that Sumeru's safety was being threatened, I couldn't help feeling anxious and scared.
Nahida: If I decided not to take action when things can still be done, or if time ran out before I've used up all my energy...
Nahida: Using my powers may be the easiest way out, but it's also the most difficult.
Traveler: You still have room for "growth."
Nahida: Yes, and I think I learned a lot from them.
Nahida: I understand what it means to have their wishes come true, but I'm still unable to accept it.
Nahida: Why did it sound so peacefully content when it was doing something that just... makes you want to cry?
Nahida: Looks like I still haven't fully grasped the concept of "empathy" yet...
Traveler: This isn't your fault.
Nahida: Thank you for comforting me...
Nahida: Feelings are really complex things, and there is still a lot for me to learn.
Nahida: Huh?
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~♪~
Nahida: They're even taking care of the crops... Are they simply mirroring the elemental life-forms' behaviors?
Nahida: But since that Fungus even learned to speak, all of this might be due to the long-term effects of elemental power.
Traveler: Time is a powerful thing.
Nahida: That's right. And now, we don't have to worry about the safety of these two Fungi anymore.
Nahida: From now on, I'll be keeping an eye on this Fungi camp and come check on them once in a while.
Nahida: I want to preserve the traces they left behind in order to create an opportunity for them to meet in the future.
Nahida: After all, that Fungus remembered the name "Nur." Its memories came back.
Traveler: I believe in their bonds as a family.
Nahida: Mm. Let's think of it as a beautiful wish then.
Paimon: Nahida, the Fungi brought over some fruit! Come and have some!
Nahida: Okay, I'm coming!
Traveler: I believe in miracles.
Traveler: I feel the same.
Traveler: Yeah, and I was a little angry.
Traveler: Have fun.
