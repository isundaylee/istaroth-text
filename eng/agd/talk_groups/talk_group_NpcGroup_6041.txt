Agemo: Hello! There aren't any matches on right now, so if you're looking for takeout, you'll have to go find Mr. Cipac. I just take care of deliveries.

Traveler: So you're the take-out person?
Agemo: Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm only on duty when there are matches taking place in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.
Agemo: Some spectators wear themselves out with all that cheering, jeering, and jumping around, so it's only natural they start wishing they had something to eat or drink.
Agemo: That's where I come in, moving around the stands, taking orders, then running off to buy and deliver their stuff.
Agemo: The spectators don't need to pay me any extra — Mr. Cipac pays me a regular wage.
Agemo: And when there aren't any matches on, like now, I get to rest.

Traveler: Sounds like a lot of strenuous physical labor.
Agemo: Exactly! It's a race against time, day in and day out, to keep the food from going cold and soft.
Agemo: Fortunately, I'm good with directions — never missed a delivery, ever!
