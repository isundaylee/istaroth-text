Yiqing: Guess I'll have to try a new prescription...

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Yiqing: I'm the physician in this area. Come find me anytime if you're feeling unwell.
Yiqing: You're young and full of fire, and ironically, that makes you more susceptible to illnesses in these mountains.

Traveler: Why are you trying new prescriptions?
Yiqing: There are no panaceas, so a good physician must find the right medicine to treat each patient's symptoms.
Yiqing: If the illness is complex, then we'll have to dig deep to find the ultimate prescription.
Yiqing: Well, all that assumes the physician has seen enough to be familiar with lots of different medicines, of course...
Yiqing: To master the effects of different prescriptions, I have to keep trying and learn from my mistakes.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yiqing: Work out regularly, and keep a balanced diet.

Traveler: Heatiness?
Yiqing: Heatiness is the root of all evil inside the body, and young people are especially prone to it, for their bodies are easily excited.
Yiqing: I have a few herbs to help quench the flames and vent the heat. Most effective when taken with herbal tea. Please help yourselves.
