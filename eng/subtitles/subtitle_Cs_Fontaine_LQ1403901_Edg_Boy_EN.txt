The accord is the basis of perfume-making
The product in its most primitive form
Ambergris mixed with cedarwood
Rounded out with a base note of agarwood...
...This is... the scent of leather?
Exactly. We're unable to extract essential oils from leather
But by combining other raw materials, we can recreate its essence
That is the purpose of an accord
Does that mean, you can recreate any scent in the whole world?
Haha, I'm afraid not
Certain fragrances in this world
Are simply one of a kind
That quality is what draws people in
And fuels their obsessions...
If I wear "Auguste" to the ball, I'll also be "one of a kind"!
Our competitor already got their hands on it? We're falling behind!
It doesn't matter how much it costs. I have to buy something better!
Perfume is all anyone's talking about. I have to buy some soon...
Who cares about the message? Fork over the Mora and it's yours, am I right?
This fragrance... will be "one of a kind" no more
"Myths" can be deconstructed
"Miracles" can be recreated
All it takes is skill, experience
Limitless exploration, and a little patience
...The only thing left is determining where the real "Auguste" is hidden
...Pretending to be attacked means he's not free to move around
"Auguste" must be hidden within reach...
...Paimon took a peek through the window earlier
And his house was packed with flowers...
The curator commissioned a flower pot from Kshahrewar
Capable of retaining heat and moisture...
...Perfumes are as beautiful as flowers, and equally as delicate
When stored
You must take care to control the temperature
And keep them away from direct sunlight...
Did you get all that, Emilie?
...Mhm, I got it
Did you hear? Someone was attacked again last night!
So... Sylvain is dead, is that right?
...Yes, Master
