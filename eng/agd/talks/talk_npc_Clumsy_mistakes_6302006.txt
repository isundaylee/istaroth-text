Traveler: Clumsy mistakes?
Uesugi: Well, it's all thanks to that Arataki Itto.
Uesugi: While the Vision Hunt Decree was in effect, he was defeated by Madam Kujou Sara. He has been conjuring up a plan to take his revenge since then.
Uesugi: Madam Kujou Sara saw he was very serious about the revenge, and that his fighting spirit was commendable. So they picked a day for another duel.
Uesugi: ...Somehow, Arataki Itto insisted that, due to some weird Oni rules, the rematch must be a sumo showdown at the crossroads...
Uesugi: That's just too weird! I mean, it's basically harassment against Madam Sara, right?
Uesugi: Anyway, the duel didn't happen in the end. Arataki was dragged away by some masked lady... I just hope that Madam Sara won't be affected by this...
