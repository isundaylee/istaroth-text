# Heart of the Dice

Fein: What's the point of having so many variations of the same tabletop game...
Fein: Ah, Traveler! Maybe give me a little warning next time? Are you here for the King of Invokations Grand Prix too?
Traveler: What are you up to?
Fein: Oh, this is a game designed by an adventurer from the Guild. They say it's an... innovative tabletop game that combines Genius Invokation TCG and combat. It's called "Heart of the Dice."
Fein: Since we're involved in organizing the King of Invokations Grand Prix, the Guild decided to host a minigame inspired by the adventurer's design.
Traveler: How do you combine card games and combat?
Fein: Hahaha, to be honest, I don't really understand either. There's a rulebook here though... Just look at how thick it is.
Fein: If I'm not mistaken, the core gameplay mechanism of Heart of the Dice would be... strategically using your dice.
Fein: Anyway, if you're interested, please have a go at it.
Traveler: That's a very unexpected combination...
Traveler: What tabletop game?
