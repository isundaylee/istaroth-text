Beidou: There's a lot of stories about me floating around in Liyue, but I guess the most well-known is the one about me defeating Haishan.
Beidou: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I went into that fight with a huge ego. I thought I'd seen it all and wanted to show people that I could take on the world... Little did I know it would very nearly cost me my life.
Beidou: Ultimately, I still dealt the final blow. But in the end, what got me through it wasn't my arrogant desire to prove myself. It was the fact that I had a whole crew behind me that I cared about a lot.
