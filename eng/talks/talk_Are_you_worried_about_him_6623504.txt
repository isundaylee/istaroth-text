Traveler: Are you worried about him?
Copa: ...Yeah. But some might consider my concern one-sided.
Copa: On the one hand, I hope he doesn't give up on flying tests so easily. After all, he's still young, and it's not as if he's talentless.
Copa: But on the other hand, I don't want him to waste too much time failing and hope he can find a career for himself soon that will bring him a sense of both satisfaction and achievement.
Copa: You see, not even I can wrap my head around such life choices. If I ever figure it out, I'll go give him some guidance.
