Ajilenakh Dash: What!? What's going on!? How could they have defeated all my Fungi in just the blink of an eye!? What am I gonna tell the others...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Ajilenakh Dash: Huh? What are you two doing here? Are you here to mock me!?
Ajilenakh Dash: Don't celebrate just yet! I'll win it all back next time!
Paimon: Next time? Paimon thought we only had one shot in the preliminaries?
Traveler: Maybe she meant the next season.
Paimon: Yeah, that's a good thing. No need to take a single loss too hard!
Paimon: Anyway, strange Ajilenakh Nut girl, Paimon is looking forward to our next fight!
Ajilenakh Dash: Hmph, I'll be the one to comfort you guys next time!
Ajilenakh Dash: And if you guys aren't too mean about it, I might even consider sharing a few Candied Ajilenakh Nuts with you to make you feel better.
Traveler: She's still got some fight in her.
Traveler: Haha, we won!
Paimon: Yeah! Golden Comet and Silver Companion won!
Ajilenakh Dash: Erm... The Fungi react to each other's skills. I may have been careless and forgotten about that.
Ajilenakh Dash: It's dangerous to charge in without a plan. I'll keep that in mind from now on!
Ajilenakh Dash: Whatever the case, my companions and I will make adjustments to our strategy and definitely beat you next time!
Paimon: Hmm? You're speaking as if we're gonna go up against each other again...
Traveler: The competition will probably have more than one season.
Paimon: Hmm, that makes sense. Hopefully, she'll be as passionate as she is now in the next season.
Traveler: Don't feel too sad about it...
Ajilenakh Dash: Iâ€”I'm not sad! You just wait! I'll win it all back!
