Traveler: What are you doing?
Norma: Oh, I was just on my way to buy some food.
Norma: Not groceries, though... I was going to get some restaurant takeout and bring it home with me. My husband has long since grown tired of my cooking...
Norma: You're a traveler? How delightful...
Norma: I've heard that over in Liyue they have such a wide variety of different dishes that they've had to split it into several different cuisines...
Norma: I would love to visit if I ever had the chance.
