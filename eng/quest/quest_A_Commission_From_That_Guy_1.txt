# A Commission From "That Guy"


## Talk 1

Vile: Why, we meet again. How do you fare?
Vile: Oh, yes, and one thing. Thus far, Jilliana has neither done too well nor too poorly. The good news is that she has yet to leave Mondstadt...
Vile: But the bad news is that she has already confessed her situation to Sister Victoria, who hasn't done much about it so far.
Vile: We can only wait and see how this whole affair will end.
Traveler: ...What are you planning?
Vile: Oh, come now. Don't look at me like that. I'm not some sort of villain. As a matter of fact, am I not giving you pointers on how to help her?
Vile: Right, let's get down to business. The reason I'm here are the "loose ends" we left behind from that previous incident.
Vile: Simply put, you defeated the Treasure Hoarders, yes. But at the same time, you've also blown Jilliana's cover.
Vile: The Treasure Hoarders are not lenient to traitors. As far as I know, we've already caught wind of quite a few of their tracks, and we've never seen any of this lot before.
Vile: Chances are that they're out to get Jilliana, and also to avenge their losses in the meantime. At this moment, we can only ask you to beat them back.
Traveler: Isn't this all your doing?
Vile: Oh, please, I too have my orders. If it wasn't for that gentleman's insistence that you be the one to handle this, I wouldn't have come looking for you.
Vile: Don't worry, I have ensured that the rewards this time will be substantial.
Vile: This time, our dear gentleman has furnished me with ample Mora, unlike the previous time, when I had to pay you out of pocket... Ah yes, I should also mark the location of those Treasure Hoarders on your map.
Vile: Well, then. If for nothing else, please protect Jilliana, Rudolf, Lily, and Mondstadt for the Mora. It's all up you now, so do your best.
Traveler: Go do it yourself!
Vile: Don't say that. You know I don't have your strength.
Traveler: This is a matter for the Knights.
Vile: While that is true, that certain gentleman judges that under the present circumstances, the fewer people know of Jilliana's affairs the better.
Vile: Besides, that gentleman does not wish for the Knights to get involved. After all, the Knights are too used to acting in the open, and often go overboard in the process.
Vile: Take our ever-reliable Huffman, for example. Why, if he were to hear that there were Treasure Hoarders abroad near Mondstadt, he would raise the alarm within the hour.
Vile: And should the Knights march out in full muster, the Treasure Hoarders would surely scurry off in a flash, rendering our plan to get rid of them for good moot once again.
Vile: So, we ask you to fly solo and take them out efficiently, only because we must.

## Talk 2

Vile: You're back already? Why, aren't you efficient? I think I know why that gentleman likes you so much.
Traveler: The money. Give it here.
Vile: How cold. I mean, I do have the bounty right here. But pray, spare a thought for a fellow errand-runner's feelings!
Traveler: Why, it's an honor.
Vile: Oh no, the honor is all mine. Please take this reward... And pleasure doing business with you.

## Talk 3

Huffman: That's right, you'd better keep hiding, you thieves, 'cause if I ever find out where you're hiding... Where are you all hiding, anyway?
Traveler: I know where they're hiding.
Huffman: You? How do youâ€” Huh. The markings on this map are very detailed... Who did you get them from? Vile? To think she'd be...
Huffman: ...This is nowhere near the location we'd established previously. Just what is the goal of these Treasure Hoarders...
Huffman: I'm sorry, please let me mark these down... Alright, I've got it. I will get people to verify these locations immediately, and once we have verified them, we will go and repel these Treasure Hoarders.
Huffman: You have my thanks, once again, for your contributions to Mondstadt. This time, we won't let a single Treasure Hoarder get away!

## Talk 4

Vile: You're back already? Why, aren't you efficient? I think I know why that gentleman likes to leave matters in your hands.
Traveler: I left it to the Knights of Favonius.
Vile: You left it to the Knights of Favonius... Hey, didn't I just say that leaving it to them might be troublesome?
Vile: Well, you sure know how to skive. Fortunately, that gentleman expected that you might do this, so I had a backup plan prepared.
Vile: Well, don't worry about the rest. *sigh* Guess it's time to run some errands...
Vile: But according to that gentleman, your actions may yet lead us in interesting directions.
Vile: After all, it would have been too obvious a move for me to report the Treasure Hoarders' movements myself, and that gentleman can't exactly approach the Knights directly either...
Vile: Well, these are for you. Take them. What did that gentleman call it? A small reward for "changing the course of the wind."

## Talk 5

Vile: Still preparing? That's fine. Just head out once you're ready.
Traveler: Who's this gentleman, anyway?
Vile: I won't tell you no matter how you ask. That's par for course in our line of work.
Vile: Even when we do reveal any intelligence, we do so because we must.
Vile: Well, you can give this a thought: which of the things I just said falls under "things I revealed because I must"?
Traveler: What's your goal?
Vile: That gentleman's goals... I couldn't guess them. But I believe that he also means to protect Mondstadt.
Vile: Or should I say that even he probably wouldn't do things like this just for the fun of it?
Vile: Hmm, no, no, I shouldn't be speculating about such things...

## Talk 6

Jilliana: What... What can I do for you?
Jilliana: I'm still waiting for Sister Victoria to give me her reply.
Jilliana: This incident... I'm prepared for the consequences, no matter what they may be.
