## Talk

Mika: #Hello, Traveler.
Mika: You know, I feel livelier after hearing your voice... Hehe!

## Talk

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Mika: Yes, I love it!
Mika: This place is amazing, beautiful, and peaceful... There's so many wonderful things I've never seen before.
Mika: I doubt there's any other place in Teyvat that can compare to this.
Mika: Even if you just give me a tiny tent, I'll still be super comfortable here.
Mika: Oh, but... if I'm gonna be camping outside, I'll have to trouble you for some firewood to make a campfire...
Traveler: No need for that — it's temperate here year-round!
Mika: Th—Thank you... I hope me being here isn't too much of an imposition...
Mika: Um... If there's anything I can help with around here, please do let me know!
Mika: I used to spend a lot of time cleaning and tidying the house and yard. That was a while ago, but I'm probably still okay at it...
Traveler: You're my guest, Mika.
Mika: Aw... That's extremely kind of you... Thank you ever so much!
Mika: Uh, I guess I should stop with all the formalities before I ruin the mood...
Mika: Alright, I'll make myself at home, then. I want to do a detailed survey of this place... I'll do my best to understand your design philosophy!
Mika: That way, I can help you out if you ever need it.
Traveler: All a guest needs to do is make themselves at home.
Traveler: Of course I'd get you what you need!

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mika: Of course!
Mika: It's rare to have time alone with you... I have so many things I want to ask you about.
Mika: For instance, your mastery of the sword allows you to defeat strong opponents that are even beyond the reach of arrows.
Mika: Distance and firing range are never a problem to you... How do you manage it?
Traveler: I can show you on the field someday.
Mika: Okay, sure... Since we'll be traveling together, watching you fight will definitely be the best way for me to learn.
Mika: Um, anyway, let's move on to a lighter topic... What kind of story do you want to hear?
Traveler: Anything you'd like to share.
Mika: Um... Let me think... Ah, here's an interesting one about the Reconnaissance Company.
Mika: When I first started, we'd pluck the petals off a Sweet Flower to decide who was on cooking duty after work.
Mika: Some of us weren't that good at cooking, but no one ever complained. We'd just polish off everything and then give constructive criticism.
Mika: With everyone's feedback and a period of trial and error, everyone's culinary skills significantly improved.
Mika: Obviously, our cooking can't compare to what you'd find at restaurants in the city, but they're pretty delicious as field rations go.
Traveler: Why don't we try that method as well?
Mika: Good idea! It introduces an element of surprise, too...
Mika: Hehe, I'm already looking forward to our next meal... I'll go and collect some Sweet Flowers!
Traveler: It would be an interesting way to choose the chef of the day.
Traveler: But for now, I want to hear your stories.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Mika: Mmm... Let me think...
Mika: When the finch adeptus invited me over for some tea, she told me that you can use your willpower to change the topography here.
Mika: If you don't mind... could you find an open place and form one or two mountains there?
Mika: It doesn't matter what they look like — as long as it's something that you'd find difficult to climb. The craggier, the better.
Mika: But if that would take too much time and effort, just scrap the idea...
Traveler: You mean... you want to go on a hike?
Mika: Yes! I'm so grateful for the delicious food and the cozy accommodation you've provided, but I fear that I'll get out of shape if I'm too comfortable for too long...
Mika: I still have a long way to go before I can become a well-seasoned surveyor. I can't get complacent.
Mika: Besides, understanding the landforms you create will allow me to see what kind of terrain might pose a challenge to you, so I can prepare a plan accordingly.
Mika: This way, I'll soon be of some help!
Traveler: I'll give it a go when the time comes.
Mika: Great! Thank you.
Mika: Hearing that makes me really motivated!
Traveler: Let's challenge the most perilous of terrain together!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Mika.
Mika: #Good morning, Traveler!
Mika: Have you had breakfast? If not, may I use your kitchen? I won't be long!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Mika.
Mika: It's bedtime already? You have a really healthy routine...
Mika: I should take a leaf out of your book... Anyway, sleep tight!

## Talk

Mika: Ah! Something about this place feels familiar...
Mika: This campsite's layout is similar to the example provided in the first version of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Manual...
Mika: You're amazing! How did you manage to remember all these little details...? I'm just in awe!

## Talk

Mika: What a spacious kitchen! With all this equipment, we could provide enough marching rations for an entire company!
Mika: Being here reminds me of the gatherings I had with my teammates.
Mika: Although I can't drink with everyone, I'm happy just to be part of the conversation.
