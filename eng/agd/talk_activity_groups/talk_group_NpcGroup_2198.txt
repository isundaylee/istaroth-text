## Talk

Tu: If this place does indeed become a market, then we should establish connections with the Feiyun Commerce Guild as soon as possible.

## Talk

Traveler: Market?
Tu: That's right, I've heard people say that The Chasm is about to be bought over by the Yanshang Teahouse and turned into a grand market.
Tu: I'm not overstating things, either. A couple of days earlier, I came across some people from Yanshang Teahouse who'd come looking for Muning the manager.
Tu: So, just by chance, I heard them discussing some kind of monetary transaction.
Tu: How did it go again...? Let me think.
Tu: "Thanks to the second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, I was able to raise this sum of Mora. And I would also like to thank you representatives of the Yanshang Teahouse for making a trip down to this quiet spot specifically."
Tu: I mean, just listen to that. They must mean that Muning's been in contact with Yanshang Teahouse to liven this place up in collaboration with the Feiyun Commerce Guild, am I right?

## Talk

Traveler: Feiyun Commerce Guild?
Tu: Exactly! I've heard that they usually deal in silks and satins, but I didn't expect them to also want in on that Chasm Mora as well.
Tu: Also, I never expected Muning to have monetary connections to the Feiyun Commerce Guild. This is a great opportunity!
Tu: So, uh... could you tell me a bit about the details behind their development plans?

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Tu: Oh... Alright then, I'll ponder this a bit longer.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't think that's how things are.
Tu: Oh, come on. These business discussions aren't what they seem on the surface. Much thought is needed to decipher their plots and plans!
Tu: I'll ponder this a while longer. I won't let this opportunity slip by.

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you asking me?
Tu: Well, that's because you've contributed so much to resolving the situation down below! I'm sure they'll tell you everything.
Tu: If even you've never heard a peep about this, then surely there is some super-secret plan at play. That means that it's all the more imperative that I do not miss a thing!
