Traveler: How do you like it here?
Tighnari: Hmm, this place has a peaceful environment and a wonderful view. Very pleasant.
Tighnari: ...Perhaps a little too pleasant.
Tighnari: Look, I've already mapped out an itinerary of my stay.
Traveler: You're planning on doing some forest-watching here?
Tighnari: Haha, that would be going too far. This place was constructed by magic, right? I don't sense any dangers.
Tighnari: And I'm guessing that the only ones who can get in here are those you have specifically invited.
Tighnari: If they're your friends, I'm sure they won't cause any major disturbances.
Tighnari: ...Right? They wouldn't, would they?
Traveler: Are you conducting research?
Tighnari: Erm... half and half.
Tighnari: I'm just wandering around here and there, observing various flora as I always do.
Tighnari: This is equal parts research and normal life.
Tighnari: But I should probably take a more relaxed approach while I'm here. I'll only plan 60% of my typical itinerary.
Tighnari: Should you need me, come find me any time.
