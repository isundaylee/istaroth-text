# Sauro-Vet's Dilemma


## Talk 1

"Kururuk" (Infuriated Qucusaurus): —Shwaaaargh!
Mazkal (???): Come on kiddo, come on now, quit fooling around. If you don't take your meds, you won't recover!
Paimon: #Oh no, she's in danger! We've gotta help her, Traveler!

## Talk 2

Mazkal: I think Kururuk's almost recovered from his injuries... Maybe an increase in the intensity of his rehab exercises is in order.

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: "Shwrawr!"
As if knowing it is outmatched, the Qucusaurus flies off with a cry...
Paimon: Argh, it's quick! Gone in the blink of an eye!
Traveler: C'mon, Paimon, after it!
Paimon: Wha— You want Paimon to go chase it? Seriously?
Mazkal (???): ...Hmm, if nothing else, it does look like it's recovered quite nicely. Next, we should...
Paimon: Speaking of which, why was that Qucusaurus so mad?
Paimon: ...Hmm, Paimon knows! You must've stolen its snacks! There's nothing more infuriating than a food thief, Paimon'll tell ya that!
Mazkal (???): Snacks? Well, yes, I've had some, but Kururuk's not the type to get in a huff over small stuff like that.
Paimon: "Kururuk"? So it has a name... Seems like it's got quite a temper on it, though! Almost hit you back there!
Mazkal (???): Well, I wouldn't blame him, the treatment being what it is...
Traveler: So taking a beating is also a kind of healing? You learn something every day...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: #What? Come on, how did you get that into your head? Cut that nonsense out right now — you're giving {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} the wrong idea!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroowr? Rrooh?
Mazkal (???): Haha, if that was a workable form of therapy, I'd love to try it myself! Unfortunately, Saurians are different from us. Even if you told them something would help them recover quickly, there's no guarantee they'd understand.
Mazkal: Ah, yes, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Mazkal. I usually take care of wounded or sick Saurians nearby. Not to brag or anything, but my medicines get pretty good client reviews.
Mazkal: Hmm. Your little companion looks very healthy. Doesn't look like he needs my help.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: Ah, so you're a Saurian vet! Uhh, judging from the way Kururuk behaved, seems like a pretty tough job...
Mazkal: Oh, I wouldn't say it's all that tough. It's just that Kururuk's case is somewhat... special. He's deeply distrustful of humans right now, so he resists all treatments and medication.
Mazkal: *sigh* If only I were a Saurian myself. I've observed him, and he gets along with other Saurians just fine. Perhaps he'd be willing to take medicine if it came recommended by another Saurian.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wroo?
Paimon: Hmm, well if that's the case, we might just be able to help you!
Mazkal: Huh? Wait, you're saying that despite your appearance, you're actually Saurians!?
Paimon: You sure have an overactive imagination! Ugh...
Paimon: #A—Anyway, the real reason we can do this is because {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s a super clever little Saurian! He can help us out!
Mazkal: Huh? He's that smart?
Traveler: Got a good eye for picking me as a companion, if nothing else...
Paimon: Uh, sure, but that's not really the focus right now, is it?
Paimon: #Yup! Either way, you can leave this to {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, no problem!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Mazkal: #Then on Kururuk's behalf, let me thank you in advance, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
Mazkal: I've been worried that if he keeps acting up like this, it might not only prevent his old injuries from healing, but even cause new wounds to emerge... So I'm most relieved to have your help!
Mazkal: I've formulated two different medicines for him. I've done my best to balance therapeutic effects and palatability, but I haven't come up with the perfect solution by any means...
Mazkal: The result being that the more effective of the two medicines isn't as tasty, while the one Saurians love isn't quite as effective...
Mazkal: #Hmm... Well, instead of all this explaining, let's just have {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} take a sniff. You'll get the picture from how he reacts.
Mazkal: Here's the more effective medicine.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wooo... Rrroo...
Mazkal: And this is the less effective, but much more appetizingly-colored one.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: Wow, the difference really is obvious!
Mazkal: No matter which one you use, the medicines will help Kururuk recover, so I'll just give you both of them. You can decide which you want to try!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Mazkal: Hehe, you're so reliable! Anyway, I'll head back to camp to make some preparations. As for Kururuk, I leave him in your capable hands!
Paimon: #Don't you worry, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s got this!
Traveler: Smart enough to build bridges of friendship between humans and Saurians.
Traveler: Running away so soon? Come back... if you dare.
Paimon: You think a Saurian's gonna understand something like that!?

## Talk 4

Paimon: #If he'll eat it, this one should help him recover better, right? You've got this now, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Looks pretty hopeful. Hehe, good work, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! ...Err, wait a minute...
"Kururuk": —Shwaaaargh!
Paimon: Huh!? W—Was the medicine too effective? He looks even angrier than before! Gah, we've gotta calm him down real quick...

## Talk 5

Traveler: Might as well.
Paimon: #We're counting on you for Round Two, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Chowed it right down! But...
Paimon: Uh oh! He's even madder than before! Quick, we gotta calm him down!

## Talk 6

"Kururuk": Shrawr...
Paimon: #Traveler, Paimon's kinda worried about how Kururuk's wounds haven't fully healed yet... Why don't we follow him and see how things are?
Black Screen Text: #You hurry over to {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and Kururuk.
Paimon: There he is? Phew, at least he looks fine... Alright, let's feed him the medicine now!
Paimon: Which of the two should we go with?

## Talk 7

Paimon: #Well, even if this one doesn't work as well, just having him eat the medicine at all is progress enough! Let's do this, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Ooh, he snapped it right up? Hmm... But he still looks pretty listless.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wroo?
Paimon: Sh—Should we try the other one, then?

## Talk 8

Traveler: Let's not go with either for now.
Paimon: Hmm, that does make sense... Actually, why don't we bring him back to Mazkal now that he's being a bit less rowdy?

## Talk 9

"Kururuk": Rrooah...
Traveler: Is this really a Saurian who still hasn't fully recovered?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrooo... Rawr! Rawr! Raaawr!
Paimon: He'd probably be a super tough opponent when he's in tip-top shape... Anyway, let's bring him back to Mazkal while he's being a bit more docile!

## Talk 10

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Mazkal: You're back! How did it go? Did Kururuk take his medicine?
Paimon: Well, he did, but...
Black Screen Text: You explain what happened earlier...
Mazkal: I see. Alright, let me have a look... Hmm. Looks like he's fine, not hurt too badly at all.
Mazkal: Either way, it's a good thing that he took the medicine! And now that I know how he reacts, I can adjust the formula accordingly.
Mazkal: #Yup, don't worry, we should be fine. Thanks for your help — especially you, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! What an amazing little Tepetlisaur you are!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawwr!
Paimon: #Haha, it's nice hearing people praise {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} — even better than hearing them praise Paimon, in fact!
Mazkal: I'm impressed at how well you two get along with this little guy too. I could stand to learn a thing or two from you.
Traveler: Truly amazing, am I not?
Mazkal: I'd love to say that there's something I could do to help you, or do for you...
Mazkal: But I think I'll settle for wishing you the best of health. Best you never need my help!
Mazkal: Ah, right, but if you just want to chat, you're welcome to come find me anytime.
Paimon: Sure! Hope Kururuk recovers soon — hopefully without instantly resorting to hitting people, like he did earlier...
Mazkal: As for that... Not to worry, I'll figure something out. And you never know, his temper might improve along with his wounds!
Traveler: #Not at all, the credit belongs to {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
