Traveler: Adventurers can also travel the world.
Banu: But traveling scholars can contribute more, y'know. I often heard those adults at the Citadel of Regzar complain about those adventurers trapping themselves in the desert and that they had to send people to rescue them.
Banu: While traveling scholars get to study abroad with their certificates in different countries. Isn't that awesome? And they usually bring tons of useful reports back to the Akademiya as well.
Banu: While you were searching for the Future Stars, I wasn't slacking off here. I've been writing my traveling report and I'm halfway through it already.
Banu: Anyway... I'd most like to become a traveling scholar. But if I can't be that, I'll consider becoming an adventurer as you suggested.
