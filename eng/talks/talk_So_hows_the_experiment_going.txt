# Talk Dialog

Hosseini: So, how's the experiment going?
Traveler: Eh, within expectations, more or less.
Hosseini: The Amplifier is functioning stably, and the recorded data is clear. Normally, I'd be thrilled.
Hosseini: But after seeing how you fight for myself, I just feel like there's still much room for my device to improve.
Traveler: Well, I am a virtuoso of violently vanquishing villainy.
Hosseini: Haha, yes, that's true! So I too must keep at it, and work hard.
Traveler: Being able to spot issues is always a good thing.
Hosseini: #Precisely. And as it happens, I already have some ideas, so this round of experiments was very productive indeed. Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: I just noticed... you don't cough anymore.
Hosseini: Huh. Now that you mention it... My cough has gotten better since my Amplifier started making progress.
Hosseini: Perhaps it is as the doctors say, that "laughter is the best medicine"?
Traveler: Hope all goes well.
Hosseini: #Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: Can it cure your nongraduatitis?
Hosseini: We might need my mentor's mood to cooperate for that.
Hosseini: Theoretically, though, if the Hosseini Amplifier does perform up to par, he'll have to be happy whether he wants to be or not, ha!
