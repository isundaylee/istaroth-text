Traveler: Seems like you're worried about something?
Chubo: Fewer and fewer people are fishing... Or to be precise, far fewer youths are willing to engage in agriculture nowadays.
Chubo: Tea does bring in a lot of money, of course, but you can't just bite and eat Mora.
Chubo: As far as I know, Qiaoying Village's grain production is barely self-sufficient, but many other crops must be purchased from outside.
Chubo: We're situated in the mountains, so if anything were to happen to the mountain path and stop the delivery of goods, now that be terrible news for us, wouldn't it?
Chubo: What's more, youngsters nowadays are all busy learning how to grow and prepare tea.
Chubo: It worries me terribly. Fewer and fewer fishermen like me, youngsters unwilling to take up grain production... Won't our local produce soon come to lack variety?
