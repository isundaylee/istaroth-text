Traveler: What are you doing?
Moce: Me? As you can see, I'm busy dealing with the barbarian threat! According to the reports I've received, there've been traces of them skulking about here.
Moce: This is no trivial matter! Vigilance must be maintained until reinforcements arrive!
Moce: If there is anything else, please bring it up with my adjutant, citizen.
