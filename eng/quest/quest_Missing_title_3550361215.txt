## Talk 1

Arana: Arana will take care of her. She is a most cherished friend.
Arana: #Nara Traveler, please go to Vanarana and sing the Rhythm of the Great Dream. Then ask them to help prepare the Bija.
Traveler: I'm not sure I understand you...
Arana: Like clouds know they have to release rain, rain knows they need to fall onto ground, and seeds know they need to grow into big trees and have lots of big fruits.
Traveler: Iâ€”I got it...
Arana: #Nara Traveler, it looks like you don't understand. It's okay. When the right time comes, Nara Traveler will know what to do.

## Talk 2

Rana: ...
Traveler: (I have to help Rana recover soon...)
Traveler: (Let's leave quietly.)

## Talk 3

Rana: (Rana is still sleeping. Arana is not around.)
Rana: (A blurry image appears in the "bubble" that envelopes Rana.)
Traveler: (You are immersed in the image...)
Black Screen Text: You are in a forest where everything looks incomparably massive and serene. You feel very comfortable here.
Rays of sunshine peek through the sparkling gold leaves, with grass as tall as you swaying quietly all around, gently caressing your hand as you walk by.
Black Screen Text: You hear the sound of distressed crying amid the musical melody of the wind blowing through the trees and flowing water. Following the sound, you find a small girl.
She looks like she has worn herself out from crying and fallen asleep in the meadow. You walk up to her and softly sing a song that can calm all beings...
Rana: (... It seems that Rana's condition hasn't worsened.)
Traveler: (Leave quietly.)

## Talk 4

Rana: (Rana is still sleeping. She should be fine since Arana's Ararakalari is here.)

## Talk 5

Araja: #Oh, it's Nara Traveler. Do you have any questions for me?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Do you need a hand with anything?
Araja: #Oh, thank you, Nara Traveler. As you can see, I'm doing rather well.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Are any Aranara in need of help?
Araja: Oh, well... Go to the center of Vanarana, and you should see Arapacati there. Something has been troubling her lately.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Is there anything else to be done for Festival Utsava?
Araja: About that, Arakavi should be at the center of Vanarana. I think he's also in need of help for Festival Utsava.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: About "Marana"...
Araja: That's a story from very long ago...
Araja: A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
Araja: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
Araja: The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
Araja: On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
Araja: They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
Araja: Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
Araja: Of course. In my stories, Marana's Avatar takes many forms. Sometimes beasts, sometimes birds, sometimes Nara, sometimes blight...
Araja: But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: About the Vasoma Fruit...
Araja: It's a fruit full of energy. It grows on the memories and dreams in the earth, and it needs the help of Aranara and Nara to bear fruit.
Araja: A Bija can be formed by feeding a Vasoma Fruit to the Ashvattha Tree. It's a great tree planted by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's the origin of Aranara.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: About the Aranyaka...
Araja: #It belonged to Nara Varuna. She was a Golden Nara who was kind, brave, and honest, just like you.
Araja: #I still remember how the Aranara of that time missed her and loved her stories. But I believe that since Nara Traveler is here now...

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: See you.
Araja: Yes. I look forward to celebrating Festival Utsava with you.

### Additional Talk 7

Araja: I can't thank you enough for preparing Festival Utsava.
Araja: It's a pity that I couldn't join your adventures like Arama and the others, nor was I able to provide any help.
Araja: That being said, if you ever feel tired during your adventures, come visit Vanarana. You're always welcomed in this dream.
