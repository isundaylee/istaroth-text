# Seagaze Sunset


## Talk 1

Paimon: How was Shenhe able to carry that huge rock all by herself!? Hmm... adepti super-strength, much?
Paimon: #Traveler, we can't slow down yet. Let's go meet her at the building site!

## Talk 2

Leming: First, we construct the keel of the Jade Chamber. The keel is the part that holds the Plaustrite, so once that arrives, it goes straight in...

## Talk 3

Lizheng: Shh... Quiet! Can't you see that I'm concentrating here? Every brick is a crucial component! If I stop concentrating, I'm gonna lay a brick out of whack, and that'll put the whole darn structure out of whack, and then... Well, shoot, and then it's all over...

## Talk 4

Shenhe: It appears that we've been taken for intruders... This time, why not allow me to take care of this.

## Talk 5

Shenhe: The core of the mechanism is exposed. Now's our chance!

## Talk 6

Siqin: I'm under orders to ensure the security of this location. It's imperative that construction stays on schedule. Hopefully, there won't be any setbacks.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa, wâ€”we're going to faaaall!!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Is everyone okay?
Paimon: Look, the Seelie has disappeared beneath the clouds again!
Shenhe: It looks like we need to go further down. But before that, let's destroy the guard mechanisms on this level first.

## Talk 9

Liang: We've been pretty active in the Millelith recently. I don't know what's going on but... I'd better be careful.

## Talk 10

Paimon: We're gonna fall! This time we're really going to fall, aaaah!!!
Paimon: So high... We can't even see to the bottom!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Phew... Luckily there was a pool of water at the bottom. Otherwise, that could have ended very differently...
Paimon: Hey, that Seelie's on the move again! Let's catch up with it!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Look over there, could that be the Sunset Vermillionite?

## Talk 13

Keqing: Ah, Traveler, Paimon. I wasn't expecting to run into you out here at Guyun.
Keqing: What brings you here? You'll have to make it quick, I'm afraid, I really can't afford to chat for too long.
Traveler: What are you doing out here?
Keqing: As you can see, we're working on a construction project.
Keqing: Personally, I consider this project to be of greater importance than the Jade Chamber rebuild. That's why I'm here to supervise.
Keqing: I just hope we can complete it on schedule...
Traveler: What is this?
Keqing: A new type of Guizhong Ballista.
Keqing: Ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the Guizhong Ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
Keqing: This design is a step down from the adepti's original Guizhong Ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
Keqing: It's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. This will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
Keqing: I am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.

## Talk 14

Liang: I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to Guyun Stone Forest. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...

## Talk 15

Changfeng: That young lady who carried the Plaustrite in earlier... she's gotta be an adeptus, surely...

## Talk 16

Changfeng: That young lady who carried the Plaustrite in earlier... she's gotta be an adeptus, surely...

## Talk 17

Cloud Retainer: A human raised by the adepti is precisely what Liyue needs right now. It is also what the adepti wish to give to Liyue.

## Talk 18

Keqing: Ah, Traveler, Paimon. I wasn't expecting to run into you out here at Guyun.
Keqing: What brings you here? You'll have to make it quick, I'm afraid, I really can't afford to chat for too long.

## Talk 19

Anshun: I heard that Lady Keqing has gone to Guyun Stone Forest.
Anshun: She took a lot of our workers with her, too. So does that mean there's another construction project going on over there as well?

Anshun: She took a lot of our workers with her, too. So does that mean there's another construction project going on over there as well?

## Talk 21

Leming: Now we have the Plaustrite, the real construction work can finally begin! I think everyone's going to be very busy from this point onwards. Me especially.

## Talk 22

Keqing: Ah, Traveler, Paimon. I wasn't expecting to run into you out here at Guyun.

## Talk 24

Lizheng: You again? Can't you see that I'm trying to work!? Look, if you wanna chat, find me at dinnertime, okay!

## Talk 25

Paimon: Missing text (3792954306)

## Talk 26

Lizheng: You again? Can't you see that I'm trying to work!? Look, if you wanna chat, find me at dinnertime, okay!

## Talk 27

Siqin: We had a handful of scoundrels try to sneak in and steal some supplies earlier. I caught them, and they'll be dealt with according to the law.

## Talk 29

Cloud Retainer: There seem to have been a growing number of tales told regarding Shenhe in recent years. Perhaps she was seen on the previous occasion when she secretly ventured out from the mountains.
Cloud Retainer: One has heard that a playwright in Liyue Harbor wrote an opera based on the legends told about her. It is called "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."
Cloud Retainer: The play portrays her as making a stand to protect her fellow villagers... Hehe, one can only surmise that every story needs a hero.

## Talk 30

Liang: I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to Guyun Stone Forest. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...

## Talk 31

Baizhu: Why does Lady Ningguang need so much wound dressing?
Baizhu: Is it really such risky business, rebuilding the Jade Chamber? This is all most peculiar...

## Talk 32

Changfeng: The rebuilding of the Jade Chamber is a monumental task, and we are the ones who have been entrusted with this work. It is only right that we put our hearts and souls into this project.

## Talk 33

Baiwen: This is a matter of utmost importance. I must not let Lady Ningguang down...
Baiwen: Oh? Are you here to deliver construction materials?

## Talk 34

Anshun: Normally, it would be Lady Keqing supervising the construction work. But it seems like she's been a little preoccupied lately...

## Talk 35

Paimon: So Shenhe isn't an adeptus after all. She just grew up around the adepti...
Paimon: No wonder she doesn't like being treated as an adeptus. Having everyone falling over themselves to show their respect all the time must be kinda hard to deal with...

## Talk 36

Paimon: Oh! And another thing, we bought some Grilled Chicken Drumsticks on the way back last night! There was a place just outside.
Paimon: Here's one for you, Shenhe! Try it, they're so good!
Shenhe: ...I concur. It has a rich flavor, far more agreeable than those I've cooked for myself in the wilderness in the past.

## Talk 37

Paimon: The Seelie got to here and then disappeared. Should we go over and take a look?
