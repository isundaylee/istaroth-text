Traveler: What is this place?
Gongming: I am under no obligation to respond to your questions... However, since you display such a woeful ignorance of well-known facts...
Gongming: I shall indulge you this time... This is the "Golden House." Though, you may simply think of it as the Liyue Mint... or, in fact, the Teyvat Mint.
Gongming: The source of all wealth, the foundation of ambition, the lifeblood of the economy... I am a steward here, and I take every precaution to ensure the security of this place.
