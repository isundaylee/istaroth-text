# Evermotion Mechanical Painting: Invoker

Félix Yogue: What a surprise. To think that my invention could be used in this fashion...
Félix Yogue: Ah, Traveler! It seems we meet again... *cough*
Traveler: I thought you'd left Mondstadt.
Félix Yogue: That was the plan, yes, but... Things do change, you know...
Félix Yogue: *cough* But let's get back on topic.
Félix Yogue: This time, I've been invited by the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild to create several Mechanical Paintings based on certain card faces that can be disassembled and reassembled.
Félix Yogue: As for the card game, what was it again... Ah, right, it's called Genius Invokation TCG.
Félix Yogue: According to them, these paintings will be brought to be used in the King of Invokations Grand Prix as a sort of minigame to liven things up just a bit.
Félix Yogue: *sigh* These things are too complicated for me. I should just concentrate on my inventions.
Félix Yogue: Ah, yes, Mondstadt's mechanical paintings are with me, so if you want to play around with them, feel free.
Traveler: Did something go wrong with your invention again?
Félix Yogue: No, not at all! Not this time... Or should I say, there was never a problem.
Félix Yogue: When I asked you for your help previously, I was having a monster problem, not an invention problem!
