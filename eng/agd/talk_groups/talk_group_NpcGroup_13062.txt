Message Board: "The Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament has begun! Hundreds of contestants are capturing and putting together their team of formidable Fungi!"
Message Board: "Once the preparation phase ends, the staff will confirm whether the contestants have collected four Fungi as required, and will randomly put together the preliminary round schedule."
Traveler: View "Competition Rules"...
Paimon: Uh... There are so many clauses here! There's even a... disclaimer?
Paimon: This is giving Paimon a headache... Paimon doesn't want to read any of this. Let's just skip it! The prize money is what's most important anyway...
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: Ahem! What Paimon meant was, if there's anything about the Fungi. Like whether the Fungi can be shown in public or not... and stuff...
Paimon: Hehe, let's see if we can find it!
Message Board: "Competition Rewards - Top 8: Sizable amount of Mora, limited-edition Nilotpala Cup Season 1 Honorary Title, and the permission to keep the ace Fungus..."
Paimon: A sizable amount of Mora? Wait... They didn't include the actual amount...? And what's this about the permission to keep your Ace Fungus? Do they mean we can take one home to keep as a pet?
Paimon: Let's keep reading...
Message Board: "Fungi Activity Rules - Rule #3: Fungi that are registered and controlled by a Wisdom Orb are allowed to move around freely in areas proximate to the arena. Beast tamers, please pay extra attention to the activity borders."
Message Board: "Activity areas only include areas around the arena and the main roads of Port Ormos. Please do not bring your Fungi to the following public areas: Wikala Funduq, shops, and restaurants."
Message Board: "Currently, this competition is unknown to some members of the population. Panic or chaos may occur if Fungi were to appear in front of individuals who are unaware of the competition. It is recommended that everyone manage their Fungi accordingly."
Message Board: "The Corps of Thirty will referee the competitors to ensure that all rules are followed. Competitors who violate the rules will be disqualified immediately. If the violation is considered a gross offense, further responsibilities may be pursued and punishment from the Akademiya may occur."
Paimon: Wow... the rules are really strict! They're really serious about this. We should be careful as well!
Traveler: Did you just speak your real thoughts out loud?
Traveler: About the comment event...
Message Board: "After the results of the preliminary rounds are finalized, audience members can leave a comment on this competition billboard to show their support for the competitors or to share their thoughts about Fungi!"
Message Board: "All comments will be screened and evaluated by staff before they are posted. Please refrain from leaving comments that are over-the-top and be nice!"

Message Board: "Floating Fungi are the cutest! Whether they're Hydro, Anemo, or Dendro!"
Message Board: "Every Floating Fungus has a big head and its body is soft. It moves around slowly, and sways back and forth as it does so."
Message Board: "Let's make a Floating Fungi Protection Association together!"
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Reminder from the staff: Competition Fungi are special, wild Fungi are dangerous!"
Message Board: "Enjoy the competition responsibly. Please do not attempt to imitate anything you see!"

Message Board: "Maybe the organizers should add some kind of balancing mechanism to make the competition more competitive."
Message Board: "For example, attach a point system to each Fungus that enters battle. Each team has a limited number of points, and the stronger the Fungi, the higher the points."
Message Board: "With that put in place, the competitors will need to take a strategic approach to what Fungi they include in their team. This also guarantees a more competitive atmosphere."
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: You idiot! The audience won't be able to understand what's going on if the competition becomes too complicated!
Message Board: Everyone's just here to have a good time. Nobody wants to count dumb points and guess strategies while watching the competition!
Message Board: Besides, the skills of the stronger Fungi are awesome. If you restrict them from entering the arena, the competition might get stale really quickly!

Message Board: "The preliminary round is over. When will the competition film be available for purchase?"
Message Board: "I'm having a hard time staying in my seat. There are so many competitors with really cool nicknames that sound like they have a strong team! Ordinary audiences won't be able to watch every single match. We need the film!"
Message Board: "It's okay even if it's a little pricey. After all, competitions like this are rare, and it's exciting to watch even the second or third time around!"
Traveler: Leave.

Message Board: "Your combat style is bold and a treat to watch."
Message Board: "I wonder if Haniyyah is accepting apprentices? I want to learn how to beast tame from her and make friends with all sorts of Fungi!"

Message Board: "Golden Comet and Silver Companion are so ridiculously strong! I wonder if they're Fungi veterans!"
Message Board: "With the two of them here, I would say that this season's champions are already decided!"
Message Board: "I hear that Silver Companion has an obsession with Mora. Maybe we should pool some together and ask Silver Companion if they can take it easy and throw the match!"
Message Board: "That way, ordinary people like us would have a shot at winning the competition!"
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Are you a competitor from their group!? It would be cheating if you tried to use Mora to bribe them!"
Message Board: "They'll let their skills do the talking! You should use the time you spent coming up with stupid ideas like this to train instead!"
Message Board: "I think it's still too early to say that they'll be the final winners. I'm pretty sure they'll have a hard time if they're matched against Fried Tofu With All the Frills."

Paimon: Whâ€”What's going on!? Is there a comment Paimon shouldn't see!?

Message Board: "A foreign guest by the name of Aratani is collecting photos of the Fungi. They say that she has ways to produce Fungi picture cards that are extremely valuable collectibles!"
Message Board: "But Miss Aratani seems to be looking to make money off this. That's why she's dividing up the sales channel for the picture cards."
Message Board: "Anyone who's willing to purchase her cards, please leave a comment below! If you have any cute photos of the Fungi, make sure you send them to us as well!"

Message Board: "The Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament quarter-finals are approaching. Things are heating up! Audience members and competitors, please show us your excitement!"
Traveler: Most Liked Comment
Message Board: "To be honest, even though the competitions are exciting, the Fungi's abilities should really be applied in other areas as well. For example, they should be used to escort caravans or to guard the city."
Message Board: "If that happens, a lot of the pressure will be taken off the Corps of Thirty, and merchants wouldn't need to spend so much money on hiring bodyguards."
Message Board: "Goods might even become cheaper when the cost decreases! After all, I'm sure the merchants factor the cost of hiring bodyguards into the sale price of the goods. We, the customers, are the ones that pay for it."
Message Board: "So I think it's safe to say that it could be very beneficial for us ordinary people if this event were to become even more popular!"

Message Board: "I recommend banning the use of Stretchy Geo Fungi! The skills on that type of Fungus are way too strong!"
Message Board: "Launching an entire team of Fungi in an instant is way too overpowered!"
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Haha, I can tell that you're an amateur from your comment! The strong abilities of Stretchy Geo Fungi come at a cost â€” the skill can't be used frequently in combat, and Stretchy Geo Fungi can easily be focused down!"
Message Board: "If you use proper team composition, you'll be able to limit the Stretchy Geo Fungi's combat capabilities!"

Message Board: "The competition has been going on for a little while. I'm just curious, how do each of the competitors train their Fungi?"
Message Board: "Everyone's Fungi started out the same, but they seem to be completely different in battle. It must be because of their training!"
Message Board: "I think that the organizers should allow the audience to look around the training facilities too. I want to get to know each contestant's style and how they spend each day with their Fungi."
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Bro, don't be stupid! The training grounds are extremely dangerous! It's nothing like the arena!"
Message Board: "Besides, the competitors will definitely show us their best during their matches. There's no need for us to know everything they do. That'll only make things more difficult for them."

Message Board: "He is not charging any fees and will provide food and beverages! However, he won't be able to manage it all on his own, so it'd be great if everyone could bring some too!"

Message Board: "If there are more competitions after this one, please don't schedule the matches so closely together! And maybe consider revival matches to give competitors who had a bad day a second chance!"

Message Board: "Thank you for your support! The staff at Nilotpala Cup has received your suggestions."

Message Board: "It's finally the finals. I've been waiting for an evenly matched fight."
Message Board: "To be honest, the matches prior to this one were a little boring. They were too friendly! There was no excitement... I'd rather see the competitors give it everything they've got. I want them to go for each other's throats! An exciting competition should be fierce and filled with rivalry!"
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "I completely disagree! This is a competitive event, not a brawl! The cute Fungi should be quickly tended to after being wounded in the match. And you're here talking about spilling blood!?"
Message Board: "If it's excitement that you're looking for, you can go pick up one of the bounties posted by the Corps of Thirty and go fight the vicious Fungi in the wild!"
Message Board: "Not only will that satisfy your needs, it'll also bring great joy to us!"

Message Board: "Someone mentioned before that we can use tamed Fungi to help with security. I find that to be a great idea. It can even be applied to other areas as well!"
Message Board: "They can help with protecting cargo shipments, crop irrigation, or even mining. The possibilities are endless."
Message Board: "Obviously, it's all on the premise that the 'beast taming' techniques are steadily passed on to more people, and the cost of Wisdom Orbs is reduced."
Message Board: "Also, we'll have to monitor and solve any issues regarding the reliability of the Wisdom Orbs once its application is introduced on a large scale..."
Message Board: "Maybe the organizers should hire the competitors as instructors to teach the general public about the usage of the orbs... Hmm, that could be a great idea."
