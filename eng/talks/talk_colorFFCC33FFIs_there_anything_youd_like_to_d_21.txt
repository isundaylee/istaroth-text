Keqing: Sure, let's arrange an evening when both of us are free.
Keqing: A little while ago, I took some time to survey every inch of this place.
Keqing: I found three locations where the scenery was quite beautiful, it really resonated with me.
Keqing: One of them was perfect for stargazing.
Keqing: So, are you interested?
Traveler: Of course!
Keqing: Great.
Keqing: I was a little apprehensive actually, I was wondering how I could convince you if you refused at first...
Keqing: Personally, I consider it... a reward... for completing a stage of my work.
Keqing: Rare blessings like these... we mustn't let them go to waste.
Traveler: Keqing...
Keqing: Now that I know you don't have any reservations, you better go and work it into your schedule!
Keqing: The sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned.
Traveler: I never knew you had a stargazing hobby.
Keqing: It's not really a hobby...
