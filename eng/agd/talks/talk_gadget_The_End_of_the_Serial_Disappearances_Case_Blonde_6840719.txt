The Steambird: "The End of the Serial Disappearances Case! Blonde Outlander Pivotal in Exposing True Culprit."
The Steambird: Report from our correspondent Charlotte: The final verdict on the Serial Disappearances Case has finally been handed down by the court at Opera Epiclese.
The Steambird: Thanks to the tireless efforts of groups such as the Blonde Outlander and the Spina di Rosula, Lyney, who was initially deemed a suspect in a magic-related incident, has proven his innocence.
The Steambird: The Blonde Outlander uncovered key evidence during the investigation that revealed the truth regarding the case.
The Steambird: The evidence showed that Marcel is the true culprit behind the entire case. Not only did he kidnap dozens of young ladies for human experiments, but he also plotted against multiple involved personnel to shift blame and evade capture.
The Steambird: The primary suspect, Marcel, was found guilty by the Oratrice and the Iudex. However, Marcel passed away due to extreme shock in the aftermath of the trial.
The Steambird: Childe, the Fatui Harbinger, was also found guilty by the Oratrice and sentenced to imprisonment at the Fortress of Meropide.
The Steambird: Furthermore, this case marked the first instance where the verdict of the Iudex contradicted that of the Oratrice. The final judgment was based on the verdict of the Oratrice. Further details shall be covered in future reports.
