# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Going to get a new job?
Michica: Huh? Opening a shop?
Michica: Oh no no, I don't actually have any plans to open a shop. It was just an analogy.
Michica: Once you've worked here for long enough, you'll see just about anything.
Michica: Get distracted for one second, and something in a package gets broken.
Michica: Get distracted again, and the delivery address literally evaporates into thin air, because it was written in that kind of ink that changes with the outside temperature...
Michica: ...*sigh* Forget it. There's no point going into it. There'll only be more pleasant surprises waiting for us.
Michica: Sorry you had to listen to all of that. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
