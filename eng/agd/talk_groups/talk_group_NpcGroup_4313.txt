Traveler: About the Akasha Terminals...
Panah: The Akasha is a treasure trove of wisdom left to us by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Panah: Using the power of the Akasha, the sages developed the Akasha Terminal. By wearing it, you'll be aided by the wisdom of the Dendro Archon in obtaining the knowledge you need.
Panah: In the past, the Akademiya only issued Akasha Terminals to people of Sumeru or outlanders who were in a long-term residence in Sumeru.
Panah: The Akademiya decided of late to distribute the Akasha Terminals to all tourists in Sumeru, hoping to help all feel the universal compassion from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.

Traveler: You are...
Panah: Ahaha! Look familiar, do I?
Panah: You might have seen me near the gate of Sumeru City giving out Akasha Terminals. That's how most people know me anyway, though I'm afraid the remembrance is not mutual...
Panah: There have been some personnel shuffles recently that have led to me being sent here to help our two standing sages and the Scribe out with their work.
Panah: I'm sure you know about the big shake-up that's been happening since Lesser Lord Kusanali assumed control over the Akademiya. I've been up to my neck in various applications from all manner of researchers...
Panah: ...And of course, I need to deal with people snooping around for information.
Panah: To be honest, I haven't quite gotten used to the pace of my new job just yet... but I'll just have to do my best.
