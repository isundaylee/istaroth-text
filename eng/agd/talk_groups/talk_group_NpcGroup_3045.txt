Shouta: The Konpeito candies I brought back last time were finished overnight. I guess the archon must be really fond of them.
Shouta: I have placed the rest in here this time. I'm sure it will...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Shouta: I've heard that I can make a wish to the archon once I have placed the offering in the shrine. If the archon likes my offering, my wish will definitely be granted.
Shouta: I have brought all of my snacks here today, and I'd like to wish that the archon will cancel the exam tomorrow!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Shouta: I'm sure the archon will bless me this time!

## Talk

Traveler: Has it ever worked?
Shouta: Hmm... It works about once in a dozen times... Last time, I wished bad luck upon someone who bullied me, and then he flunked his exam, haha!
Shouta: ...What? You don't believe me? Why do you look so skeptical?
Shouta: The archon is real. I won't allow you to doubt that! After all, wishes don't come true if your heart isn't earnest...
Shouta: Those bad guys who laughed at me for having my snacks stolen won't be blessed, I know it. Their teacher will never get diarrhea. When they borrow comic books, they'll always be missing the next volume!

## Talk

Traveler: Such specific punishments.
Shouta: Hmph, that's what they'll get for being bad guys!
Shouta: The archon will let everyone know that you'll only be rewarded for being an awesome person like Yoimiya.
Shouta: Yoimiya never ridicules me. She will offer me little fireworks for fun, and she encourages me to study hard... In my mind, she's the greatest person ever — besides my family, of course!
Shouta: Not like that big guy with the horns. He would play cards with me and win all of my snacks. Ugh, and I don't even have that many snacks to lose...

## Talk

Shouta: Ugh... This isn't good...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Shouta: We gave two offerings to the shrine, right? However, the deity hasn't responded to me yet.
Shouta: I went to have a look, and offerings weren't there anymore...
Shouta: But when we went there the first time, the deity granted a part of my wish after accepting my offerings...
Shouta: So, I was thinking... Someone... Or something might've stolen the offerings before the deity could accept them.
Traveler: That's a possibility.
Shouta: If that's the case, then I'm in trouble. I might not be able to give offerings again...
Shouta: If I'm too persistent with my wishes, even deities will grow impatient.
Shouta: Please help me! Please come with me to the shrine outside the city and take a look!

## Talk

Traveler: What did you offer?
Shouta: Wh—What do you want? Are you planning to take these snacks?
Shouta: You can't do that! You'll bring bad luck onto yourself if you steal other people's offerings!
Shouta: Uhh... How about I give these Onikabuto to you?
Shouta: I caught them with my friends. They don't seem like something I can offer to the deities. You can have them, but in return, don't touch my snacks, okay?
