# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kinich: Yes. It's a nice environment. Comfortable, too.
Ajaw: Really, Kinich? Man, you have low standards.
Ajaw: Don't get me wrong, it's quite impressive for a basic slum. But it's a far cry from the Nation of Flame when I was the ruler.
Ajaw: Back then, I had a grand castle at the highest point in the nation, with an endless stream of worshipers coming to pay tribute to the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw.
Ajaw: You could not fathom the gifts they would bring... Fine wine made from the freshest red fruits, opulent chests full of treasure... And that was the bare minimum!
Traveler: Very impressive.
Kinich: You'd think that as an almighty dragonlord and supreme ruler, you'd know how to be a good guest as well as a good host.
Ajaw: Hmph...
Kinich: Thank you for inviting me here.
Kinich: When I camp outdoors, all I require is a bonfire or a cave to rest in. But this place provides both safety and comfort, which is hard to come by elsewhere.
Kinich: How can I repay you?
Traveler: Ah, there's no need...
Kinich: I'm serious. I don't intend to accept your kindness for free â€” I insist.
Kinich: So if there's anything you want from me at all, please be up front with me. I will consider how best to complete the task, and take it from there. Simple and straightforward.
Traveler: This is kinda sudden. I've got nothing in mind...
Kinich: Fair enough... Then let's just say, I owe you one for now.
Kinich: Let me know once you've thought of something.
Kinich: And of course, in the unlikely event that the price isn't right, I'll tell you right away.
Traveler: This must be quite the humble change of pace.
