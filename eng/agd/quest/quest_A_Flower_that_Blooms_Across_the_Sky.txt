# A Flower that Blooms Across the Sky


## Talk 1

Paimon: Um, Paimon's been meaning to ask what you meant by "prepared."
Arapurva: Nara Avin has not completely remembered. Memories and dreams are both necessary.
Avin: Dreams...
Avin: But I'll never be able to stand again. Even if I can recover, I don't know how long that'll take.
Arapurva: Such worries are not needed here. Nara Avin, you must remember. Dreams are connected to your heart, not your body.
Avin: My heart...?
Arapurva: I led you this far, but now Nara Avin must find her precious things by herself.
Yoimiya: Huh? He's gone, just like that?
Yoimiya: It looks like the sky here has changed somewhat.
Avin: My heart...
Avin: ...!
Paimon: Huh!?
Avin: I... stood up.
Avin: It wasn't hard at all, and it didn't feel weird. It was like... how things were before I got sick.
Paimon: Wait, so that means we're...
Traveler: We're inside a dream.
Paimon: Not our first time in one. Ah, no wonder Arapurva said not to worry... Avin can move freely in this dream.
Avin: Wow, that's amazing, is this... the power of my heart?
Yoimiya: How amazing! Now we can all look for Arashani together.
Yoimiya: C'mon, let's race! Lemme see how good you really are!
Avin: I might not have recovered yet...
Avin: Whatever, let's go! I won't lose, not even to an adult!
Paimon: Ah, and off she goes!
Paimon: Well, this was easy. Paimon thought she'd need more time.
Traveler: I guess that's what they call aptitude.
Paimon: Hehe, that's true. Let's catch up with them.
Traveler: That's the power of a wish.

## Talk 2

Avin: *pants* You're... good...
Yoimiya: Hehe, if we had run any further, you would've caught up!
Paimon: Avin was neck and neck with Yoimiya!
Avin: I've outrun lots of adults before. Long legs don't necessarily mean you run faster. Training's important, too.
Yoimiya: Haha, I won't even be able to compete with you in a few years.
Yoimiya: Hm, let's see... Where should we go next?
Paimon: Ah, look! Something's floating up ahead!
Traveler: It looks like a... star?
Avin: Does it want us to follow it?
Yoimiya: Hmm, maybe. Let's follow it.

## Talk 3

Paimon: So this is our destination? But Paimon doesn't see an Aranara. Just this big stone.
Avin: I'm so happy... I almost forgot how it feels to be this happy...
Avin: You know, at first, it felt like my world had shrunk down to a tiny space.
Avin: But as long as I continue moving forward, new sights will always appear in front of me, and my world will keep expanding before my eyes.
Avin: Even though I don't know how I did it, I know I have you all to thank.
Yoimiya: Oh, that's not important. What's important is that you've remembered the joy of going through the world.
Yoimiya: Our memories don't just symbolize our past. They can also shine a light on our future.
Yoimiya: Once you find the hope in your heart again, that happiness will come back to you.
Avin: Yes! Thank you, Yoimiya! Thank you all!
Avin: Let's keep looking for Arashani. It doesn't look like he's here.
Paimon: Yeah... Uh, then why would the star lead us here?
Traveler: This stone really stands out.
Avin: I dunno how to explain this... I don't know what it is, but it feels very familiar...
Avin: Almost like it's a part of me.
Yoimiya: I know!
Yoimiya: Could this stone be your Urstone?
Avin: Ur—Urstone?
Traveler: (Yoimiya's good at ad libbing.)
Traveler: (I'd almost forgotten about that.)
Yoimiya: It's a very rare ore that symbolizes a person's aspirations and dreams.
Yoimiya: Since you can see it, that means you've found what you've lost.
Avin: Is that how it works...?
Avin: It's just like in fairy tales... I thought I'd stopped believing in those.
Avin: But I'm glad that I found that belief again.
Paimon: Eh? Th—They passed right through!
Yoimiya: Let's go after them!
Paimon: Hey, Yoimiya! HEY! ...Well, we have no choice.
Paimon: We passed through, but nothing seems to have changed.
Arashani: It has been a while, Nara Avin. It really has been a while, yes?
Avin: Arashani...
Arashani: Why do you look sad? Oh. Arashani knows. You are happy.
Avin: Arashani! *sobs*
Yoimiya: Aw, the Aranara sure have a flair for magical journeys.
Yoimiya: They not only helped Avin find her best friend, but they also showed us what an Urstone is.
Yoimiya: Oh, um, we have to look for one of our own later — to make the purest lens.
Paimon: Yep! It's kinda funny, but Paimon thinks we can actually do it.
Traveler: That's an adventure for you.
Traveler: This has been pretty fun.
Yoimiya: But we have to bring her back to Sumeru City first. Her mother must be worried sick.
Black Screen Text: The scene before you is akin to a dream. Before you know it, you are returned to where you previously were.

## Talk 4

Avin: It... The dream ended.
Yoimiya: We dreamed a most lovely dream.
Yoimiya: Don't look so lonely! He's right next to you.
Avin: Arashani! Y—You're... still here...
Arashani: Arashani wants to say sorry. It is not that Arashani did not want to find Nara. Arashani could not remember the time.
Arashani: Arashani does not dare enter the city. Arashani did not see Nara Avin, so Arashani thought you had made new friends.
Arapurva: That is normal and unavoidable. It is not something to be grieved.
Avin: It's okay, I understand. This happened because I lost sight of myself.
Avin: But I think I understand now. Yoimiya's right. Everyone gets bad luck, but we have to support each other through unlucky times.
Avin: Thanks for helping me rediscover my memories and dreams. I won't let your work go to waste.
Yoimiya: Hehe. You've also helped us a lot, so don't be so humble! To be honest, we didn't know where to start with the Urstone.
Yoimiya: But now that we're on this track, I think we'll find it easy!
Avin: Yoimiya, you need this Urstone because you want to see a meteor shower?
Yoimiya: Yep. Oh! Once we find it, you should come with us!
Avin: If that's how things are...
Avin: I'm happy to lend you my Urstone.
Paimon: Wha!?
Paimon: Wh—What just happened? Did you just take... glasses out of your chest?
Traveler: I have no idea what's going on, either.
Arapurva: ...
Yoimiya: Hahaha, how'd you know we'd need this?
Avin: I didn't. I just thought that since you helped me find my precious friend, I should help you using something precious to me...
Avin: And then the light turned into this. Is this what you needed?
Yoimiya: Thank you. I didn't expect us to solve our problem like this. Alright, time to give it a go!
Yoimiya: Not that I know how to use it, but let's see what my intuition says.
Yoimiya: Where are you... Where are you...
Yoimiya: Ooh! I think I see it! Oh, uh... It was pretty obvious.
Yoimiya: C'mon, I'll lead the way. Once we're done watching the meteor shower, I'll accompany you home.
Yoimiya: Also, thank you for helping us. Actually, let me scrap the pleasantries and give you a heartfelt compliment instead!
Yoimiya: You all are great storytellers!
Arapurva: Oh, what a coincidence. I would say the same for you, Red Nara.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Mmm... Ugh...
Paimon: We're waking up already? But Paimon wants to watch more...
Yoimiya: The meteors we summoned flew up from the ground...
Yoimiya: They were exactly like fireworks!
Yoimiya: Ah, I could've kept watching that forever. That was the realest, grandest, most magical dream I've ever had!
Paimon: Paimon too! Paimon didn't expect you to just pull us onto that shooting star, though.
Yoimiya: Hehe~ Honestly, I didn't think about it at all. I just thought it'd be a shame if we didn't try something crazy.
Traveler: Yoimiya, you...
Traveler: You already knew that it was a dream.
Yoimiya: You know me. It really doesn't matter to me if our experience was real or a dream.
Yoimiya: I really should thank you two, though. You set all this up as a backup plan because you knew that meteor showers are hard to catch, right?
Yoimiya: Don't worry, I loved it so so so much! I think this ranks as the absolute best gift I've ever been given.
Paimon: Oh phew, that's good. Paimon was afraid that you might be angry after hearing the truth.
Yoimiya: Why would I be? I dreamed about helpful, friendly, cute Aranara...
Yoimiya: I dreamed that we ran and jumped atop large mushrooms, and we discovered Urstone in a very unexpected way...
Yoimiya: And when I thought we had woken up, the next part was even more amazing!
Yoimiya: From her heart, Avin brought forth Urstone glasses. We found meteors that flew up from the earth, and we even became one with the shooting stars themselves...
Traveler: We've been in a dream.
Traveler: Who's to say we've woken up?
Yoimiya: That's right. Dreams themselves may be imaginary, but they're also experiences that can never be relived or replicated.
Yoimiya: If we were sticklers about truth and fiction, we would've missed out on so much beauty and emotion.
Paimon: Hehe, you sure know your way with words. Paimon's gonna bump you up a few places on the "Paimon's Best Friends" list!
Traveler: So there's a leaderboard for that...
Paimon: Um, by the way... the Aranara, they don't usually like...
Yoimiya: Oh yeah, they're so cute! We really have to thank those lovely carvings.
Paimon: The wood carvings?
Yoimiya: Yeah. If we hadn't seen those wood carvings, then we wouldn't have dreamed of such cute Aranara.
Paimon: ...?
Traveler: Yoimiya gets it.
Traveler: I think they're cuter than the carvings.
Yoimiya: Hehe, don't worry, I know. I think they're very cute, and I'm happy to protect them.
Yoimiya: Well, it's almost time. Let's send her home.
Black Screen Text: After sending Avin home, you and Yoimiya spend a few more days in Sumeru.

## Talk 6

Yoimiya: Sumeru's such a nice place. I'll be back for sure!
Niousha: You will always be welcome here. Avin would be happy to see you again.
Avin: It's a deal! I'll be waiting for you.
Yoimiya: Hahaha, you got it!
Avin: Yoimiya, before you go back, I want to tell you about my new dream.
Avin: I want to travel to Inazuma on my own and watch a fireworks show there.
Yoimiya: Wow, that's impressive! Hehe, I didn't expect to be introduced to new customers while on vacation.
Yoimiya: Don't worry, I'll make you some fireworks that you'll never forget!
Yoimiya: You two as well. No matter how busy your adventures get, remember to come back to Inazuma. We'll always welcome you, no matter when you drop by!
Yoimiya: You've got to come and watch the fireworks this meteor shower inspired as they soar high in the sky!
Paimon: Sounds like a plan!
Traveler: Take care, Yoimiya.
Yoimiya: I will, I will! Haha, you're as earnest as ever.
Yoimiya: Oh yeah, by the way, have a look at this.
Traveler: An Aranara Carving...
Yoimiya: That's right. This is the one you helped me pick, and you said it looked kinda like me. I went to buy another one — this one's for you.
Yoimiya: Look at it whenever you're feeling down. Who knows, maybe it'll raise your spirits. If nothing else, you'll know that I'm supporting you all the way.
Yoimiya: Of course, meeting in person is still better, hehe.
Traveler: Thank you.
Yoimiya: Okay, I'll be heading back now. I'm sure we'll meet again soon!
Yoimiya: I really loved the trip you prepared for me — in fact, I'm totally impressed!
Yoimiya: No matter where you two go, I know that our friendship and its warmth will support you.
Yoimiya: So go forward — to the end of your journey, and to the ends of this world!
Yoimiya: See you around!
Traveler: I'll treasure it.
Traveler: May all your days be filled with happiness.
Yoimiya: Every day, and forever!
Traveler: Fireworks are for now, but friends are forever!
Yoimiya: Wh—Why'd you just shout that out? It's embarrassing...
