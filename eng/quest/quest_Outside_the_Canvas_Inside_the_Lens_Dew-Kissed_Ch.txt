# Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens: Dew-Kissed Chapter

Asagiri: S—So cold... I definitely shouldn't have just gone out into the wind willy-nilly...
Asagiri: #...Huh? Traveler! Paimon! It's yo—AH-CHOO!
Traveler: Asagiri? What're you doing here?
Paimon: Are you okay? How'd you make it out this far all by yourself...
Asagiri: I'm... well... fine! I'm much better now! See, I'm not even coughing anymore.
Asagiri: Haha... ha...
Traveler: You sure about that?
Asagiri: Whoa! No need! I admit it, I sneaked out on my own! Happy?
Asagiri: I... I didn't have a choice. How could I possibly paint beautiful pictures if I just sat in Inazuma all the time?
Asagiri: Even if I have you running around taking pictures for me, picture references can't compare to seeing things with your own eyes.
Asagiri: So, I asked an author I worked with before to contact a merchant ship for me, and quietly hitched a ride with them so I could travel.
Traveler: And you even brought all your painting tools with you...
Asagiri: But of course! The canvas is my very soul! How could I ever abandon any of them?
Asagiri: Plus, my paintings are selling exceptionally well in Fontaine. A few Fontainian authors have even asked me to do the covers for their novels!
Asagiri: Though... Apparently putting illustrations throughout novels isn't a thing for them! Truly strange...
Asagiri: #Oh, right... Since you happen to be here, Traveler... Would you mind helping me collect some reference materials?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Asagiri: Excellent! With you helping out, I know the job's as good as done.
Asagiri: Okay, let me have a look. As it happens, I've received a few more commissions from some authors...
Traveler: Alright then, but don't go running off.
Asagiri: I know! Not like I can deal with those clockwork meka anyway.
Asagiri: When it comes to dealing with all kinds of weird monsters, you're the creme de la creme.
Traveler: Let me write back and check.
