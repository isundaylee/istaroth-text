Twilight Theater Head: My most distinguished guests! Please hear me!
Twilight Theater Head: I'm sure you have watched the first four acts. I hope you've enjoyed the show!
Twilight Theater Head: The stage is now set for the final act! Ahh, I'm so excited, I could cry!
Twilight Theater Head: There is still something I need to follow up with backstage. I am terribly sorry that I cannot escort you to the final stage personally, but... I'll see you there!
