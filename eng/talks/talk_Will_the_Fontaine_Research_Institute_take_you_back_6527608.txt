Traveler: Will the Fontaine Research Institute take you back?
Edwin Eastinghouse: If I were Raimondo, I wouldn't let Edwin Eastinghouse himself be idle and outside the Institute.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Otherwise... Hmph! Does he really want the Institute to turn into a Fonta development factory?
Edwin Eastinghouse: But now that that Choiseul has moved his office into the Institute... He might try to stop me from returning...
Edwin Eastinghouse: I just want to conduct my own research in peace. Is that too much to ask?
