# Missing title (1548673983)

Idyia: "Welcome to the Veluriyam Mirage. I hope you can relax and enjoy some respite from your tiring journey."
Idyia: That's how I would have greeted you if things had been different... *sigh* It's hard to believe how much has happened.
Idyia: Since everything's fixed now, I thought... Better late than never. What do you think? Pretty professional, huh?
Traveler: About Preprints...
Idyia: Uh... do you want me to explain the underlying theory? I don't actually know that much about it. In short, a Preprint is like an idea...
Idyia: Think of it like how a plant should grow is imprinted in its seed, or how a bird will spread its wings is determined while it's still in its egg.
Idyia: Things follow these instincts and rules that are programmed into them and become that which we see around us. Perhaps the blueprints of all things were created at the very beginning.
Idyia: A Preprint is like those blueprints, and the light reflected through the bottle transforms them into the entire Veluriyam Mirage. Ah, but this kind of magic only works within the confines of the bottle.
Traveler: About Oceanids...
Idyia: Oh, are you wondering why we fled Fontaine? It feels like it happened a lifetime ago...
Idyia: The reason for our flight... it would be the "water". The waters of Fontaine changed, and to the Oceanids, now the waters there are full of... pain and hatred...?
Idyia: For us, if we wanted to live, fleeing was the best choice. Oh, it was then that became lost and fainted in the desert...
Idyia: I must say, this desert is really just too vast!
Traveler: About Rhodeia...
Idyia: Huh, Rhodeia? Have you met her?
Idyia: Looks like she finally found a place for herself... Qingce Village? Is that in Liyue? You really have gone far away, Rhodeia...
Traveler: Keep up the good work!
Idyia: Yeah, I will... I will work hard! And please do enjoy the humid environment here. You'll rarely come across such a place in the desert!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Idyia! Emergency, huge news!
Paimon: We found a pocket watch! Look! Is this the legendary Mora Pocketwatch!?
Traveler: It's gold and shiny on the outside!
Idyia: Hmm, let me take a look...
Idyia: Y-You really found it!? Is this ordained by destiny?
Idyia: The ultimate prize left by the mysterious adventurer was found by the legendary Traveler...
Idyia: I sense some sort of... spiritual legacy!
Paimon: Paimon is really happy to be praised like that, but Paimon is more curious about what happens next...
Traveler: Will we get additional rewards?
Idyia: N-Nothing like that...
Idyia: Actually, it never occurred to me that someone would find this pocket watch... After all, even I forgot where it was buried.
Idyia: But it's valuable on its own, right? Right!? Additional rewards from me are unnecessary...
Idyia: Anyway, I'll be writing this down, with just the right amount of flair, of course. I'll transform it into an exciting and thrilling story for my future guests.
Idyia: Now, the treasure you buried will be replacing this Mora Pocketwatch!
Paimon: Oh yeah, that's right! We talked about that too, it's about the stories hidden inside the treasure.
Paimon: #Anyway, let's study this watch a little longer, Traveler!
Paimon: Idyia, please write a really exciting story about us!
Idyia: Don't worry, leave it to me!
Traveler: Will it trigger a hidden event?
Traveler: It has Mora engraved on it!

### Additional Talk 2

Idyia: Oh, it's you two. What is it? You look like you have questions.
Idyia: If it's answers about Veluriyam Mirage that you seek, then you've come to the right person. I know Veluriyam Mirage like the ripples on my palm.
Traveler: You have... wave-like wrinkles?
Idyia: It's just a metaphor! I'd never have any wrinkles, never!
Paimon: Anyway, let Paimon bring you up to speed! We found this letter in the park!
Paimon: Idyia, you must know where this came from, right?
Idyia: Of course, it's obviously from... Huh? It's my first time seeing such a letter...
Paimon: The ripples on your palm aren't looking too clear now...
Idyia: S-Someone must have buried it while I wasn't paying attention. It's not surprising that I'm seeing it for the first time now.
Idyia: And based on its contents, it's closer to a will and a chronicle than a letter. But who? The tone of the writing feels quite familiar...
Traveler: It seems related to the Shinrou Casket?
Idyia: Ah! Now that you mentioned it, you're right, it is from the old man who brought the Shinrou Casket. It's... it's something that happened not too long after I arrived in the bottle.
Idyia: The old man was from Inazuma. His first question upon arriving here was whether this Domain fulfills wishes, and he wanted to be sent to a battlefield of the past...
Idyia: I tried to explain it to him, but... His physical condition was terrible when he arrived, and even his mind was clearly at its limit from his arduous journey...
Idyia: He kept repeating things like "I beg you, send me back to that day" or "send me back to that war..."
Idyia: So, I used the bottle's mirage to recreate the battlefield from his mind.
Paimon: Oh! So when he mentioned "finally returning" in the letter...
Idyia: It's probably because when he woke up in a daze, the mirage surrounding him was already the image of the battlefield in his memories. It was quite a scary battlefield, but he had such a big smile on his face.
Idyia: Why would someone wish to see something so terrifying in their last moments?
Traveler: Maybe it means something special to him?
Idyia: I don't know. But he looked very satisfied, in the end.
Idyia: If there was a wish he had to fulfill in a place like that, the years he spent carrying that burden must have been really hard.
Idyia: The Shinrou Casket was a big help in restarting the Central Hub. So, I owe Mr. Hideie a debt of gratitude.
Traveler: Maybe it's more exciting that way.
Traveler: Really? Let me have a look!
Idyia: I-It's just a metaphor. It's no different from your palm print. Nothing special, really.
