# A Teapot to Call Home: Part II


## Talk 1

Investigate: Well! It seems that we have a visitor...

## Talk 2

Investigate: Well! It seems that we have a visitor...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow... this teapot seems even bigger inside than Madame Ping's. There's even a great big house in the middle, too!
Paimon: Huh, but there's just a whole load of nothing around it...
Traveler: Get chiseling, Paimon — you could carve us a whole house out of this rock.
Paimon: Paimon can't do that! Well, you're the one with a sword, anyway — you do it!
Paimon: Still... why is it so empty here apart from that house?
Paimon: Oh, wait a second, what is that?
Traveler: Go dig a burrow to live in for now, I guess?
Paimon: Hey! There's a perfectly good house right over there. Why should Paimon have to live in a hole in the ground!?

## Talk 5

Investigate: Well! It seems that we have a visitor...

## Talk 6

Investigate: Well! It seems that we have a visitor... Oh?
Paimon: Ah, it's Tubby! From a distance, Paimon thought it was just a huge finch!
Paimon: So you're the "little helper" Madame Ping mentioned?
Investigate: Madame Ping... Oh, you must mean Ping! Yes, she did summon me here. She told me much about you.
Investigate: You know, back when we met in the Mondstadt tavern, I had a feeling that we would meet again.
Investigate: It seems I was right. But it's still a nice surprise to meet you here.
Investigate: You may leave all matters regarding the upkeep of this realm to me.
Investigate: Your journey may be far from over... but at least this way, you will not want for a comfortable place to sleep each night.
Traveler: So, what's a teapot spirit, exactly?
Investigate: Though it is the adepti who create realms such as this, they generally do not have the time of day to attend to the banal matter of their maintenance.
Investigate: Thus, we teapot spirits were created to help guard their realms and manage their affairs.
Investigate: You may consider me a butler, if you will.
Investigate: Now, allow me to explain this realm to you...
Investigate: Have you any blueprints on you? Specifically, blueprints with beautiful rooms, chairs, and the like.
Investigate: As long as you have a blueprint, you can refashion this realm however you please.
Paimon: Blueprints? Oh, that's right! Granny handed us some when she gave us the teapot, didn't she? Let's take them out and have a look!
Investigate: Yes, these are the blueprints I'm talking about. Go on, open them up...
Investigate: Just commit the image of the objects to memory and prepare the necessary materials...
Investigate: Then, simply release the thought from your mind and the object in the blueprint shall appear within this teapot.
Paimon: Wow, is that all it takes? Then... we could build a whole city inside, couldn't we!
Investigate: Hmm... I doubt it. A golden-eyed adeptus explained this to me at some point in the past.
Investigate: He said that even though Sub-Space Creation is a product of adeptal power, even that has its limits.
Investigate: This world is not a true one, after all. It provides merely a moment of brief respite from the mortal realm, not a means of escaping it entirely.
Paimon: A golden-eyed adeptus? Paimon wonders — who could that be...
Investigate: I hardly remember myself. What's more, I have never seen that adeptus again since...
Traveler: How very strange...
Investigate: Well, let's not dwell on that. Have a look around — best you get accustomed to this realm.
Investigate: If there's anything you would like to ask, just look for me.
