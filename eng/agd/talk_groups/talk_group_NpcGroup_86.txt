Traveler: Sure. I'll go take a look.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Great! I've done so much research on this place. Do you wanna know more?

## Talk

Traveler: It's fine. I'll be able to handle it.

Traveler: Tell me more about this treasure trove.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Follow this road and you will come across *a tightly shut door*, behind that lies the legendary treasure trove! Apparently you only need to sacrifice the souls of *100* cursed monsters to the watcher of the maze, and then you can just pop open the treasure trove door!

Traveler: What do you mean "cursed..."?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: I'm not sure how it came to be, but the whole place is shrouded in a cursed fog. Even those with a Vision are only able to stay a short while before being forced out.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: With that said, *the chests here* are said to contain items that will help you to resist the fog's curse and *increase your time in the maze*! Some of the chests being guarded by monsters can only be opened *after the monster is defeated*. If you're going to give it a go, make sure to *pay attention to the time*!

Traveler: About the maze...
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Legend has it that it's been occupied by a horde of monsters that are now unable to truly die because of the curse, making them stronger and stronger instead. What's more is that every time you pass through a passageway, the monsters and mechanisms in the nearby rooms randomly change.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Records seem to suggest that the color of the rooms somehow correlates to the monsters within. *White rooms* generally only contain normal monsters while*blue and orange rooms* feature elite monsters, and seem to have a connection with the watcher of the maze...

Traveler: How do I sacrifice cursed monster souls?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: Killing a *normal monster* sacrifices only one cursed soul. Killing a stronger *elite monster* will sacrifice 4-6 souls. Keep this in mind when trying to reach 100 souls, especially given the time limit.

## Talk

Traveler: Who is the watcher of the maze?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: It's said that when you reach *75* sacrificed souls, the watcher of the maze will wake from a deep sleep and appear at a *random place* somewhere in the maze. Killing it will get you a whole load of souls â€” enough to open the treasure trove. But it's a very powerful monster, so make sure you *leave yourself enough time to battle it*!

## Talk

Traveler: I'll go give it a go.
