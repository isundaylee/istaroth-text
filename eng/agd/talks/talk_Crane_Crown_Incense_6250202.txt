Traveler: "Crane Crown Incense"?
Pingshan: Look, there's a stone hanging over the cliff of the Yilong Dais, like the head of a crane.
Pingshan: If you light one at the censer there, the adepti will hear your wish. Works every time, trust me on that!
Pingshan: The trip to the crane's head isn't for the faint-hearted, though. Many guests lost their composure as soon as they looked down.
Pingshan: That's why we now have a proxy service.
Pingshan: It'll cost you the equivalent of two cups of tea, but you get a wish that'll come true. Not a bad deal, right?
