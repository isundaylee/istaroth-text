Mermet: Good things? Well, I'm not so sure about that. You might want to ask the hydrology surveyors. They often come across all sorts of strange things during their surveys.
Mermet: However, I heard from a friend about a place nearby with a significant accumulation of "Magical Crystal Ore." I'm not sure if that qualifies as a "good thing" for you, but there you have it. I've marked their location on the map. If you're interested, you can go take a gander.
