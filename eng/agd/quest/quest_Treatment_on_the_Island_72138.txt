# Treatment on the Island


## Talk 1

Yasumoto: Yeargh!!! I'm... I'm nobody suspicious, I swear! Just a local doctor!
Yasumoto: If you don't believe me, I can take you to my place. If you want anything, take it. Please just let me go!
Yasumoto: Or take me to your General, Lord Kujou! Hâ€”He knows me!
Traveler: I think there's been a misunderstanding...
Yasumoto: Huh...? Oh, you don't look like someone from the Shogunate... or from Sangonomiya.
Yasumoto: Are you... an outlander? What are you doing here?
Traveler: Well...
Yasumoto: Well, anyway, you'd better leave here as soon as possible. Yashiori Island is very dangerous now.
Yasumoto: So far, there is no sign that the Tatarigami will disappear, and the Tenryou Commission is not going to withdraw any time soon.
Yasumoto: The island is no longer inhabitable, let alone suitable for sightseeing.
Yasumoto: If you're fleeing arrest by the commissioner, head west.
Yasumoto: The Tenryou Commission does not welcome unknown fugitives. But the pirates might take you in.
Traveler: What happened on the island?
Yasumoto: Hmm... Have a look for yourself. See what the city folks and Sangonomiya's people have done to us!
Yasumoto: First, it was the explosion in Tatarasuna. The sky was stained with strange colors that night...
Yasumoto: Many of my relatives and friends lost their jobs and now live in poverty. Many others were badly injured, and they were terrible to look upon when they finally returned home.
Yasumoto: Many of my friends... didn't manage to escape.
Yasumoto: Then, Sangonomiya's people destroyed the wards which suppressed the Serpent's remains. The Tatarigami arose and everyone on the island fled in a panic.
Yasumoto: The strange diseases brought by the Tatarigami are also spreading. Many of the residents here have become very ill.
Yasumoto: I'm afraid it's just a matter of time before it spreads to the camps of both armies.
Traveler: Where am I?
Yasumoto: This was one of the key places where the crystal used in making Inazuman Jade Steel was produced. As long as the crystal didn't run out, we could live comfortably without being constrained by the city folk.
Yasumoto: And now? You can barely find anyone alive on the island... I mean, like me, humans who can speak normally.
Traveler: Why don't you leave?
Yasumoto: You think I don't want to leave? That son of the Tenryou Commissioner has invited me before... he should still be in the army overseeing the battle.
Yasumoto: "You have medical skills, you are different from ordinary people. It's dangerous for you to stay on the island. Why don't you come to be my medic? I can refer you to my father."
Yasumoto: That's what he said, at least.
Yasumoto: Before the war, being able to treat a commissioner was an honor that I, as a countryside doctor, would never have dreamed of.
Yasumoto: But now... Think about it. The commissioner wouldn't lack for good doctors around his person. But what about Yashiori Island? The only person the sick here can count on is me.
Yasumoto: So I'm not going to leave. I won't treat either side of the battle. My only enemy is the Tatarigami.
Traveler: Is there anything I can help you with?
Yasumoto: No, nothing... Actually, forget that. Yes, to be quite honest, I really need some help.
Yasumoto: I need some special plants to make medicine for treating the strange diseases caused by the "Tatarigami". I can't say it'll work for sure, but it can't hurt to try.
Yasumoto: Problem is... the plants I need have been contaminated by the "Tatarigami," and they're mostly distributed in dangerous environments.
Yasumoto: If they're not cut off by water, the surrounding area is crawling with monsters... not to mention that the Tatarigami is particularly intense around these parts...
Yasumoto: For someone of my level of courage and ability, it'd be tough to handle it.
Yasumoto: And as a doctor, I dare not take that kind of risk to collect some plants. So I've had to resort to slow-acting, cautious treatments, and haven't had the chance to test out any improved remedies in a long time.
Yasumoto: Outlander, I see you've brought a wind glider with you. You must be an experienced traveler. I'm sure you'll be able to deal with dangers like this.
Yasumoto: So, I hope you can help me gather the right ingredients in these locations.
Yasumoto: Come meet me here once you've gathered the plants. Don't worry about the reward. I still have some savings.
Yasumoto: Although it's an assignment given by a stranger, I hope you will consider it. Thank you very much.
Yasumoto: By the way, please be careful on your way.
Traveler: You look dejected.
Traveler: It's a long story...
Traveler: How suspicious...

## Talk 2

Yasumoto: Oh, you're here.
Yasumoto: Have you gathered the herbs I mentioned?

## Talk 3

Yasumoto: Blarghhh!! Ahem... ha... ha...
Traveler: Are you all right?
Yasumoto: Well... ahem, it tastes bitter and my tongue has gone numb. Local paralysis might be caused by the Tatarigami.
Yasumoto: It tastes horrible. But seems harmless.
Yasumoto: It may take a long time to observe the side effects of the medicine. I don't know... Hey?
Yasumoto: #They... They're coming toward us! Traveler! Get rid of them!
Traveler: It doesn't look very tasty...

## Talk 4

Yasumoto: Yes, yes, the stems and leaves are all intact. And they are still fresh... Thank you very much.
Traveler: That's all, right?
Yasumoto: Good, yes. That's enough. Now, I can start researching some new remedies.
Yasumoto: Thank you again for your effort. Here is the reward I promised you. I hope it's not too paltry a sum for you.
Yasumoto: By the way, outlander...
Yasumoto: Ah, excuse me. I have troubled you so much, but I still don't know what to call you.
Traveler: #Just call me Traveler.
Yasumoto: #Traveler, if you are interested in helping me again, please come back later.
Yasumoto: Of course, I'll compensate you fairly. Haha.

## Talk 5

Yasumoto: #Thank you, Traveler. I'm sorry if I've caused you any inconvenience.
Traveler: No, it's fine.
Yasumoto: I have mixed a new remedy with the herbs you gathered. But I don't have any test subjects to assess the efficacy of the medicine.
Yasumoto: #Traveler, can you please...
Traveler: Please tell me straight-forward.
Yasumoto: #Traveler, can I ask you to witness the efficacy of my new remedy?
Yasumoto: The new prescription is still unstable and there's no way to foresee the worst consequences.
Yasumoto: So I hope at least someone can witness my success... Or help me deal with the consequences, if the worst comes to the worst.
Traveler: Alright.
Traveler: It's nothing.

## Talk 6

Yasumoto: Phew... Phew... My heart almost jumped out. Thank you for saving my life. I won't forget it.
Yasumoto: This is a normal phenomenon. Living beings affected by Tatarigami will be unconsciously attracted to inauspicious energy.
Yasumoto: Because this remedy is saturated with Tatarigami energy, it's normal that it would attract them.
Yasumoto: Phew, anyway... I think I know how to improve this remedy now.
Yasumoto: But the last failure wasted some fresh herbs. I need some more herbs to continue with my new remedy evaluations.
Yasumoto: #In your upcoming journey, Traveler, please watch out for any useful herbs on the island. Just leave them in the bamboo basket in front of the house in the mornings.
Yasumoto: I will give you the reward as I've promised. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait a while.
Yasumoto: #Traveler, it's fine if you're busy. Maybe I can find someone else to help.
Traveler: You got it!
Yasumoto: #Goodbye, traveler Traveler. I hope you will have a safe journey on Yashiori Island.
Traveler: Sure, I'll take care of it.

## Talk 7

Yasumoto: Thank you very much for your help. But please be careful on Yashiori Island... This is not a safe place to stay.
