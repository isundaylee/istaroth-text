Traveler: So, know a thing or two about furnishings?
Goth: I was originally planning to renovate the hotel, but then the Fatui booked the whole place out. Now, I no longer have any need for these blueprints... Take a look, maybe you'll find one you like.

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Goth: To be frank, the Fatui's actions are more concerning to me than those of Stormterror.
Goth: Whenever I pass by, they always seem to be having some sort of meeting. They've even chased all the staff in charge of cleaning their accommodations away...
Goth: What are they planning? I do hope that they aren't hatching some nefarious plot. It will bring the name of the Goth Grand Hotel down for sure...
Goth: Well, never mind. They paid in full, at the very least.

Traveler: Who are you?
Goth: I'm Ludwig, but all my friends in the city call me "Goth."
Goth: Goth is my family name. The Goth family has a long, proud heritage serving the people of Mondstadt.
Goth: From the Dawn Breeze Inn to the latest and greatest addition, the Goth Grand Hotel, the Goth family have been involved in the hotel and catering industry serving personal and business guests right from the start.
Goth: We might not be as illustrious as the Gunnhildr family, who defend Mondstadt against invasion, but even so each member of the Goth family is proud of the work we do.

Traveler: Tell me about the Goth Grand Hotel.
Goth: The Goth Grand Hotel is part of the Goth family's hotel enterprise. I am the owner and manager.
Goth: But whatever your requirements are right now, the Goth Grand Hotel will be unable to accommodate them in the short term.
Goth: The reason is that not long ago, the Fatui booked out the entire premises indefinitely.
Goth: If you ask me why... It seems they were dissatisfied with the accommodation provided to them by the Knights of Favonius. I suppose that says something about the luxuriousness of the Goth Grand Hotel... Heh.
Goth: This whole business actually runs contrary to the Goths' spirit of service to the people of Mondstadt... But Master Pantalone of the Fatui offered an unbelievably generous amount for the booking, it was difficult to refuse...

Traveler: What other business does your family do?
Goth: Apart from the hotel, we also offer rental accommodation. It's more cost-effective for longer-term visitors.
Goth: But we don't have any vacancies right now. Since the Fatui booked out the whole hotel, demand for rented accommodation has soared.
Goth: Speaking of vacancies... Technically, we do have one place still available. But someone went and locked the door with some kind of seal, and now it won't open. We can't exactly rent it out when the tenant won't be able to get inside...
Goth: All this is to say that if you're looking to rent, the best I can offer is to put a word in with the folks who deal with that side of things, ask them to keep an eye out for you.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Tell me about the magic laboratory.
Goth: It's finally being put to use again, thanks to that astrologer.
Goth: The only issue is that the equipment takes up a lot of space. Which is fine if you're just working in there, but not if you want to sleep and eat there too.
Goth: I was going to recommend somewhere more spacious to her, but she flat-out dismissed the idea. "It's easier to focus one's energy in difficult circumstances," she said.
