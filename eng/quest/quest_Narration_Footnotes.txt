# Narration Footnotes


## Talk 1

Kirara: Hey! Are you guys already finished with everything in the Metropole?
Kirara: No need to prioritize me — there's just this place I really wanna go check out. Feel free to get back to me once you've got everything sorted out.

## Talk 2

Kirara: Huh? I was sure there'd be people here...
Detective: ...There once was a goddess who ruled over fate. Before she died, she left three riddles for the kingdom she'd created.
Paimon: What... Who said that?
Detective: Long story short, on this day, a sentient feline, an outlander, and a, uh... diminutive pixie arrived on the scene.
Detective: They saw a narrow path off to the side.
Paimon: Okay, but which side?
Kirara: Yeah, if you gave ambiguous instructions like that to a Komaniya Express courier, they'd give you the parcel right back and tell you to write the delivery address more clearly.
Detective: ...Despite how obvious the answer was, the perplexed pixie and the flummoxed feline struggled to work it out. Hmm, although perhaps a small part of the blame could be attributed to my dull narration...
Detective: Alright, let's try this again: *clears throat* "The path on the left-hand side seemed to give off an enticing fragrance, as if to say: 'This is the way to wealth and glory!'"
Kirara: Ooh! That sounds like the start of a good story! Then what, then what?

## Talk 3

Traveler: Police, open up!
Detective: ...That's actually quite an amusing approach. It's probably not going to get us anywhere, but I do admire your sense of humor, and your commitment to it.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 1: Who is it?

## Talk 4

Traveler: We're here for a routine inventory check.
Detective: Ah, what an ingenious idea! Far more intelligent than Boborano's ancestors. But I still recommend against this answer.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 1: Who is it?

## Talk 5

Traveler: #{NICKNAME}-Marquis and {M#his}{F#her} retinue.
Kirara: The Great Youkai, Nekomata-in-Boots!
Paimon: And the Trusty Travel-Guide Pixie— Uhh, travel-guide! Trusty travel-guide.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 2: By which virtue did the ancients defeat the dragon?

## Talk 6

Cappet: Ah, welcome, esteemed and noble outlander. Allow us to introduce ourselves.
Albizzi: We represent the three great clans of this realm, having been selected as its authorized historical supervisors.
Boborano: Our purpose being to await the arrival of ones such as yourselves, who shall remove the clockwork key.
Cappet: My name is—
Kirara: You're Cappet, he's Albizzi, and that's Boborano. Right?
Kirara: You've done so much talking that we can already tell you apart by your voices.
Paimon: Aren't we missing someone, though? The guy who led us here to begin with?
Cappet: Who?
Detective: *clears throat* And thus was born the long-awaited fellowship, destined to uncover the truth of the past. Allow me to quote, if I may: "In the history of Constellation Metropole, a new page has begun."
Kirara: Him.
Boborano: Well, there's no fourth person, so which of you is the ventriloquist? Come on, out with it.
Albizzi: We've never heard that voice before. But he sounds like he'd be good at reading bedtime stories to children.
Cappet: Whoever it is, I don't know and I don't care. Forget about him. We have far more important things to focus on, like where our journey goes from here.
Albizzi: That key you hold is the pivot point about which the past and present of the Metropole revolve. However, between our three clans there is some... dispute over the historical record.
Boborano: Each clan has its own version of history, detailing the clan's origins and the tale of the dragon of old. And unfortunately, we don't know which one is the truth.
Paimon: Dragon? You mean, the one that's been acting up recently?
Boborano: Oh — no, not that one, you adorable little pixie. When I say "dragon of old"—
Cappet: ...He means, a dragon that would be really, really old if it was still with us today, but it was defeated in ancient times. The new one has nothing to do with our clan history.
Kirara: Uhh, was that supposed to be a joke...? Anyway, so you've been waiting for someone to remove the key so you can finally explore the truth of the past?
Boborano: Not just explore it, but argue incessantly about it. Honestly, I don't care that much. Cappet's the one who's always bothering us about it.
Albizzi: What we need to figure out is who resolved the dragon crisis. We have to know that before we can decide which is the Supreme Clan.
Cappet: The moment you removed the key from where it was lodged, you became the Honorary Marquis. We humbly beseech you, noble outlander—
Traveler: #Call me {NICKNAME}.
Cappet: #Noble Marquis {NICKNAME}, we ask you to help us — you, and your talking puss-in-boots, and the pale, floating pixie.
Kirara: Puss-in-boots, are you serious!? It's better than "demon-feline," but still...
Albizzi: Embrace it, my friend, embrace it. Most cats don't wear boots or speak, do they?
Kirara: I'm not even a "cat"! I'm a nekomata! Now that you know the word, I expect you to use it!
Cappet: Please allow me to lead you all to a sacred memorial site. It will be much easier to explain what needs to be done once we are there.
Black Screen Text: Cappet leads the party to the so-called "sacred memorial site."

## Talk 7

Cappet: This place is sacred to my clan. It is where our brave forefathers once took up arms against the dragon of old.
Cappet: After a bitter battle that dragged on for many days and nights, finally our forefathers fought the dragon into submission, and it fled. ...They took turns, though. Some forefathers worked the day shift, while others worked the night shift.
Traveler: So they worked shifts while the poor dragon had to work around the clock?
Cappet: So they say. It's just a legend though.
Boborano: Wait a second! Did I just hear you admit that your clan's history is just a legend?
Cappet: History, legend — who cares? My clan was definitely courageous, that's the point. That's the truth.
Cappet: And isn't the truth what we've all been arguing about non-stop for all these years?
Detective: #Cappet's words gave {NICKNAME} food for thought: Could it be that "the truth" in a fictional world is equivalent to "fiction" in the real world?
Detective: But that would have to wait. Apparently, Cappet was not alone in his pilgrimage to this sacred site — unwanted company had arrived.
Detective: #{NICKNAME} and the talking cat— Ahem, nekomata decided to teach them some manners.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Courage and strength.
Detective: Oh, no no no, don't say that. Even though the writings you saw do prove that bravery has its uses...
Albizzi: Uh, you do realize we can hear everything you're saying, right?
Detective: If you say it out loud, you'll only set those three off arguing again. Thinking it is fine, but please promise me you won't say it.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 2: By which virtue did the ancients defeat the dragon?

## Talk 9

Cappet: Your martial prowess and show of courage are a more vivid re-enactment of my ancestors' feats that suit the modern aesthetic.
Cappet: Now, let's get down to business.
Cappet: As we all know, time is but an illusion. Time may flow line-by-line, page-by-page, or frame-by-frame. But usually, it flows in the form of springs and gears.
Albizzi: And that clockwork key you have in your hand can turn back time, and make the past reappear.
Boborano: Actually, my view is that the illusion of time is more of a problem of consciousness. Gears power the body, while the body is the vessel of the conscious mind.
Boborano: But the mind cannot understand the dimension of time, so we experience instead an endless continuum of moments as the pinion of now turns along the rack of ages.
Kirara: I... I'm getting flashbacks to when I was delivering packages to the Sumeru Akademiya...
Detective: A teacher once asked Albizzi what his greatest fear was, and he replied: "dragons." Boborano was asked the same question. He replied "time," and repeated the argument we just heard.
Detective: The teacher then turned to Cappet, and posed the same question. He replied "Boborano."
Cappet: The manuscript that tells the truth of the historical record, the blueprint to all of creation, the work of the great mage themselves — it can be found at the beginning of the gear-rack, and on the very first page of the book.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon didn't follow all that. But basically, you're just saying that we need to put the key in and turn it all the way back?
Cappet: Exactly. It is said that in the beginning, the Goddess of Creation took the Goddess of Fate's manuscript as a blueprint, placed it under the Goddess of Prophecy's starry realm, and generated the world from a few magic arrays.
Cappet: So in a few moments, when the great clockwork key turns the local time here back to the very beginning, we will restore the magic arrays back to their original configurations.
Kirara: Hold on, isn't stealing part of the blueprint of creation a little dangerous? Also, how are we supposed to know the original configurations of the magic arrays?
Cappet: Ah, well the general shapes of the configurations have been passed down over the ages. They now form the family crests of each of our clans. So you'll just need to reference my family crest, and join the dots accordingly.
Cappet: To address your other concern... When the house has already been built, do you really think that taking away the construction crew and blueprint will cause it to collapse?
Detective: #{NICKNAME}-Marquis prepares to insert the great clockwork key into the nearby keyhole.

## Talk 10

Traveler: Hard work and wealth.
Detective: ...To be completely honest, "hardwork" is a bit of an alien concept to us here in the Constellation Metropole. We have "hardware," and we have "clockwork," but not "hardwork."
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 2: By which virtue did the ancients defeat the dragon?

## Talk 11

Cappet: Behold, the sacred writings that record the truth of— No wait, that have shaped the truth of history. Gather around, and let us bear witness!
Cappet: Feast your eyes, rejoice, and cheer. For this is the unquestionable truth! Look at the signature — nobody is capable of forging that!
Albizzi: I don't believe it! So... all along, our histories have been false?
Boborano: Don't lose heart, Albizzi. It does not follow from "his is true" that "ours are false."
Cappet: That might be the most bogus logic I've ever heard! But keep up the mental gymnastics, Boborano. I've been waiting for that look of jealousy on your face my whole life, and I'm gonna savor it.
Detective: And yet, it seemed that this conundrum could indeed have more than one solution. Everyone agreed that there may be more than one truth.
Detective: The party decided to visit the sacred sites of the other clans, and see what their documents had to say.
Cappet: Isn't a narrator supposed to remain detached and objective? It feels like you're forcing a narrative agenda on us here.
Cappet: Well, whatever. I'm in a good mood, let's do it. The instructions say to repeat the process three times, and besides — I'm looking forward to watching you both be sorely disappointed.
Boborano: Let's do my clan next. I'll lead the way.

## Talk 12

Detective: The party finds no pedestal in which to place the great clockwork key, only a locked door.
Cappet: Where's your clan's pedestal? Lemme guess, you hid it away in advance to save yourself the embarrassment of having it exposed as a fake?
Boborano: You done? Okay. Now, since my clan's main claim to fame is—
Cappet: Misinformation, half-truths, and fabrication...
Boborano: Oh, shut up, Cappet.
Detective: Shut up, Cappet.
Cappet: I swear, if I wind up dead one day, the murderer was Boborano. Let those be my last words.
Boborano: My clan's claim to fame is that we outwitted the dragon of old and stole its treasure. Ergo, all articles of value that we own — including the pedestal for the clockwork key — lie behind that door.
Kirara: So next step is, open the door?
Boborano: Almost. There's one step before that. The door is protected by a smart interrogation system. We have to answer its questions, and if we get them wrong, it will alert law enforcement.
Paimon: Geez. Well, do you at least know the answers?
Boborano: The correction fluid of time has dyed white the pages of the book of wisdom. ...Uh, no. No, I don't know the answers.
Boborano: But worry not, I had a quick word with the constabulary in advance. They'll ignore the alarm if we get the questions wrong. So answer without fear.
Voice From Behind the Door: (There is no response from the door, and nothing unusual about it.)
Traveler: (Knock on the door.)
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 1: Who is it?

## Talk 13

Traveler: Wisdom.
Cappet: If this is the right answer, I swear I'll—
Voice From Behind the Door: Correct.
Cappet: Ugh, a barefaced lie! So low.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 3: Which is more real, the fiction of the outside world, or the truth of this world?

## Talk 14

Boborano: Now, let me see what—
Cappet: What elaborate fiction the clan of wisdom was able to conjure up.
Boborano: If anyone's listening, I would like to submit these as my last words: "I surrender. I'm the one who murdered Cappet."
Boborano: Haha, look! Look, my clan's history is true as well. There's that same unforgeable signature again, right here!
Cappet: What!?
Albizzi: Does this mean that my clan is the only odd one out...?
Boborano: Given that my clan's wisdom is such a subject of ridicule in your eyes, I will now appeal to my own personal intelligence — which I believe far surpasses that of my clan at large — and make a prediction:
Boborano: It seems likely that the claims made by each of our clans regarding their history and virtue are all true.
Albizzi: Boborano... How can that be?
Kirara: Ah, I get what's going on. Once when I was drinking with Guuji Yae, she bet me a round of Dried Fish that I couldn't guess which cup the Umeboshi was under.
Kirara: Whichever one I guessed, I was always wrong, and Guuji Yae would lift a different cup to reveal the Umeboshi.
Kirara: But then I learned later from one of the shrine maidens, Miyuki, that all of the cups had an Umeboshi under them! *sigh*... Just goes to show, I still got a long way to go before I become a great youkai.
Paimon: Don't mind fox lady, that's just her way of teasing you!
Boborano: Oh! Actually, that reminds me. We can now open these three treasure chests. And unlike the guessing game you mentioned, this one's not a trick...
Albizzi: Cool... Well, once you've plundered the last of Boborano's family wealth, we can go to my clan's place.

## Talk 15

Detective: The cohort of truth-seekers followed Albizzi to his clan's sacred site. They arrived to the sight of a giant guard towering over them.
Albizzi: Up ahead is my clan's gigantified guard. He can be a little pig-headed, and he's incredibly strong. Your weapons won't even scratch him.
Kirara: Wait, but wasn't Cappet's clan the one that's all about strength? So... What do you guys believe in then?
Albizzi: Oh, the guard is one of Cappet's people. Size is a coveted trait in the clan of strength, after all.
Albizzi: Mine is the clan of empathy, and our key contribution is... growth serum!
Kirara: ...What's empathetic about that?
Albizzi: Our ancestors believed that, just maybe, the dragon of old didn't mean us any harm at all. Perhaps the dragon simply didn't notice us, since we are so very tiny.
Albizzi: So they drank the growth serum, and grew even larger than the dragon. Then, they sat the dragon down, calmly explained their perspective, and eventually taught it how to empathize.
Kirara: Uhhh...
Albizzi: The serum isn't what it once was, though. Nowadays, it doesn't make you grow all that much, and it actually makes you lose your empathy... So, I advise we take a detour.

## Talk 16

Traveler: I don't know.
Detective: #C'mon, you'll have to do better than that, kid. I mean, {NICKNAME}-Marquis. You and your friends are the only ones who know the truth about us.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 3: Which is more real, the fiction of the outside world, or the truth of this world?

## Talk 17

Albizzi: We should be getting close.
Kirara: Why is this place so full of junk? Are you the kind of people who never throw away the box when you buy something, 'cause you're worried you won't be able to return it without the original packaging?
Kirara: We'll never find the Oracle Pillars in all this mess!
Albizzi: Never mind that, we have a more pressing issue... It seems there's a slight problem with my clan's family crest. The Marquis may need to utilize their wisdom to solve the issue.
Boborano: Wisdom too, huh? Well, you guys have a bit of everything, don't you? Except empathy.

## Talk 18

Traveler: Both are false.
Detective: Please try to avoid being unnecessarily cruel in your response.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 3: Which is more real, the fiction of the outside world, or the truth of this world?

## Talk 19

Albizzi: This is the last one.
Albizzi: The signature! ...So it's true! Empathy is one of the founding virtues of Constellation Metropole too!
Boborano: Just as we suspected. All three are the truth.
Cappet: Okay, well this is a lot to process. I feel a little empty inside... Yes, we found the truth, but... there's too much truth.
Kirara: I get you. It's like... in Inazuma, when there were only six books in the Mirage Warriors series, it was really popular.
Kirara: But by the time book number eighty-eight came out, nobody wanted to read it. They'd all lost interest.
Detective: A brief moment of joy is drowned out by a growing feeling of melancholy. But perhaps there is a glimmer of hope to be found, too?
Detective: Anyone? Anyone? Alright, I'll say it: How is it the case that these three versions of history can all be true at once?
Paimon: That's exactly what Paimon was wondering... But Boborano kind of already explained it away earlier.
Paimon: So Paimon was worried she'd look stupid for asking the question.
Boborano: It's not a stupid question at all, my dear little pixie. While I did postulate that different truths may coexist, there is an issue when it comes to these three truths in particular.
Boborano: The problem is, all three truths are the history of the exact same thing — namely, the dragon and the Metropole's origins. Yet all three bear the signature, showing that they're genuine.
Detective: Suddenly, the sound of a bell rings out!

## Talk 20

Traveler: Perhaps... both are equally real.
Detective: Hear, hear. Who can be sure that the outside world isn't just a dream? And that when the dreamer wakes up, they won't just find themselves inside a novel?
Detective: There is no way to know, therefore both are equally real.
Voice From Behind the Door: All correct. You may have the key pedestal.
Black Screen Text: The door opens, and a puff of smoke wafts out.\nAfter the smoke clears, the pedestal appears.
Boborano: #{NICKNAME}-Marquis, you know what must be done. Please insert the great clockwork key.
Boborano: Oh — and this is my family crest.

## Talk 21

Kirara: Phew, we made it out. Dunno if we'll still be needing this clockwork key, but I yoinked it out before we ran, just in case!
Paimon: Okay, but back to the truth problem. There are three conflicting versions of the truth, and somehow they're all still true. What is that supposed to mean?
Boborano: I don't know. I doubt anyone here in Simulanka could make sense of it. All we do know is that any manuscript bearing her signature has to be valid.
Cappet: She is the Goddess of Fate, the creator of all of this. And all these manuscripts are her grand design.
Albizzi: The reason we argued about who was right was that we didn't know enough about the truth of the past. But now we have the truth, so we just have to accept it.
Albizzi: As surely as we will follow the clockwork path designed for us, so is this the course that history has taken. It is clear and incontrovertible.
Boborano: We will never argue again. Thank you all.
Detective: Is that all there is to it? Is this where the decision made at the first crossroads of destiny has led us to? A pointlessly happy ending?
Detective: Eh, overthinking it would be equally pointless. Well, that's enough for one day — time to take a break.
Paimon: Could you be any more cryptic? You're planning something, Paimon knows it...
Boborano: Whatever happens, today was a breakthrough in my journey of discovery. I will go back and share it with my clan.
Cappet: Me too.
Albizzi: And me.
Kirara: Let's leave it there for today then. I'm sure we'll find out what else Mr. Narrator has planned for us tomorrow.

## Talk 22

Traveler: We're all good!
Kirara: Great! Then let's go!

## Talk 23

Traveler: I'll be right back...
Kirara: Sure. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere!

## Talk 24

Bystander: Oh my god, this is terrible! I don't understand, the three great clans of Constellation Metropole have finally made peace with each other. Who could have done this?
Kirara: What happened? Oh no, someone's lying on the ground... Cappet!
Paimon: How did this happen?
Boborano: Cappet, you idiot, wake up! You need to revise your last words, or everyone's gonna start suspecting me!
Detective: Last words? What did he say?
Albizzi: "If I wind up dead one day, the murderer was Boborano."
Boborano: Gah, you could have at least pretended to not remember it!
Albizzi: I'm sorry, Boborano, but this is an interrogation. I have to give the detective straight answers...
Detective: Don't worry, Boborano. I don't consider you a suspect, nor do I have the authority to charge anyone with a crime. So, are you the last people to have had contact with him?
Traveler: Y—Yes...
Detective: My sincere condolences. You were travel companions, right? It's a real tragedy... I'm afraid he'll be out cold for another hour and a half, at least.
Paimon: ...Huh?
Detective: I know. It's despicable. Hitting someone in the back of the head is the second-worst act of cruelty there is. The first being replacing their gear oil with extra-strong glue.
Kirara: So... Cappet's... not dead?
Detective: His gears, metal frame, and shell are all still in excellent condition. It's just his energy supply that's been all messed up...
Detective: Wait, but... Surely you can't be suggesting that just because Cappet isn't broken, there's no need to go looking for the culprit...?
Paimon: No no, there's a need! Huge need.
Detective: ...Unfortunately, this is rapidly turning into a cold case. There's no evidence, and no witnesses. Unless there's an official clockwork pedestal of the Goddess of Prophecy around here somewhere...
Detective: *cough* *cough* ...Ahem, excuse me.
Detective: Then, suddenly, the long-lost dragon of old flew across the sky!
Kirara: Where, where?
Boborano: I didn't see anything... Wait, why can't I move?
Detective: My mistake, it was just a cloud. Or a bird, or something.
Detective: If only we could turn time backwards and replay the crime.
Traveler: Uh...
Kirara: Isn't that one of those... clockwork socket things, right behind you?
Detective: #Ah! So it is. No wonder everyone here is suddenly struggling to move. {NICKNAME}, if you please, let's recreate the crime scene.

## Talk 25

Detective: Well, that clears it up. Cappet was walking along the street, then he suddenly collapsed. He was faking it.
Paimon: What, so case closed? Aren't you supposed to investigate a little more first?
Detective: We literally replayed the crime scene and saw it with our own eyes. There's no need for any evidence-gathering or powers of deduction now. Besides, maybe the truth is inherently strange by nature.
Detective: Like how Constellation Metropole has three histories, each of which is the truth.
Kirara: But didn't you say Cappet was struck in the back of the head and knocked unconscious?
Detective: For all I know, he could have bashed his head against the toilet bowl before leaving the house. Then walked here in a daze before finally passing out.
Detective: As for why he might have done that... My guess is:
Kirara: ...Is...?
Detective: With the Supreme Clan question left unanswered, and the tension in Constellation Metropole suddenly wiped away, he was looking to create a new source of conflict.
Detective: Only then would the city feel alive again.
Paimon: Huh... Do we really think he's capable of that, though? Sounds like a pretty complicated conspiracy for the average Simulanka resident...
Kirara: #{NICKNAME}, something about the crime scene isn't sitting right with me... It just seems unnatural.
Kirara: Also, anything outside of the immediate area won't have appeared in the replay. Is it possible that something was missing from the scene?
Kirara: Why don't we search the area?
Detective: Wait, what are you doing?
Kirara: Oh, we're uh... we're gonna head to Cappet's house to check the toilet bowl for signs of an impact.

## Talk 26

Shop Owner: You're... not from these parts, are you? Just visiting?
Kirara: Yep, that's right. Why, what's up?
Shop Owner: Ah. Well, I was gonna offer you a great job in the toytanium mines. A safe and secure working environment.
Kirara: Uh... Doesn't sound very safe... At least, not as safe as being a courier.
Shop Owner: To keep the toytanium ore intact, we use specially designed pickaxes that can't cut through it. Even if you struck a person with it, it wouldn't so much as leave a scratch.
Shop Owner: And in terms of labor intensity, the work has been rated as class-two physical labor by a reputable organization. Even cats can do it.
Kirara: I'm not a— Ugh, never mind. I give up.
Paimon: Welcome to Paimon's world...
Shop Owner: Mind you, I don't know what happened today, but somehow a pickaxe has gone missing. Maybe one of the giant guards broke down, so someone took it to perform a rapid resuscitation procedure.
Kirara: Sounds pretty brutal for a first-aid technique...
Kirara: #Still, a missing pickaxe, huh... Is it just me, {NICKNAME}, or does that seem kinda suspicious?

## Talk 27

Grocery Store Owner: *sigh* Come here — whatever it is you were looking to buy, please do come back tomorrow. It's just, I have to close early today.
Grocery Store Owner: A bottle of growth serum has gone missing. If someone's stolen it with the intention of harming others, the consequences could be disastrous.
Grocery Store Owner: There's a whole investigation into it, so I gotta close the shop while I do an inventory count. If it turns out I'm wrong and I miscounted, I could be charged with filing a false report and disturbing the peace...

## Talk 28

Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

## Talk 29

Boborano: ...So it was you.
Detective: Hehe, hahahaha!
Detective: I would congratulate you for cracking the case, but since I did such an abysmal job of covering my tracks, you didn't exactly have your work cut out for you.
Detective: So all I can say is:
Kirara: ...Is...?
Detective: Catch me if you can!

## Talk 30

Boborano: Stop the poem, we have a situation... Something's up with this person.
Kirara: #{NICKNAME}, are you alright?
Traveler: Turns out... there's glue...
Black Screen Text: You try to stand up, but the glue is holding you firmly in place...
Paimon: C'mon, you can do it! Th—This can't be how our story ends...!
Traveler: (Try to stand up)
Black Screen Text: You manage to partially un-stick yourself. The issue isn't that you can't break free — it's more that you don't want to tear your clothes in the process. They mean a lot to you.
Kirara: Can I give you a hand? Or a tail, even?
Traveler: (Keep trying to stand up)
Black Screen Text: You finally free yourself and stand up, clothes intact.

## Talk 31

Kirara: You've got nowhere left to run!
Detective: Alright, I confess.
Paimon: That was fast!
Detective: Getting caught by you here was a backup plan. I don't know if what I've done will make things better or not.
Detective: Time to come clean. I am the narrator, the one who's been guiding you all this time.
Traveler: Yeah, I figured...
Detective: Hahaha, okay. I guess my voice-acting skills have some room for improvement.
Detective: Anyway, I only did what I did because—
Paimon: Why are you suddenly spilling the beans?
Detective: I poured my heart and soul into all this. I was worried you wouldn't ask.
Detective: The truth is, I was one of the first conscious beings ever made by the Goddess of Creation. And I've known for a long time that this whole world is just a fairytale, written by the Goddess of Fate.
Traveler: ...!
Detective: I know they say that fairytales are just made up for kids to read. But I refuse to believe that fairytales are just fictional stories, and nothing more.
Detective: The reason why Constellation Metropole has three origin stories is that the Goddess of Fate wrote three drafts, and couldn't decide which one she liked best.
Detective: Then, her cat trod all over them and they all got crumpled together. So the three worlds just sort of folded into one.
Detective: The Goddess of Fate was torn between them anyway, since she couldn't decide which ending was best for the dragon or the kids.
Detective: So when she saw what the cat had done, she simply decided to go with all three.
Paimon: Who'd have thought... But what does any of this have to do with what you did?
Detective: You're not a fictional character, so you couldn't hope to understand my sorrow. Honestly, I don't think there's anyone in all of Simulanka who would understand.
Detective: Every day that I experience, every interaction I have with another person... Is it really all just a work of fiction?
Detective: The only reason the three great clans wanted to find out the truth was for the pointless task of electing the Supreme Clan. I thought that once they'd learned the truth, it might make them curious enough to investigate further.
Detective: But as it turned out, they just... accepted it. And carried on living the same old lives.
Detective: I have to motivate them to keep looking for answers, now that they think they've learned the truth. I have to make them uncomfortable with the superficial explanation that they took at face value.
Detective: And I have to figure out, once and for all, while you real people from the outside world are still here: Are we real?
Paimon: Aw...
Detective: That's my full confession. Time for you to take me back. I'm guessing I'll probably be forced to make a public apology, then sentenced to half a day in solitary confinement. I definitely deserve half a day.
Detective: Oh, also, pass this message onto Cappet, Boborano, and Albizzi, if you could: The great clockwork key was originally put in place jointly by the ancestors of the three clans.
Detective: If the three of them had had any ability to cooperate whatsoever, they'd have been able to remove it by themselves.
Detective: Over all these years, not once have they ever tried removing it together.
Footnote: Oh, my poor child. There's one thing you've been mistaken about this whole time.
Kirara: Aah! Whose voice is that!? ...Detective, was that you? Your voice acting's actually pretty good.
Footnote: The reason fairytales are suitable for children is that they help them to understand the world.
Footnote: Fairytales may be works of fiction, but at their heart lies an internal logic that is undoubtedly real-world truth in a condensed form. Perhaps they simplify good and evil, and perhaps they hide the darkness in metaphors.
Footnote: But let there be no doubt: The world within fairytales is as real as can be. And by extension, you and your compatriots are also real.
Detective: Goddess! Is it really you!?
Footnote: The line that separates footnotes from narrative can never be crossed. Never the two shall meet. This is why you have never heard my voice before.
Footnote: But now, you wish to break free from the story — and there's a cat nearby — so you can hear my echo.
Kirara: Nekomata...
Detective: ...Just your echo...?
Detective: ...
Paimon: Aw... Poor detective...
Detective: So... we are a part of the real world, too...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You lead the surrendered detective back to Cappet...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "So we need a shot of the crime scene for evidence, a mugshot of the suspect for the records, and a photo of the heroes for posterity..." The guard mulled it over. "Three photos is overkill. Let's just get one big group photo at the crime scene."\n\n"Suspect, try and look more serious. Heroes, more natural please, happy smiles! ... But no smiling from the victim or their friends and family, thank you. No no, don't get up! Stay on the ground, we need to capture the crime-scene as-is!"\n\n\n"3, 2, 1, say cheeeeese!"
Traveler: (Weirdest photo experience of my life...)
Traveler: Gasp! Shock! My mind is blown!
Detective: You're overdoing it a little bit there.

## Talk 32

Kirara: So, are you all set? Ready to start investigating?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Constellation Metropole Royal Guard: Hello there. Have you seen my spear, by any chance?
Constellation Metropole Royal Guard: Someone was shouting about a dragon a minute ago, and I instinctively threw it into the sky, yeah...

### Additional Talk 2

Cappet: My head's spinning. Albizzi just gave me a quick rundown of the situation. So you caught the detective?
Paimon: Sorta, we chased him until he surrendered. Oh, and he asked us to pass on a message...
Black Screen Text: You tell the three about the rest of what happened...
Black Screen Text: ...And that they could have removed the great clockwork key if they'd just worked together.
Cappet: Does he really think we didn't try that? 'Cause we did. After six months in that place.
Boborano: That was my bad. I thought it was a stupid idea at the time, so I didn't really exert myself.
Albizzi: I, uh... I also sort of stopped trying after three years.
Cappet: You...! *sigh* Never mind, I'm partly to blame as well. On the second attempt, I just hugged the key and pretended like I was pulling as hard as I could.
Kirara: You guys are so lazy... My granny's neighbor's pet dog has nothing on you, and it spends all day every day sunbathing.
Cappet: Anyway, you said you heard the voice of the Goddess of Fate at the end? That's amazing.
Albizzi: There is a world beyond our own after all.
Cappet: What would you guys say to taking a trip to the outside world some time? Otherwise, I got bashed in the back of the head for nothing.
Boborano: Depends, do either of you know how to get there...? But yes, I agree, we should go. And not invite the detective, just to annoy him.
Boborano: But maybe the reason we never worried about whether we're real or not is that, unlike him, we weren't there to witness the creation of this world. We've never had any reason to doubt that we're real.
Boborano: If someone ever convinced me that these delightful dimwits, Cappet and Albizzi, weren't real... I'd be devastated.
Albizzi: Hehe.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: The growth serum?
Kirara: If it was the growth serum, Cappet would've been turned into a giant.
Paimon: Also, the bottle probably would've shattered when it hit him. We would have seen the debris on the ground.
Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: The guard's spear?
Kirara: If so, there's no way his head would still be in such good shape. He'd have a big dent in the back.
Paimon: And if the guard is to be believed, he had the spear in his possession right up until that guy shouted about the dragon.
Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: The pickaxe?
Paimon: If it was the pickaxe, Cappet sure is lucky it's not still lodged in his head...
Kirara: Actually, you're wrong there, Paimon. The foreman at the mine was just saying, this kind of pickaxe is designed not to damage toytanium, so it couldn't cause any superficial damage to residents here.
Kirara: But, you could probably knock someone out if you hit them hard enough. And it wouldn't leave a scratch.
Kirara: Let's take this back to the crime scene and replay it one more time.

### Additional Talk 6

Detective: Ah, you're back. How was the toilet at Cappet's house?
Kirara: Toilet? What about it? ...Oh yeah. Uh, forget that!
Traveler: (Show the pickaxe)
Detective: What's this about? What are you trying to say?
Kirara: We thought the way Cappet fell looked odd, so we searched the area for suspicious items and found this.
Kirara: It could have been deliberately placed out of range of the crime scene so it wouldn't show up when we replayed it. Now we've retrieved it, we were gonna replay it again — you don't mind, do you?
Detective: Oh, uh... I just remembered, I forgot to turn off the clockwork switch in my kitchen, I think I'll just—
Boborano: Oh no, you stay right there!
Detective: Uhh...
