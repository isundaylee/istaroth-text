Traveler: ...Giblets?
Su Er'niang: There's nothing to worry about, everything's washed thoroughly before I use it.
Su Er'niang: I have some customers who never used to go near any kind of animal innards, but after they'd tried it here they simply fell in love with it!
Su Er'niang: Go on, have a taste! Free of charge. If you like it, please come back and buy some more!

Su Er'niang: Chop suey...?
Su Er'niang: I know, I know, the name sounds a little odd.
Su Er'niang: But Zhongyuan Chop Suey is a local specialty here in Chihu Rock.
Su Er'niang: It all starts with rinsed giblets that are chopped into mince meat. Then you add some Tiger Fish gelatin along with some starch and other ingredients, and roll it into meatballs.
Su Er'niang: After a quick deep fry, they're ready to be enjoyed. Not a hint of fish in that wonderful aroma!
Su Er'niang: But it sure is troublesome having to explain the name to every outlander that shows up to eat here, whew!

Su Er'niang: Who's the fool that disagrees?
Su Er'niang: Why, that manager of the warehouse, Gou San'er. Who else!?
Su Er'niang: After working all morning to prepare the food, I saw him looking after the warehouse all by himself. He looked quite tired, so I offered him some...
Su Er'niang: Once he was finished, I asked him if he liked it. He said that he would have preferred something saltier and spicier!
Su Er'niang: Some nerve he has talking like that! And to think that I was kind enough to offer him some!
Su Er'niang: You see? I get all worked up just thinking about it. I'll be sure teach him a thing or two about good cooking!
