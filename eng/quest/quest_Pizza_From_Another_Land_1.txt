# Pizza From Another Land


## Talk 1

Matsumoto: *sigh* Is there anything in the world that will satisfy my taste buds?
Traveler: About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
Matsumoto: Oh, the pizza you mentioned tastes really good, and it also has a lot of local ingredients.
Matsumoto: However, I have tried the authentic Mushroom Pizza before.
Matsumoto: I remember that the pizza was made of Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Matsumoto: Hahaha, I just feel that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor.

## Talk 2

Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you've returned.
Kiminami Anna: How did it go, any feedback?
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza... Hmm, it's worth a try.
Kiminami Anna: The ingredients to prepare are Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Kiminami Anna: We have the other ingredients, but we usually don't stock up on Cheese...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, could I trouble you to get a block of Cheese?
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Kiminami Anna: I'm counting on you, then. Just a block of Cheese will do.
Traveler: You don't really use Cheese in the store?
Kiminami Anna: It's not that we don't use it at all, we just use it very rarely.
Kiminami Anna: After all, there are not many dishes in the store that require Cheese, so we don't really stock much of it...
Kiminami Anna: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler. Please help to bring me a block of Cheese.

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?

## Talk 4

Kiminami Anna: Thank you, these ingredients will do.
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza from Mondstadt, I don't know if I can make it successfully...
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Kiminami Anna: This pizza looks... pretty good...
Kiminami Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Kiminami Anna: I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
Kiminami Anna: If it's not bad...it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
