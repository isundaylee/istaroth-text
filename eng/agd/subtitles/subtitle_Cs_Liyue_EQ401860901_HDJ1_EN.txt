Red shall three bloodlines in the Bishui flow
The bones of eight heroes don frost and snow
Moon-graced by skiff my hook-blade I claim
As a pillar in the waters let it remain
The clashing blades like seafoam pass
Each one their end fate will decide
But you, Tao Dou, shall be cast down
Your body and soul shall not abide
Cavalry gold and iron march
Hearts stone-set on heaven's arch
Down starward street their mortal stride
And onward into myth they ride
For death stains not the virtues pure
And eastward flow vicissitudes sure
Names shall fade, hope's flame endures
Secret of the flame, blessing of Homa...
Redeem us, deliver us from evil
Hyah!
The fire's almost out...
Did we fail?
I have faith in the director
So
My time has come
There is no avoiding death
Nor predicting its time
The duty of Wangsheng
I now fulfill
Look!
Next Lantern Rite...
If you see a butterfly
That's me coming back to see you all
