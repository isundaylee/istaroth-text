# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Lynette: ...
Traveler: ...
Lynette: ...Now that's rare. People wanting me to start a conversation is a rather infrequent occurrence.
Lynette: After all, in most cases, this would just mean falling into an uncomfortable silence like this.
Traveler: Do you not like to chat?
Lynette: No, that's not it. You can often find me talking with other girls.
Lynette: They often gossip about the latest issues of serialized novels, or the gossip on who has a crush on whom...
Lynette: Just say "Oh, I see", "Wow, really?", or "Go on!" at the right moment... and the conversation will flow freely.
Lynette: ...It's a great way to conserve your energy. I highly recommend it.
Traveler: Well, if you don't talk, then silence is inevitable...
Lynette: Saying something requires first listening, then analyzing, constructing your idea, and finally speaking out loud.
Lynette: A back-and-forth conversation would require me to go through all the steps very efficiently. Mm... I've always found it quite taxing.
Lynette: ...Also, is it not true some people prefer to chat with someone who listens more than they talk?
Lynette: If you ever have something to vent about, feel free to come and confide in me. I have a lot of experience in comforting others and calming things down.
Lynette: Also, you can rest assured that your secrets will always be safe with me.
