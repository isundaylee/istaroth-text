# Our Animal Friends


## Talk 1

Zhenchen: All are welcome to join the "Claw Convoy" animal rescue society...
Traveler: Greetings!
Zhenchen: #Ah, Traveler, it's you. How do you do?
Zhenchen: Our guild is currently holding an event. Might that interest you?
Traveler: What sort of event are we talking about?
Zhenchen: Simply put, we're asking people to join the Claw Convoy, an animal rescue society sponsored by the Feiyun Commerce Guild, and help us take care of abandoned or endangered animals.
Zhenchen: The Guild has been working with volunteers from the various nations, helping to solve the widespread problem of stray animals through communal adoption.
Zhenchen: We've seen major expansion in recent years, which led us to start thinking about working with researchers like Ms. Lamiya in the field of endangered animal conservation.
Lamiya: Honestly, I'm glad to see my research bear fruit in this way too.
Zhenchen: Haha! Then we're of the same mind.
Zhenchen: Thanks to our volunteers and visionary researchers like Ms. Lamiya, many stray animals now have a home, and endangered species are being protected.
Zhenchen: Aside from Liyue, the Claw Convoy's animal care facilities may be found everywhere the Feiyun Commerce Guild is active, like in Mondstadt and Sumeru...
Zhenchen: As such, we're running this event to show our gratitude to our volunteers and to let everyone know just how many Convoy companions we've got out there.
Zhenchen: You can head over to the area where the adopted animals are staying to check on their actual living conditions, and take a small gift to go.
Zhenchen: The gifts were prepared by our staff and other animal adopters. Of course, before you claim a gift, you'll need to prepare something for other adopters as well.
Zhenchen: When the time comes, all gifts will be retrieved by a professional and delivered to the original adopter. No need for expensive gifts â€” they're just meant to convey your feelings.
Zhenchen: #So how about it, Traveler? Interested?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Zhenchen: Wonderful! It would be amazing to have a celebrity like you taking part.
Zhenchen: If you're ready, you can hand over your gift now. Our staff will pass it to the relevant adopter once the event ends.
Zhenchen: By the way, based on my personal experience, some of our adopters are interested in regional specialties, and others prefer good food.
Traveler: Absolutely, sign me up!

## Talk 2

Zhenchen: How about you split your gift into two boxes?

## Talk 3

Zhenchen: Okay, we'll pack these specialties into a gift box.

## Talk 4

Zhenchen: Alright, we'll pack this food into a box and send it out.
Zhenchen: Each animal behaves in its own unique way. We don't lock them away in cages. Instead, we employ professional caretakers to monitor their physical condition.
Zhenchen: Tracking them down is no easy task. You'll need the special Inscribed Tracker that Ms. Lamiya has developed.
Zhenchen: I'm not as knowledgeable as she is in this area, so I'll leave the explaining to her.
Lamiya: Agreed. Allow me to explain.
Lamiya: The underlying tech behind the Inscribed Mirror is related to the Akasha, and the operational specifics are quite complex, but don't worry, it's tested and safe.
Lamiya: We've already attached micro-transmitters to all the animals, so we just need to read the device's signal, and the mirror will reveal all that can be seen from the animal's perspective.
Lamiya: This device may need some improvements, but this footage will suffice for us to locate active animals.
Zhenchen: That's all there is to it. If you're ready, then we're happy to welcome you to the Claw Convoy!
Zhenchen: Use the Inscribed Mirror to find our animal friends. Both our adopters' gifts and the animals themselves will be waiting for you!

Lamiya: Maybe I should adopt an animal too? If only I could keep a Rishboland Tiger...
