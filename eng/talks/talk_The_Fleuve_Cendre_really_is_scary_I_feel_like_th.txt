# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The Fleuve Cendre really is scary. I feel like there's shady characters everywhere."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Relax, with the Spina di Rosula here, nobody will cause too much trouble."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Really? But I saw a huge dude dressed up like an Eremite today, one glance is enough to know he means business."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "You mean Jaime the Brute, right? That's normal, his job is collecting on debts, so of course he's gotta look tough."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "He's got quite the temper though, so I'd recommend you keep your distance. He's beaten people just for looking at him twice. That's why he's called the Brute."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Not necessarily. Today I saw old lady Bracari bump into his shoulder, and he apologized to her on the spot with perfect etiquette."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The Brute knows how to apologize? And to an old granny? Did you drink the wrong potion?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Not just that, you didn't see his totally obsequious way of doing it. Just like old Colin, shrinking away like a scared finch."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Haha, definitely a pity I didn't see that!"
