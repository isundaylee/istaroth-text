# The Great Mountain Survey


## Talk 1

Esther: Did you find my beacons?
Traveler: I did indeed.
Esther: Let me see... Yes, these are the ones, alright!
Esther: Ugh, look at the state of them... Those monsters clearly weren't gentle with them. But thankfully, they're not completely ruined.
Esther: *sigh* Still, I guess I won't be using them in the near future... Ah, can't be helped. I will have to make do with a smaller-scale survey...
Esther: I have some other beacons here. Could you set them up on the mountain for me?
Traveler: Where exactly?
Esther: ...Is that a yes? I'll take that as a yes! Thanks! I'll mark the spot on the map for you.
Esther: ...There. I've marked them all out. Just put the beacons in those general areas.
Esther: Make sure to put them up in high spots. The higher the altitude, the more accurate the survey.
Traveler: Why can't you do it yourself?
Esther: I don't dare... If not even a whole team of explorers could stand up to those monsters, I'm certainly not going back up there alone.
Esther: I can't find any other explorers planning a trip up there at the moment, but I also can't delay this indefinitely.
Esther: So, you're the only chance I've got. Seeing as you managed to fetch my beacons back so effortless last time, I think you're more than up to the task.
Esther: Thanks once again. I'll be sure to compensate you well!
Esther: Wait, let me mark the locations on the map for you...

## Talk 2

Esther: Are all the beacons in place?
Traveler: Yes.
Esther: Wonderful, that is an enormous help. Take these â€” along with my thanks, once again, for everything.
Esther: Ugh, with so few beacons for the survey, who knows if I'll be able to turn up anything of interest...

## Talk 3

Esther: There's no way this is enough beacons to survey the whole mountain...

## Talk 4

Esther: This beacon is useless... So's this one...
