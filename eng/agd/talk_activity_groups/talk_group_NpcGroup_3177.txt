Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...Hello, do you need something?

Traveler: You seem upset.
Matsukawa Souzen: As an officer with a duty towards Inazuma, I should naturally be upset about the current state of the nation.
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...When I think about the endless fighting between the Shogunate and the rebels, I can't even sleep or eat.
Matsukawa Souzen: If it keeps going on like this, Inazuma's finances will continue to worsen with each passing day. It's only a matter of time before it starts to affect the lives of the people...
Matsukawa Souzen: I hope that Her Excellency can act soon and fix the situation from the root of the problem herself...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Matsukawa Souzen: *sigh* ...Goodbye.

Traveler: Something seems to be troubling you.
Matsukawa Souzen: Inazuma has just gone through a series of changes. A new era is coming.
Matsukawa Souzen: To be honest, all this has made me too busy to have time for anything else, but I don't think that this is a bad thing, necessarily.
Matsukawa Souzen: Her Excellency has seems to have had something of a change of mood. I can only hope that...
Matsukawa Souzen: Ah, I shall not speak of this now. Whatever the case, our work in clearing our accounts is far busier than usual. Perhaps we can chat again some other time.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Matsukawa Souzen: Indeed. Farewell.
