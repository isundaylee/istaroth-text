Rahman: Well now, if it isn't our new friend!
Rahman: How are things going? How's your mood? Everything going fine?

Traveler: Fine. And you?
Rahman: Well, if I may be frank? Things are changing so very suddenly... It's hard not to feel lost.
Rahman: That's the truth of the matter, I fear.
Rahman: Though I'm not fond of the people on the other side of the Wall of Samiel, I'd like to think myself the sensible sort — I won't be having any further delusions about King Deshret's revival.
Rahman: We're friends now, I say — should you need me, I won't just stand idly by and watch.
Rahman: If I might say something else, I would warn you that you're up against the lofty Akademiya. Whatever you do, you've got to be careful.

## Talk 3

Rahman: We meet again. How have you been recently? Have things settled down a bit for you?

Traveler: A bit is about right. And you?
Rahman: Hah, well, I've actually gotten busier recently. Other than completing the work that Cyno has assigned to us, I still have my lady's protection to worry about.
Rahman: By "my lady," I mean Ms. Setaria, whom I'm sure you know. She left the Akademiya recently — with permission, of course.
Rahman: She wants to pass on the things she knows to the desert people. Both Lesser Lord Kusanali and Cyno have approved of this plan, and they've both helped quite a bit, too.
Rahman: Ah, this is a blessing that is hard to come by, especially for us, the children of King Deshret. We must hold it most dear indeed.

Traveler: Things aren't going too differently for me.
Rahman: Is that so? Well then, please stay safe while you're out exploring.
Rahman: If there's anything I can help you with, don't hesitate to ask. I'll be here for the foreseeable future, in any case.
