## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Venti: If you want to chat, now's the time — a bard stays not always in a single clime.
Traveler: About Dvalin...
Venti: Up till the end, Dvalin remembered his duty as one of the Four Winds.
Venti: As such, I don't intend to forcibly strip him of that duty and force my ideals of freedom onto him.
Venti: I just hope that Dvalin will be able to choose for himself and understand what freedom is.
Venti: Before I became an archon, I too was taught the meaning of freedom in this way by a friend.
Traveler: About the Abyss Order...
Venti: Kaeya shared some new intelligence, you say?
Venti: #...I see. So, the Abyss Order has a {F#Prince}{M#Princess} who orchestrated the plan to corrupt Dvalin?
Venti: #They were probably trying to turn Dvalin into a weapon of war for the Abyss. But that said, I have never heard of any such {F#Prince}{M#Princess} of the Abyss Order.
Traveler: Not an Abyss Order tradition, then.
Venti: I think so, too...
Venti: #Apparently, but how does a {F#Prince}{M#Princess} come out of nowhere and take command over the entire Abyss Order?
Traveler: So this is a recent development...
Traveler: About Signora...
Paimon: That Fatui lady didn't hang around, did she? She just grabbed your Gnosis and left!
Venti: She wanted to avoid any eyewitnesses from the Knights of Favonius.
Venti: The slightest slip-up here would have destroyed the Fatui's diplomatic relations with the Knights.
Paimon: So they're just gonna keep acting like Mondstadt's allies as if nothing happened!?
Venti: *sigh*... If only the seven nations had banded together against the Abyss Order in the first place.
Venti: The Fatui possess the strongest military among the seven nations. Yet they've used it to steal the Holy Lyre, covet the power of gods, and use Dvalin as a bargaining chip against the Knights...
Paimon: Speaking of the Lyre... didn't Diluc say something like this before?
Paimon: He said that the Fatui can only run amok across the seven nations and threaten the Knights because of the harbingers.
Venti: Yes. As I said earlier, the Cryo Archon has given them authority and strength beyond that of other mortals.
Venti: The Tsaritsa... I haven't seen her in five hundred years. What is she thinking? What's her plan?
Venti: Whatever the answer is, I have a feeling it's only going to make your search for The Seven all the more difficult...
Traveler: About deities...
Venti: As I said before, Vision wielders are known as allogenes and may ascend to Celestia.
Venti: A Gnosis is a higher-order nexus of elemental manipulation and is emblematic of an archon's status as one of The Seven.
Venti: #But as for which of The Seven took your {F#brother}{M#sister}... I'm sorry, I don't know.
Venti: ...Wait, as one of the Seven, I'm not clear of suspicion yet either, am I?
Traveler: You don't look like that god at all.
Paimon: Hang on a hot second! Tone-Deaf Bard is just one of Barbatos' many incarnations, who's to say—
Traveler: We've known you long enough to trust you.
Venti: #Haha, we're a great team indeed! Say, once you find your {F#brother}{M#sister}, how would you like to become one of the new Four Winds?
Traveler: Perhaps...
Paimon: #Hmm, you don't seem too into it, Traveler...
Paimon: Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard... If being one of the Four Winds means free food, you can consider Paimon!
Venti: Hahaha...
Traveler: There's nothing else...
Venti: Well then, best be off to *Liyue*. If the descension ritual you fail to tally, then another year you must dally.
