Neatly-Written Diary: "...Still no clues at all. I knew I shouldn't have chosen Liyue as the subject of my research. At this rate, I'll have to return empty-handed..."
Neatly-Written Diary: "...If I do return empty handed, that old geezer is going to nag at me till I go insane... Come to think of it, Soraya is also doing research in Liyue, and she's staying at the Wangshu Inn. If she could help me out a bit..."
Neatly-Written Diary: "Ugh, Soraya hasn't responded to my letters. Perhaps it was a bit rude of me to suddenly write her? We only took the same class, after all."
Neatly-Written Diary: "She probably doesn't remember me anymore... Well, I'll stay a few days more. If there's still nothing, then I'll have to go back..."

Neatly-Written Diary: "Maybe I'm just getting paranoid, but I feel like I see silhouettes on the *mountain to the west*... someone's also been inside my camp, flipping through my notes..."
Neatly-Written Diary: "Soraya was right. I have to leave this place..."
