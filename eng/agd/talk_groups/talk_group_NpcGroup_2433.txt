Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Juza: I'd be the Alcor's Chief Mate. I'm in charge of the lads when Captain Beidou isn't around.
Juza: I used to be a dockworker, just muddling along without a clue about what I was living for. If it weren't for Captain Beidou's invitation, I'd still be tightening screws in some miserable corner...
Juza: Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
Juza: I know you've got your own business to attend to, Traveler, but the crew all miss you. We'll always have a seat reserved for you if it ever strikes your fancy, just so you know!

Traveler: Tell me more about the ship...
Juza: This beauty here is the flagship of our very own Crux Fleet, the Alcor!
Juza: She's sturdy, she's armed to teeth, and she's the speediest ship to sail Liyue's seas!
Juza: Basically, it's our most eye-catching vessel. Pirates look upon it and flee in terror at the sight!
Juza: Of course, we aren't just famous for this boat. More importantly, we've got Captain Beidou and all the lads.
Juza: They might make like a rowdy, joking lot, but when the going gets tough, they shut up and get cracking!
Juza: I mean, you've seen us in action, you should know exactly what I mean, haha!

## Talk

Traveler: About the photography class...
Juza: Well, I'd heard that you and the Captain handled a crisis in Inazuma together, and that you were talented in many fields. Sure didn't expect you to be this good, though!
Juza: You know what? We should just bring you aboard for all the classes: photography, performance art, chess, the works!

Traveler: And who'd you be, matey?

Juza: Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
Juza: Oh, that's right. It so happens, traveler, that we're hiring right now. Interested in joining up as a sailor?
Juza: If you come on board, I'll have more than enough to tell you stories about the Captain, hahaha!
