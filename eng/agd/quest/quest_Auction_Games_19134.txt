# Auction Games


## Talk 1

Observe Vase: (A plain-looking vase with clear signs of wear and tear.)
Observe Vase: (Can't see any reason to bid on something like this.)

## Talk 2

Observe Writing Tools: (Generic office implements. I guess they could brighten the place up a little.)
Observe Writing Tools: (Still, it'd be cheaper to get one from Bolai...)

## Talk 3

Observe Hairpin: (A fairly well-made hairpin, but there's nothing exceptional about it.)
Observe Hairpin: (Fine to buy in a shop, but can this really fetch a good price at an auction?)

## Talk 4

Xiaofei: Anything Lady Ningguang used to own is sure to be worth a significant amount of money.
Xiaofei: So even if the price is a little inflated, it should still be fine...

## Talk 5

Yingfeng: Did you bring plenty of Mora with you?
Yingfeng: Let's put it this way â€” anything you can snag in one of Lady Ningguang's auctions is practically Mora in the bank. The more you take home, the bigger your fortune.

## Talk 6

Little Bin: Hmm, I can't see anything that particularly interests me...
Little Bin: Lady Ningguang must know what she's doing though. I'm sure she has her reasons.

## Talk 7

Xiaofei: Huh? You want to know why I paid so much?
Xiaofei: Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it? Because the previous owner was Lady Ningguang.
Xiaofei: Sure, the item might look pretty ordinary, but that's probably just because I'm not a connoisseur, so I don't know how to appreciate it...
Xiaofei: But I figured I'd buy it first, then go get it appraised by an expert. Then I'll be rich! Hehe...

## Talk 8

Yingfeng: I may have paid an arm and a leg for this, but in the end I got the result I wanted. Hahaha.
Traveler: Aren't you worried about the price being over-inflated?
Yingfeng: Nothing of Ningguang's could ever be over-inflated.
Yingfeng: I'm far from the only buyer who believes that "owned by Ningguang" is worth paying a premium for. So how much I make just depends on how many people are even bigger fans of Ningguang than I am!

## Talk 9

Little Bin: *sigh* Today wasn't my day. Didn't manage to snag much.
Little Bin: There were too many bidders, and they all seemed like experts to me.
Little Bin: I guess I'll just have to wait for the next auction. Someday, I'll be the lucky one.

## Talk 10

Ningguang: Check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.

## Talk 11

Ningguang: While we're waiting for the auction to begin, feel free to check out the lots or just stretch your legs.
Ningguang: Maybe you'll find something that catches your eye.
