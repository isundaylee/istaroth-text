# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Darcy: I'm here to help people like you, of course!
Darcy: All you newcomers, still holding the empty forms Ms. Monglane shoved at you, looking around like lost lambs. You need a friendly face to point you in the right direction, don't you?
Darcy: And who better than me, the former "Pretty Face," to perform this task?
Darcy: I'll tell you something on the down low... You can't repeat it to anyone else! Ms. Monglane herself approves of my work. Not that she can admit to it in public, but I know...
Darcy: That's definitely what she actually thinks!
