(Quest is part of chapter: Akitsu Kimodameshi: Part I Test of Courage)

# Test of Courage


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Hey Traveler, you'll never guess what Paimon just heard!
Paimon: The Yashiro Commission is holding a Test of Courage event! They've even prepared rewards for participants who can pass the event's challenges!
Paimon: But uh, if it's a "Test of Courage," that means it's probably gonna be scary, right? So, if we join, Paimon's gonna let you go first...

## Talk 2

Kamisato Ayaka: This reminds me of a story that a retainer once told me several years ago.
Kamisato Ayaka: There was a wandering samurai who, while crossing the forest at night, noticed that the familiar scenery was beginning to change right in front of him.
Kamisato Ayaka: The man stopped and realized that it was as if he was in another world. Strange creatures that didn't appear to be human were all staring at him...
Paimon: Whaa! That's super scary! Paimon doesn't even dare look at all these trees after hearing that story!
Paimon: #Will we really be okay...? If anything weird jumps out at us, teach it a lesson, Traveler!

## Talk 3

Arataki Itto: Hahaha! Oh, I'll show you how scary this oni can be!

## Talk 4

Kamisato Ayaka: Wait... Are these fireworks?
Paimon: Oh, they suddenly lit up! We'd better keep our distance!
Paimon: Let's get out of here!

## Talk 5

???: The torment~...
Paimon: Huh? Did you hear that voice?
???: Ah, the torment~... You will suffer with me~!
Kamisato Ayaka: Could it be... a spirit that's haunting this place?
Paimon: Oohhh~ We're not here to bother you, uh no need to torment us! We'll even ask someone at the Grand Narukami Shrine to come and free you... hehe!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Aww, Paimon thought we found it, but it doesn't seem to be here.
Paimon: Let's keep searching somewhere else!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Have we reached the end? Paimon doesn't see anything here...
Paimon: Seems we went the wrong way... Let's try a different path!

## Talk 8

Kamisato Ayaka: Please... stay a little closer.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or does Chinju Forest feel a little gloomier than before?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I haven't sensed anything particularly different. How about I tell you a story...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Once, in my wandering travels, I came upon a bridge, and I had been told that an ominous presence awaited those who cross that bridge at night.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It was said that there were a pair of lovebirds who tragically fell into the water below and perished. Their grieving spirits converged around the bridge and were never dispersed.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So, I picked a night to cross the bridge, and as I was crossing, I heard some voices.
Paimon: An—And then?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I stopped and listened for some time, and realized it was a couple disguised as ghosts who blackmailed passersby for their belongings. They were arguing over how to split their ill-gotten loot.
Paimon: Huh, after hearing that, Paimon doesn't feel so scared anymore!

## Talk 10

Arataki Itto: You have no idea how long we've been waiting here! Hahaha! Let's go, Ushi!!!

## Talk 11

Gorou: Shouldn't we move out?

## Talk 12

Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm also curious about what's over there, but we should continue following the signs for now.

## Talk 13

Kaedehara Kazuha: What are you looking at?

## Talk 14

Gorou: A surprise attack! I can't see anything!
Gorou: It's an ambush! Everyone, fall back!

## Talk 15

Kaedehara Kazuha: Careful, there's something up above.
Paimon: *coughing* What's this?
Paimon: Huh, fireworks? Whew, Paimon was scared half to death...

## Talk 16

???: The horror~... The horrorrr~...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hello? Is someone there?
???: I will haunt you... and you shall know my horror~!

## Talk 17

Kamisato Ayaka: Would you like to stop for a rest?

## Talk 18

Gorou: There may be ambushes waiting in the forest. Let's stick to the road signs.

## Talk 19

Gorou: Hmm... There's something off about this place...
Gorou: This unsettling feeling reminds me of a strange story I heard among the troops.
Paimon: A strange story? Is it... scary?
Gorou: According to the story, there was an army that was marching through a deserted forest when they discovered a stockpile of delicious food.
Gorou: The troops were short on provisions, so they came to a halt and began to eat heartily. Before long, they suddenly noticed several pairs of blood-red eyes staring at them...
Paimon: Ahh! Paimon's heard enough! What a scary story... *whimper*

## Talk 20

Arataki Itto: Hehe, just as I predicted! They're coming right our way!
Arataki Itto: It's time, Ushi! Let's give 'em a scare! Heeheehee.

## Talk 21

Gorou: We should be safe here...
Gorou: Wait, what's this?
Paimon: It's fireworks... Whew, Paimon was scared half to death...

## Talk 22

???: Pain~... The painnn~...
Gorou: Huh? Who goes there? Identify yourself!
???: No brain~... Ahh, the painnn...
Paimon: N—No brain?
Paimon: Oh, this is creeping Paimon out. Let's sneak by and stay out of sight...
