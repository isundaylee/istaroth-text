Traveler: About Stormterror...
Victoria: Ever since Stormterror appeared, there have been many more people coming to confession. This is an unexpected boon.
Victoria: But it matters little. Even if Stormterror hadn't arrived, I have ways and means of making people confess... of their own accord...
Victoria: In a manner of speaking, of course. Don't think about it too much. *chuckles*
