# Necessary Procedures


## Talk 1

Ivanovich: I believe these documents should be in order...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Ivanovich: Oh, so it's you. Well, you've seen what happened in Liyue Harbor earlier, yes? It gave us all quite the fright.
Ivanovich: I thought the city might be in a mess for a while longer, but order was restored very quickly. The Liyue Qixing are quite something, indeed.
Ivanovich: But whether it was to stabilize the situation or otherwise, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has released a whole slew of new bulletins and regulations.
Ivanovich: I wish to continue doing business here, so I've been out and about these few days, trudging my way through a deluge of paperwork, administrative procedures, and submitting all the applications that the regulations require.
Ivanovich: But Clerk Zhao said that I also need to apply for a new business permit, and told me to stay tuned for any more announcements.
Ivanovich: I've been running around for several days now. There are a few procedures I've yet to finish, but I really don't have any energy left to spare to check the bulletins.
Ivanovich: Traveler, could you please help me check the Bulletin Board and see if there's any news on the new business permits?

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: This is the Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board. You can find community news and shop advertisements posted here. Please do not post unimportant matters.
Traveler: Let's look for information on the Ministry's personnel transfers...
Bulletin Board: "The Ministry of Civil Affair's personnel transfers are as follows..."
Paimon: Hang on a minute. That's got nothing to do with business permits, does it?
Traveler: Let's look up the status of Feiyun Slope's water supply contamination...
Bulletin Board: "Regarding the recent contamination of Feiyun Slope's water supply..."
Paimon: Come on, Ivanovich has things to do. We don't have time to be worried about this right now.
Traveler: Let's look for news about new business permit applications...
Bulletin Board: "If you should wish to apply for a new business permit, you are required to undertake the following procedures..."
Paimon: This should be the new business permit that Ivanovich wants to apply for. Let's copy the procedures down.

## Talk 3

Ivanovich: So, did you find the bulletin concerning the permit?
Traveler: I've copied it down.
Ivanovich: Wonderful! Let me have a closer look...
Ivanovich: Exit permit, business premises and safety certificates, and an old business permit...
Ivanovich: That's fine, that's fine. I got those documents signed a few days ago, and that was an endurance run and a half.
Ivanovich: Traveler, could you help me submit each of these documents in their turn as well?
Ivanovich: That said... *cough* there might be a lot of people looking to submit theirs as well.
Ivanovich: The <color=#00E1FFFF>exit permit</color> must go to Nervous An first. Then, the <color=#00E1FFFF>business premises and safety certificates</color> have to be handed in to a Millelith soldier named Jiayi...
Ivanovich: Finally, the <color=#00E1FFFF>old business permit</color> needs to be given to Clerk Zhao.
Ivanovich: Please help me hand these in, Traveler. I will be sure to arrange adequate compensation for you.
Traveler: Sure, sure.
Ivanovich: I really hope this is the end of all these procedures...
Traveler: Same here.
Ivanovich: Well, you probably won't ever have to do so again, but as for me... I'll have to do it again at some point if I want to do business here.
Ivanovich: *sigh* These methods do provide a certain sense of security, yes, but I do wish they could be further simplified.

## Talk 4

Nervous An: The paperwork for these procedures is incomplete again...
Traveler: Ivanovich is looking to get a new business permit...
Nervous An: Ivanovich? Oh, yes, I remember him. He's been here a few times.
Nervous An: Applying for a new business permit, is he? Haha... he must be terribly busy right now, then.
Nervous An: You're here to help him out, I presume. Have you brought his <color=#00E1FFFF>exit permit</color> with you? I do remember telling him before that his paperwork wasn't complete, and that he needed to get it filled in elsewhere...

## Talk 5

Nervous An: Let me see... No, this isn't correct. I only handle exit permits here. I'm not in charge of any other documents.

## Talk 6

Nervous An: Let me see... No, this isn't correct. I only handle exit permits here. I'm not in charge of any other documents.

## Talk 7

Nervous An: Let me see... Yes, this will do. I'll take this document with me, then.

## Talk 8

Jiayi: Orderly lines please, orderly lines!
Traveler: Ivanovich is looking to get a new business permit...
Jiayi: Oh? You're here as his representative? I see. May I have your business premises certificate and... Uh, what was it again? Right â€” a business safety certificate. Do you have them both with you?
Traveler: You're in charge of these certificates?
Jiayi: No, no, I'm ad-hoc help, just like you. Clerk Zhao has her hands full at the moment, so I've been called in to help collect and file those certificates.
Jiayi: *sigh* It's really tiring work... So, have you brought both your business premises certificate and business safety certificate?

## Talk 9

Jiayi: Um, this is the wrong one. I'm only supposed to take business premises and safety certificates.

## Talk 10

Jiayi: Looks good. I'll file these documents away and pass them to Clerk Zhao later.

## Talk 11

Clerk Zhao: Hello. Anything to submit? Any questions?
Traveler: Ivanovich is looking to get a new business permit...
Clerk Zhao: You're his representative? Alright. His <color=#00E1FFFF>old business permit</color>, please.
Clerk Zhao: If you have it, submit it. I'll need it if you want a new one.

## Talk 12

Clerk Zhao: Mm. Good, I'll take this.
Clerk Zhao: Have you submitted the other documents? You'll have to make another trip in a few days if you haven't.
Traveler: I have.
Clerk Zhao: Good. If everything checks out, the new permit should arrive soon.
Clerk Zhao: I'll get someone to contact Ivanovich then.

## Talk 13

Ivanovich: Have you submitted all the documents yet?
Traveler: They've been submitted.
Ivanovich: Phew, that's wonderful. As long as I get a new business permit, I can continue doing business here.
Ivanovich: Thank you so much for making the trip on my behalf. Here, take this as compensation, just as we agreed.
Ivanovich: I really hope that I won't ever have to work through so many procedures again... So tiring...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ivanovich: I can finally rest for a while. Any more of this and I would have collapsed for sure...
Traveler: What's with the huge number of procedures?
Ivanovich: Haha. Well, this is Liyue Harbor, after all. Contracts are of utmost importance.
Ivanovich: Don't we all feel safer when all things big and small are written down in black and white?
Ivanovich: Well, I say that, but this really is too much. I'm getting dizzy already...
Traveler: Is Snezhnaya like this too?
Ivanovich: You mean in the way we do things? Well, not exactly...
Ivanovich: But if you want specifics, I could probably go on and on.
Ivanovich: You'll see what I mean, though, if you ever get the opportunity to set foot in Snezhnaya.

### Additional Talk 2

Ivanovich: *sigh* These methods do provide a certain sense of security, yes, but I do wish they could be further simplified.
