Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I did in fact come across some odd-looking Crystal Ore recently. It's called Magical Crystal Ore and it's a lot more powerful than your regular ore.
Wagner: I, for one, don't have the skill to deal with that kind of power. It could be that it takes more than the work of a smith to process that kind of thing.
Wagner: ...I've marked a few locations of Magical Crystal Ore on your map. Go fetch some and see what you make of it.
Wagner: You must let me know if you figure out how to make use of it... I can't stand being shown up as a blacksmith by a bunch of stupid rocks.
