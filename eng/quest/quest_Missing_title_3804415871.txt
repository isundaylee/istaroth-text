Traveler: You know how to repair meka?
Denichere: I used to work in a project team that built meka, but the project leads kept changing.
Denichere: And every new lead would redo all the work from the beginning.
Denichere: I just couldn't stand it, so I spoke to Heinry and eventually transferred to his Fonta project team.
Denichere: Though I never thought I'd have to fix them again after all this time...
Denichere: Oh, I brought some extra parts that I'm not going to use. Take them, maybe they'll come in handy.
