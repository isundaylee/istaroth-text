## Talk

Goncourt: Got questions? If you do, don't ask me. I'm not a guard. Go find... go find Estienne! He seems like he's got all the time in the world.

## Talk

Traveler: You're not a guard?
Goncourt: Ha, no. I just play one on stage. See this uniform? Take a closer look, the quality is much worse than an actual uniform.
Goncourt: If it wasn't for the tragically tiny budget the Tri-Coupon Troupe has, I would have a proper costume. A genuine top-quality guard's uniform...

## Talk

Traveler: Very well. Goodbye.
Goncourt: Good luck.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't think that's the best use of your resources.
Goncourt: I must disagree with your opinion. You have to understand that props and costumes are crucial to any performance.
Goncourt: Oh, or do you mean that the script is even more important? Well, if that's the case then I would have no choice but to agree!

## Talk

Traveler: The Tri-Coupon Troupe?
Goncourt: An incredible organization, dedicated to enriching lives through theater... or at least I'd like to be able to say that.
Goncourt: At the moment, we're more amateur hobbyists... Or a support group. Oh, if only we had more of a budget...

## Talk

Goncourt: Hello. We meet again.

## Talk

Traveler: About your outfit...
Goncourt: Haha. Looks real enough, right? But look, the quality is much worse than an actual uniform.
Goncourt: If it wasn't for the tragically tiny budget the Tri-Coupon Troupe has, I would have a proper costume. A genuine top-quality guard's uniform...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Tri-Coupon Troupe...
Goncourt: An incredible organization, dedicated to enriching lives through theater... or at least I'd like to be able to say that.
Goncourt: At the moment, we're more amateur hobbyists... Or a support group. Oh, if only we had more of a budget...
Goncourt: Fourmon and Meilhat have been doing all the work lately. And it does seem the two of them alone can already put on a decent performance...

## Talk

Traveler: About "The Fourth"...
Goncourt: Haha. You've heard the moniker? Did Lanoire tell you? She's the only person here who calls me that.
Goncourt: That was my stage name when I fought in the Pankration Ring. Goncourt the Fourth. But everyone complained it was too long so they just called me Goncourt.
Goncourt: But Lanoire just calls me "The Fourth," even when I'm not in the arena.
Goncourt: Perhaps I'm some kind of storybook character to her? That actually suits me just fine.

## Talk

Traveler: I need to go. Let's talk again later.
Goncourt: Don't let me keep you!

## Talk

Traveler: Looks like you're out.
Goncourt: Oh, I'm injured.
Goncourt: Hey, didn't you say you'd tell me some amazing stories when you got the chance? Did you think of any?

## Talk

Traveler: (Share an unforgettable experience.)
Goncourt: That's awesome! But it'd be a waste for me to turn it into a script. We can only put on cheap little skits here...
Goncourt: That's a story that deserves to be performed on the stage of the Opera Epiclese!
Goncourt: But were there the opportunity to tell such a grand story under those shining light... well, it's not like I'd get a chance to write the script, now would I?

## Talk

Traveler: (Tell about an ordinary experience.)
Goncourt: Hmm, that's a good story. But to make it work on stage... I think the story would be almost unrecognizable.
Goncourt: Personally, I like that kind of story. Ordinary events can tell us a lot about a person's character... Some might disagree, of course, but that doesn't matter.
Goncourt: Perhaps the most important thing is that audiences expect conflict and twists! And, unfortunately, this probably does not meet those expectations. Such a shame.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm kinda busy right now. Maybe another time.
Goncourt: A rain check it is.
