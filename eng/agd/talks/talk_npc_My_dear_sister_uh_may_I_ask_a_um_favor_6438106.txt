# Talk Dialog

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? You haven't gotten yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya, have you?
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine at school!
Sanad: I.. just want to borrow some of your old theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need them as... reference materials! Yeah, that's right!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: I'd say that you might get more out of discussing your ideas with some better students in your cohort, as opposed to borrowing my theses from way back when.
Zohreh: Perhaps a little discussion might lead to something new altogether. You never know...
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... or perhaps we should say that he achieves too much. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil right now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.
