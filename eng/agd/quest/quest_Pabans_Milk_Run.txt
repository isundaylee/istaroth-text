# Paban's Milk Run


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Milk...
Paban: Are you the interested supplier?
Paban: Have you prepared your dairy product samples? Don't worry, they'll be safe with me.
Traveler: Samples are ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Paban: Well, I'd suggest you hurry, then. You're not the only party after this contract.

## Talk 2

Paban: Very well. Here is the fee for your samples, with a service fee added in. I will inform you when a supplier has been selected.
