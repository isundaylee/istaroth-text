Traveler: Who are you?
Sumi: I used to work at Tatarasuna. Yuuzou rescued me from the ruins after the disaster — straight up saved my life.
Sumi: I have no obligations to Sangonomiya and can leave here at any time. But I've been through life-and-death situations with everyone here... I won't be separated from them again.

Traveler: About your companion...
Sumi: Though the resistance is definitely involved with the incident at the Mikage Furnace in some way, the Shogunate's policies are still way too harsh.
Sumi: I know the difficulties Vision-bearers face. I've taken some in before, after all.
Sumi: All in all, I don't particularly support either side, but I've chosen to stay here because of my companions.
