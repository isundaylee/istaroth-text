Traveler: Elders...
Aderfi: ...
Aderfi: That doesn't concern you, outsider. In Tanit, when a Matriarch dies, matters will be deliberated by the "Nine Elders."
Aderfi: When that happens, well, imagine nine mouths quarreling endlessly... Quite a spectacle, I assure you.
Aderfi: Hmph. At least the flowing winds are changing their paths... Far quieter now. A little more peace is always welcome.
