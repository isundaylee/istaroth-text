## Talk

Mihir: The sights and scenes of the Vourukasha Oasis are as they always were. They comfort you humans as well, yes?

## Talk

Traveler: About Pari responsibilities...
Mihir: These should come naturally to us Pari, and should not trouble us.

## Talk

Traveler: About Sorush...
Mihir: Sorush is also doing her utmost to fulfill her duties as a Pari.
Mihir: Although her methods... could use some refinement, she is very dedicated to her duties. I am sure you understand what I mean.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you in peace for now.
Mihir: Very well. I shall stay here for a spell.

## Talk

Mihir: Peace has been restored for now... Friendly human, why are you still here?

## Talk

Traveler: There are still some other things I'd like to do...
Mihir: If such is the case, I understand.
Mihir: I also have many tasks awaiting me... I will complete them after I finish resting.

## Talk

Traveler: About Sorush...
Mihir: In terms familiar to a human, Sorush has matured from her recent experiences.
Mihir: The Pari are indifferent to the maturation process, but I didn't realize that Sorush had already...
Mihir: Hm. It's been a good thing for her. That should mean enough.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Mihir: Considering a lot of what happened was pretty unexpected... Well, unexpected for Sorush, anyhow.
Mihir: With the sign extinguished, I assume Sorush has also learned much from the Chaplet.
Mihir: The greater struggle itself, however, is not over. As Pari, our duty remains even with the quelling of the sign.

## Talk

Traveler: Nothing. I'll be going now.
Mihir: Farewell, friendly human.
