Traveler: A tourism guidebook?
Vert Jr.: Heh! My sister Rouge and I have dedicated ourselves to the discovery of sights worth visiting and cuisine worth tasting.
Vert Jr.: Gorgeous views and delicious food are treasures that belong to everyone in Teyvat. Every tourist should seize the opportunity to enjoy them!
Vert Jr.: But non-frequent visitors must inquire about the scenic spots and cuisine from scratch...
Vert Jr.: What a bother! It would probably take them years, just like it's taking me!
Vert Jr.: Just think! How convenient would things be if we had one... Or even several detailed, comprehensive guides to refer to?
Vert Jr.: That's exactly why my sister and I have decided to explore every settlement in Teyvat. We'll create that very series of travel guides for the sake of all tourists!
Vert Jr.: Things have been going very smoothly, and we only encountered a small hiccup along the way...
Vert Jr.: Problem being that my sister found herself unused to the food outside of Fontaine, so we had to switch jobs...
Vert Jr.: Now, her Rouge's Registry will be a record of scenic attractions, while my Vert's Vouchsafes will be about cuisine!
