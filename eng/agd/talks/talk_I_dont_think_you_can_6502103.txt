Traveler: I don't think you can...
Lovi: *sigh* You're not gonna make some story up to scare me off, are you?
Lovi: "Oh, you can't touch this, or the Gardes will catch you!"
Lovi: Adults are so boring. That blonde guy I met at Leschots's is way cooler.
Lovi: He doesn't say much, but he lets me open his clockwork penguins up.
Lovi: That penguin was super cute, and its internals were really interesting as well. I think he made it himself, actually! Oh, I'm so envious of him!
