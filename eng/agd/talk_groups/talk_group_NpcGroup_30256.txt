## Talk

Wafiq: I hope my little brothers didn't go running off...
Traveler: You look a little worried.
Paimon: Yeah, could it be that you forgot to turn off the stove before leaving the house?
Wafiq: Nah, I checked twice already. The stove and the firewood in the fireplace are both definitely put out.
Wafiq: I'm just worried about my two energetic younger brothers... They run around and occasionally get into trouble. I think they've recently started hanging out with the kids from the Ajilenakh Nut Gang.
Wafiq: They're nice kids, but they'll definitely become overweight if they keep chomping down on those Ajilenakh Nuts and sweets. If it continues, not even the Sumpter Beasts will be able to carry them.
Traveler: Paimon likes sweets too...
Paimon: Hey! That's because Paimon isn't picky about food, okay? There's nothing to worry about there!
Paimon: Besides, if Paimon becomes so heavy that not even a Sumpter Beast would be able to carry Paimon, then we wouldn't need to worry about any monsters we run into because Paimon could perform a Plunging Attack and easily crush them!
Traveler: How much do you weigh now... Paimon...?
Traveler: Are you a competitor as well?
Wafiq: No, no, no... I'm far from being strong enough to compete... I'm just an ordinary chef that's here to take a look...
Wafiq: My two little brothers kept trying to persuade me to join the competition because they want to play with the Fungi. But I couldn't even figure out how to use the Wisdom Orb properly and didn't even make it to the preliminaries.
Wafiq: That's why I have such admiration for qualified competitors such as you guys!
Paimon: We never noticed that there was a learning curve in using the Wisdom Orb...
Wafiq: It's not all bad though. A staff member named Balfour had tasted my food before and immediately recognized me.
Wafiq: He asked if I wanted to provide meals for the competitors and said that it was a good business opportunity. Unfortunately, it didn't work out since the special training facility for the competitors is a little too far away from Port Ormos, but I agreed to help him out next time.
Wafiq: I just don't understand why he'd pick me when there are so many other talented chefs to choose from.
Wafiq: Could it be because... the other chefs are too expensive, and Balfour wanted to cut costs?
Paimon: Maybe it's because Balfour really likes your food! Have some faith in yourself!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Wafiq: Goodbye, powerful stranger.
