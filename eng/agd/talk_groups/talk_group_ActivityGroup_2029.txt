Lisa: Have a question for me, cutie?
Traveler: About brewing potions...
Lisa: All you need to do is add the ingredients into the cauldron, follow the steps provided, and you're good to go.
Lisa: Using different herbs in the brewing process will, in turn, alter the effects of the potion. There's a whole bunch of combinations to try.
Traveler: About cultivating herbs...
Lisa: Bio-alchemical processing can infuse herbs with different effects and properties. The type of potion you want to brew will determine what kinds of herbs you need to cultivate.
Traveler: About the market...
Lisa: You'll need to consult the news of the market to determine what kinds of potions to brew.
Lisa: I already took the liberty of compiling the latest details on the market for you. You can find the information I collected right by those shelves over there.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Lisa: Well, if there's anything else you want to ask, don't hesitate to come and find me.

Freda: Hello there! As always, I, Freda, will do my best to assist you today.
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!

## Talk

Lisa: Have a question for me, cutie?
Traveler: About improving efficiency...
Lisa: After observing your work, I made note of several improvements we can make to the brewing, cultivation, and sales aspects of the business.
Lisa: Freda can tell you more about implementing these upgrades.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Lisa: Well, if there's anything else you want to ask, don't hesitate to come and find me.

Freda: Hello there! As always, I, Freda, will do my best to assist you today.
Traveler: Improve operating efficiency...
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!

Atefeh: So, are you ready to make more Mora with me?
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!

## Talk

Atefeh: Hello there. The potions from earlier have sold out.
Atefeh: I've organized the sales data for you. Feel free to have a look.
Atefeh: Let's skip right to talking about this deal, shall we?
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Atefeh: According to my keen market sense, these are the kinds of potions that are currently in demand.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Atefeh: Hmm, okay. But don't wait too long. When it comes to making Mora, you've got to strike while the iron is hot!

## Talk

Deyou: Greetings. I'm Deyou, a merchant from Liyue.
Paimon: Oh, are you here to purchase potions, too?
Deyou: That's right. Your store's doing pretty well, so I'm sure my sales will be good this time... Yeah, very sure...
Paimon: You don't sound very confident...
Paimon: Hey now, our potions are selling super well — orders just keep pouring in, we can barely cope!
Deyou: My apologies. I'm not doubting your sales figures...
Deyou: It's my business that hasn't been going too well. Every time I buy popular products, they just don't sell before prices go down all around — I post losses nine out of ten times.
Deyou: I always convince myself it's just bad luck, but if I have nothing but bad luck, does that mean that I'm just... not cut out for this...?
Deyou: If I don't make any money this time, I'll pack up, head home, and just work for my father.
Traveler: Maybe you're just choosing the wrong products?
Deyou: Is that so...? I suppose there's still much for me to learn.
Deyou: Right. You're right. I can't stay down like this. I'll make money this time — and I'll impress my father, make him see what I'm made of...
Deyou: Okay! Down to business. Let's talk terms.
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Deyou: These are the types of potion I plan to purchase this time.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Deyou: Don't worry. Caution is the better part of valor — and business.
Traveler: Perhaps the issue is with your sales strategy.

## Talk

Deyou: Down to business. Let's talk terms of cooperation.
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Deyou: These are the types of potion I plan to purchase this time.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Deyou: Don't worry. Caution is the better part of valor — and business.

## Talk

Deyou: The potions from last time have all sold out.
Deyou: This is the sales situation...
Deyou: I look forward to working with you in the future!
Traveler: Check potion requirements...
Deyou: These are the types of potion I plan to purchase this time.
Traveler: Maybe later...
Deyou: Don't worry. Caution is the better part of valor — and business.

## Talk

Lisa: Well, well, well. Your business sure is booming, cuties.
Lisa: Sure enough, entrusting this job to you was the right choice.
Lisa: Don't forget to take a rest if you need it, though. A cup of tea can do wonders when you're tired.

## Talk

Jean: Public reception towards alchemical potions has been much more favorable than expected.
Jean: If things continue like this, the potions industry could end up becoming a new revenue stream for the entire region of Mondstadt...
Lisa: We've got more than enough time to make big plans for the future. Right now, we should focus on the hard-earned success we've been able to achieve so far. How about we find a time to celebrate together?
Paimon: Ooh, a celebration! As long as there's yummy food, Paimon's in!
Lisa: Of course. Once I've made the preparations, you'll be the first to know. I'll even do you the honor of extending your invitation in person, hehe.
Jean: That does sound nice. You certainly deserve to relax after all your hard work.

## Talk

Sucrose: #Greetings, Traveler, Paimon, and Lisa!
Paimon: Sucrose! It's been a while since the last time we saw you!
Sucrose: On the way here, I overheard quite a few people talking about alchemical potions.
Sucrose: At first, I was worried something might have gone wrong with the herbs, but judging by the way people were talking, it seems like they were pretty pleased with the results!
Lisa: Hehe, Sucrose, your bio-alchemical expertise was exactly what we needed for potion making.
Paimon: Yeah! We've been able to make potions with all sorts of different effects!
Sucrose: #You mastered potion-making in such a short amount of time? I guess that's expected for someone of your talent, Traveler.
Lisa: #I wouldn't be surprised if he became a potion master one day.
Traveler: I've still got a long way to go...
Sucrose: #Still, if you managed to master potion-making in such a short amount of time, Traveler, we should be able to start teaching the public about it as well.
Lisa: Wait, was that also a part of Jean's plan?
Sucrose: Yep. It's something she and Mr. Albedo talked about... As I understand it, the goal was not just to create and sell potions, but also to teach the principles and practices of alchemy to the people.
Sucrose: Thanks to your shop, the public's understanding of alchemical potions has increased quite a bit. Perhaps, one day, they'll even be able to make simple potions themselves...
Lisa: Hmm, without the proper training, though, those potions could be dangerous to use...
Sucrose: #You're right... With Lisa there to mentor you, Traveler, we could rest assured that nothing would go wrong during the potion-making process. However, when it comes to the general public, we have to think of a way to ensure that any resulting potions would be safe to use.
Sucrose: So, Mr. Albedo is planning to establish a set of criteria to evaluate various levels of potion-making ability. People will have to pass the exam that corresponds to their level of proficiency before being allowed to brew their own potions.
Lisa: Let me guess... You would like us to also take part in this exam?
Sucrose: Yes, although it would probably be more accurate to say that... we would like you to help us finalize the contents of the exam.
Sucrose: #In order to ensure a proper level of difficulty, we need to first collect the relevant data. That's where our mock exam comes in. If you could take it, Traveler, your results would serve as a very important reference for us.
Sucrose: You will, of course, be compensated for your efforts!
Lisa: Hehe, what a great idea! I must admit, I'm very interested to see how much my cutie's alchemy skills have improved.
Traveler: I guess I could give it a go.
Sucrose: Wonderful. Then let me explain a little bit about how the exam works. The exam has four levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.
Sucrose: To pass, all you need to do is brew a potion within the time limit that satisfies the main objective.
Sucrose: Satisfying additional objectives will earn you extra rewards.
Paimon: Okay, all this is starting to sound pretty official. Paimon's nervous all of a sudden.
Sucrose: Just do what you normally do and you should be fine. If you don't pass the first time around, you can always retake the exam, so no need to put too much pressure on yourselves.
Paimon: Oh, retakes are allowed! Phew, that's a relief!
Sucrose: Yep! Just let me know when you're ready.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: Bring it on!
Lisa: Hehe, confidence is a good look on you, cutie!
Traveler: I'm just a beginner.

## Talk

Sucrose: #Oh, it's you again, Traveler! We can proceed with the exam whenever you're ready.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk

Sucrose: Whenever you're ready, we can go ahead and proceed with the Beginner exam.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk

Sucrose: Hm, your movements are quite practiced, and your potion meets the requirements as well. Congratulations on passing the Beginner exam!
Paimon: Hmph, that was a piece of cake!
Traveler: It had its challenging moments.
Sucrose: Even so, it was no match for your skills.
Sucrose: Alright, I believe I've collected all the necessary feedback... Looks like we'll have to make some adjustments to the level of difficulty for the actual exam.
Sucrose: #I'm going to head back to the lab now. See you later, Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: That was nothing.
Sucrose: Wow... I really thought it would be more difficult for someone so new to potion-making.

## Talk

Sucrose: Eh, you are still pretty new to this. A few mistakes here and there are to be expected...
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon just got a bit flustered when she remembered she was taking an exam...
Traveler: Guess we didn't prepare well enough...
Sucrose: Don't get discouraged. I also made all sorts of mistakes when I first started doing experiments. You know what they say — Practice makes perfect! I'll come back later and you can try again.
Traveler: We were so close...

## Talk

Sucrose: #Traveler, Paimon, how's the potion-making been going lately?
Paimon: Sucrose, you're back!
Traveler: It's been going great!
Sucrose: I should have known. You really do have a talent for alchemy.
Sucrose: I'm sure this exam will also be a walk in the park for you.
Sucrose: Well, ready to begin?
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: Alright! No rush! Take as much time as you need.
Traveler: We're still working out some kinks...
Sucrose: Well, you just need to keep practicing! You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Sucrose: As for the Intermediate exam, just think of it as a practice session, and you'll be fine.

## Talk

Sucrose: #Oh, it's you again, Traveler! We can proceed with the exam whenever you're ready.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk

Sucrose: If you're ready, then let's go and proceed with the Intermediate exam.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: Alright! No rush! Take as much time as you need.

## Talk

Sucrose: Let me see... Yep, looks like your potion meets the requirements. You've passed once again!
Paimon: Hehe, we're getting pretty good at this!
Sucrose: I'm so glad I asked for your help... Please, take this for your trouble.

## Talk

Sucrose: It's alright. You'll get there. You just need a bit more practice.
Sucrose: I'll come back later, and you can try again.

## Talk

Sucrose: Hi, you two! It's been a while, hasn't it?
Paimon: Oh, you're back! Wait... That must mean there's a new exam!
Sucrose: Yep. It's time for the Advanced exam. This one will be harder than previous exams, but I'm sure you'll do just fine.
Traveler: I'm a little nervous.
Sucrose: I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. I actually had Mr. Albedo take a look at your previous potions. He was a bit amazed that someone so new to potion-making could already produce such an impressive result.
Sucrose: He even told me that, for someone of your talent, we could stand to set harder questions.
Paimon: Wow, the recognition feels nice and all... But, Paimon feels even more pressure now.
Paimon: If we don't pass this time, it'll be super embarrassing!
Sucrose: Don't worry too much about that. Lots of things in life require a couple of tries before you get it right.
Sucrose: When I first started working as Mr. Albedo's assistant, all sorts of unexpected things would go wrong during my experiments...
Sucrose: For example, when I was studying the properties of Mist Flowers, I accidentally froze all the equipment in the lab. I basically turned them into ice sculptures. Our precision instruments were nearly ruined beyond repair.
Sucrose: Another time, I let a reagent boil for a little bit too long, and all the precious ingredients inside got charred to pieces. The smell was so bad, several knights passing by thought the lab had caught on fire...
Sucrose: Back then, I would get really hard on myself whenever things went wrong, but eventually I realized that, in order to make new discoveries, you have to accept the risk of failure.
Sucrose: A fear of making mistakes will prevent you from truly going after what it is that you want.
Paimon: You're absolutely right! Hey, you're actually really good at motivating people!
Sucrose: Hehe, it's just my experience talking — I've spent a lot of time doing research in the lab after all. Anyway, as long as you try, you'll learn something valuable from the experience.
Sucrose: Alright, whenever you're ready, we can go ahead and proceed with the Advanced exam.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: I'll do my best.

Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk

Sucrose: Wow, you even breezed through the Advanced exam...
Sucrose: Ever thought about helping out around the lab?
Paimon: #Drop everything and pursue the path of an alchemy master... Huh, what do you say, Traveler?
Traveler: Not sure we're quite ready for that yet.
Sucrose: If we work together, I'm sure we could make something super amazing!
Paimon: By "super amazing," do you mean you already have something in mind?
Sucrose: Well, in the past, my research was mainly focused on the study of plants. But this experience has shown me that potions can have all kinds of effects on people as well...
Sucrose: So, I started thinking — what if potions could have an even greater effect on people? Like... what if they could be used to help people unlock their hidden potential?
Sucrose: A memory-enhancing potion, for example, could help people memorize a whole library's worth of knowledge in a single breath.
Sucrose: Alternatively, a strength-enhancing potion could make it so that Paimon could take down an Abyss Mage all on her own.
Paimon: Woah, Paimon didn't know you could make potions like that! Sounds awesome!
Sucrose: Well, it's certainly theoretically possible. Alchemy is, in itself, a way to explore the unknown. It's a discipline with endless potential. In fact, current research has barely scratched the surface of what's possible with alchemy.
Sucrose: Theory, though, is always easier than practice. And with alchemy, there are simply too many things that you have to take into consideration. Just off the top of my head, there's the theory of sublimation, the potion's mechanism of action, and the innate metabolism of the person consuming the potion...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon didn't quite catch all that...
Sucrose: Ah, my bad... We can talk about the details some other time. If you're interested, just stop by the lab.
Paimon: Sweet! Watch out, world — with a cool potion from Sucrose, Paimon will be able to become the strongest guide in Teyvat in no time!
Sucrose: Well, I'll be off, then. Only one more exam to go! I imagine you and I will both have some final preparations to make.
Traveler: But we can certainly help out.

## Talk

Sucrose: Uh, this one was designed to be a bit difficult...
Traveler: I couldn't even follow the steps!
Sucrose: You actually already have a lot of experience under your belt. I'm sure you just made a few silly mistakes. Maybe you exhausted yourself from working too hard recently.
Sucrose: In any case, don't worry about it. We'll continue with the exam once you take a much needed break.
Traveler: Alchemy is way too hard!

## Talk

Paimon: Sucrose, you're here! Oh, is it time for the Expert exam already?
Paimon: Our alchemy skills are improving so fast, Paimon can barely keep up!
Sucrose: Your progress has been very impressive. In fact, according to the way Mr. Albedo designed the exams, passing the Expert level would mean you're now qualified to mentor other people.
Paimon: Ooh, we could start to teach other people?
Paimon: Then Paimon's totally going to start a class! Hmm, let's see, how much should Paimon charge per student...
Paimon: Well, all Paimon knows right now is that, for homework, her students are gonna have to use alchemy to make all sorts of tasty treats, hehe. Paimon'll be sure to give them lots of feedback... on their alchemy skills, of course!
Traveler: Paimon...
Sucrose: I'm sure this one will go just as well as the others.
Sucrose: I'm ready to begin whenever you are. I'll be rooting for you!
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: Of course. This is the final exam. Take as much time to prepare as you need.
Traveler: Let's focus on the exam for now.

## Talk

Sucrose: #Oh, it's you again, Traveler! We can proceed with the exam whenever you're ready.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: No problem, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk

Sucrose: Whenever you're ready, we can go ahead and proceed with the Expert exam.
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: Not yet, I need a little more time.
Sucrose: Of course. This is the final exam. Take as much time to prepare as you need.

## Talk

Sucrose: Alright, let me give your potion a try... Yep, the effect looks good. The quality of your potion is quite high as well. Your talent in this discipline is truly remarkable.
Paimon: So, we passed? Can we teach alchemy now?
Lisa: What an amazing achievement, cuties. Congratulations.
Traveler: I guess we've learned a thing or two about potion-making.
Lisa: Now is not the time to be humble.
Lisa: You mastered potion-making in such a short amount of time. That's an impressive achievement no matter how you look at it.
Sucrose: Exactly! I was also really surprised at how quickly you picked it up. I thought it would have taken way more time...
Sucrose: Anyway, thank you so much for your help. Your participation has allowed me to collect some very valuable data. With everything we've learned, we should be able to offer the official exams soon.
Sucrose: This is sure to be a critical moment in the development of the alchemical potions industry.
Paimon: Paimon feels like she just took part in something super important!
Sucrose: Of course! You two are practically pioneers! What you've been able to contribute to the field of alchemy is as impressive as a biologist discovering a new species!
Sucrose: Anyway... I should probably head back and go over the data I've collected.
Sucrose: #Traveler, Paimon, thanks again for your participation. If you have some free time, please stop by the lab!
Traveler: But we're still by no means experts when it comes to everything else.

## Talk

Paimon: Noo, we didn't make it! This exam was way too hard.
Traveler: We were too slow...
Sucrose: It's alright! This was the Expert exam, after all. It's really difficult to pass on your first try.
Sucrose: I'll come back once you've had some more time to prepare. Keep at it! I know you'll succeed in the end!
Traveler: We went over the steps in the wrong order...

## Talk

Beidou: Hey, what's up.
Eula: #Traveler, it's been a while.
Paimon: Woah, Beidou and Eula! Wait... You two know each other?
Traveler: Didn't expect to see you two together.
Beidou: Haha, well we haven't known each other long, but we hit it off right away! I guess it was meant to be.
Eula: I met Captain Beidou at Dornman Port. She was here in Mondstadt to buy some supplies, and I offered to accompany her around the area.
Paimon: Wow, Eula taking the initiative and making friends? ...Did Paimon hear that right?
Eula: Ahem, given that the two of us just met, I wouldn't go so far as to call us "friends" just yet. I was just... being hospitable. As is expected of a Knight.
Beidou: Huh? I thought we were getting along pretty well... You're telling me you were just being polite?
Eula: Oh no, I didn't mean it like that. I just thought that... after my blunder earlier, you probably wouldn't want to be my friend...
Beidou: Come on, it was just a little misunderstanding, that's all. You're still beating yourself up about that? Honestly, I'd forgotten all about it.
Paimon: Misunderstanding? What happened?
Beidou: Well, a few days ago, after docking at Dornman Port, I thought I'd treat the crew to some time at the tavern to blow off some steam.
Beidou: While we were there, an argument broke out between a couple of drunk guys. Things looked like they were about to get physical, so I intervened to try and break it up.
Beidou: I tried talking to them, but they were in the mood for a fight, and my words fell on deaf ears. So I had to resort to, uh... a more "hands-on" way of getting them to calm down.
Beidou: Eula was patrolling the area while all this was going down, and when she walked in... It wasn't a pretty sight...
Eula: Ahem, I should probably take it from here.
Eula: Recently, we've intercepted a string of attempts to smuggle goods through Dornman Port, so we decided to step up our patrols in the area.
Eula: On my rounds that day, I noticed a group of people I'd never seen before — and they were sailors. My suspicions were raised, so I asked their captain to show a valid entry permit for the port.
Eula: Captain Beidou said she didn't have the entry permit on her person and told me to check with the port authorities myself. I insisted that she should accompany me there, and well... you can see how things could get heated in a situation like that.
Beidou: Hey, you were just doing your duty. It was my fault, really. I should've watched my tone, but I'd had a few too many, and... Anyway, it all worked out in the end. I took Eula back to my ship, showed her my documents, and that was that. Misunderstanding resolved.
Beidou: I felt bad, though, so I told her I'd treat her to a drink when we got back to the tavern.
Beidou: Once we got to talking, we really hit it off. We sat there chatting until the tavern was about to close.
Eula: Captain Beidou mentioned that she wanted to have a look around the city the next day. I was also planning to head back to headquarters to submit some paperwork, so we decided to go together.
Beidou: Ah, I meant to say earlier... Drop the "Captain" and just call me Beidou. There's no need for formalities between friends.
Eula: Oh, yes, of course. Pardon me for being so formal... Anyway, as for why we're here, I heard about your shop when I got back to headquarters, and after discussing it with Beidou, we decided to stop by and say hello.
Beidou: That's right! Plus, I'm curious to see what the deal is with these Mondstadt potions you've been brewing up.
Traveler: Since you came all this way...
Beidou: Could do... although I don't have any health issues, and my ship's already stocked with everything I could need out on the ocean.
Beidou: Lemme think... Oh, do you have a potion that helps with getting to sleep?
Eula: Are you having trouble sleeping, Beidou?
Beidou: No, not me. The minute my head hits the pillow, it's lights out until the next morning!
Beidou: It's just that, I have this friend... She doesn't lack for anything, and she eats right and drinks right, but she just doesn't sleep well. I don't know if it's a case of affluenza, or if she just has too many things on her mind.
Paimon: Wait, this "friend" you're talking about, you must mean...
Beidou: Yep. She's no stranger to rare and precious treasures, but I'd wager that, to her, the chance to relax and get a good night's sleep is rarer than any treasure in her collection.
Paimon: Alright, we'll get started on that order for you right away!
Beidou: Great! Thanks for the help!
Traveler: Why don't you buy some to bring back with you?

## Talk

Beidou: We're back! Eula took me for a stroll around Starfell Lake. The scenery is amazing, especially from up in the hills.
Eula: I'm glad you liked it. I was worried I might have bored you with all the aimless wandering...
Beidou: Not at all! You're talking to someone who spends most of her days at sea. The opportunity to take a nice stroll through the woods is actually pretty special.
Beidou: #So, how's that potion coming, Traveler?
Traveler: We still need a little more time!
Beidou: No worries. I've got plenty of time before I have to head back.
Traveler: It's almost there!

## Talk

Beidou: How's the potion-making going? Hope you didn't run into too much trouble...
Traveler: Hand over the potion...
Traveler: We just need a bit more time.
Beidou: Take all the time you need! Just let me know when you're ready.

## Talk

Paimon: What about you, Eula? Is there something we can make for you?
Eula: Hmm... I don't want to put too much on your plate. It wouldn't be fair to ask you to make so many potions at once.
Eula: Beidou came all this way... Her order should take priority.
Eula: Any potion requests I have on my end, I'll just submit to Lisa later — the same goes for anything the Reconnaissance Company needs as well.
Paimon: Aww, you're so considerate of other people.
Eula: Oh, uh, you think so...? The Knights have always looked after me so well... Maybe it's rubbed off on me a little, or something.
Eula: But I still have a lot to learn... The next time things get heated, I should approach the situation in a more level-headed way.
Traveler: I think you're doing great.
Paimon: Exactly! Compared to when we first met, you're practically picking up friends left and right!
Paimon: It's just like that Tone-deaf Bard once said — the winds always change their course!
Eula: Thanks, you two... Your kindness... really means a lot.
Traveler: Everyone can see how hard you're trying.

## Talk

Beidou: Perfect, looks like my gift is all set.
Eula: Is it time for your return journey, then? If you're heading back to Dornman Port, I'd be happy to accompany you.
Beidou: Yeah, I think I've gotten my fill of sight-seeing, so it's probably time I headed back. Don't wanna keep my crew waiting.
Beidou: #Traveler, Paimon, I'll see you some other time. Oh, and good luck with your business!
Eula: On behalf of the Reconnaissance Company, I'd like to express my gratitude to you as well.

## Talk

Beidou: Huh, looks like potion-making is a pretty time-consuming endeavor.
Eula: Why don't I show you a few more places while we wait? We can come back in a little bit.
Beidou: Alright! Catch you guys later!

## Talk

Diluc: Hello, everyone.
Paimon: Woah, is that Master Diluc!
Lisa: Oh, Diluc. What's someone as busy as you doing in this neck of the woods?
Traveler: It's really been a while!
Diluc: Elzer told me the Knights launched a new commercial endeavor that turned out to be quite the hit. I think he was a bit surprised by the level of success, so he told me to come check it out.
Diluc: But, seeing as you two are the ones in charge, I'm really not surprised at all. The Knights definitely chose the most reliable people for the job.
Paimon: Uh, Elzer is the manager of Dawn Winery, right? Huh, Paimon thought he didn't get out much. Wonder how he heard about our shop...
Paimon: Wait, are we that famous already?
Diluc: No need to sound so surprised.
Diluc: The Winery keeps us all very busy. Elzer only takes the time to brief me with this sort of intel if he thinks we are faced with a real threat.
Diluc: In such a short amount of time, you've been able to establish complete production and supply lines, and even receive orders from all around Teyvat...
Diluc: If you were in the wine business, you'd already be one of our biggest rivals.
Paimon: Woah, woah! Threat? Rival?
Traveler: We're coming for your business!
Lisa: Oh? You sure seem eager, cutie.
Lisa: Looks like you really want to go toe to toe with the number one wine merchant in all of Mondstadt. Are you just itching to see whose business prowess would come out on top?
Diluc: #Hmm, a competition with Traveler... That's not a bad suggestion.
Diluc: You're extremely knowledgeable and well-traveled. If we were to become competitors, I'm sure you'd throw many a challenge my way — probably even some I've never faced before.
Diluc: But, I was really just using the wine industry as an example to emphasize your success. Our two industries aren't exactly fighting for the same market space.
Diluc: Actually, the success of your potion shop is good for the Winery's business.
Paimon: Good for your business? Paimon's lost. You were just talking about how the two industries were separate, and now they're suddenly connected?
Lisa: Hehe, it's a bit convoluted.
Lisa: Alcohol is a commodity that most people consume in their free time. In order to have free time, though, you have to get off work early. For the alcohol industry to thrive, consumers need to have both the time and the money to spend.
Diluc: That's exactly right.
Diluc: Your potions allow people to work more efficiently. As they get more popular, people will be able to complete their work faster. The more free time people have, the bigger the market there is for a commodity like mine.
Paimon: Oh, that makes sense! It's hard to be in the mood to go out and enjoy life if you're super busy all the time.
Paimon: Paimon never thought about it that way before... There sure are a lot of layers to running a business!
Paimon: Guess this means we're in the Mora-making business together, then. Hey, why don't you try out one of our potions?
Traveler: Please check out our offerings, dear partner!
Diluc: Hmm, I do have quite the interest in the effects of alchemical potions...
Diluc: Well, since you offered, please make a potion that can reduce the anxieties of the user while also improving their attention to detail.
Lisa: Reduce anxiety while also improving the user's attention to detail? That almost sounds a little contradictory to me.
Lisa: I must admit to being curious. If my cuties do manage to make this potion for you, Diluc, how exactly do you intend to use it?
Diluc: Well, I mentioned before that people with ample free time are an important consumer base for my industry. But, actually, the same is true for people who are incredibly busy and overwhelmed with work.
Diluc: After a period of high stress, like a busy work day, it can take a while for people to fully decompress. It's also common for that type of stress to leave people so exhausted that all they can do is spend the rest of the day in a daze.
Diluc: That level of stress and exhaustion makes it hard for people to derive pleasure from things they usually enjoy... like relishing the flavor of their favorite food and drink.
Paimon: *sigh* You can say that again...
Paimon: Paimon's definitely been there before. Sometimes, after a really long day, Paimon'll be so tired, but she just can't relax. Not even her favorite snacks would hit the spot like they usually do...
Lisa: My poor little cuties. Sounds like things can get quite tough out on the road... You know what, you just earned yourself some extra snacks at our upcoming tea party. Once this is all over, I'll personally see to it that you get the chance for a proper rest.
Paimon: So, basically, you need us to make a potion that decreases tension, but increases attention, so that people can still enjoy the finer things in life no matter how busy or stressed they are... Did Paimon get that right?
Diluc: Exactly. Wine is meant to be savored. Drinking it without being able to appreciate its subtle notes and characteristics is a loss not just for the winemaker, but for the consumer as well.
Diluc: If we can increase the alertness of those too exhausted to perceive the subtle notes, but decrease the restlessness of those too agitated to raise their glass, then we can be sure to reach a point of balance where all can enjoy their wine to the fullest extent.
Traveler: Excellently put, Master Diluc!
Paimon: ...Well, um, it's definitely a unique request. Seems like this would be a tricky challenge for any potion-maker.
Paimon: We should get to thinking, then. First things first, let's figure out what ingredients to use!
Traveler: I see the vision now!
Traveler: If you want something, just name it, and we'll make it!
Traveler: Let the trade war begin!
Traveler: Fancy seeing you here, Master Diluc.

## Talk

Diluc: #Hello, Traveler, Paimon.
Diluc: Have you made any progress with the potion I requested?
Paimon: #Right, the potion! You remember the details of the order, right Traveler?
Paimon: We've been working super hard on our potion-making skills recently, so we'll get right on it!

## Talk

Diluc: How's the potion coming? Have you finished?
Traveler: Hand over the potion...
Traveler: We just need a little longer...
Diluc: Not to worry. I know you're a trustworthy partner. With such individuals, I can be patient for as long as you need.

## Talk

Paimon: We're finished with the potion, Master Diluc! Please give it a try!
Diluc: Oh? I thought you might need more time, but it looks like you've already found the solution. Nice job.
Black Screen Text: You hand over the potion to Diluc. After looking it over, he takes a small dose to test out the potion's effects...
Diluc: Wow, the effect is even more apparent than I imagined. Your many talents just keep on surprising me.
Diluc: On behalf of Dawn Winery, I would like to make a bulk purchase order for this potion. Oh, and don't worry about the delivery side of things. Elzer will send someone to pick up the potions once they're ready.
Diluc: My plan is to enlist the help of artisans to infuse candles and fragrances with the effects of this potion. Those products will serve as complementary gifts for customers to enjoy during wine tasting.
Lisa: So you plan to make alchemical potions part of the wine-drinking experience itself... Interesting. And very much in keeping with the Dawn Winery's way of doing business.
Traveler: Looks like our new product's a hit!
Paimon: If our potion was enough to impress Master Diluc, Paimon's sure regular customers are gonna be even more amazed!
Diluc: Well, there's still work to be done, so I should probably head out. It'll take some time before we know exactly what the commercial impact of this combination will be.
Diluc: In any case, it's been a pleasure working with you. Here's hoping our two businesses will have a long and successful partnership. I hope those orders will keep on rolling in... for both our sakes.
Diluc: Oh, and if you have some time, you should stop by Angel's Share to see your masterpiece in action.
Paimon: For sure! Paimon can't wait! Well, see you next time, Master Diluc!
Traveler: We just secured a huge order from Dawn Winery!

## Talk

Paimon: Ugh, Paimon really doesn't know where to start...
Traveler: So many effects to keep track of.
Diluc: Don't worry about it. I know I'm asking quite a lot from you two. You must be busy with your other orders as well. When you've got that much on your plate, it's easy to slip up here and there.
Diluc: Just take it one step at a time, and you're sure to figure it out. I believe in you.
Diluc: Take as much time as you need, okay? I'm going to head back to the Winery for now.
Paimon: Wow, sure was nice of Diluc to encourage us like that... Let's work extra hard so we won't let him down!
Traveler: It's so hard to find the right combination!

## Talk

Diona: #Hmm? Traveler? Paimon? Huh, looks like you're running a business...
Paimon: Oh, hey Diona! And Tone-Deaf Bard! What brings you to the shop?
Venti: I could smell what you were brewing from all the way across Cider Lake. Bards have an extremely keen sense of smell, you know.
Diona: Again with the nonsense... Don't listen to him. We were actually in the middle of looking for some cocktail ingredients.
Diona: Margaret is getting ready to run a new promotion at The Cat's Tail, so she asked me to come up with some new drink ideas.
Diona: The bard over here is performing at the event. When he saw me getting ready to leave, he insisted on tagging along to help.
Venti: Well, what better way to be the first to try your new concoction than by helping you collect ingredients?
Paimon: Well, that explains your enthusiasm, then. You're only that generous when alcohol is involved.
Diona: Anyway, I was having some trouble coming up with new ideas for ingredients to use. I've already experimented with just about every ingredient you can find around Mondstadt — even the weirdest ones.
Diona: The bard saw me struggling and told me he had an idea, so we split up for a while.
Diona: I didn't get my hopes up, but sure enough, he came back a little while later with a rare ingredient I'd never used before...
Paimon: Oooh! What is it? Some sort of secret? C'mon, bring it out so we can see!
Venti: Hehe, it's a bird feather I found on a ruin in Dragonspine.
Venti: It was once buried in snow, and is still cold to the touch even now.
Venti: I'm sure it could be used to produce a drink with an entirely new sort of mouthfeel!
Paimon: Woah, well if anyone can find something like that, Paimon supposes it'd be you...
Diona: Unfortunately, this ingredient is not easy to find. We'll probably use up the measly amount we've discovered with just the recipe testing alone.
Venti: Don't worry about the ingredients, Diona. I'll figure something else out. You should head back, so you can get a head start on working that mixology magic of yours.
Diona: Uh-huh, 'cause the sooner I get started, the sooner you get to take advantage of the fruits of my labor, isn't that right?
Venti: Ah, well, just think of it as a way to pay me in advance for all my hard work, hehe.
Diona: That still doesn't solve our problem, though...
Diona: #Traveler, Paimon, do you have any ideas for a new drink?
Traveler: How about a different approach?
Diona: Huh? Infuse drinks with different effects... But, doesn't that bring us back to the ingredient problem all over again?
Paimon: #Oh! Paimon gets what he's saying.
Paimon: *ahem* You're looking at one of the most popular duos on the Mondstadt alchemy scene right now. Our potions are one of the hottest commodities in Teyvat!
Diona: But... what do potions have to do with drinks?
Paimon: You can add them as an ingredient, of course! Potions can add all sorts of different effects... For example, with a little alchemy on your side, you could even make a drink that can heal a broken heart!
Diona: Wow, I never knew potions could do something like that!
Traveler: Paimon's example is a bit of a stretch...
Diona: I see. How about a potion that makes people never want to drink alcohol again? Could you make something like that?
Traveler: I could try.
Paimon: #Woah, woah, woah. Don't go making promises we can't keep, Traveler!
Paimon: How are we supposed to make a potion like that!?
Diona: Ah, what a shame... And here I thought I'd finally be able to dismantle the entire Mondstadt wine industry in one fell swoop.
Paimon: It's okay, we'll try to see if we can find some other ways to help.
Venti: Actually, I've always been curious, Diona — is there a particular reason you don't like alcohol?
Diona: Hah, isn't it obvious? Ever been around a drunk person before? Let me tell you, it's not a pleasant experience!
Venti: Ah, so your gripe isn't really with alcohol itself, but the fact that it makes people drunk!
Venti: Hmm, this may sound a little weird, but I wonder if it's possible to use this mysterious alchemy craft of yours to make a drink that prevents people from getting intoxicated?
Paimon: #Hmm, so you mean, a potion that can keep someone sober and awake? Sounds like something we could do. Whaddaya say, Traveler?
Traveler: If we just need to produce something that invigorates the mind...
Diona: Perfect! I can just see it now! The more alcohol those drunkards consume, the more sober they'll become...
Diona: They'll finally have to say bye bye to their days of drunken depravity!
Diona: #It's decided then! Traveler, please make me a potion that can keep people sober!
Venti: Gotta say, I'm starting to get really curious about what that drink's going to taste like.
Traveler: Should be doable.
Traveler: Potions wear off over time...
Paimon: Oh, that's right. Even if we could make one that discourages people from drinking, it would only last for a little bit before wearing off.
Traveler: But, more reasonable effects are absolutely doable.
Traveler: You could infuse drinks with different effects...

## Talk

Diona: Phew, we're back! That was quite the successful outing!
Venti: Ingredient-collecting went a lot faster with my help, didn't it? C'mon, admit it!
Diona: Well, I suppose you weren't entirely useless.

## Talk

Diona: So, how's the potion coming? Finished yet?
Traveler: Hand over the potion...
Traveler: We're almost there!
Diona: Take your time. This is a crucial part of my plan to take down the Mondstadt wine industry. I'll wait as long as it takes!

## Talk

Venti: Hmm, if alchemy has the power to transform matter... I wonder if it could also be used to turn water into wine?
Venti: Wouldn't it be amazing if all the water in Cider Lake turned into actual cider?
Venti: In that case, at least, no matter how short on Mora I am, I'd never be short on liquor, haha...
Traveler: How about I treat you to a drink instead?
Venti: A fine alternative, haha. Who would I be to refuse such a generous invitation?
Venti: We'll go as soon as your work is finished. How does that sound?
Paimon: You really haven't changed at all... Just the mention of alcohol practically has you chomping at the bit!
Venti: Well, it's not everyday I get the chance to reunite with such dear friends. What's a reunion without a generous serving of wine?

## Talk

Diona: Wow, I can't believe I'm holding the key to shaking up Mondstadt's entire wine industry in my own two hands... Wowzaa!
Diona: #Thank you so much, Traveler! I'm gonna head back and start developing my new drinks right away!
Venti: Wait, don't leave without me! I thought you were gonna let me be the taste tester!
Diona: Of course, hehe... Operation "eliminate drunkards" has just begun, and you, my friend, are my first test subject...
Venti: #And just like that, another problem solved! Looks like you've done it again, Traveler and Paimon.
Diona: Alcohol that doesn't make you drunk... If I'm able to develop something like that... I guess there really is a type of alcohol that I can get behind...

## Talk

Paimon: Huh, this potion is turning out to be trickier than Paimon thought it would be...
Diona: Well, making a potion that has the power to topple the wine industry is sure to be complicated — more complicated than mixing drinks, at least.
Diona: You know what? I'm gonna take a look around the area to collect some more materials.
Venti: Ah, if you're looking for high-quality materials, I know just where to go!
Diona: #Perfect! Lead the way... Traveler, Paimon, we'll see you later!
Venti: Bye! See you soon!

## Talk

Gorou: Oho, so you're the ones behind the potion shop I've heard so much about! When it comes to fulfilling requests, I heard the customer's wish is practically your command.
Paimon: Huh? Gorou? Where did you come from?
Paimon: Oh, and Kirara's here too! What are you guys doing in Mondstadt?
Traveler: Didn't expect to see you here!
Kirara: Hehe, the Komaniya Express operates all across Teyvat, so I'm always on the road.
Kirara: I'm actually pretty familiar with Mondstadt from my trips here in the past. General Gorou, on the other hand... seems to still be getting the lay of the land... He got lost not too far from here...
Gorou: *ahem* Well, I would normally be provided with ample intel before carrying out an operation in a foreign territory... But, Watatsumi Island isn't exactly home to many people who've been to Mondstadt. I wasn't even able to obtain a map of the region.
Gorou: I've basically had to perform initial reconnaissance in the middle of a formal operation — not exactly ideal conditions for an error-free mission!
Kirara: Affirmative, General! Next time, I'll procure the most detailed map available and make sure you have it at your disposal from mission outset! Over and out!
Gorou: You can drop the formalities, Kirara. I don't expect you to report back to me like I'm your commanding officer. We hired you as a consultant. It wouldn't be fair to treat you like one of my soldiers.
Kirara: Hey now, it's not like this is some one-sided partnership. We agreed, right? In exchange for my services, you'll help promote our business to the people of Watatsumi Island. Your good word will be integral in helping the Komaniya Express become people's first choice for all their delivery needs!
Kirara: Our future business is counting on you!
Paimon: Back to Paimon's question, though. You still haven't told us what you're doing in Mondstadt. You mentioned something about a mission?
Gorou: Ah yes... It's a funny story actually.
Gorou: Recently, Watatsumi Island has been looking for ways to increase transportation efficiency. Basically, this means improving the operations of our cargo ships. So, we decided to send teams across Teyvat to learn about the most advanced techniques different nations have to offer.
Gorou: We had just wrapped up our trip to Liyue when we heard word of your mysterious potion shop. So, we decided to postpone our return journey for a bit and come check it out.
Gorou: Turns out it was the right choice!
Paimon: Well, Paimon's gotta say, you've practically hit the jackpot by coming here! We've got stuff you can't find anywhere else!
Traveler: We'll make you something super special!
Lisa: Oh? More customers from abroad? Hehe, my cuties sure are popular. You really do have friends all over Teyvat...
Lisa: Hm, looking at your two friends here... I can't help but be reminded of my dear little wolf cub... You know what? I should introduce you some time. For some reason, I have a feeling the three of you would really hit it off...
Lisa: In fact, once you've wrapped up your potion purchasing, why don't you both join me and my cuties for afternoon tea? I'll even bring my student along.
Kirara: Afternoon tea? Sounds great! I could really use some refreshments. Long days of deliveries always leave me parched. Thanks for the invitation!
Gorou: Uh, something tells me you're not going to take no for an answer, hehe... Wait, why does this feel so familiar...
Gorou: #Uh, anyway... Traveler, care to make some introductions?
Traveler: This is the guardian mage of tomes and spells!
Gorou: G—Guardian mage? Wow, what an impressive title... Is it a position similar to that of a Guuji?
Gorou: Or, wait... Could it be that I'm in the presence of someone as high-ranking as Her Excellency, like Lady Sangonomiya herself!?
Paimon: #Honestly, Traveler... You're gonna give the guy a heart attack.
Paimon: Don't be nervous, Gorou. That's just, uh... a nickname! Her real name is Lisa. She's works as a librarian here in Mondstadt. And, she's also the person in charge of our shop!
Paimon: Lisa, this is Gorou. He's a suuuper powerful general from Watatsumi Island. And this is Kirara. She's a suuuper punctual delivery woman with the Komaniya Express.
Lisa: Kirara... Hmm, the name sounds familiar. Ah, the collection of books from Inazuma that I have in the library... You were the one who delivered them, yes? What a helpful little gem, you are!
Kirara: Hehe, I'm glad our paths have crossed again, Miss Lisa. I hope you'll consider me for future delivery jobs as well!
Lisa: As for my cuties' other acquaintance... I believe I've read a few articles about you, General Gorou. I seem to recall more than a few references to your empathetic nature and skillful approach to leading your troops.
Lisa: Let me guess... Your troops are also the focus of your potion inquiry here today?
Gorou: Exactly!
Gorou: Commercial activity between Watatsumi Island and other regions has been on the rise recently. The workload has increased so much, both the soldiers who work on our shipping convoys and the sailors who work on the merchant vessels are struggling to keep up.
Gorou: What would really come in handy would be a potion that could help them handle their intense workload. Like one that could enhance their energy and physical strength.
Kirara: Okay, I could definitely use a potion like that as well!
Kirara: When I'm out on a long delivery, you wouldn't believe how tired my legs would get from trekking across all that rugged terrain — not to mention the damage it does to my paws.
Lisa: My cuties should be more than familiar with that kind of potion by now. I'm sure they'll have it done in no time.
Traveler: Should be doable.
Paimon: Yep, leave it to us!
Lisa: Well, while you two hop to it, I'm going to find an idle knight to deliver a letter to my little wolf cub, and ask him to treat us to the pleasure of his company.
Lisa: Once my cuties are done brewing a potion that satisfies your needs, we'll all celebrate over afternoon tea!
Kirara: Hehe, afternoon tea on the banks of Cider Lake... Wonder what that'll be like? I can't wait to find out!
Gorou: Phew, I'm just glad I've finally found a way to help my troops...
Traveler: We've got this!
Traveler: She also makes a mean cup of tea!
Traveler: We'll make sure you leave with something fun and useful!
Traveler: What a pleasant surprise!

## Talk

Gorou: #Traveler, Paimon! We're back!
Gorou: I just finished buying some souvenirs around the city. I believe you took a trip to The Cat's Tail, right Kirara? I saw you leaving, at least.
Kirara: Yep. I stopped by to visit my sweet little Diona, but she was nowhere to be found. Such a shame... Well, at least I still got a refreshing drink out of it. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
Gorou: Still remember our request, you two?
Paimon: Of course! You're after a potion that could increase a person's energy and enhances their physical strength — a very practical request if Paimon does say so herself.
Paimon: Our potion-making skills are getting better by the second. We'll have it brewed and ready in no time!

## Talk

Gorou: ...I thought I've told you before, that if you want to pass through the forest undetected, you're gonna want to wet your tails. Wet fur doesn't get snagged on branches and twigs as easily as dry fur. You'll be able to slip on by, and your enemies will be none the wiser...
Kirara: Nuh-uh, that's not gonna happen. I can't stand my tails wet. I'd be better off... tying them in a knot or something — or better yet, improving my fighting skills so that I don't have to sneak by them in the first place...
Kirara: Oh, you're here! How's the potion coming?
Traveler: Hand over the potion...
Traveler: It's still in development.
Gorou: Well, I'm rooting for you! I've seen how capable you are. No way a few alchemical roadblocks can stand in your way!

## Talk

Paimon: Gorou, Kirara, your potion is now ready! Why don't you give it a try?
Gorou: Wonderful! You two sure work fast!
Gorou: Hmm...
Gorou: Wow! My right shoulder was acting up from using my bow so much... But a few drops of your potion, and the pain is completely gone...
Kirara: Th—The pain from walking on all that rough terrain... it's like it was never there! I thought you dealt in potions, not magic elixirs!
Kirara: With this in my arsenal, I bet I could deliver two hundred orders in a single day!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like we've got another hit on our hands! Guess we can add the people of Watatsumi Island and the workers at the Komaniya Express to our list of happy customers!
Traveler: Another perfect result!
Paimon: Well, now that our work is out of the way, there's nothing standing between us and that afternoon tea we were promised...
Paimon: Oh, perfect! Lisa's here.
Lisa: I'm sorry to report my little wolf cub appears to be busy. I sent someone to fetch him in Wolvendom, but he wasn't there... It's such a shame he's going to miss the opportunity to meet some fellow furry-eared companions.
Lisa: But, I'm sure you'll have the chance to meet in the future. In fact, the next time I see him, I'll be sure to tell him about the two of you. It'll give him something to look forward to.
Black Screen Text: Lisa sets out a tableful of exquisite snacks and delectable tea. With good company by your side, the gathering turns out to be a very pleasant affair...
Black Screen Text: While Kirara appears to enjoy her meal immensely, Gorou seems a bit nervous. His mannerisms bear a striking resemblance to how he acts around a certain Lady Guuji...
Lisa: Wow, you've placed quite the sizeable order. Thank you for your patronage, my Inazuman friends.
Lisa: If feedback on the potion is favorable, I hope you'll consider reupping your supply when the time comes. If making the journey proves too troublesome, we can always ship them to you.
Kirara: Of course! I have a feeling this super powerful alchemical craft of yours could be a game changer for the entire delivery industry!
Gorou: #Absolutely. I'll be sure to collect detailed feedback from my troops... Anyway, we should head out. Until next time, Traveler and Paimon. Oh, and it was a pleasure meeting you, Miss Guardian Mage.
Paimon: Bye Gorou! Bye Kirara!
Gorou: The next time I'm in Mondstadt, I should make it an official visit. A formal meeting between Her Excellency and the Honorable Guardian Mage is sure to be a momentous occasion!
Paimon: Uh, seems like that made-up title really had an impression on him. It's given him all sorts of funny ideas...
Traveler: Well done me.

## Talk

Gorou: #Wow, potion-making is really complicated. I guess it's quite a time-consuming process, even for two people as capable as Traveler and Paimon.
Kirara: Yeah, watching them run around in circles like this is making me dizzy...
Paimon: Looks like we've still got some details to work out. Sorry to keep you waiting...
Gorou: No worries! Take as long as you need! In any case, I was hoping I'd get the chance to walk around a bit more and familiarize myself with the terrain. It'll give me a chance to buy some souvenirs and books as well.
Kirara: I guess I'll take some time for myself too... Hmm, where should I go... Ooh, I know! The Cat's Tail!
Gorou: #See you in a bit, Traveler and Paimon. Be sure to pace yourselves, alright? Don't go working too hard on our account!
