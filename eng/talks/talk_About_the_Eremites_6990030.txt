Traveler: About the Eremites...
Paimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...
Traveler: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.
Paimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.
Paimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...
Traveler: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.
