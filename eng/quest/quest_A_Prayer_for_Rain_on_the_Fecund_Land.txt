# A Prayer for Rain on the Fecund Land


## Talk 1

Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, and Paimon, thank you for helping Aranara. Arapandu senses that the branches blocking the stream in various places have been removed.
Paimon: Oh! So we can go and heal the Varuna Contraption now, right?
Arapandu: Soon, but not yet. The root system is deep underground, and the entrance is in the center of the Varunastra.
Paimon: The Varunastra... You've mentioned that before, haven't you, Arapandu?
Arapandu: #It's a manifestation of the power of the Varuna Contraption. When it displays its power, it will be taller than the tallest tree in Vana. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon saw it before.
Paimon: Do you mean that place from which water jets out occasionally? Are we seriously going through the center of that thing!?
Traveler: That doesn't look like an entrance.
Paimon: That's right!
Paimon: What if it activates just as we go in...?
Paimon: The water jet is so high, and it looks really powerful too... Paimon can't figure out how we're going to get into its center...
Traveler: Guess we can only get in from above.
Paimon: Well, Paimon can fly, but you sure can't!
Arabalika: Why? We can just make it stop.
Paimon: It can stop!?
Arapandu: #It couldn't before, but thanks to Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon's help, the power of the Varuna Contraption has been partially restored. Now, Aranara can make it stop.
Paimon: Wow, we did such an amazing thing by coincidence!
Traveler: Well, it's not so much of a coincidence...
Paimon: Ah, true. It was really difficult to find the Grove of Dreams...
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, let's go together. The green branches have bloomed. It's almost time to bear fruit.
Traveler: Paimon is amazing!
Paimon: You're amazing too. Hehe, we're both amazing!
Traveler: So we're taking this thing head-on, then.
Paimon: Paimon's heard that some people train by sitting under a waterfall and absorbing its impact... But we'll surely be swept away if we just rush in!
Traveler: Maybe we can dig a tunnel to it from the side...
Paimon: What kind of solution is that? ... Wait. It might be worth a try...
Traveler: We can't get in! There's no way to get in!
Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 2

Paimon: The entrance to the underground... It's opened up!
Traveler: I feel like something's missing...
Paimon: Hmm, that's true! Look at this giant, empty hole... Well, at least it's not a hole in our hearts.
Arapandu: #Let's go down together, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Arapandu: But we must be careful on the road ahead. It is dark and sunless underground. The place where seeds used to sleep peacefully has likely become the lair of the Fungi.
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon are Aranara's friends. Aranara do not have great power, but if you are in danger, Aranara will try to protect you.
Arabalika: Nothing to fear. Arabalika is around.
Paimon: We've been through gales and high water! This won't scare us.
Arakunti: There shouldn't be any great winds down there. Water, maybe, but no big waves.
Paimon: Hm... So you're still taking our words at face value, huh, Arakunti...
Traveler: "Gales and high water" means that a person has been through a lot.
Arakunti: Arakunti understands now. Paimon's words are difficult to understand.
Paimon: Paimon would say the same to you!
Paimon: Anyway, Fungi aren't scary at all! If this really is their lair... we'll have all-you-can-eat mushrooms for dinner tonight!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's hurry down once you're ready!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Th—This is much deeper than the Ruins of Dahri... Paimon didn't expect this place to be so deep underground.
Paimon: And there are so many spores! Just seeing them is unbearable enough...
Arapandu: The spores are covering the Varuna Contraption...
Aranakula: It must've been left by the bad guys... Ugh... The bad guys could be close by...
Arabalika: Toughen up, Aranakula. Do not back down. We are already here. We solve the problem, whether it be spores or Fungi. This is all for Vana.
Arakunti: The Varuna Contraption must be very sad to be covered by spores like this.
Paimon: Yes... Being covered by spores... Just the thought of it is kinda scary...
Traveler: Let's hurry and clear the spores away.
Paimon: Yup! We'll handle this just like when we cleaned the Yasna Monument up, eh?

## Talk 4

Arapandu: #Aranara are not too late, but... bad seeds grow faster than good seeds. Oh, Nara {NICKNAME}, please clear the bad seeds away...

## Talk 5

Arapandu: Arapandu will look for answers about Vimara Village too. Please be patient.

## Talk 6

Aranakula: #Is Nara {NICKNAME} going to take care of the nursery with Aranakula? There is nothing there yet...
Aranakula: But if you plant seeds, they will soon grow into beautiful flowers...

## Talk 7

Arabalika: Hmph.
Arabalika: ...
Arabalika: #Nara {NICKNAME}. Do not be as careless as Paimon.

## Talk 8

Arakunti: Golden Nara! Heeey ♪
Arakunti: Mushrooms yummy! Hey hey ♪
Traveler: (Arakunti seems to be fully immersed in the music.)

## Talk 9

Paimon: Paimon thinks we're safe... for now?
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, thank you for your bravery. The bad bugs gnawing on the roots of the Varuna Contraption have been cleared away.
Arapandu: The branches scattered all over Vana are also sending us their power. Now Aranara can heal the Varuna Contraption.
Traveler: It was no trouble.
Paimon: Paimon told you, the Fungi are nothing! Paimon wouldn't be scared even if there were ten more of them! Heh!
Traveler: Just treat it as a warm-up.
Paimon: #Paimon knew you wouldn't be scared of the Fungi, {NICKNAME}. Hehe...
Aranakula: Everyone was doing their best to fight the bad guys earlier. And then there was Paimon...
Arakunti: Not a drop of effort!
Paimon: #That's not true! P—Paimon gave it her all to cheer for {NICKNAME}! C'mon, {NICKNAME}, you felt Paimon's sincerity, didn't you!?
Traveler: Yes, I did.
Paimon: Hehe, see? We're one heart and one mind!
Arapandu: #Anyway, Arapandu thanks Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon for helping Aranara so much. Now it's Aranara's turn.
Paimon: Hooray! We'll be able to say goodbye to those nose-tickling spores soon!
Traveler: Not at all.
Paimon: That can't be! You should've put more effort into feeling Paimon's sincerity... It was definitely there, you know!
Traveler: If there really were ten more of them, I'd just leave it to Paimon.
Paimon: Huh? Come on. No way!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Wow! The air is much cleaner now!
Traveler: I can breathe freely now.
Paimon: Hehe, peace returns to the Ashavan Realm! Paimon doesn't know about those Fungi in the forest though...
Arapandu: After that, the bad guys may leave, or they may not. But the Varuna Contraption has already been healed, and there won't be so many spores anymore. Aranara will not let the bad guys destroy Vana.
Aranakula: The nurseries will be revived too, right...?
Arabalika: But Marana is still here. Aranara have a lot to do.
Paimon: Eh, you're so strict, Arabalika. We've finished one thing, haven't we? Just let Aranakula be happy for a bit!
Arabalika: Hmph.
Traveler: Same old Arabalika.
Paimon: *sigh*... Paimon doesn't know what will satisfy him.
Arabalika: No sense of urgency. Paimon is careless. Will get into trouble.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon's heard that one before. Paimon's not careless! Paimon's always careful!
Traveler: Looks like somebody hasn't learned their lesson.
Paimon: #Oh right, {NICKNAME}. Wasn't there something else we wanted to ask Arapandu?
Traveler: About the children of Vimara Village...
Paimon: It's about the odd things that have happened in Vimara Village to the east. The children living there sometimes disappear for a period of time, but will always return safely...
Paimon: Paimon's sure that you Aranara know more about the forest than we do. It would be great if you do know something.
Arapandu: Strange things about Vimara Village... Arapandu doesn't know now, but Arapandu will make a note of it. Other Aranara might know.
Arapandu: Arapandu will return to Vanarana later. Perhaps the answer will emerge then.
Arapandu: #About the Varuna Contraption... Nara {NICKNAME}, now you know that Aranara music can control the contraption.
Paimon: #Hmm. {NICKNAME}, you've studied Aranara music before as well, right? Does that mean that we can control the Varuna Contraption too?
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, like Nara Varuna, has been proven to be worthy of Aranara's friendship.
Arapandu: Arapandu is willing to teach you the music to control the Varuna Contraption.
Paimon: Great! But will we really have to go so deep underground every time we play...
Arakunti: Paimon is not very smart. The Varuna Contraption gets power from all over Vana...
Traveler: So you can also control the Varuna Contraption from other parts of Vana.
Paimon: Come on, that's Aranara trivia! You can't expect us to recall all that!
Black Screen Text: You master the Rhythm of the Source Water.
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, thank you for your help. Vana will never forget this, and neither will Aranara...
Traveler: I hope to see you at Festival Utsava.
Arapandu: We will meet again in Vanarana. May you have a carefree time, Golden Nara, and may Aramuhukunda watch over you.

## Talk 14

Paimon: It's even more impressive when you see it up close...
Arapandu: The Varuna Contraption is a creation of the Lord of Dendro. It sends forth water that brings life, turning Valuka into Vana, replacing that which was once yellow with green, and turning barren land into a land full of life.
Paimon: It sounds miraculous. "Water that brings life"... Wow...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon ate the soup Arapas made earlier. That was made with the water from here, right?
Paimon: His soup doesn't have a special effect, right...
Traveler: Maybe it reverses aging.
Traveler: It might let you live forever.
Paimon: Huh? Would that happen to you, or Paimon?
Traveler: It'd be you, baby Paimon.
Traveler: Couldn't be me, right?
Paimon: If Paimon gets any younger than she is now...
Traveler: You'd become like a Cicin.
Paimon: Oh come on, Paimon won't become that small!
Paimon: If that's the case...
Paimon: #Hah, "Good baby {NICKNAME}, Paimon's here to take care of you! C'mere, let Paimon give you some hugsy-wugsies!"
Paimon: Wow, it might be possible to live long enough to eat every dish in Teyvat that way!
Traveler: But where will those who share the taste be then...?
Paimon: Hmm... Guess living too long is not entirely a good thing, huh...
Aranakula: So Paimon wants water...
Aranakula: If Paimon becomes a seed, Aranakula will take good care of her, water her properly, and put her in a sunny place and loosen the soil for her.
Arakunti: Arakunti will play music to Paimon and tell her things about Vana that she doesn't know.
Arakunti: Arabalika won't come to see Paimon so often. But will bring mushrooms. Cook for her.
Arabalika: Arabalika will not do such things.
Paimon: Ooh, that sure sounds like such a cozy life! ...Wait! Paimon won't turn into a seed! What is this, some kind of scary forest that you can't leave once you enter!?
Paimon: ...It's even scarier when you think that these words are coming from these sweet-looking Aranara!
Traveler: You'll grow strong and bear fruit quickly, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! Don't you start saying that scary stuff too!
Arapandu: Nara and Paimon won't stay in Vana like Aranara do. Aranakula knows this.
Aranakula: #Aranakula knows... Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon have other missions and will leave Vana, like other Nara...
Arapandu: We have to complete the Aranara mission now and stop the Varuna Contraption in order to go down and remove those bad bugs and heal the machine.

Paimon: It sounds miraculous. "Water that brings life"... Wow...
Paimon: Can this water be consumed? Will it have any special effects?
Traveler: Maybe it reverses aging.
Paimon: Huh? Would that happen to you, or Paimon?
Traveler: It'd be you, baby Paimon.
Paimon: If Paimon gets any younger than she is now...
