Traveler: Adorable...?
Oroluk: Yes. Just see how they swim, ever so carefree, waggling their tails, in river, lake, or sea...
Oroluk: Well, I personally find them cute, and if you don't feel the same — well, that's okay too!
Oroluk: I signed up for the Fishing Association to see, catch, and raise more cutie-pies fishies.
Oroluk: However, some people are only into fishing for the delicious meat — or to sell them for Mora.
Oroluk: I mean, I get it, but I don't get involved. Most of my Association chums respect me, too.
Oroluk: Naturally, I also hope the even more people can get to know just how adorable fish are~
