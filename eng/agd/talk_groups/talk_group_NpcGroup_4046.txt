Feresht: Some day, I'm going to inherit the family business and run it even better than Father!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Feresht: You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
Feresht: When it comes to appraising treasure and collecting antiques, my sole objective is to surpass Father. Then there will be no one better than me.
Feresht: As for the business side of things, I have two more formidable opponents to defeat...

## Talk

Traveler: Good luck.
Feresht: Thanks!

## Talk

Traveler: Who are these formidable opponents?
Feresht: One is that sly Sulaykha. With that silver tongue of hers, she's able to sell something as cheap as a rug at a high price. I'm not gonna lose to her!
Feresht: The other is that Lord Sangemah Bay often mentioned by Father.
Feresht: I don't know who that is yet, but Father makes it sound like they're someone even more impressive!
Feresht: It doesn't matter. A powerful adversary is all the more worth the challenge. Just wait and see!

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Feresht: Aww, you won... But that's okay! Just wait until I come up with an even harder challenge!

## Talk

Feresht: So, this looks like a game for the master of treasure appraisal. It's not so simple!
