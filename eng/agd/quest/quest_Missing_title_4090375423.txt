# Missing title (4090375423)


## Talk 1

Qhispe: Oh Archons, I'm out of my depth... We're understaffed and undersupplied, and I can't even treat half of the wounds I'm seeing...
Qhispe: I just wish I had someone with more expertise to turn to... Ugh, no, I mustn't think like that. I have to rise to the challenge!

## Talk 2

Awhina: I saw you brought Chuychu back... It's such a tragedy. Chuychu was the most promising doctor I ever had the pleasure to meet.
Awhina: We were close business partners. She had the highest standards for medical supplies, and she'd often dip into her own pockets to treat her patients.
Awhina: She always told me how she valued the experience more than the money.
Awhina: She said she had to perfect her skills so that she could save more people, especially the one person she wanted to save the most...
Awhina: Sadly, in the end, the one person she couldn't save was herself. And now Natlan has lost one of the finest talents of a generation...

## Talk 3

Mayahuel: What's the status? Do we have enough medical supplies left?
Qhispe: We're almost out. There are still the emergency supplies, but they're reserved for the doctors and soldiers. We can't touch those.
Mayahuel: I know, I know...
Mayahuel: Alright, well... give me my share, at least.

## Talk 4

Mayahuel: What's the status? Do we have enough medical supplies left?
Qhispe: We're almost out. There are still the emergency supplies, but they're reserved for the doctors and soldiers. We can't touch those.
Mayahuel: I know, I know...
Mayahuel: Alright, well... give me my share, at least.
Mayahuel: Ah, it's you. Glad to see you're both alright.
Traveler: How's your son doing?
Mayahuel: No idea. Communications have dried up, and there are too many wounded people to attend to. Right now, my focus is on them.
Mayahuel: But I trust him. I know he'll make the right call even when the going gets tough. He's my son, and I'll always be proud of him.

## Talk 5

Qhispe: I'm so grateful Mayahuel is here. With her expertise, we were able to treat a lot more people.
Qhispe: But I'm worried she's overdoing it. She hasn't stopped this whole time. I need to get someone else to step in so I can persuade her to take a break.

## Talk 6

Mayahuel: I trust him. I know he'll make the right call even when the going gets tough. He's my son, and I'll always be proud of him.

## Talk 7

Uturunku: It's you two! Fantastic! I'm so grateful for all your encouragement.
Uturunku: So many people in Natlan see it as an honor to fight the Abyss, but then they let the excitement get to their heads and end up putting themselves in great danger.
Uturunku: You were right: It's important to fight, but it's also important to stay alive. We fight for the people we love, and also for the chance to see them again.
Uturunku: I shared your thoughts with my brothers-in-arms, and they were inspired too. Now everyone's fighting with more determination, and we're turning the tide!
Uturunku: So once again... thank you from the bottom of my heart!

## Talk 8

Uturunku: ...Oh, it's you two. I thought we'd never see each other again.
Uturunku: I put up a good fight, and we won, even though it cost us dearly...
Uturunku: Are you gonna keep fighting? If so, please be careful.
Uturunku: Fighting the Abyss is a great honor, but the path to victory lies not in honor and glory, but in surviving until the next morning.

## Talk 9

Raman: Ah, you're back. Thank you for saving me.
Paimon: We're just glad you're okay. Hey, where did those saurians go?
Raman: Oh, they're back at it again, helping the remaining messengers with scouting and intel delivery.
Raman: It kills me, not being able to do my part. Especially knowing how bad things have gotten out there. But, you gotta know your limits, I suppose.

## Talk 10

Iyoba: Oh, hey you guys. Thanks again for rescuing us. Osawe, look who it is! Say "thank-you" to these heroes!
Osawe: Thank you!
Paimon: Oh, don't mention it. Just glad you're okay.
Osawe: I also gotta say thank-you to the other people who helped us. What were they called? Fat... chewy...?
Paimon: Fatui!
Osawe: Yeah, that's it, the Fatui! They were also amazing...
Iyoba: Yeah. In the past, my impression of the Fatui wasn't exactly positive, but this has really changed my perspective. Good people can be found in every organization.

## Talk 11

Haronga: The saurians I came back with were intent on following the other warriors into battle. There was just nothing I could do to stop them.
Haronga: That officially makes me the most useless member of the unit... *sigh* But at least I know enough about saurian medicine to help treat their injuries.

## Talk 12

Young Yumkasaur: Roar â™ª
Paimon: Aw, it's the yumkasaur we rescued! You made it back! Aww, that's such good news...
Young Yumkasaur: Roar, roar!

## Talk 13

Libiac: I'm delighted to see you make it back safe and sound.
Paimon: Just keeping our word! We said we'd see you at the stadium.
Kunak: Heh... Y'know, this was the first time in my life slaying an Abyss monster, and I realized in that moment... they're not that tough.
Kunak: I let my fear win for too long... Makes me wonder how many people I could've saved if I'd just had the courage.
Libiac: Don't be so hard on yourself. Right now, staying alive is the most important thing you can do. We must live on so their stories can be told.
Libiac: They will live forever in our hearts.

### Additional Talk 1

Achiyaku: You're okay! Thank goodness, we were worried sick about you guys!
Paimon: So you made it to safety, huh? Was it a smooth journey?
Achiyaku: Uh... not exactly. We ran into a bunch of Abyss monsters and had to fight for our lives. But I gotta hand it to these folks, they really rose to the occasion. They fought every bit as well as trained warriors.
Libiac: Hehe, guess the old muscle memory's still intact!
Kunak: I feel very lucky to be alive. We have to keep surviving, so we can start to take back what we've lost.
Kunak: You guys better make sure you keep surviving too.

### Additional Talk 2

Mayahuel: Ah, it's you. Glad to see you're both alright.
