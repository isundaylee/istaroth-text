Hanbei: The mushrooms here don't look too bad. I'll put them on my shopping list...

Traveler: And you are...
Hanbei: I'm a public servant for the Inazuma Shogunate. I was sent to Sumeru for my meritorious service.
Hanbei: ...They said I was sent here for my contributions in upholding administrative regulations, but my current assignment doesn't seem to be going too well.
Hanbei: I'm here as a "foreign attach√©" to manage the mushroom trade. Sumeru has so many different mushrooms that it's enough to make your head spin. I don't have any fieldwork experience either...
Hanbei: What's more, the Shogunate's been delaying the release of the document I need. When can I officially begin importing mushrooms...?
