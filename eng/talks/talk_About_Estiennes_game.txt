Traveler: About Estienne's game...
Darcy: Congratulations on winning!
Darcy: Now that I think of it, I never even saw Caterpillar that much... I didn't know he had that many Coupons! I'm jealous! If only I had that many...
Darcy: I'd treat everyone in the entire Fortress to new flavors of Fonta... No! I'd pay everyone's wages for a day and give them all a holiday!
Darcy: Or maybe I'd sponsor an Invokation tournament? Oh, how can I choose between such good ideas... Oh! Why would I even have to choose? I can do them all!
