Tartaglia: Whew, it's finally done. I have to catch up with the others...
Traveler: Tartaglia?
Tartaglia: #Ah, {NICKNAME}? Haha, you're just in time. I'm chasing after the powerful "Great Mujina Youkai" with some new comrades I met.
Traveler: Wait, the Great Mujina Youkai?
Tartaglia: Why, from those comrades of mine, of course. Apparently, this extremely powerful youkai has been wreaking havoc across rural Inazuma. Whenever it comes across a child who has snuck outside to play, it starts teasing them.
Tartaglia: You know, things like tying their shoelaces together, or turning mud and roots into fruits on a tree then tricking the children into eating them...
Tartaglia: Sometimes, it even dispatches a few mini mujina and has them turn into parents or teachers to frighten the children.
Tartaglia: Anyway, there's no way I'm gonna let such a formidable youkai run loose.
Tartaglia: If you have time, why not join us on our pursuit of the Great Mujina Youkai?
Traveler: So these "comrades" of yours...
Tartaglia: Oh? So you know Yoimiya too? What a coincidence...
Tartaglia: Anyway, now's not the time for chitchat. Yoimiya and the others are looking for the Great Mujina Youkai's tracks up ahead.
Tartaglia: It's my responsibility to bring up the rear, and ensure the Great Mujina doesn't attack us from behind in a fit of rage.
Traveler: Could one of them be Yoimiya?
Traveler: Where did you hear that name?
Traveler: What are you doing here?
