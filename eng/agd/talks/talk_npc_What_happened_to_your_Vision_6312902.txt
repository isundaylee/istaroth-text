Traveler: What happened to your Vision?
Tejima: I turned it in a long time ago... The people from the Tenryou Commission marched up to the village to inspect and confiscate when the Vision Hunt Decree was first announced. I heard that the people who refused to cooperate had a really bad time.
Tejima: *sigh* I thought that I should just stay out of trouble. It wouldn't have been good to trouble the villagers...
Tejima: It's just that... though I only turned the Vision in, I feel like something has gone missing from inside me, too...
