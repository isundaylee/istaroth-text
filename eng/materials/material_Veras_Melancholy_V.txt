# Vera's Melancholy (V)

You can't have picnics on the sides of a galactic highway! Even the deities will be held fully responsible for road accidents that might occur!
The doorway to a study in a simple village connects to anywhere in space and time! Having tea with the deities, playing hide-and-seek across time... Vera's great adventure continues!
