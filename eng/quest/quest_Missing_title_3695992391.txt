# Missing title (3695992391)

Khedive: Why, hello! It's you!
Khedive: Hah, they actually managed to get you to come here.
Traveler: Yes, it's me.
Khedive: Ah, my apologies, please! My name is Khedive. Khedive Pursina.
Khedive: If you know anything of the history of the Akademiya, you would know that our founder was once the rival of the Purbirunis in the field of astronomy...
Traveler: #Well, I'm {NICKNAME}.
Khedive: Ah, there's no need for you to introduce yourself so specifically. Your name and its fame have long reached my ears.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Khedive: I'm a researcher who was specifically called in by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. My task is to study the changes that have occurred in life forms within The Chasm before it reopens, and to examine any items of paleontological interest...
Khedive: Of course, it has been agreed that I shall share the results of my research with the historical society here in Liyue.
Khedive: *sigh* I know what you're thinking, and to be honest this does, in principle, violate the rules of the Akademiya. But the Liyue authorities were quite firm about this. I doubt anyone could have moved them an inch.
Khedive: Additionally, the exploration team has been signed under my name, and I am to pay for the salaries of all the camp's miners out of pocket... So if we don't get results, it'll be quite the loss for me.
Traveler: That's true...
Khedive: It's fine, though. I've got the Mora.
Traveler: Alright, then. See you.
Khedive: See you!
Traveler: That sounds really rough.
Traveler: Is announcing your academic school of thought tradition in Sumeru?
Khedive: Ah, no, no... It is just... Let's just call it a scholar's pride, shall we?
Khedive: Actually, you know what? I blame Anisa for infecting me with the Purbirunis' bad habit in that regard.
Traveler: Do I know you?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Jinwu: Huh, it's a new face. Ho there, youngster!
Traveler: "New face?"
Jinwu: Well, I don't quite know everyone here at the mine, but it's only polite to at least call everyone *something*, right? Still... you look like this is your first time here. Am I right?
Traveler: #Indeed you are. {NICKNAME}'s the name, and the pleasure is all mine.
Jinwu: Jinwu. I'm in charge of the facilities here. I've worked at the mines for the past 20-odd years. To most of these lads, I'm their big sister. You have any questions, or the facilities give you any trouble? Give me a shout.
Jinwu: And if you're up for a few old stories, I'm up for telling them. I mean, if we're free, we're free to talk, eh?
Traveler: Could you tell me about The Chasm's history?
Jinwu: Wow, that's going to be quite the story. How about I give you a short introduction instead?
Jinwu: So The Chasm's the biggest mine in Liyue bar none, and it's also the oldest in the land — if you don't count the mine at Mt. Tianheng, that is.
Jinwu: They say that indigenous tribes already existed here, gathering the Glazed Sand Crystal and trading completed porcelain products, long before Rex Lapis ever arrived.
Jinwu: Later, these tribes would make blood-pacts with the Lord of Geo's Yaksha and join him, thus becoming the forebears of Shenglu Hall, one of Liyue's Eight Trades.
Jinwu: They also took part in the great battles to subdue Azhdaha and repel the black calamity... They've contributed a lot to Liyue.
Jinwu: See that valley over there to the northwest? They say that it is the trail left over after the Lord of Geo bodily dragged Azhdaha out of The Chasm.
Jinwu: Eventually, they would forsake their tribal lands and ways, and growing used to city life, would join the Lord of Geo in his dwelling, creating and selling porcelain for a living, forsaking their old militant roots.
Jinwu: So yeah, those nitpickers at Shenglu Hall had ancestors who fought alongside Rex Lapis himself! Imagine that!
Traveler: Could you tell me more about The Chasm itself?
Jinwu: I was there, you know, when they sealed this place up several years back. The lads down below dug up something truly...
Jinwu: Well, I remember the long line of wounded that were carried back up to the surface, I'll tell you what...
Jinwu: Even spookier yet, the lads who were injured weren't necessarily hurt in the way you'd usually think miners would be. It was more like... spiritual or mental damage, you know?
Jinwu: They'd recover a few days after being brought up to the surface, so there wasn't much serious damage done in the end, but that was enough to get the Qixing to step in.
Jinwu: Doesn't matter what exactly they dug up, but I'll bet you that it was nothing good. The folks at Yujing Terrace reckoned so, too... and so they sealed The Chasm off completely.
Jinwu: Now that sure got Shenglu Hall riled up... though that's a story for another day.
Traveler: Tell me about your work...
Jinwu: Me? I manage equipment. Nothing too exciting, mind! I spent the last 20-plus years tinkering with miners' ore-lamps and water filters while other kids went to school, s'all.
Jinwu: #{F#Take note, girl, don't get into this line of work. It's sweat and hard labor all day, every day. Not worth it.}{M#Met batch after batch of miners while I was at it. Some of them weren't hardly any older than you when they first went in.}
Traveler: Could you tell me about the Seven-Star Array?
Jinwu: That's a little something that the Qixing set up. Tell you what, it certainly bars the righteous, but not the wick... Hahah! Right, just kidding.
Jinwu: Anyway, this array is the highest class of seal in the land as far as governance is concerned. If anyone sees it, they'll know what the consequences of breaking the seal will be, alright.
Jinwu: And that's why the Qixing used these ostentatious Bedrock Keys to anchor the array. Gotta send a message, make a show of force, y'know?
Jinwu: Gotta put the fear of Rex Lapis — or at least the fear of the Qixing's retribution — into the hearts of any thieves who might want to break the seal and steal some stuff.
Jinwu: *cough* In other words, if someone really does break the seals and does not suffer the consequences... It means that they at least have the tacit approval of the Qixing.
